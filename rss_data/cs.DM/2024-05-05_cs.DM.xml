      <title>Unavoidable induced subgraphs in graphs with complete bipartite induced minors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that if a graph contains the complete bipartite graph $K_{134, 12}$ as an induced minor, then it contains a cycle of length at most~12 or a theta as an induced subgraph. With a longer and more technical proof, we prove that if a graph contains $K_{3, 4}$ as an induced minor, then it contains a triangle or a theta as an induced subgraph. Here, a \emph{theta} is a graph made of three internally vertex-disjoint chordless paths $P_1 = a \dots b$, $P_2 = a \dots b$, $P_3 = a \dots b$, each of length at least two, such that no edges exist between the paths except the three edges incident to $a$ and the three edges incident to $b$.
  A consequence is that excluding a grid and a complete bipartite graph as induced minors is not enough to guarantee a bounded tree-independence number, or even that the treewidth is bounded by a function of the size of the maximum clique, because the existence of graphs with large treewidth that contain no triangles or thetas as induced subgraphs is already known (the so-called layered wheels).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.03865v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the study of particular geometrically defined intersection classes of graphs. Those were previously studied by Magnant and Martin, who proved that these graphs have arbitrary large chromatic number, while being triangle-free. We give several structural properties of these graphs, and we raise several questions.</description>

      <title>Temporal Reachability Dominating Sets: contagion in temporal graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.06999v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a population with dynamic pairwise connections, we ask if the entire population could be (indirectly) infected by a small group of $k$ initially infected individuals. We formalise this problem as the Temporal Reachability Dominating Set (TaRDiS}) problem on temporal graphs. We provide positive and negative parameterized complexity results in four different parameters: the number $k$ of initially infected, the lifetime $\tau$ of the graph, the number of locally earliest edges in the graph, and the treewidth of the footprint graph $\mathcal{G}_\downarrow$.
  We additionally introduce and study the MaxMinTaRDiS problem, where the aim is to schedule connections between individuals so that at least $k$ individuals must be infected for the entire population to become fully infected. We classify three variants of the problem: Strict, Nonstrict, and Happy. We show these to be coNP-complete, NP-hard, and $\Sigma_2^P$-complete, respectively. Interestingly, we obtain hardness of the Nonstrict variant by showing that a natural restriction is exactly the well-studied Distance-3 Independent Set problem on static graphs.</description>

      <title>Rank-one Boolean tensor factorization and the multilinear polytope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.07053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.07053v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the NP-hard problem of finding the closest rank-one binary tensor to a given binary tensor, which we refer to as the rank-one Boolean tensor factorization (BTF) problem. This optimization problem can be used to recover a planted rank-one tensor from noisy observations. We formulate rank-one BTF as the problem of minimizing a linear function over a highly structured multilinear set. Leveraging on our prior results regarding the facial structure of multilinear polytopes, we propose novel linear programming relaxations for rank-one BTF. We then establish deterministic sufficient conditions under which our proposed linear programs recover a planted rank-one tensor. To analyze the effectiveness of these deterministic conditions, we consider a semi-random model for the noisy tensor, and obtain high probability recovery guarantees for the linear programs. Our theoretical results as well as numerical simulations indicate that certain facets of the multilinear polytope significantly improve the recovery properties of linear programming relaxations for rank-one BTF.</description>

      <title>A quadratic estimation for the K\"uhnel conjecture on embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.04188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.04188v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The classical Heawood inequality states that if the complete graph $K_n$ on $n$ vertices is embeddable in the sphere with $g$ handles, then $g \ge\dfrac{(n-3)(n-4)}{12}$. A higher-dimensional analogue of the Heawood inequality is the K\"uhnel conjecture. In a simplified form it states that for every integer $k&gt;0$ there is $c_k&gt;0$ such that if the union of $k$-faces of $n$-simplex embeds into the connected sum of $g$ copies of the Cartesian product $S^k\times S^k$ of two $k$-dimensional spheres, then $g\ge c_k n^{k+1}$. For $k&gt;1$ only linear estimates were known. We present a quadratic estimate $g\ge c_k n^2$. The proof is based on beautiful and fruitful interplay between geometric topology, combinatorics and linear algebra.</description>

      <title>Graph Parameters, Universal Obstructions, and WQO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.03688v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of a universal obstruction of a graph parameter with respect to some quasi-ordering relation on graphs. Universal obstructions may serve as a canonical obstruction characterization of the approximate behaviour of graph parameters. We provide an order-theoretic characterization of the finiteness of universal obstructions and, when this is the case, we present some algorithmic implications on the existence of fixed-parameter algorithms.</description>

      <title>Open-separating dominating codes in graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03015v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using dominating sets to separate vertices of graphs is a well-studied problem in the larger domain of identification problems. In such problems, the objective is to choose a suitable dominating set $C$ of a graph $G$ such that the neighbourhoods of all vertices of $G$ have distinct intersections with $C$. Such a dominating and separating set $C$ is often referred to as a \emph{code} in the literature. Depending on the types of dominating and separating sets used, various problems arise under various names in the literature. In this paper, we introduce a new problem in the same realm of identification problems whereby the code, called \emph{open-separating dominating code}, or \emph{OSD-code} for short, is a dominating set and uses open neighbourhoods for separating vertices. The paper studies the fundamental properties concerning the existence, hardness and minimality of OSD-codes. Due to the emergence of a close and yet difficult to establish relation of the OSD-codes with another well-studied code in the literature called open locating dominating codes, or OLD-codes for short, we compare the two on various graph families. Finally, we also provide an equivalent reformulation of the problem of finding OSD-codes of a graph as a covering problem in a suitable hypergraph and discuss the polyhedra associated with OSD-codes, again in relation to OLD-codes of some graph families already studied in this context.</description>
