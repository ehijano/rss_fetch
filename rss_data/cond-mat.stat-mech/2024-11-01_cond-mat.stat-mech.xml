      <title>Solving the Kinetic Ising Model with Non-Reciprocity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-reciprocal interactions are a generic feature of non-equilibrium systems. We define a non-reciprocal generalization of the kinetic Ising model in one spatial dimension. We solve the model exactly using two different approaches for infinite, semi-infinite and finite systems with either periodic or open boundary conditions. The exact solution allows us to explore a range of novel phenomena tied to non-reciprocity like non-reciprocity induced frustration and wave phenomena with interesting parity-dependence for finite systems of size $N$.
  We study dynamical questions like the approach to equilibrium with various boundary conditions. We find new regimes, separated by $N^{th}$-order exceptional points, which can be classified as overdamped, underdamped and critically damped phases. Despite these new regimes, long-time order is only present at zero temperature. Additionally, we explore the low-energy behavior of the system in various limits, including the ageing and spatio-temporal Porod regimes, demonstrating that non-reciprocity induces unique scaling behavior at zero temperature. Lastly, we present general results for systems where spins interact with no more than two spins, outlining the conditions under which long-time order may exist.</description>

      <title>Supercritical Crossover Lines in the Cell Fluid Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A cell fluid model with a modified Morse potential is studied. The supercritical states are considered with respect to a possibility to build a separation boundary between liquid-like and gas-like bahaviors. Three different lines are calculated that can be used for this purpose: the locus of the isothermal compressibility maxima, the locus of the thermal expansion coefficient maxima, and the line where the effective chemical potential is zero, M=0. By the symmetry of the functionals for the partition functions, the condition M=0 in fluids is analogous to the absence of an external field in the Ising model.</description>

      <title>Classical Geometric Fluctuation Relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fisher information is a fundamental concept in various physical and metrological theories. By defining an analogous stochastic quantity called Stochastic Fisher Information (SFI), we uncover two fluctuation relations with an inherent geometric nature, as the SFI acts as a single nonequilibrium trajectory metric. The geometric nature of these relations is expressed through a stochastic length derived from the system entropy associated with a nonequilibrium trajectory. We also explore the possibility of trajectory-dependent uncertainty relations linked to the time SFI. Finally, we test the newly formulated theorems using two simple stochastic models.</description>

      <title>Universal Scaling of Gap Dynamics in Percolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Percolation is a cornerstone concept in physics, providing crucial insights into critical phenomena and phase transitions. In this study, we adopt a kinetic perspective to reveal the scaling behaviors of higher-order gaps in the largest cluster across various percolation models, spanning from latticebased to network systems, encompassing both continuous and discontinuous percolation. Our results uncover an inherent self-similarity in the dynamical process both for critical and supercritical phase, characterized by two independent Fisher exponents, respectively. Utilizing a scaling ansatz, we propose a novel scaling relation that links the discovered Fisher exponents with other known critical exponents. Additionally, we demonstrate the application of our theory to real systems, showing its practical utility in extracting the corresponding Fisher exponents. These findings enrich our understanding of percolation dynamics and highlight the robust and universal scaling laws that transcend individual models and extend to broader classes of complex systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.24118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study probabilities of rare events in the general coalescence process, $kA\rightarrow \ell A$, where $k&gt;\ell$. For arbitrary $k, \ell$, by rewriting these probabilities in terms of an effective action, we derive the large deviation function describing the probability of finding $N$ particles at time $t$, when starting with $M$ particles initially. Additionally, the most probable trajectory corresponding to a fixed rare event is derived.</description>

      <title>Modeling Brownian Motion as a Timelapse of the Physical, Persistent, Trajectory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While it is very common to model diffusion as a random walk by assuming memorylessness of the trajectory and diffusive step lengths, these assumptions can lead to significant errors. This paper describes the extent to which a physical trajectory of a Brownian particle can be described by a random flight. Analysis of simple timelapses of physical trajectories (calculated over collisional timescales using a velocity autocorrelation function that captures the hydrodynamic and acoustic effects induced by the solvent) gave us two observations: (i) subsampled trajectories become genuinely memoryless only when the time step is ~200 times larger than the relaxation time, and (ii) the distribution of the step lengths has variances that remain significantly smaller than 2Dt (usually by a factor of ~2). This last fact is due to the combination of two effects: diffusional MSD is mathematically superballistic at short timescales and subsampled trajectories are moving averages of the underlying physical trajectory. In other words, the MSD of the physical trajectory at long time intervals asymptotically approaches 2Dt, but the MSD of the subsampled steps does not, even when the associated time interval is several hundred times larger than the relaxation time. I discuss how to best account for this effect in computational approaches.</description>

      <title>Entropy alternatives for equilibrium and out of equilibrium systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an entropy-related function (non-repeatability) that describes dynamical behaviors in complex systems. A normalized version of this function (mutability) has been previously used in statistical physics. To illustrate their characteristics, we apply these functions to different systems: (a) magnetic moments on a square lattice and (b) real seismic data extracted from the IPOC-2007-2014 catalog. These systems are well-established in the literature, making them suitable benchmarks for testing the new approach. Shannon entropy is used as a reference to facilitate comparison, enabling us to highlight similarities, differences, and the potential benefits of the new measure. Notably, non-repeatability and mutability are sensitive to the order in which the data sequence is collected, distinguishing them from traditional entropy measures.</description>

      <title>Spread Complexity Rate as Proper Momentum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23334v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate a precise relation between the rate of complexity of quantum states excited by local operators in two-dimensional conformal field theories and the radial momentum of particles in 3-dimensional Anti-de Sitter spacetimes. Similar relations have been anticipated based on qualitative models for operator growth. Here, we make this correspondence sharp with two key ingredients: the precise definition of quantum complexity given by the spread complexity of states, and the match of its growth rate to the bulk momentum measured in the proper radial distance coordinate.</description>

      <title>On computational complexity of unitary and state design properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23353v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study unitary and state $t$-designs from a computational complexity theory perspective. First, we address the problems of computing frame potentials that characterize (approximate) $t$-designs. We provide a quantum algorithm for computing the frame potential and show that 1. exact computation can be achieved by a single query to a $\# \textsf{P}$-oracle and is $\# \textsf{P}$-hard, 2. for state vectors, it is $\textsf{BQP}$-complete to decide whether the frame potential is larger than or smaller than certain values, if the promise gap between the two values is inverse-polynomial in the number of qubits, and 3. both for state vectors and unitaries, it is $\textsf{PP}$-complete if the promise gap is exponentially small. As the frame potential is closely related to the out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOCs), our result implies that computing the OTOCs with exponential accuracy is also hard. Second, we address promise problems to decide whether a given set is a good or bad approximation to a $t$-design and show that this problem is in $\textsf{PP}$ for any constant $t$ and is $\textsf{PP}$-hard for $t=1,2$ and $3$. Remarkably, this is the case even if a given set is promised to be either exponentially close to or worse than constant away from a $1$-design. Our results illustrate the computationally hard nature of unitary and state designs.</description>

      <title>Efficient Detection of Strong-To-Weak Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking via the R\'enyi-1 Correlator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23512v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking (SWSSB) has recently emerged as a universal feature of quantum mixed-state phases of matter. While various information-theoretic diagnostics have been proposed to define and characterize SWSSB phases, relating these diagnostics to observables which can be efficiently and scalably probed on modern quantum devices remains challenging. Here we propose a new observable for SWSSB in mixed states, called the R\'enyi-1 correlator, which naturally suggests a potential route towards scalably detecting SWSSB phases in experiment. Specifically, if the canonical purification (CP) of a given mixed state can be reliably prepared, then SWSSB in the mixed state can be detected via ordinary two-point correlation functions in the CP state. We discuss several simple examples of CP states which can be efficiently prepared on quantum devices, and whose reduced density matrices exhibit SWSSB. The R\'enyi-1 correlator also satisfies several useful theoretical properties: it naturally inherits a stability theorem recently proven for the closely-related fidelity correlator, and it directly defines SWSSB as a particular pattern of ordinary spontaneous symmetry breaking in the CP state.</description>

      <title>Quantum thermal machine regimes in the transverse-field Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23710v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We identify and interpret the possible quantum thermal machine regimes with a transverse-field Ising model as the working substance. In general, understanding the emergence of such regimes in a many-body quantum system is challenging due to the dependence on the many energy levels in the system. By considering infinitesimal work strokes, we can understand the operation from equilibrium properties of the system. We find that infinitesimal work strokes enable both heat engine and accelerator operation, with the output and boundaries of operation described by macroscopic properties of the system, in particular the net transverse magnetization. At low temperatures, the regimes of operation and performance can be understood from quasiparticles in the system, while at high temperatures an expansion of the free energy in powers of inverse temperature describes the operation. The understanding generalises to larger work strokes when the temperature difference between the hot and cold reservoirs is large. For hot and cold reservoirs close in temperature, a sufficiently large work stroke can enable refrigerator and heater regimes. Our results and method of analysis will prove useful in understanding the possible regimes of operation of quantum many-body thermal machines more generally.</description>

      <title>Physics of collective transport and traffic phenomena in biology: progress in 20 years</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23735v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Enormous progress have been made in the last 20 years since the publication of our review \cite{csk05polrev} in this journal on transport and traffic phenomena in biology. In this brief article we present a glimpse of the major advances during this period. First, we present similarities and differences between collective intracellular transport of a single micron-size cargo by multiple molecular motors and that of a cargo particle by a team of ants on the basis of the common principle of load-sharing. Second, we sketch several models all of which are biologically motivated extensions of the Asymmetric Simple Exclusion Process (ASEP); some of these models represent the traffic of molecular machines, like RNA polymerase (RNAP) and ribosome, that catalyze template-directed polymerization of RNA and proteins, respectively, whereas few other models capture the key features of the traffic of ants on trails. More specifically, using the ASEP-based models we demonstrate the effects of traffic of RNAPs and ribosomes on random and `programmed' errors in gene expression as well as on some other subcellular processes. We recall a puzzling empirical result on the single-lane traffic of predatory ants {\it Leptogenys processionalis} as well as recent attempts to account for this puzzle. We also mention some surprising effects of lane-changing rules observed in a ASEP-based model for 3-lane traffic of army ants. Finally, we explain the conceptual similarities between the pheromone-mediated indirect communication, called stigmergy, between ants on a trail and the floor-field-mediated interaction between humans in a pedestrian traffic. For the floor-field model of human pedestrian traffic we present a major theoretical result that is relevant from the perspective of all types of traffic phenomena.</description>

      <title>Quantum anomaly triggers the violation of scaling laws in gravitational system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scaling laws for critical phenomena take pivotal status in almost all branches of physics. However, as scaling laws are commonly guaranteed by the renormalization group theory, systems that violate them have rarely been found. In this letter, we demonstrate that gravitational system can break scaling laws. We derive this result through investigating phase transition and critical phenomenon in a gravitational system with quantum anomaly. For the first time, we outline the key conditions to violate the scaling laws in generic gravitational system viewed from the equation of state $P=P(T,V)$. Our results indicate that quantum effects can magnify the distinctiveness of gravity, which may be significant to understand the microscopic structure of spacetime.</description>

      <title>Designed self-assembly of programmable colloidal atom-electron equivalents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To unlock the potential for assembling complex colloidal "molecules", we investigate a minimal binary system of programmable colloidal atom-electron equivalents (PAE-EE), where electron equivalents (EEs) are multivalent linkers with two distinct types of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) ends complementary to those ssDNAs on binary programmable atom equivalents (PAEs). We derive a statistical mechanical framework for calculating the effective interaction between PAEs mediated by EEs with arbitrary valency, which quantitatively agrees with simulations that explicitly include EEs. Our analysis reveals an anomalous dependence of PAE-PAE interactions on the EE valency, showing that EE-mediated interactions converge at the large valency limit. Moreover, we identify an optimal EE valency that maximizes the interaction difference between targeted and non-targeted binding pairs of PAEs. These findings offer design principles for targeted self-assembly in PAE-EE systems.</description>

      <title>Gardner transition coincides with the emergence of jamming scalings in hard spheres and disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Gardner transition in structural glasses is characterized by full-replica symmetry breaking of the free-energy landscape and the onset of anomalous aging dynamics due to marginal stability. Here we show that this transition also has a structural signature in finite-dimensional glasses consisting of hard spheres and disks. By analyzing the distribution of inter-particle gaps in the simulated static configurations at different pressures, we find that the Gardner transition coincides with the emergence of two well-known jamming scalings in the gap distribution, which enables the extraction of a structural order parameter. The jamming scalings reflect a compressible effective force network formed by contact and quasi-contact gaps, while non-contact gaps that do not participate in the effective force network are incompressible. Our results suggest that the Gardner transition in hard-particle glasses is a precursor of the jamming transition. The proposed structural signature and order parameter provide a convenient approach to detecting the Gardner transition in future granular experiments.</description>

      <title>The model of photoswitching in lead-halide perovskite microcrystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23823v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A theoretical model for the recently discovered effect of all-optical photoswitching in lead tribromide perovskite single microcrystals is proposed. The model takes into account the spatially distributed kinetics of the charge carrier recombination and the creation/destruction of trap states. It successfully reproduces the key features of the photoswitching phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Mode analysis of Nambu-Goldstone modes in U(1) charged first-order relativistic viscous hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We conduct a mode analysis of a general U(1)-charged first-order relativistic hydrodynamics within the framework of the effective field theory of dissipative fluids in a Minkowski background. The most general quadratic action for collective excitations around hydrodynamic solutions -- specifically, the Nambu-Goldstone (NG) modes associated with the symmetry-breaking pattern induced by external fields -- is derived. It is found that the hydrodynamical frame invariants write the first-order dispersion relations in the low energy limit. In thermodynamical viscous fluids realized by integrating out fast modes, unitarity and local KMS symmetry for its underlying UV theory are guaranteed. Then, we find that first-order hydrodynamics are stable if the null energy condition is satisfied. As the NG modes nonlinearly realize the diffeomorphism symmetries, our mode analysis is valid in any coordinate systems, including Lorentz-transformed references. We also comment on the causal structure for the diffusive modes based on the retarded Green functions for the stochastic NG mode.</description>

      <title>Neural Network Matrix Product Operator: A Multi-Dimensionally Integrable Machine Learning Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23858v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A neural network-based machine learning potential energy surface (PES) expressed in a matrix product operator (NN-MPO) is proposed. The MPO form enables efficient evaluation of high-dimensional integrals that arise in solving the time-dependent and time-independent Schr\"odinger equation and effectively overcomes the so-called curse of dimensionality. This starkly contrasts with other neural network-based machine learning PES methods, such as multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs), where evaluating high-dimensional integrals is not straightforward due to the fully connected topology in their backbone architecture. Nevertheless, the NN-MPO retains the high representational capacity of neural networks. NN-MPO can achieve spectroscopic accuracy with a test mean absolute error (MAE) of 3.03 cm$^{-1}$ for a fully coupled six-dimensional ab initio PES, using only 625 training points distributed across a 0 to 17,000 cm$^{-1}$ energy range. Our Python implementation is available at https://github.com/KenHino/Pompon.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a monolayer of metal balls under periodic chiral driving in the horizontal plane. Energy dissipation occurs in this system via (i) inelastic collisions and (ii) frictional interaction with the substrate. We show that below a density-dependent critical drive, the system phase separates into a fluid phase coexisting with a solid phase. Unlike ordinary coexistence, however, the system does not obey the lever rule, as the fluid-phase density depends on the overall particle density. Additionally, the pressure is discontinuous across the fluid-solid interface, accompanied by a chiral edge current at the interface.</description>

      <title>Non-linear sigma models for non-Hermitian random matrices in symmetry classes AI$^{\dagger}$ and AII$^{\dagger}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.24043v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symmetry of non-Hermitian matrices underpins many physical phenomena. In particular, chaotic open quantum systems exhibit universal bulk spectral correlations classified on the basis of time-reversal symmetry$^{\dagger}$ (TRS$^{\dagger}$), coinciding with those of non-Hermitian random matrices in the same symmetry class. Here, we analytically study the spectral correlations of non-Hermitian random matrices in the presence of TRS$^{\dagger}$ with signs $+1$ and $-1$, corresponding to symmetry classes AI$^{\dagger}$ and AII$^{\dagger}$, respectively. Using the fermionic replica non-linear sigma model approach, we derive $n$-fold integral expressions for the $n$th moment of the one-point and two-point characteristic polynomials. Performing the replica limit $n\to 0$, we qualitatively reproduce the density of states and level-level correlations of non-Hermitian random matrices with TRS$^{\dagger}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.24058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thermal states play a fundamental role in various areas of physics, and they are becoming increasingly important in quantum information science, with applications related to semi-definite programming, quantum Boltzmann machine learning, Hamiltonian learning, and the related task of estimating the parameters of a Hamiltonian. Here we establish formulas underlying the basic geometry of parameterized thermal states, and we delineate quantum algorithms for estimating the values of these formulas. More specifically, we prove formulas for the Fisher--Bures and Kubo--Mori information matrices of parameterized thermal states, and our quantum algorithms for estimating their matrix elements involve a combination of classical sampling, Hamiltonian simulation, and the Hadamard test. These results have applications in developing a natural gradient descent algorithm for quantum Boltzmann machine learning, which takes into account the geometry of thermal states, and in establishing fundamental limitations on the ability to estimate the parameters of a Hamiltonian, when given access to thermal-state samples. For the latter task, and for the special case of estimating a single parameter, we sketch an algorithm that realizes a measurement that is asymptotically optimal for the estimation task. We finally stress that the natural gradient descent algorithm developed here can be used for any machine learning problem that employs the quantum Boltzmann machine ansatz.</description>

Abstract: Biological molecular machines convert free energy between different forms in cells, often at high efficiency. Optimal control theory provides a framework to elucidate design principles governing energetically efficient driving. Here, we use linear-response theory to design efficient protocols exercising dynamic control of trap center and stiffness in a model of driven F1-ATPase. We find that the key design principles of an efficient protocol can be satisfied either by dynamic control of both parameters, or by dynamic control of a single parameter and a good static choice for the second. These results illustrate that accessing a new degree of dynamic control provides varying performance improvements in different systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.24142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study quantum field theories which have quantum groups as global internal symmetries. We show that in such theories operators are generically non-local, and should be thought as living at the ends of topological lines. We describe the general constraints of the quantum group symmetry, given by Ward identities, that correlation functions of the theory should satisfy. We also show that generators of the symmetry can be represented by topological lines with some novel properties. We then discuss a particular example of $U_q(sl_2)$ symmetric CFT, which we solve using the bootstrap techniques and relying on the symmetry. We finally show strong evidence that for a special value of $q$ a subsector of this theory reproduces the fermionic formulation of the Ising model. This suggests that a quantum group can act on local operators as well, however, it generically transforms them into non-local ones.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.24143v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a conformal field theory that arises in the infinite-volume limit of a spin chain with $U_q(sl_2)$ global symmetry. Most operators in the theory are defect-ending operators which allows $U_q(sl_2)$ symmetry transformations to act on them in a consistent way. We use Coulomb gas techniques to construct correlation functions and compute all OPE coefficients of the model, as well as to prove that the properties imposed by the quantum group symmetry are indeed satisfied by the correlation functions. In particular, we treat the non-chiral operators present in the theory. Free boson realization elucidates the origin of the defects attached to the operators. We also comment on the role of quantum group in generalized minimal models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.24212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scrambling unitary dynamics in a quantum system transmutes local quantum information into a non-local web of correlations which manifests itself in a complex spatio-temporal pattern of entanglement. In such a context, we show there can exist three distinct dynamical phases characterised by qualitatively different forms of quantum correlations between two disjoint subsystems of the system. Transitions between these phases are driven by the relative sizes of the subsystems and the degree scrambling that the dynamics effects. Besides a phase which has no quantum correlations as manifested by vanishing entanglement between the parts and a phase which has non-trivial quantum correlations quantified by a finite entanglement monotone, we reveal a new phase transition within the entangled phase which separates phases wherein the quantum correlations are invisible or visible to measurements on one of the subsystems. This is encoded in the qualitatively different properties of the ensemble of states on one of the subsystems conditioned on the various measurement outcomes on the other subsystem. This provides a new characterisation of entanglement phases in terms of their response to measurements instead of the more ubiquitous measurement-induced entanglement transitions. Our results have implications for the kind of tasks that can be performed using measurement feedback within the framework of quantum interactive dynamics.</description>

In contrast to the classical-gas experiments, where no temperature change was measured, here we observe both cooling and heating effects, which arise, respectively, due to quantum statistics and inter-particle interactions. Our observations are reproduced in numerical calculations within the Hartree-Fock approximation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.05140v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study heat and particle current circulation (CC) in quadratic Fermionic systems analysed using a general dissipative Lindbladian master equation. It was observed in an earlier study (Upadhyay et al. Phys. Rev. E 107, 034120 (2023)), that CC occurs near the additional energy degeneracy point (AEDP) in Fermionic systems which have some form of asymmetry. We find general analytical expression to support this observation for quadratic Fermionic networks. We then apply these ideas to the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model with periodic boundary conditions and a tight binding model with unequal hopping strengths in the upper and lower branches. In both these cases, we find the specific conditions required for observing CC and study the behavior of these currents with various system parameters. We find that having unequal number of Fermionic sites in the upper and lower branches is enough for generating CC in the SSH model. However, this asymmetry is not adequate for the tight-binding model and we require unequal hopping strengths in the upper and lower branches to induce CC in this model. We also compare our results with the exact results obtained via the Non-Equilibrium Green Function (NEGF) formalism, and observe that the relationship between AEDP and CC also holds for the exact results. Finally, we observe that for certain system parameters, the onset point of particle and heat CC are not the same. Based on all these observations, we describe how carefully examining the energy spectrum of the system gives a great deal of information about the possibility and behavior of CC in Fermionic systems with asymmetries.</description>

Abstract: Equilibrium rate theories play a crucial role in understanding rare, reactive events. However, they are inapplicable to a range of irreversible processes in systems driven far from thermodynamic equilibrium like active and biological matter. Here, we develop an efficient numerical method to compute the rate constant of rare nonequilibrium events in the weak-noise limit based on an instanton approximation to the stochastic path integral and illustrate its wide range of application. We demonstrate excellent agreement of the instanton rates with numerically exact results for a particle under a non-conservative force. We also study phase transitions in an active field theory. We elucidate how activity alters the stability of the two phases and their rates of interconversion in a manner that can be well described by modifying classical nucleation theory,</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15230v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Field-theoretical calculations predict that, at the upper critical dimension $d_c=4$, the finite-size scaling (FSS) behaviors of the Ising model would be modified by multiplicative logarithmic corrections with thermal and magnetic correction exponents $(\hat{y}_t, \hat{y}_h)=(1/6,1/4)$. Using high-efficient cluster algorithms and the lifted worm algorithm, we present a systematic study of the FSS of the four-dimensional Ising model in the Fortuin-Kasteleyn (FK) bond and loop representations. Our numerical results reveal the FSS behaviors of various geometric and physical quantities in the three representations, offering robust evidence for the logarithmic correction form conjectured by the field theory. In particular, clear evidence is obtained for the existence of $\hat{y}_t=1/6$ in the loop representation, while it is difficult to extract in the spin representations, because of mixing with the Gaussian-fixed-point asymptotics. In the FK-bond representation, the multiplicative logarithmic correction for the second-largest cluster is also numerically observed to be governed by an exponent $\hat{y}_{h2} = -1/4$ with its exact value unknown yet.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21999v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Random assemblies of magnetic nanowires represent a unique class of materials with promising applications in spintronics and information storage. These assemblies exhibit complex behavior due to the combination of magnetic dipolar interactions between the nanowires and electronic transport properties governed by tunneling barriers at magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs). The intricate interplay of these phenomena makes the study of magnetic nanowire networks a rich area of research. In this study, we develop a theoretical framework to analyze the resistive behavior of random magnetic nanowire networks. By employing a combination of graph theoretical approaches and mean-field theory, we derive an effective resistance model that encapsulates the contributions of magnetic interactions between the nanowires. Our findings show the importance of considering both the magnetic and electrical properties of nanowire networks in the design and optimization of amorphous resistive devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23205v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an ultrafast thermodynamics framework to model heat generation and entropy production in laser-driven ferromagnetic systems. By establishing a connection between the magnetic field strength of the laser pulse and magnetization dynamics we model time-dependent entropy production rates and deduce the associated heat dissipation in epitaxial and polycrystalline FeNi and CoFeB thin films. Our theoretical predictions are validated by comparison to experimental magnetization dynamics data, shedding light on thermodynamic processes on picosecond timescales. Crucially, we incorporate recently observed inertial spin dynamics, to describe their impact on heat generation in pump-probe experiments. As such, this formalism provides novel insights into controlling heat production in magnetic systems, and contributes to advancing the understanding of non-equilibrium thermodynamics in magnetic systems, with implications for future experimental protocols in spintronics and nanotechnology.</description>

      <title>Elliptic Stable Envelopes for Certain Non-Symplectic Varieties and Dynamical $R$-Matrices for Superspin Chains from the Bethe/Gauge Correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.12333v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We generalize Aganagic-Okounkov's theory of elliptic stable envelopes, and its physical realization in Dedushenko-Nekrasov's and Bullimore-Zhang's works, to certain varieties without holomorphic symplectic structure or polarization. These classes of varieties include, in particular, classical Higgs branches of 3d $\mathcal N=2$ quiver gauge theories. The Bethe/gauge correspondence relates such a gauge theory to an anisotropic/elliptic superspin chain, and the stable envelopes compute the $R$-matrix that solves the dynamical Yang-Baxter equation (dYBE) for this spin chain. As an illustrative example, we solve the dYBE for the elliptic $\mathfrak{sl}(1|1)$ spin chain with fundamental representations using the corresponding 3d $\mathcal N=2$ SQCD whose classical Higgs branch is the Lascoux resolution of a determinantal variety. Certain Janus partition functions of this theory on $I \times \mathbb E$ for an interval $I$ and an elliptic curve $\mathbb E$ compute the elliptic stable envelopes, and in turn the geometric elliptic $R$-matrix, of the anisotropic $\mathfrak{sl}(1|1)$ spin chain. Furthermore, we consider the 2d and 1d reductions of elliptic stable envelopes and the $R$-matrix. The reduction to 2d gives the K-theoretic stable envelopes and the trigonometric $R$-matrix, and a further reduction to 1d produces the cohomological stable envelopes and the rational $R$-matrix. The latter recovers Rim\'anyi-Rozansky's results that appeared recently in the mathematical literature.</description>

      <title>Diffusion coefficients preserving long-time correlations: Consequences on the Einstein relation and on entanglement in a bosonic Bogoliubov system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.16651v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analytically derive the diffusion coefficients that drive a system of $N$ coupled harmonic oscillators to an equilibrium state exhibiting persistent correlations. It is shown that the main effect of the latter consists in a renormalization of the natural frequencies and the friction coefficients of the oscillators. We find that the Einstein relation may be satisfied at low temperatures with frequency-dependent effective friction coefficients, provided that the physical constraints are fulfilled. We also investigate the entanglement evolution in a bipartite bosonic Bogoliubov system initially prepared in a thermal squeezed state. It is found that, in contrast to what one may expect, strong coupling slows down the entanglement sudden death, and for initially separable states, entanglement generation may occur.</description>

Insights from such models have led to advances in the quantum theory of charged black holes in spatial dimensions $d \geq 3$, and to a universal theory of strange metals in correlated electron materials in $d=2$; these are also briefly reviewed.</description>

      <title>Gaussian Universality in Neural Network Dynamics with Generalized Structured Input Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00642v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bridging the gap between the practical performance of deep learning and its theoretical foundations often involves analyzing neural networks through stochastic gradient descent (SGD). Expanding on previous research that focused on modeling structured inputs under a simple Gaussian setting, we analyze the behavior of a deep learning system trained on inputs modeled as Gaussian mixtures to better simulate more general structured inputs. Through empirical analysis and theoretical investigation, we demonstrate that under certain standardization schemes, the deep learning model converges toward Gaussian setting behavior, even when the input data follow more complex or real-world distributions. This finding exhibits a form of universality in which diverse structured distributions yield results consistent with Gaussian assumptions, which can support the theoretical understanding of deep learning models.</description>

      <title>Measurement-induced entanglement transition in chaotic quantum Ising chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08703v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We numerically investigate the robustness against various perturbations of measurement-induced phase transition in monitored quantum Ising models in the no-click limit, where the dynamics is described by a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. We study perturbations that break the integrability and/or the symmetry of the model, as well as modifications in the measurement protocol, characterizing the resulting chaos and lack of integrability through the Dissipative Spectral Form Factor (DSFF). We show that while the measurement-induced phase transition and its properties appear to be broadly insensitive to lack of integrability and breaking of the $\mathbb{Z_2}$ symmetry, a modification of the measurement basis from the transverse to the longitudinal direction makes the phase transition disappear altogether.</description>

      <title>Role of symmetry in the orientationally disordered crystals of hard convex polyhedra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09637v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The crystalline solids with lack of orientational ordering of anisotropic particles serve the purpose of studying the disordered systems with many fundamental applications in contemporary research. Despite the orientational disorder, multiple unique orientations with fixed angular differences exist in the crystal structures giving rise of "discrete plastic crystal" phase where the particles jump discretely within the unique orientations. We report the computational evidence of the role of symmetries between polyhedral particles and respective crystalline structures in controlling the existence of such phase at comparatively higher range of packing fractions beyond the freely rotating plastic crystals. The point groups of the particle and crystal structure were found to be directly connected in terms of the parallel alignment between the highest order rotational symmetry axes of the particle point group and any rotational axes of crystallographic point group, as a characteristic feature of this phase giving rise of discrete orientations. Based on our previous research [Kundu \textit{et al.}, arXiv:2311.06799, 2023] and new findings reported here, this symmetry relationship appeared to occur at the unit cells of the crystal structures which acted as the source of correlation, where as, all previously reported conserved orientational attributes i.e., number of unique orientations with fixed angular differences, equal population densities within the unique orientations, could be thought as the signatures of correlation present in the entire system. This relationship appeared to control all the aspects of phase which might be useful to draw fundamental insights about the disordered phases with orientational correlation as well as designing the disorder in the crystals.</description>

      <title>A universal speed limit for spreading of quantum coherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08204v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Discoveries of fundamental limits for the rates of physical processes, from the speed of light to the Lieb-Robinson bound for information propagation, are conceptual breakthroughs that often challenge our understanding of the underlying physics. Here we observe such a limit for a paradigmatic many-body phenomenon, the spreading of coherence during formation of a weakly interacting Bose-Einstein condensate. We study condensate formation in an isolated homogeneous atomic gas that is initially far from equilibrium, in an incoherent low-energy state, and condenses as it relaxes towards equilibrium. Tuning the inter-atomic interactions that drive condensation, we show that the spreading of coherence through the system is initially slower for weaker interactions, and faster for stronger ones, but always eventually reaches the same limit, where the square of the coherence length grows at a universal rate given by the ratio of Planck's constant and the particle mass. These observations are robust to changes in the initial state, the gas density, and the system size. Our results provide benchmarks for theories of universality far from equilibrium, are relevant for quantum technologies that rely on large-scale coherence, and invite similar measurements in other quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Synthetic Mutual Gauge Field in Microwave-Shielded Polar Molecular Gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10806v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent breakthrough of realizing the Bose-Einstein condensate of polar molecules and degenerate Fermi molecules in three dimensions relies crucially on the microwave shielding technique, which strongly suppresses the collision loss between molecules. In this letter, we show that the cooperation of microwave shielding and dipolar interaction naturally leads to the emergence of a synthetic gauge field. Unlike that studied in cold atoms before, this gauge field couples to the relative motion of every two molecules instead of single-particle motion, therefore being a mutual gauge field. In this case, every molecule carrying a synthetic charge sees the other molecule as carrying the source of the magnetic field, and the spatial distribution of the magnetic field is reminiscent of a solenoid attached to the molecule. In other words, in addition to microwave-shielded interaction, another part of the interaction between two molecules behaves as a charge interacting with a solenoid, which was missed in the previous discussion. We argue that the physical manifestation of this gauge field is breaking time-reversal symmetry in the collective spatial motion of molecules. Finally, we discuss the challenges in quantitatively studying such a quantum many-body system.</description>

      <title>Complete mathematical theory of the jamming transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21439v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The jamming transition of frictionless athermal particles is a paradigm to understand the mechanics of amorphous materials at the atomic scale. Concepts related to the jamming transition and the mechanical response of jammed packings have cross-fertilized into other areas such as atomistic descriptions of the elasticity and plasticity of glasses. In this perspective article, the microscopic mathematical theory of the jamming transition is reviewed from first-principles. The starting point of the derivation is a microscopically-reversible particle-bath Hamiltonian from which the governing equation of motion for the grains under an external deformation is derived. From this equation of motion, microscopic expressions are obtained for both the shear modulus and the viscosity as a function of the distance from the jamming transition (respectively, above and below the transition). Regarding the vanishing of the shear modulus at the unjamming transition, this theory, as originally demonstrated in [Zaccone \&amp; Scossa-Romano, Phys. Rev. B 83, 184205 (2011)], is currently the only quantitative microscopic theory in parameter-free agreement with numerical simulations of [O'Hern et al. Phys. Rev. E 68, 011306 (2003)] for jammed packings. The divergence of the viscosity upon approaching the jamming transition from below is derived here, for the first time, from the same microscopic Hamiltonian. The quantitative microscopic prediction of the diverging viscosity is shown to be in fair agreement with numerical results of sheared 2D soft disks from [Olsson \&amp; Teitel, Phys. Rev. Lett. 99, 178001 (2007)].</description>

      <title>Statistical Mechanics of Multiplectoneme Phases in DNA</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23145v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A stretched DNA molecule which is also under- or overwound, undergoes a buckling transition forming intertwined looped domains called plectonemes. Here we develop a simple theory that extends the two-phase model of stretched supercoiled DNA, allowing for the coexistence of multiple plectonemic domains by including positional and length distribution entropies. Such a multiplectoneme phase is favored in long DNA molecules in which the gain of positional entropy compensates for the cost of nucleating a plectoneme along a stretched DNA segment. Despite its simplicity, the developed theory is shown to be in excellent agreement with Monte Carlo simulations of the twistable wormlike chain model. The theory predicts more plectonemes than experimentally observed, which we attribute to the limited resolution of experimental data. Since plectonemes are detected through fluorescence signals, those shorter than the observable threshold are likely missed.</description>
