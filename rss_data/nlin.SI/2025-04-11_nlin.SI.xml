      <title>Harmonic, Holomorphic and Rational Maps from Self-Duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02636v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a generalization of the so-called rational map ansatz on the Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^3$, for any compact simple Lie group $G$ such that $G/{\widehat K}\otimes U(1)$ is an Hermitian symmetric space, for some subgroup ${\widehat K}$ of $G$. It generalizes the rational maps on the two-sphere $SU(2)/U(1)$, and also on $CP^N=SU(N+1)/SU(N)\otimes U(1)$, and opens up the way for applications of such ans\"atze on non-linear sigma models, Skyrme theory and magnetic monopoles in Yang-Mills-Higgs theories. Our construction is based on a well known mathematical result stating that stable harmonic maps $X$ from the two-sphere $S^2$ to compact Hermitian symmetric spaces $G/{\widehat K}\otimes U(1)$ are holomorphic or anti-holomorphic. We derive such a mathematical result using ideas involving the concept of self-duality, in a way that makes it more accessible to theoretical physicists. Using a topological (homotopic) charge that admits an integral representation, we construct first order partial differential self-duality equations such that their solutions also solve the (second order) Euler-Lagrange associated to the harmonic map energy $E=\int_{S^2} \mid dX\mid^2 d\mu$. We show that such solutions saturate a lower bound on the energy $E$, and that the self-duality equations constitute the Cauchy-Riemann equations for the maps $X$. Therefore, they constitute harmonic and (anti)holomorphic maps, and lead to the generalization of the rational map ans\"atze in $\mathbb{R}^3$. We apply our results to construct approximate Skyrme solutions for the $SU(N)$ Skyrme model.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Scattering Relation for the Toda Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08018v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we consider the Toda lattice $(\boldsymbol{p}(t); \boldsymbol{q}(t))$ at thermal equilibrium, meaning that its variables $(p_i)$ and $(e^{q_i-q_{i+1}})$ are independent Gaussian and Gamma random variables, respectively. We justify the notion from the physics literature that this model can be thought of as a dense collection of ``quasiparticles'' that act as solitons by, (i) precisely defining the locations of these quasiparticles; (ii) showing that local charges and currents for the Toda lattice are well-approximated by simple functions of the quasiparticle data; and (iii) proving an asymptotic scattering relation that governs the dynamics of the quasiparticle locations. Our arguments are based on analyzing properties about eigenvector entries of the Toda lattice's (random) Lax matrix, particularly, their rates of exponential decay and their evolutions under inverse scattering.</description>

      <title>Effective Velocities in the Toda Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11407v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we consider the Toda lattice $(\boldsymbol{p}(t); \boldsymbol{q}(t))$ at thermal equilibrium, meaning that its variables $(p_i)$ and $(e^{q_i-q_{i+1}})$ are independent Gaussian and Gamma random variables, respectively. This model can be thought of a dense collection of many ``quasiparticles'' that act as solitons. We establish a law of large numbers for the trajectory of these quasiparticles, showing that they travel with approximately constant velocities, which are explicit. Our proof is based on a direct analysis of the asymptotic scattering relation, an equation (proven in previous work of the author) that approximately governs the dynamics of quasiparticles locations. This makes use of a regularization argument that essentially linearizes this relation, together with concentration estimates for the Toda lattice's (random) Lax matrix.</description>
