      <title>Comprehensive Multimodal and Multiscale Analysis of Alzheimer Disease in 5xFAD Mice: Optical Spectroscopies, TEM, Neuropathological, and Behavioral Investigations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Alzheimer disease (AD) is considered one of the leading causes of death in the United States, and there is no effective cure for it. Understanding the neuropathological mechanisms underlying AD is essential for identifying early, reliable biomarkers and developing effective therapies. In this paper, we report on a comprehensive multimodal study of AD pathology using the 5xFAD mouse model. We employed light-scattering techniques, Partial Wave Spectroscopy (PWS) and Inverse Participation Ratio (IPR), to detect nanoscale structural alterations in brain tissues, nuclear components, and mitochondria. To support the light-scattering experiments, behavior, and histopathological studies were conducted. These analyses revealed significant increases in structural heterogeneity and mass density fluctuations in the brains of 5xFAD mice compared with Non-transgenic controls. Behavioral assessment demonstrated memory impairment in 5xFAD mice, reflected by a reduced recognition index. Histopathological analysis further revealed increased amyloid beta plaques and microglia activation in the hippocampus and cortex of 5xFAD mice compared with Non-transgenic controls. An increase in structural disorder within brain tissues can be attributed to higher mass density fluctuations, likely arising from macromolecular rearrangement driven by amyloid beta aggregation and neuroinflammatory responses as the disease progresses. Our findings suggest that PWS and IPR-derived metrics provide sensitive biophysical indicators of early cellular and subcellular disruption, offering potential as quantitative biomarkers for the detection and progression of AD.</description>

      <title>Towards Integrated Clinical-Computational Nuclear Medicine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The field of Clinical-Computational Nuclear Medicine is rapidly advancing, fueled by AI, tracer kinetic modeling, radiomics, and integrated informatics. These technologies improve imaging quality, automate lesion detection, and enable personalized radiopharmaceutical therapy through physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling and voxel-level dosimetry. Workflow automation and Natural Language Processing (NLP) further enhance operational efficiency. However, successful implementation and adoption of these tools require clinical oversight to ensure accuracy, interpretability, and patient safety. This paper highlights key computational innovations and emphasizes the critical role of clinician-guided evaluation in shaping the future of precision imaging and therapy.</description>

      <title>On the Appropriateness of Linear Stress Recovery in Biomechanical Analysis of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) wall stress is a candidate rupture risk marker but is typically computed from single-phase images without known cardiac phase. Linear stress recovery methods, which solve a single geometrically linear equilibrium problem on the imaged, already-loaded geometry, have been validated for static stress estimation, but their robustness to unknown imaging phase remains unexplored. We investigated whether imaging phase materially biases 99th percentile stress recovered linearly, and whether linear recovery agrees with non-linear analysis under matched loads. Two patient-specific AAAs from a public 4D-CTA cohort (Case 1: 5.5% strain; Case 2: 4.5% strain) were analyzed. For each, we analyzed diastolic and synthetic systolic geometry, the latter generated by warping the diastolic mesh via displacements from non-linear hyperelastic analysis. Linear stresses were recovered on both geometries under systolic pressure and compared via 99th-percentile maximum principal stress, stress distributions, and 3D stress differential contours. Linear stresses under pulse pressure were compared against non-linear stresses. 99th-percentile stresses from linear recovery on diastolic vs synthetic systolic geometries under systolic pressure differed by 8.6% (Case 1) and 3.5% (Case 2), within segmentation uncertainty. 99th-percentile stresses from linear recovery and non-linear analysis under pulse pressure agreed closely: 0% difference (Case 1) and 1.1% (Case 2), with nearly identical distributions. These findings support linear stress recovery for patient-specific AAA analysis in clinical settings with static single-phase imaging, offering a computationally efficient alternative without compromising accuracy or requiring patient-specific wall properties.</description>

      <title>Measuring thermal contact resistances between metallic rods using laser spot heating and infrared thermography. Part 1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Estimation of thermal contact resistances between cylinders can be achieved using heating on the cross sections by a laser spot and measurement of the temperature response by IR thermography. This type of measurement makes it possible to characterise contacts in clusters of cylinders to simulate clusters of grains, or the properties of fibrous media in the transverse direction or, under certain conditions, to detect emerging thermal resistances (cracks perpendicular to the observation plane) by IR thermography. Here, the thermal model is simplified because the temperature field in relaxation on either side of the resistance can be considered isothermal with a separation of transfers in the plane and along the thickness. The mathematical model is then analytical (relaxation of a linear system), and the processing of the temperature field can be inversed thanks to the consideration of the logarithm of matrices, useful when studying the propagation of measurement noise. The method proposed in the case of two or three cylinders is a first step and a validation for applications to the study of more complex media (large number of cylinders, granular media).</description>

      <title>In-vivo imaging with a low-cost MRI scanner and cloud data processing in low-resource settings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: To demonstrate in-vivo imaging with a low-cost, low-field MRI scanner built and operated in Africa, and to show how systematic hardware and software improvements can mitigate the main operational limitations encountered in low-resource environments. Methods: A 46 mT Halbach scanner located at the Mbarara University of Science and Technology (Uganda) was upgraded through a complete reorganization of grounding and shielding, installation of new control electronics and open-source user-interface software. Noise performance was quantified using a standardized protocol and in-vivo brain images were acquired with three-dimensional RARE sequences. Distortion correction was implemented using cloud-based reconstructions incorporating magnetic field maps. Results: The revamped system reached noise levels routinely below three times the thermal limit and demonstrated stable operation over multi-day measurements. Three-dimensional T1- and T2-weighted brain images were successfully acquired and distortion-corrected with remote GPU-based reconstructions and near real-time visualization through the user interface. Conclusions: The results show that low-cost MRI systems can achieve clinically relevant image quality when electromagnetic noise and power-grid instabilities are properly addressed. This work highlights the feasibility of sustainable MRI development in low-resource settings and identifies stable power delivery and local capacity building as the key next steps toward clinical translation.</description>

      <title>A primer on treatment planning aspects for temporally modulated pulsed radiation therapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Temporally modulated pulsed radiotherapy (TMPRT) delivers conventional fraction doses of radiation using temporally separated pulses of low doses (&lt;30 cGy) yielding fraction-effective dose rates of around 6.7 cGy/min with the goal to exploit tumor radiation hypersensitivity, which was observed in both, preclinical models and in human clinical trials. To facilitate TMPRT, volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) and 3D-CRT planning techniques were developed following the guidelines of the proposed NRG CC-017 trial. Plans were evaluated with respect to homogeneity, conformality, and adherence to dose constraints. Deliverability of plans was assessed using in-phantom measurements for absorbed dose accuracy at low dose rates and using EPID for isodose verification. For VMAT only single arc plans were found to be acceptable due to otherwise unacceptably heterogeneous field doses, while for dynamic conformal arcs machine limtations on the number of monitor units per degree require the use of partial arcs for each pulse. Delivery of plans at low dose rates (&lt; 100 MU/min) was accurate with high Gamma pass rates on modern LINACs and moderate pass rates on legacy LINACs, in line with their general performance. Generally, VMAT is preferred to achieve optimal homogeneity, conformality, and organ-at-risk sparing, while the use of 3D-CRT can increase the availability of TMPRT for more patients and clinics.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Predictive Modeling of Microfluidic Cancer Cell Separation Using a Deterministic Lateral Displacement Device</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17787v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deterministic Lateral Displacement (DLD) devices are widely used in microfluidics for label-free, size-based separation of particles and cells, with particular promise in isolating circulating tumor cells (CTCs) for early cancer diagnostics. This study focuses on the optimization of DLD design parameters, such as row shift fraction, post size, and gap distance, to enhance the selective isolation of lung cancer cells based on their physical properties. To overcome the challenges of rare CTC detection and reduce reliance on computationally intensive simulations, machine learning models including gradient boosting, k-nearest neighbors, random forest, and multilayer perceptron (MLP) regressors are employed. Trained on a large, numerically validated dataset, these models predict particle trajectories and identify optimal device configurations, enabling high-throughput and cost-effective DLD design. Beyond trajectory prediction, the models aid in isolating critical design variables, offering a systematic, data-driven framework for automated DLD optimization. This integrative approach advances the development of scalable and precise microfluidic systems for cancer diagnostics, contributing to the broader goals of early detection and personalized medicine.</description>

      <title>Production of High-Specific-Activity Radioisotopes Using High-Energy Fusion Neutrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02814v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that transmutation driven by high-energy neutrons from deuterium-tritium (D-T) fusion reactions can produce many important medical radioisotopes - including $^{32}$P, $^{60}$Co, $^{64}$Cu, $^{89}$Sr, $^{90}$Y, $^{89}$Zr, $^{99}$Mo/$^{99\mathrm{m}}$Tc, $^{103}$Pd, $^{111}$In, $^{117}$In/$^{117\mathrm{m}1}$Sn, $^{123}$I, $^{125}$I, $^{131}$I, $^{133}$Xe, $^{153}$Sm, $^{166}$Ho, $^{177}$Lu, $^{188}$Re, and $^{192}$Ir-and emerging isotopes such as $^{47}$Sc, $^{67}$Cu, $^{103}$Ru/$^{103\mathrm{m}}$Rh, $^{103}$Pd/$^{103\mathrm{m}}$Rh, $^{119}$Sb, $^{124}$I, $^{155}$Tb, $^{161}$Tb, $^{195\mathrm{m}1}$Ir/$^{195\mathrm{m}}$Pt, and $^{225}$Ac with high specific activity and in large quantities. These reactions involve stable, abundant feedstocks and non-fission transmutation channels that change the proton number, enabling chemical separation of the product. Fusion-based transmutation could provide a flexible and proliferation-resistant platform for supply of high-purity isotopes. A D-T neutron source operating at a few megawatts of fusion power could meet or exceed global demand for most major radioisotopes. Further research is required to develop tailored approaches for feedstock processing and product extraction.</description>

      <title>Smooth Total variation Regularization for Interference Detection and Elimination (STRIDE) for MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13628v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: MRI is increasingly desired to function near electronic devices that emit potentially dynamic electromagnetic interference (EMI). To accommodate for this, we propose the STRIDE method, which improves on previous external-sensor-based EMI removal methods by exploiting inherent MR image smoothness in its total variation. STRIDE measures data from both EMI detectors and primary MR imaging coils, transforms this data into the image domain, and for each column of the resulting image array, combines and subtracts data from the EMI detectors in a way that optimizes for total-variation smoothness. Performance was tested on phantom and in-vivo datasets with a 0.5T scanner. STRIDE resulted in visually better EMI removal, higher temporal SNR, larger EMI removal percentage, and lower RMSE than standard implementations. STRIDE is a robust technique that leverages inherent MR image properties to provide improved EMI removal performance over standard algorithms, particularly for time-varying noise sources.</description>
