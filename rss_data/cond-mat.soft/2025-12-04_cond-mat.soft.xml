      <title>Interfacial Thermal Conductance Between a Polyethylene Glycol Polymer Chain and Water: A Molecular Dynamics Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding interfacial heat transfer between polymers and water is crucial for the design of biomaterials, drug delivery platforms, and nanofluidic systems. In this study, we employed all atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to quantify the interfacial thermal conductance between a polyethylene glycol (PEG) 36mer chain and explicit water over the temperature range of 280-350 K. To compare the conformational behavior of the PEG chain, we examined its radius of gyration and observed a temperature dependent chain collapse consistent with previous coarse grained models. By employing a transient non equilibrium MD approach, we imposed temperature difference across the interface and analyzed the energy relaxation behavior to compute heat transfer across the polymer water interfaces. Our results demonstrate that both temperature and interfacial interaction strength influence interfacial thermal conductance, with temperature playing the dominant role. Structural factors such as chain conformation and interfacial area were found to mediate the effect of interfacial interaction. Additional analysis of the vibrational density of states (VDOS) and the mean square displacement (MSD) reveal that vibrational coupling has minimal impact on thermal conductance across interfaces, whereas increased water thermal motion enhances energy transfer. These findings highlight the structural and dynamical origins of interfacial thermal conductance and provide atomistic insights into the tuning of interfacial heat transport in molecular systems through temperature and solvent interactions.</description>

      <title>Tunable Thin Elasto-Drops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an experimental method to fabricate centimetric thin elastic capsules with highly uniform thickness and negligible bending stiffness using silicone elastomers. In our experiments, the capsules thickness is tunable at fabrication, while internal pressure and hoop (circumferential) stress are adjustable via hydrostatic inflation once the capsules are filled and immersed in water. Capsules mechanics are probed through hydro-elastic waves generated by weak mechanical perturbations at the capsule interface. By analyzing the surface wave dynamics in the Fourier domain, we extract the in-plane stress and demonstrate that the hydro-elastic waves are exclusively governed by hoop stress. This establishes a direct analogy with liquid drops characterised by an effective surface tension, allowing the capsules to be modeled as large-scale "elasto-drops" with an inflation and thickness tunable effective surface tension. Our work demonstrates that elasto-drops serve as a robust model system for parametric studies of large-scale liquid drops with experimentally adjustable surface tension.</description>

      <title>Yielding in dense active matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-density granular active matter is a useful model for dense animal collectives and could be useful for designing reconfigurable materials that can flow or solidify on command. Recent work has demonstrated key similarities and differences between the mechanical response of dense active matter and its sheared passive counterpart, yet a constitutive law that predicts precisely how dense active matter flows or fails remains elusive. Here we study the yielding transition in dense active matter in the limit of slow driving and large persistence times, across a wide range of material preparations. Under shear, materials prepared to be very low energy or ultrastable are brittle, and well-described by elastoplastic constitutive laws. We show that under random active forcing, however, ultrastable materials are always ductile. We develop a modified elastoplastic model that captures and explains these observations, where the key parameter is the correlation length of the input active driving field. We also observe large parameter regimes where the plastic flow is surprisingly well-predicted by the input active driving field and not highly dependent on the structural disorder, suggesting new strategies for control.</description>

      <title>Curvature Potential Formulation for Thin Elastic Sheets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thin elastic sheets appear in systems ranging from graphene to biological membranes, where phenomena such as wrinkling, folding, and thermal fluctuations originate from geometric nonlinearities. These effects are treated within weakly nonlinear theories, such as the Foppl-von Karman equations, which require small slopes and fail when deflections become large even if strains remain small. We introduce a methodological progress via a geometric reformulation of thin-sheet elasticity based on a stress potential and a curvature potential. This formulation preserves the structure of the classical equations while extending their validity to nonlinear, multivalued configurations, and geometrically frustrated states. The framework provides a unified description of thin-sheet mechanics in regimes inaccessible to existing theories and opens new possibilities for the study of elastic membranes and two-dimensional materials.</description>

      <title>Critical fluctuations of elastic moduli in jammed solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate sample-to-sample fluctuations of the shear modulus in ensembles of particle packings near the jamming transition. Unlike the average modulus, which exhibits distinct scaling behaviours depending on the interparticle potential, the fluctuations obey a critical exponent that is independent of the potential. Furthermore, this scaling behaviour has been confirmed in two-dimensional packings, indicating that it holds regardless of spatial dimension. Using this scaling law, we discuss the relationship predicted by heterogeneous-elasticity theory between elastic-modulus fluctuations and the Rayleigh scattering of sound waves across different pressures. Our numerical results provide a useful foundation for developing a unified theoretical description of the jamming critical phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Invariant fractocohesive length in thermally aged elastomers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fractocohesive length - the ratio between fracture toughness and work-to-fracture - provides a material-specific length scale that characterizes the size-dependent fracture behavior of pristine elastomers. However, its relevance to thermally aged materials, where both toughness and work of fracture degrade dramatically, remains unexplored. Here, we demonstrate that despite severe thermal embrittlement, the fractocohesive length remains invariant throughout thermal aging, independent of temperature or duration. We verify this invariance experimentally for two elastomer systems (Styrene Butadiene Rubber and Silicone Rubber) at multiple aging temperatures for aging times up to eight weeks. This finding bridges a critical gap in fracture mechanics of aged polymers: while the evolution of work-to-fracture can be predicted from well-established constitutive models that track network changes (crosslink density and chain scission), the evolution of fracture toughness has lacked predictive frameworks. The invariance of fractocohesive length enables direct calculation of fracture toughness at any aging state from the predicted work of fracture, eliminating the need for extensive fracture testing on aged elastomers and providing a crucial missing link for computational fracture predictions in aged elastomeric components.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian Active Matter in Incompressible Fluid Membranes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active proteins and membrane-bound motors exert force dipole flows along fluid interfaces and lipid bilayers. We develop a unified hydrodynamic and Hamiltonian framework for the interactions of pusher and puller dipoles embedded in an incompressible two-dimensional membrane supported by a shallow viscous subphase. Beginning from the screened Stokes equations of the membrane--subphase composite, we derive the real-space incompressible Green's tensor, obtain its near- and far-field asymptotics, and construct the resulting dipolar velocity and stream functions. Although generic dipoles reorient under the local membrane vorticity, we show that the far-field dipolar flow is vorticity-free; force-free motors therefore retain fixed orientation and obey a Hamiltonian dynamics in which the positions of $N$ dipoles evolve via an effective Hamiltonian built from the dipolar stream function. In the near field, where the flow possesses finite vorticity, a Hamiltonian formulation is recovered in the quenched-orientation limit. Exploiting this structure, we simulate ensembles of pusher and puller dipoles and compare the dynamics generated by the $1/r$ near-field kernel and the subphase screened $1/r^{3}$ far-field kernel. For identical dipoles, the far-field Hamiltonian produces rapid clustering from random initial conditions, whereas the near-field Hamiltonian suppresses collapse and yields extended, non-aggregating configurations.</description>

      <title>Speciation and hydration forces in sodium carbonate/bicarbonate aqueous solutions nanoconfined between mica sheets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The equilibrium between hydrated and hydrolysed forms of CO2 in water is central to a multitude of processes in geology, oceanography and biology. Chemistry of the carbonate system is well understood in bulk solution, however processes such as mineral weathering and biomineralisation frequently occur in nano-confined spaces where carbonate chemistry is less explored. For confined systems, the speciation equilibria are expected to tilt due to surface reactivity, electric fields and reduced configurational entropy. In this discussion paper we provide measurements of interaction force between negatively charged aluminosilicate (mica) sheets across aqueous carbonate/bicarbonate solutions confined to nanoscale films in equilibrium with a reservoir of the solution. By fitting the measurements to a Poisson-Boltzmann equation modified to account for charge regulation at the bounding walls, we discuss features of the bicarbonate speciation in confinement. We find that (i) the presence of bicarbonate in the bulk reservoir causes a repulsive excess pressure in the slit compared to pH-neutral salt solutions at the same concentration, arising from a higher (negative) effective charge on the mica surfaces; (ii) the electrostatic screening length is lower for solutions of Na2CO3 compared to NaHCO3 at the same bulk concentration, due to a shift in the speciation equilibria with pH and in accordance with Debye-H\"uckel theory; (iii) hydration forces are observed at distances below 2 nm with features of size 0.1 nm and 0.3 nm; this was reproducible across the various bicarbonate electrolytes studied, and contrasts with hydration forces of uniform step size measured in pH-neutral electrolytes.</description>

      <title>Structural and Dynamical Crossovers in Dense Electrolytes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electrostatic interactions fundamentally govern the structure and transport of electrolytes. In concentrated electrolytes, however, electrostatic and steric correlations, together with ion-solvent coupling, give rise to complex behavior, such as underscreening, that remains challenging to explain despite extensive theoretical effort. Using molecular dynamics simulations of primitive electrolytes with and without space-filling solvent particles, we elucidate the structural and dynamical crossovers and their connection that emerge with increasing salt concentration. Explicit-solvent electrolytes exhibit a screening transition from a charge-dominated dilute regime to a density-dominated concentrated regime, accompanied by dynamical crossovers in ion self-diffusion and ion-pair lifetimes. These dynamical crossovers display a marked discontinuity, unlike the smoother variation of the screening crossover, which originates from short-range ion-counterion structures. Despite the pronounced growth of ionic clusters, their percolation transition does not appear to be directly coupled to the onset of these crossovers. Both structural and dynamical behaviors are found to depend sensitively on ion-solvent coupling: implicit-solvent electrolytes exhibit a screening transition between two charge-dominated regimes, accompanied by qualitatively distinct dynamical behavior. Finally, we demonstrate that the diffusion-corrected ion-pair lifetime provides a consistent descriptor linking ionic structure and dynamics across electrolyte systems.</description>

      <title>Remembrance of Tasks Past in Tunable Physical Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.03799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sequential learning in physical networks is hindered by catastrophic forgetting, where training a new task erases solutions to earlier ones. We show that we can significantly enhance memory of previous tasks by introducing a hard threshold in the learning rule, allowing only edges with sufficiently large training signals to be altered. Thresholding confines tuning to the spatial vicinity of inputs and outputs for each task, effectively partitioning the network into weakly overlapping functional regions. Using simulations of tunable resistor networks, we demonstrate that this strategy enables robust memory of multiple sequential tasks while reducing the number of edges and the overall tuning cost. Our results hint at constrained training as a simple, local, and scalable mechanism to overcome catastrophic forgetting in tunable matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08873v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding protein motion within the cell is crucial for predicting reaction rates and macromolecular transport in the cytoplasm. A key question is how crowded environments affect protein dynamics through hydrodynamic and direct interactions at molecular length scales. Using megahertz X-ray Photon Correlation Spectroscopy (MHz-XPCS) at the European X-ray Free Electron Laser (EuXFEL), we investigate ferritin diffusion at microsecond time scales. Our results reveal anomalous diffusion, indicated by the non-exponential decay of the intensity autocorrelation function $g_2(q,t)$ at high concentrations. This behavior is consistent with the presence of cage-trapping in between the short- and long-time protein diffusion regimes. Modeling with the $\delta\gamma$-theory of hydrodynamically interacting colloidal spheres successfully reproduces the experimental data by including a scaling factor linked to the protein direct interactions. These findings offer new insights into the complex molecular motion in crowded protein solutions, with potential applications for optimizing ferritin-based drug delivery, where protein diffusion is the rate-limiting step.</description>

      <title>Screw Symmetry, Chiral Hydrodynamics and Odd Instability in Active Cholesterics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00684v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Active cholesterics are chiral in both their structure, which has continuous screw symmetry, and their active stresses, which include contributions from torque dipoles. Both expressions of chirality give rise to curl forces in the hydrodynamics, which we derive from the active Ericksen-Leslie equations using a geometric approach. This clarifies the hydrodynamics of continuous screw symmetry and provides an example of generalised odd elastic forces that originate from an equilibrium free energy. We discuss also the nonlinear structure of the active hydrodynamics in terms of the Eulerian displacement field of the cholesteric pseudolayers. For the active instability, screw symmetry generates a contribution of chiral activity to the linearised pseudolayer hydrodynamics that is absent in materials with chiral activity but achiral structure. When the two forms are sufficiently antagonistic, this term produces a new active instability with threshold and characteristic wavevector distinct from those of the active Helfrich-Hurault instability in chiral active smectics. Finally, we comment on the isotropic chiral hydrodynamics of materials with three-dimensional screw symmetry.</description>

      <title>Random packing fraction of binary convex and similar hyperparticles with small size difference: Statistical geometry approaches to excluded volume</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12898v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper the random packing fraction of binary similar hyperparticles with small size difference in D-dimensional Euclidean space RD is studied using two statistical geometry approaches. These geometric approaches, concerning orientation geometry and integral geometry, yield the excluded volume of particle pairs. The excluded volume of rectangles, based on orientation geometry, in Euclidean space R2 is used to derive an explicit equation for the bidisperse packing fraction, which is compatible with the expression published previously. Next, the excluded volume of pairs of convex particles in D = 2, 3 and 4 resulting from integral geometry are presented. These excluded volumes are identical with the specific ones for (sphero-)cylinders (D = 3) and rectangles (D = 2), derived by orientation geometry. Furthermore, these excluded volumes contain geometric measures: particle volume, surface area, mean curvature and the second quermassintegral. This allows the derivation of closed-form and generic expressions for the random packing fraction of binary convex hyperparticles in Euclidean spaces R2 , R3 and R4.</description>

Abstract: We derive the asymptotic behavior of the radial distribution function $g(x)$ for one-dimensional (1D) hard-rod systems and related quasi-one-dimensional geometries at high packing fractions using Laplace transform techniques and pole analysis. By identifying the poles and residues of the Laplace transform in the limit of small void fraction, we obtain compact representations of $g(x)$ in terms of the Jacobi elliptic theta function $\theta_3$. This formulation naturally captures the two regimes governing the oscillatory decay toward unity: an intermediate algebraic decay and a long-distance exponential decay, consistent with previous results for the Tonks gas. Our approach provides a unified framework that (i) expresses $g(x)$ in a single well-tabulated special function, (ii) links spatial correlations directly to the pole structure in complex Laplace space, offering clear physical insight into decay rates and oscillation frequencies, and (iii) generalizes straightforwardly to 1D binary mixtures and confined hard-disk systems, where direct Gaussian decompositions are cumbersome. The equivalence between the theta-function representation and the Gaussian superposition of Bouzar and Messina [Phys. Rev. E 112, L042105 (2025)] is established via the Poisson summation formula, highlighting the versatility and conceptual advantages of the Laplace-pole framework.</description>

      <title>Onsager Condensation in Chiral Active Matter: Universality of Topological Gas Dynamics</title>

Abstract: We identify a thermodynamic phase transition in chiral active matter. Low-frequency disorder triggers global synchronisation and energy dissipation, while high disorder activates a topological heat pump, generating an inverse energy cascade. This drives the system towards an Onsager dipole, which can be arrested into a metastable vortex glass if dispersion is insufficient to overcome the defect lattice. We propose topological gas dynamics as a universality class governed by the interplay of active disorder and topological sorting, unifying active swarms and classical inviscid fluids.</description>
