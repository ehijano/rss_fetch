      <title>Accelerating the Fusion Workforce</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fusion energy research and development landscape has seen significant advances in recent years, with important scientific and technological breakthroughs and a rapid rise of investment in the private sector. The workforce needs of the nascent fusion industry are growing at a rate that academic workforce development programs are not currently able to match. This paper presents the findings of the Workforce Accelerator for Fusion Energy Development Conference held in Hampton, Virginia, United States of America (USA), on May 29-30 2024, which was funded by the US National Science Foundation (NSF). A major goal of the conference was to focus on bringing public and private stakeholders together to identify opportunities for partnership in fusion research and education with the goal of meeting the needs for a talented and diverse workforce. Representatives from industry, academia, and national laboratories participated in the conference through the preparation of white papers, presentations, and group discussions, and the production of recommendations to address the challenges facing the US fusion workforce.</description>

      <title>Refreshing idea on Fourier analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03514v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The "theoretical limit of time-frequency resolution in Fourier analysis" is thought to originate in certain mathematical and/or physical limitations. This, however, is not true. The actual origin arises from the numerical (technical) method deployed to reduce computation time. In addition, there is a gap between the theoretical equation for Fourier analysis and its numerical implementation. Knowing the facts brings us practical benefits. In this case, these related to boundary conditions, and complex integrals. For example, replacing a Fourier integral with a complex integral brings a hybrid method for the Laplace and Fourier transforms, and reveals another perspective on time-frequency analysis. We present such a perspective here with a simple demonstrative analysis.</description>

      <title>Ukrainian contribution to particle physics: historical perspective and prospects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many world-known scientists and engineers like G. Breit, G. Budker, G. Charpak, G. Gamow, M. Goldhaber, A. Ioffe, S. Korolyov, E. Lifshitz, M. Ostrogradsky, S. Timoshenko, V. Veksler were born in Ukraine, while some, like L. Landau and M. Bogolyubov, started their career there. Reclaiming their scientific legacy as well as that of many others helps to promote Ukrainian contributions to particle physics both inside and outside of Ukraine and to motivate the next generation of Ukrainian scientists in the time of war. We will present the status of Ukrainian scientific infrastructure two years after the start of the full-scale invasion and past, present and expected future contributions of Ukrainian scientists to CERN.</description>

      <title>Spanish heat waves curb discretionary mobility and alter work behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extreme heat is a growing problem in European countries, with rising temperatures especially affecting aging populations. While research has documented how high temperatures affect individual decisions in cities - such as consumer spending and pedestrian behavior - less is known about how these decisions vary across demographic groups or how they aggregate to reshape mobility networks. Using open human mobility data derived from both passive and active connections to mobile networks, we examine the effects of extreme heat on mobility patterns in Spain, stratifying the data by age, gender, socioeconomic class, and activity. Our findings reveal that activity falls by as much as 10% on hot days generally and as much as 20% during hot afternoons specifically, when temperatures are highest. Individuals reduce infrequent activities most, frequent activities less so, and rarely miss work. Furthermore, significant demographic differences emerge on hot days. Older adults are more likely to avoid work-related travel and cut back substantially on other activities, while those earning less are less able to reduce work-related mobility, highlighting socioeconomic disparities. Our results show evidence that extreme heat not only disrupts mobility but exacerbates intergroup differences, disproportionately affecting the most vulnerable groups.</description>

      <title>Fractional modelling of COVID-19 transmission incorporating asymptomatic and super-spreader individuals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic has presented unprecedented challenges worldwide, necessitating effective modelling approaches to understand and control its transmission dynamics. In this study, we propose a novel approach that integrates asymptomatic and super-spreader individuals in a single compartmental model. We highlight the advantages of utilizing incommensurate fractional order derivatives in ordinary differential equations, including increased flexibility in capturing disease dynamics and refined memory effects in the transmission process. We conduct a qualitative analysis of our proposed model, which involves determining the basic reproduction number and analysing the disease-free equilibrium's stability. By fitting the proposed model with real data from Portugal and comparing it with existing models, we demonstrate that the incorporation of supplementary population classes and fractional derivatives significantly improves the model's goodness of fit. Sensitivity analysis further provides valuable insights for designing effective strategies to mitigate the spread of the virus.</description>

      <title>A Novel Approach to Real-Time Short-Term Traffic Prediction based on Distributed Fiber-Optic Sensing and Data Assimilation with a Stochastic Cell-Automata Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03628v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper demonstrates real-time short-term traffic flow prediction through distributed fiber-optic sensing (DFOS) and data assimilation with a stochastic cell-automata-based traffic model. Traffic congestion on expressways is a severe issue. To alleviate its negative impacts, it is necessary to optimize traffic flow prior to becoming serious congestion. For this purpose, real-time short-term traffic flow prediction is promising. However, conventional traffic monitoring apparatus used in prediction methods faces a technical issue due to the sparsity in traffic flow data. To overcome the issue for realizing real-time traffic prediction, this paper employs DFOS, which enables to obtain spatially continuous and real-time traffic flow data along the road without dead zones. Using mean velocities derived from DFOS data as a feature extraction, this paper proposes a real-time data assimilation method for the short-term prediction. As the theoretical model, the stochastic Nishinari-Fukui-Schadschneider model is adopted. Future traffic flow is simulated with the optimal values of model parameters estimated from observed mean velocities and the initial condition estimated as the latest microscopic traffic state. This concept is validated using two congestion scenarios obtained in Japanese expressways. The results show that the mean absolute error of the predicted mean velocities is 10-15 km/h in the prediction horizon of 30 minutes. Furthermore, the prediction error in congestion length and travel time decreases by 40-84% depending on congestion scenarios when compared with conventional methods with traffic counters. This paper concludes that real-time data assimilation using DFOS enables an accurate short-term traffic prediction.</description>

      <title>Estimates of the reproduction ratio from epidemic surveillance may be biased in spatially structured populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.13798v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate estimates of the reproduction ratio are crucial to project infectious disease epidemic evolution and guide public health response. Here, we prove that estimates of the reproduction ratio based on inference from surveillance data can be inaccurate if the population comprises spatially distinct communities, as the space-mobility interplay may hide the true epidemic evolution from surveillance data. Consequently, surveillance may underestimate the reproduction ratio over long periods, even mistaking growing epidemics as subsiding. To address this, we use the spectral properties of the matrix describing the spatial epidemic spread to reweigh surveillance data. We propose a correction that removes the bias across all epidemic phases. We validate this correction against simulated epidemics and use COVID-19 as a case study. However, our results apply to any epidemic where mobility is a driver of circulation. Our findings will help improve epidemic monitoring and surveillance and inform strategies for public health response.</description>

      <title>Deep Overlapping Community Search via Subspace Embedding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14692v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Overlapping Community Search (OCS) identifies nodes that interact with multiple communities based on a specified query. Existing community search approaches fall into two categories: algorithm-based models and Machine Learning-based (ML) models. Despite the long-standing focus on this topic within the database domain, current solutions face two major limitations: 1) Both approaches fail to address personalized user requirements in OCS, consistently returning the same set of nodes for a given query regardless of user differences. 2) Existing ML-based CS models suffer from severe training efficiency issues. In this paper, we formally redefine the problem of OCS. By analyzing the gaps in both types of approaches, we then propose a general solution for OCS named Sparse Subspace Filter (SSF), which can extend any ML-based CS model to enable personalized search in overlapping structures. To overcome the efficiency issue in the current models, we introduce Simplified Multi-hop Attention Networks (SMN), a lightweight yet effective community search model with larger receptive fields. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first ML-based study of overlapping community search. Extensive experiments validate the superior performance of SMN within the SSF pipeline, achieving a 13.73% improvement in F1-Score and up to 3 orders of magnitude acceleration in model efficiency compared to state-of-the-art approaches.</description>
