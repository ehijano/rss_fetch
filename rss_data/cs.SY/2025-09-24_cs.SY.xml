      <title>Stochastic Economic Dispatch with Battery Energy Storage considering Wind and Load Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the integration of renewable energy resources in power systems, managing operational flexibility and reliability while minimizing operational costs has become increasingly challenging. Battery energy storage system (BESS) offers a promising solution to address these issues. This paper presents a stochastic dynamic economic dispatch with storage (SDED-S) framework to assess the impact of BESS in managing uncertainty. The temporal correlation between wind and load uncertainties is captured, with scenarios generated using a method inspired by stratified and importance sampling. The proposed approach is demonstrated on a modified IEEE 39-bus system, where selected conventional generators are converted to wind power plants. Case studies show that strategic BESS deployment significantly improves system flexibility by reducing renewable curtailments and dispatch costs. Renewable energy curtailments decrease upon increasing BESS size and approach zero depending on wind penetration level. Higher wind penetrations result in greater curtailments without storage and yield larger cost savings when BESS is deployed, highlighting the growing need for flexibility as renewable energy penetrations increase.</description>

      <title>Reversible Kalman Filter for state estimation with Manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work introduces an algorithm for state estimation on manifolds within the framework of the Kalman filter. Its primary objective is to provide a methodology enabling the evaluation of the precision of existing Kalman filter variants with arbitrary accuracy on synthetic data, something that, to the best of our knowledge, has not been addressed in prior work. To this end, we develop a new filter that exhibits favorable numerical properties, thereby correcting the divergences observed in previous Kalman filter variants. In this formulation, the achievable precision is no longer constrained by the small-velocity assumption and is determined solely by sensor noise. In addition, this new filter assumes high precision on the sensors, which, in real scenarios require a detection step that we define heuristically, allowing one to extend this approach to scenarios, using either a 9-axis IMU or a combination of odometry, accelerometer, and pressure sensors. The latter configuration is designed for the reconstruction of trajectories in underwater environments.</description>

      <title>Fully Distributed State Estimation for Multi-agent Systems and its Application in Cooperative Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the distributed state estimation problem for a continuous-time linear multi-agent system (MAS) composed of $\mathit{m}$ agents and monitored by the agents themselves. To address this problem, we propose a distributed observer that enables each agent to reconstruct the state of the MAS. The main idea is to let each agent $\mathit{i}$ recover the state of agent $\mathit{j}$ by using leader-follower consensus rules to track agent $\mathit{j}$'s state estimate, which is generated by agent $\mathit{j}$ itself using a Luenberger-like estimation rule. Under the assumptions of node-level observability and topological ordering consistency, we show that the estimation error dynamics are stabilizable if and only if the communication graph is strongly connected. Moreover, we discuss the fully distributed design of the proposed observer, assuming that the agents only know basic MAS configuration information, such as the homogeneity and the maximum number of allowable agents. This design ensures that the proposed observer functions correctly when agents are added or removed. Building on this, we consider cooperative localization as a distributed estimation problem and develop two fully distributed localization algorithms that allow agents to track their own and other agents' positions (and velocities) within the MAS. Finally, we conduct simulations to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed theoretical results.</description>

      <title>On the Dynamics of Acceleration in First order Gradient Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ever since the original algorithm by Nesterov (1983), the true nature of the acceleration phenomenon has remained elusive, with various interpretations of why the method is actually faster. The diagnosis of the algorithm through the lens of Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) and the corresponding dynamical system formulation to explain the underlying dynamics has a rich history. In the literature, the ODEs that explain algorithms are typically derived by considering the limiting case of the algorithm maps themselves, that is, an ODE formulation follows the development of an algorithm. This obfuscates the underlying higher order principles and thus provides little evidence of the working of the algorithm. Such has been the case with Nesterov algorithm and the various analogies used to describe the acceleration phenomena, viz, momentum associated with the rolling of a Heavy-Ball down a slope, Hessian damping etc. The main focus of our work is to ideate the genesis of the Nesterov algorithm from the viewpoint of dynamical systems leading to demystifying the mathematical rigour behind the algorithm. Instead of reverse engineering ODEs from discrete algorithms, this work explores tools from the recently developed control paradigm titled Passivity and Immersion approach and the Geometric Singular Perturbation theory which are applied to arrive at the formulation of a dynamical system that explains and models the acceleration phenomena. This perspective helps to gain insights into the various terms present and the sequence of steps used in Nesterovs accelerated algorithm for the smooth strongly convex and the convex case. The framework can also be extended to derive the acceleration achieved using the triple momentum method and provides justifications for the non-convergence to the optimal solution in the Heavy-Ball method.</description>

      <title>Optimal Service Mode Assignment in a Simple Computation Offloading System: Extended Version</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a simple computation offloading model where jobs can either be fully processed in the cloud or be partially processed at a local server before being sent to the cloud to complete processing. Our goal is to design a policy for assigning jobs to service modes, i.e., full offloading or partial offloading, based on the state of the system, in order to minimize delay in the system. We show that when the cloud server is idle, the optimal policy is to assign the next job in the system queue to the cloud for processing. However, when the cloud server is busy, we show that, under mild assumptions, the optimal policy is of a threshold type, that sends the next job in the system queue to the local server if the queue exceeds a certain threshold. Finally, we demonstrate this policy structure through simulations.</description>

      <title>Policy Gradient with Self-Attention for Model-Free Distributed Nonlinear Multi-Agent Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-agent games in dynamic nonlinear settings are challenging due to the time-varying interactions among the agents and the non-stationarity of the (potential) Nash equilibria. In this paper we consider model-free games, where agent transitions and costs are observed without knowledge of the transition and cost functions that generate them. We propose a policy gradient approach to learn distributed policies that follow the communication structure in multi-team games, with multiple agents per team. Our formulation is inspired by the structure of distributed policies in linear quadratic games, which take the form of time-varying linear feedback gains. In the nonlinear case, we model the policies as nonlinear feedback gains, parameterized by self-attention layers to account for the time-varying multi-agent communication topology. We demonstrate that our distributed policy gradient approach achieves strong performance in several settings, including distributed linear and nonlinear regulation, and simulated and real multi-robot pursuit-and-evasion games.</description>

      <title>Compositional System Dynamics: The Higher Mathematics Underlying System Dynamics Diagrams &amp; Practice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work establishes a robust mathematical foundation for compositional System Dynamics modeling, leveraging category theory to formalize and enhance the representation, analysis, and composition of system models. Here, System Dynamics diagrams, such as stock &amp; flow diagrams, system structure diagrams, and causal loop diagrams, are formulated as categorical constructs, enabling scalable, transparent, and systematic reasoning. By encoding these diagrams as data using attributed C-sets and utilizing advanced categorical tools like structured cospans, pushouts, pullbacks, and functor mappings, the framework supports modular composition, stratification, and seamless mapping between syntax and semantics.
  The approach underwrites traditional practice with firm mathematical structure, facilitates the identification of certain forms of pathways and feedback loops, the detection of simple patterns within complex diagrams, common structure between diagrams, and structure-preserving mappings between diverse diagram types. Additionally, this framework supports alternative semantics, such as stochastic transition dynamics, extending beyond traditional ordinary differential equation (ODE) representations. Applications in compositional modeling, modularity, and team-based collaboration demonstrate the practical advantages of this advanced framework.
  Future directions include integrating dimensional annotations, supporting hybrid and agent-based modeling paradigms, and expanding the framework's applicability to global and local temporal reasoning through temporal sheaves. By revealing and formalizing the hidden mathematical structure of System Dynamics diagrams, this work empowers practitioners to tackle complex systems with clarity, scalability, and rigor.</description>

      <title>Refined Barrier Conditions for Finite-Time Safety and Reach-Avoid Guarantees in Stochastic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Providing finite-time probabilistic safety and reach-avoid guarantees is crucial for safety-critical stochastic systems. Existing barrier certificate methods often rely on a restrictive boundedness assumption for auxiliary functions, limiting their applicability. This paper presents refined barrier-like conditions that remove this assumption. Specifically, we establish conditions for deriving upper bounds on finite-time safety probabilities in discrete-time systems and lower bounds on finite-time reach-avoid probabilities in continuous-time systems. This key relaxation significantly expands the class of verifiable systems, especially those with unbounded state spaces, and facilitates the application of advanced optimization techniques, such as semi-definite programming with polynomial functions. The efficacy of our approach is validated through numerical examples.</description>

      <title>AI Agent Access (A\^3) Network: An Embodied, Communication-Aware Multi-Agent Framework for 6G Coverage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The vision of 6G communication demands autonomous and resilient networking in environments without fixed infrastructure. Yet most multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approaches focus on isolated stages - exploration, relay formation, or access - under static deployments and centralized control, limiting adaptability. We propose the AI Agent Access (A\^3) Network, a unified, embodied intelligence-driven framework that transforms multi-agent networking into a dynamic, decentralized, and end-to-end system. Unlike prior schemes, the A\^3 Network integrates exploration, target user access, and backhaul maintenance within a single learning process, while supporting on-demand agent addition during runtime. Its decentralized policies ensure that even a single agent can operate independently with limited observations, while coordinated agents achieve scalable, communication-optimized coverage. By embedding link-level communication metrics into actor-critic learning, the A\^3 Network couples topology formation with robust decision-making. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the A\^3 Network not only balances exploration and communication efficiency but also delivers system-level adaptability absent in existing MARL frameworks, offering a new paradigm for 6G multi-agent networks.</description>

      <title>Interaction-aware Lane-Changing Early Warning System in Congested Traffic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lane changes (LCs) in congested traffic are complex, multi-vehicle interactive events that pose significant safety concerns. Providing early warnings can enable more proactive driver assistance system and support more informed decision-making for drivers under LCs. This paper presents an interaction-aware Lane-Changing Early Warning (LCEW) system designed to issue reliable early warning signals based on future trajectory predictions. We first investigate the stochastic nature of LCs, characterized by (i) variable-size multi-vehicle interactions and (ii) the direct and indirect risks resulting from these interactions. To model these stochastic interactions, a Social Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Neural Network framework informed by mutual information (STGCNN-MI) is introduced to predict multi-vehicle trajectories. By leveraging a MI-based adjacency matrix, the framework enhances trajectory prediction accuracy while providing interpretable representations of vehicle interactions. Then, potential collisions between the LC vehicle and adjacent vehicles (direct risks) or among the non-adjacent vehicles (indirect risks) are identified using oriented bounding box detection applied to the predicted trajectories. Finally, a warning signal is generated to inform the LC driver of location of potential collisions within the predicted time window. Traffic simulation experiments conducted in SUMO demonstrate that the proposed interaction-aware LCEW improves both vehicle-level safety and overall traffic efficiency, while also promoting more natural behavioral adaptation.</description>

      <title>Dual Iterative Learning Control for Multiple-Input Multiple-Output Dynamics with Validation in Robotic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solving motion tasks autonomously and accurately is a core ability for intelligent real-world systems. To achieve genuine autonomy across multiple systems and tasks, key challenges include coping with unknown dynamics and overcoming the need for manual parameter tuning, which is especially crucial in complex Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) systems.
  This paper presents MIMO Dual Iterative Learning Control (DILC), a novel data-driven iterative learning scheme for simultaneous tracking control and model learning, without requiring any prior system knowledge or manual parameter tuning. The method is designed for repetitive MIMO systems and integrates seamlessly with established iterative learning control methods. We provide monotonic convergence conditions for both reference tracking error and model error in linear time-invariant systems.
  The DILC scheme -- rapidly and autonomously -- solves various motion tasks in high-fidelity simulations of an industrial robot and in multiple nonlinear real-world MIMO systems, without requiring model knowledge or manually tuning the algorithm. In our experiments, many reference tracking tasks are solved within 10-20 trials, and even complex motions are learned in less than 100 iterations. We believe that, because of its rapid and autonomous learning capabilities, DILC has the potential to serve as an efficient building block within complex learning frameworks for intelligent real-world systems.</description>

      <title>An Extended Kalman Filter for Systems with Infinite-Dimensional Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article examines state estimation in discrete-time nonlinear stochastic systems with finite-dimensional states and infinite-dimensional measurements, motivated by real-world applications such as vision-based localization and tracking. We develop an extended Kalman filter (EKF) for real-time state estimation, with the measurement noise modeled as an infinite-dimensional random field. When applied to vision-based state estimation, the measurement Jacobians required to implement the EKF are shown to correspond to image gradients. This result provides a novel system-theoretic justification for the use of image gradients as features for vision-based state estimation, contrasting with their (often heuristic) introduction in many computer-vision pipelines. We demonstrate the practical utility of the EKF on a public real-world dataset involving the localization of an aerial drone using video from a downward-facing monocular camera. The EKF is shown to outperform VINS-MONO, an established visual-inertial odometry algorithm, in some cases achieving mean squared error reductions of up to an order of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Integration of Concentrated Solar Power Plants in Renewable-Only VPP with Electrical and Thermal Demands: A Two-Stage Robust Bidding Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes the integration of Concentrated Solar Power Plant (CSP) in the Renewable-only virtual power plant (RVPP) for bidding in the electricity day-ahead and secondary reserve markets, as well as trading thermal energy through a heat purchase agreement. A reformulated two-stage robust optimization approach is introduced to account for multiple uncertainties, including electricity prices, non-dispatchable renewable energy sources electrical production, CSP thermal production, and uncertainties in electrical and thermal demand consumption. The provision of energy and reserve by the thermal storage of CSP is modeled using an adjustable approach, which allocates a share of energy for up and down reserves based on the profitability of the RVPP. Simulations are conducted for several case studies to demonstrate the effectiveness and computational efficiency of the proposed approach under different RVPP operator decisions against uncertain parameters and various trading strategies for electricity and thermal energy. The simulation results show that integrating CSP into RVPP enhances RVPP flexibility for both electrical and thermal trading. Furthermore, the results indicate that the profitability of the RVPP increases when all trading options are considered, across different levels of conservatism adopted by the RVPP operator in response to uncertain parameters.</description>

      <title>Frequency-Varying Optimization: A Control Framework for New Dynamic Frequency Response Services</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To address the variability of renewable generation, initiatives have been launched globally to provide faster and more effective frequency responses. In the UK, the National Energy System Operator (NESO) has introduced a suite of three new dynamic services, where aggregation of assets is expected to play a key role. For an Aggregated Response Unit (ARU), the required level of frequency response varies with grid frequency, resulting in a frequency-varying equality constraint that assets should meet collectively. We show that the optimal coordination of an ARU constitutes a Frequency-Varying Optimization (FVO) problem, in which the optimal trajectory for each asset evolves dynamically. To facilitate online optimization, we reformulate the FVO problem into Tracking of the Optimal Trajectory (TOT) problems, with algorithms proposed for two scenarios: one where the asset dynamics are negligible, and another where they must be accounted for. Under reasonable conditions, the ARU converges to the optimal trajectory within a fixed time, and within the maximum delivery time requested by NESO. The proposed framework can be readily distributed to coordinate a large number of assets. Numerical results verify the effectiveness and scalability of the proposed control framework.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Override Control under High-Relative-Degree Nonovershooting Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers the problem of adaptively overriding unsafe actions of a nominal controller in the presence of high-relative-degree nonovershooting constraints and parametric uncertainties. To prevent the design from being coupled with high-order derivatives of the parameter estimation error, we adopt a modular design approach in which the controller and the parameter identifier are designed separately. The controller module ensures that any safety violations caused by parametric uncertainties remain bounded, provided that the parameter estimation error and its first-order derivative are either bounded or square-integrable. The identifier module, in turn, guarantees that these requirements on the parameter estimation error are satisfied. Both theoretical analysis and simulation results demonstrate that the closed-loop safety violation is bounded by a tunable function of the initial estimation error. Moreover, as time increases, the parameter estimate converges to the true value, and the amount of safety violation decreases accordingly.</description>

      <title>A Weighted Least Squares Error Hetero-functional Graph State Estimator of the American Multi-modal Energy System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As one of the most pressing challenges of the 21st century, global climate change demands a host of changes across at least four critical energy infrastructures: the electric grid, the natural gas system, the oil system, and the coal system. In the context of the United States, this paper refers to this system-of-systems as ``The American Multi-Modal Energy System (AMES)". These combined changes necessitate an understanding of the AMES interdependencies, both structurally and behaviorally, to develop and enact effective policies. This work focuses on behavioral analysis methods to provide examples of how to analyze system behavior and the critical matter and energy flows through the system. Building upon past works, two regions of the AMES are modeled, and their behavior is analyzed using Hetero-functional Graph Theory (HFGT). More specifically, the work presents a weighted least square error state estimation model of the AMES. State estimation has played a major role in the operation and development of the American Electric Power System. This work extends the state estimation analysis beyond the single-operand electric grid environment into the heterogeneous environment of the AMES. Employing a data-driven and model-based systems engineering approach in combination with HFGT, a Weighted Least Squares Error Hetero-functional Graph State Estimation (WLSEHFGSE) optimization program is developed to estimate the optimal flows of mass and energy through the AMES. This work is the first to integrate state estimation methods with HFGT. Furthermore, it demonstrates how such a WLSEHFGSE recovers the mass and energy flows in a system-of-systems like the AMES with asset-level granularity.</description>

      <title>MAPPO for Edge Server Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19079v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a goal-oriented communication problem for edge server monitoring, where jobs arrive intermittently at multiple dispatchers and must be assigned to shared edge servers with finite queues and time-varying availability. Accurate knowledge of server status is critical for sustaining high throughput, yet remains challenging under dynamic workloads and partial observability. To address this challenge, each dispatcher maintains server knowledge through two complementary mechanisms: (i) active status queries that provide instantaneous updates at a communication cost, and (ii) job execution feedback that reveals server conditions opportunistically. We formulate a cooperative multi-agent distributed decision-making problem in which dispatchers jointly optimize query scheduling to balance throughput against communication overhead. To solve this problem, we propose a Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (MAPPO)-based algorithm that leverages centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE) to learn distributed query-and-dispatch policies under partial and stale observations. Numerical evaluations show that MAPPO achieves superior throughput-cost tradeoffs and significantly outperforms baseline strategies, achieving on average a 30% improvement over the closest baseline.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.19107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research presents a smart urinary health monitoring system incorporating a coplanar waveguide (CPW)-fed slot-loop antenna biosensor designed to analyse various urine samples. The antenna demonstrates distinct resonant frequency shifts when exposed to five specific urine conditions, deviating from its baseline 1.42 GHz operation. These measurable frequency variations enable the antenna to function as an effective microwave sensor for urinary biomarker detection. A potential artificial intelligence-based Convolutional Neural Networks Long Short-Term Memory (CNN-LSTM) framework is also discussed to overcome the limitations of overlapping frequency responses, aiming to improve the accuracy of health condition detection. These components contribute to the development of a smart toilet system that displays real-time health information on a wall-mounted urinal screen, without requiring any user effort or behavioural change.</description>

      <title>A Fast Initialization Method for Neural Network Controllers: A Case Study of Image-based Visual Servoing Control for the multicopter Interception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning-based controller design methods often require substantial data in the initial training phase. Moreover, the training process tends to exhibit strong randomness and slow convergence. It often requires considerable time or high computational resources. Another class of learning-based method incorporates Lyapunov stability theory to obtain a control policy with stability guarantees. However, these methods generally require an initially stable neural network control policy at the beginning of training. Evidently, a stable neural network controller can not only serve as an initial policy for reinforcement learning, allowing the training to focus on improving controller performance, but also act as an initial state for learning-based Lyapunov control methods. Although stable controllers can be designed using traditional control theory, designers still need to have a great deal of control design knowledge to address increasingly complicated control problems. The proposed neural network rapid initialization method in this paper achieves the initial training of the neural network control policy by constructing datasets that conform to the stability conditions based on the system model. Furthermore, using the image-based visual servoing control for multicopter interception as a case study, simulations and experiments were conducted to validate the effectiveness and practical performance of the proposed method. In the experiment, the trained control policy attains a final interception velocity of 15 m/s.</description>

      <title>Robust Synchronous Reference Frame Phase-Looked Loop (PLL) with Feed-Forward Frequency Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synchronous reference frame phase-looked loop (SRF-PLL) techniques are widely used for interfacing and control applications in the power systems and energy conversion at large. Since a PLL system synchronizes its output with an exogenous harmonic signal, often 3-phases voltage or current, the locking of the frequency and phase angle depends on the performance of the feedback loop with at least two integrator terms, and on the distortions of the measured input quantities. For the conventional SRF-PLL with a proportional-integral (PI) control in feedback, we are providing a robust design which maximizes the phase margin and uses the normalization scheme for yielding the loop insensitive to the input amplitude variations. The main improvement in the transient behavior and also in tracking of frequency ramps is achieved by using the robust feed-forward frequency estimator, which is model-free and suitable for the noisy and time-varying harmonic signals. The proposed feed-forward-feedback SRF-PLL scheme is experimentally evaluated on the 3-phases harmonic currents from standard PMSM drives with varying angular speeds and loads. Both, the tracked angular frequency and locked phase angle are assessed as performance metrics of the robust SRF-PLL scheme with feedforwarding.</description>

      <title>Watts and Drops: Co-Scheduling Power and Water in Desalination Plants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a mathematical framework to jointly schedule water and electricity in a profit-maximizing renewable colocated water desalination plant that integrates both thermal and membrane based technologies. The price-taking desalination plant sells desalinated water to a water utility at a given price and engages in bidirectional electricity transactions with the grid, purchasing or selling power based on its net electricity demand. We show that the optimal scheduling policy depends on the plant's internal renewable generation and follows a simple threshold structure. Under the optimal policy, thermal based water output decreases monotonically with renewable output, while membrane based water output increases monotonically. We characterize the structure and intuition behind the threshold policy and examine key special properties.</description>

      <title>Policy Gradient Bounds in Multitask LQR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the performance of policy gradient in multitask linear quadratic regulation (LQR), where the system and cost parameters differ across tasks. The main goal of multitask LQR is to find a controller with satisfactory performance on every task. Prior analyses on relevant contexts fail to capture closed-loop task similarities, resulting in conservative performance guarantees. To account for such similarities, we propose bisimulation-based measures of task heterogeneity. Our measures employ new bisimulation functions to bound the cost gradient distance between a pair of tasks in closed loop with a common stabilizing controller. Employing these measures, we derive suboptimality bounds for both the multitask optimal controller and the asymptotic policy gradient controller with respect to each of the tasks. We further provide conditions under which the policy gradient iterates remain stabilizing for every system. For multiple random sets of certain tasks, we observe that our bisimulation-based measures improve upon baseline measures of task heterogeneity dramatically.</description>

      <title>A Counterfactual Reasoning Framework for Fault Diagnosis in Robot Perception Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18460v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Perception systems provide a rich understanding of the environment for autonomous systems, shaping decisions in all downstream modules. Hence, accurate detection and isolation of faults in perception systems is important. Faults in perception systems pose particular challenges: faults are often tied to the perceptual context of the environment, and errors in their multi-stage pipelines can propagate across modules. To address this, we adopt a counterfactual reasoning approach to propose a framework for fault detection and isolation (FDI) in perception systems. As opposed to relying on physical redundancy (i.e., having extra sensors), our approach utilizes analytical redundancy with counterfactual reasoning to construct perception reliability tests as causal outcomes influenced by system states and fault scenarios. Counterfactual reasoning generates reliability test results under hypothesized faults to update the belief over fault hypotheses. We derive both passive and active FDI methods. While the passive FDI can be achieved by belief updates, the active FDI approach is defined as a causal bandit problem, where we utilize Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with upper confidence bound (UCB) to find control inputs that maximize a detection and isolation metric, designated as Effective Information (EI). The mentioned metric quantifies the informativeness of control inputs for FDI. We demonstrate the approach in a robot exploration scenario, where a space robot performing vision-based navigation actively adjusts its attitude to increase EI and correctly isolate faults caused by sensor damage, dynamic scenes, and perceptual degradation.</description>

      <title>VLN-Zero: Rapid Exploration and Cache-Enabled Neurosymbolic Vision-Language Planning for Zero-Shot Transfer in Robot Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18592v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rapid adaptation in unseen environments is essential for scalable real-world autonomy, yet existing approaches rely on exhaustive exploration or rigid navigation policies that fail to generalize. We present VLN-Zero, a two-phase vision-language navigation framework that leverages vision-language models to efficiently construct symbolic scene graphs and enable zero-shot neurosymbolic navigation. In the exploration phase, structured prompts guide VLM-based search toward informative and diverse trajectories, yielding compact scene graph representations. In the deployment phase, a neurosymbolic planner reasons over the scene graph and environmental observations to generate executable plans, while a cache-enabled execution module accelerates adaptation by reusing previously computed task-location trajectories. By combining rapid exploration, symbolic reasoning, and cache-enabled execution, the proposed framework overcomes the computational inefficiency and poor generalization of prior vision-language navigation methods, enabling robust and scalable decision-making in unseen environments. VLN-Zero achieves 2x higher success rate compared to state-of-the-art zero-shot models, outperforms most fine-tuned baselines, and reaches goal locations in half the time with 55% fewer VLM calls on average compared to state-of-the-art models across diverse environments. Codebase, datasets, and videos for VLN-Zero are available at: https://vln-zero.github.io/.</description>

      <title>Distributionally Robust Safe Motion Planning with Contextual Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a distributionally robust approach for collision avoidance by incorporating contextual information. Specifically, we embed the conditional distribution of future trajectory of the obstacle conditioned on the motion of the ego agent in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) via the conditional kernel mean embedding operator. Then, we define an ambiguity set containing all distributions whose embedding in the RKHS is within a certain distance from the empirical estimate of conditional mean embedding learnt from past data. Consequently, a distributionally robust collision avoidance constraint is formulated, and included in the receding horizon based motion planning formulation of the ego agent. Simulation results show that the proposed approach is more successful in avoiding collision compared to approaches that do not include contextual information and/or distributional robustness in their formulation in several challenging scenarios.</description>

      <title>3D Flow Diffusion Policy: Visuomotor Policy Learning via Generating Flow in 3D Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning robust visuomotor policies that generalize across diverse objects and interaction dynamics remains a central challenge in robotic manipulation. Most existing approaches rely on direct observation-to-action mappings or compress perceptual inputs into global or object-centric features, which often overlook localized motion cues critical for precise and contact-rich manipulation. We present 3D Flow Diffusion Policy (3D FDP), a novel framework that leverages scene-level 3D flow as a structured intermediate representation to capture fine-grained local motion cues. Our approach predicts the temporal trajectories of sampled query points and conditions action generation on these interaction-aware flows, implemented jointly within a unified diffusion architecture. This design grounds manipulation in localized dynamics while enabling the policy to reason about broader scene-level consequences of actions. Extensive experiments on the MetaWorld benchmark show that 3D FDP achieves state-of-the-art performance across 50 tasks, particularly excelling on medium and hard settings. Beyond simulation, we validate our method on eight real-robot tasks, where it consistently outperforms prior baselines in contact-rich and non-prehensile scenarios. These results highlight 3D flow as a powerful structural prior for learning generalizable visuomotor policies, supporting the development of more robust and versatile robotic manipulation.

      <title>Verification and Synthesis of Discrete-Time Control Barrier Functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.18685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Discrete-time Control Barrier Functions (DTCBFs) have recently attracted interest for guaranteeing safety and synthesizing safe controllers for discrete-time dynamical systems. This paper addresses the open challenges of verifying candidate DTCBFs and synthesizing DTCBFs for general nonlinear discrete-time systems with input constraints and arbitrary safe sets. In particular, we propose a branch-and-bound method, inspired by the $\alpha$BB algorithm, for the verification of candidate DTCBFs in both cases, whether a corresponding control policy is known or unknown. We prove that this method, in a finite number of iterations, either verifies a given candidate function as a valid DTCBF or falsifies it by providing a counterexample (within predefined tolerances). As a second main contribution, we propose a novel bilevel optimization approach to synthesize a DTCBF and a corresponding control policy in finite time. This involves determining the unknown coefficients of a parameterized DTCBF and a parameterized control policy. Furthermore, we introduce various strategies to reduce the computational burden of the bilevel approach. We also demonstrate our methods using numerical case studies.</description>

      <title>Guaranteed Robust Nonlinear MPC via Disturbance Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18760v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robots must satisfy safety-critical state and input constraints despite disturbances and model mismatch. We introduce a robust model predictive control (RMPC) formulation that is fast, scalable, and compatible with real-time implementation. Our formulation guarantees robust constraint satisfaction, input-to-state stability (ISS) and recursive feasibility. The key idea is to decompose the uncertain nonlinear system into (i) a nominal nonlinear dynamic model, (ii) disturbance-feedback controllers, and (iii) bounds on the model error. These components are optimized jointly using sequential convex programming. The resulting convex subproblems are solved efficiently using a recent disturbance-feedback MPC solver. The approach is validated across multiple dynamics, including a rocket-landing problem with steerable thrust. An open-source implementation is available at https://github.com/antoineleeman/robust-nonlinear-mpc.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18825v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider nonlinear control systems subject to bounded disturbances and to both state and input constraints. We introduce the definition of robust admissible set - the set of all initial states from which the state and input constraints can be satisfied for all times against all admissible disturbances. We focus on its boundary that can be decomposed into the usable part on the state constraint boundary and the barrier, interior to the state constraints. We show that, at the intersection of these two components, the boundary of the admissible set must be tangent to the state constraints and separate the interior of the robust admissible set and its complement. Moreover, we prove that the barrier must satisfy a saddle-point principle on a Hamiltonian, in the spirit of Pontryagin's maximum principle, thus providing a direct computational tool. Lastly, we illustrate our results by calculating the robust admissible set for an adaptive cruise control example.</description>

      <title>Proactive-reactive detection and mitigation of intermittent faults in robot swarms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19246v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intermittent faults are transient errors that sporadically appear and disappear. Although intermittent faults pose substantial challenges to reliability and coordination, existing studies of fault tolerance in robot swarms focus instead on permanent faults. One reason for this is that intermittent faults are prohibitively difficult to detect in the fully self-organized ad-hoc networks typical of robot swarms, as their network topologies are transient and often unpredictable. However, in the recently introduced self-organizing nervous systems (SoNS) approach, robot swarms are able to self-organize persistent network structures for the first time, easing the problem of detecting intermittent faults. To address intermittent faults in robot swarms that have persistent networks, we propose a novel proactive-reactive strategy to detection and mitigation, based on self-organized backup layers and distributed consensus in a multiplex network. Proactively, the robots self-organize dynamic backup paths before faults occur, adapting to changes in the primary network topology and the robots' relative positions. Reactively, robots use one-shot likelihood ratio tests to compare information received along different paths in the multiplex network, enabling early fault detection. Upon detection, communication is temporarily rerouted in a self-organized way, until the detected fault resolves. We validate the approach in representative scenarios of faulty positional data occurring during formation control, demonstrating that intermittent faults are prevented from disrupting convergence to desired formations, with high fault detection accuracy and low rates of false positives.</description>

      <title>Optimization-Based Ramping Reserve Allocation of BESS for AGC Enhancement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2204.11270v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The transient behavior of Automatic Generation Control (AGC) systems is a critical aspect of power system operation. Therefore, fully extracting the potential of Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESSs) for AGC enhancement is of paramount importance. In light of the challenges posed by diverse resource interconnections and the variability associated, we propose an online optimization scheme that can adapt to changes in an unknown and variable environment. To leverage the synergy between BESSs and Conventional Generators (CGs), we devise a variant of the Area Injection Error (AIE) as a measure to quantify the ramping needs. Based on this measure, we develop a distributed optimization algorithm with adaptive learning rates for the allocation of the ramping reserve. The algorithm restores a larger learning rate for compliance with the ramping needs upon detecting a potentially destabilizing event. We demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of the proposed scheme through comprehensive case studies. It is shown that the proposed scheme can improve the transient behavior of the AGC system by bridging the gap in ramping capability.</description>

      <title>DANSE: Data-driven Non-linear State Estimation of Model-free Process in Unsupervised Learning Setup</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.03897v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address the tasks of Bayesian state estimation and forecasting for a model-free process in an unsupervised learning setup. For a model-free process, we do not have any a-priori knowledge of the process dynamics. In the article, we propose DANSE -- a Data-driven Nonlinear State Estimation method. DANSE provides a closed-form posterior of the state of the model-free process, given linear measurements of the state. In addition, it provides a closed-form posterior for forecasting. A data-driven recurrent neural network (RNN) is used in DANSE to provide the parameters of a prior of the state. The prior depends on the past measurements as input, and then we find the closed-form posterior of the state using the current measurement as input. The data-driven RNN captures the underlying non-linear dynamics of the model-free process. The training of DANSE, mainly learning the parameters of the RNN, is executed using an unsupervised learning approach. In unsupervised learning, we have access to a training dataset comprising only a set of measurement data trajectories, but we do not have any access to the state trajectories. Therefore, DANSE does not have access to state information in the training data and can not use supervised learning. Using simulated linear and non-linear process models (Lorenz attractor and Chen attractor), we evaluate the unsupervised learning-based DANSE. We show that the proposed DANSE, without knowledge of the process model and without supervised learning, provides a competitive performance against model-driven methods, such as the Kalman filter (KF), extended KF (EKF), unscented KF (UKF), a data-driven deep Markov model (DMM) and a recently proposed hybrid method called KalmanNet. In addition, we show that DANSE works for high-dimensional state estimation.</description>

      <title>The Bayesian Separation Principle for Data-driven Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16717v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate the existence of a separation principle between model identification and control design in the context of model predictive control. First, we clarify that such a separation principle holds asymptotically in the number of data in a Fisherian context, and show that it holds universally, i.e. regardless of the data size, in a Bayesian context. Then, by formulating model predictive control within a Gaussian regression framework, we describe how the Bayesian separation principle can be used to derive computable, uncertainty-aware expressions for the control cost and optimal input sequence, thereby bridging direct and indirect data-driven approaches. Numerical results in both linear and nonlinear scenarios illustrate that the proposed approach outperform nominal methods that neglect uncertainty, highlighting the advantages of incorporating uncertainty in the control design process.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08135v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper focuses on the design of H2 and H-Infinity distributed controllers with local communication and local disturbance rejection. We propose a two-step controller design procedure: (1) select closed-loop poles, then (2) optimize over parameterized controllers. Our parameterization builds on the system level synthesis (SLS) formulation -- primarily used in the discrete-time setting -- and extends it to the general continuous-time setting. We verify our approach in simulation on a 9-node grid governed by linearized swing equations, where our distributed controllers (with local communication) achieve performance comparable to that of optimal centralized controllers while facilitating local disturbance rejection.</description>

      <title>Low-pass sampling in Model Predictive Path Integral Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11717v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) control is a widely used sampling-based approach for real-time control, offering flexibility in handling arbitrary dynamics and cost functions. However, the original MPPI suffers from high-frequency noise in the sampled control trajectories, leading to actuator wear and inefficient exploration. In this work, we introduce Low-Pass Model Predictive Path Integral Control (LP-MPPI), which integrates low-pass filtering into the sampling process to eliminate detrimental high-frequency components and improve the effectiveness of the control trajectories exploration. Unlike prior approaches, LP-MPPI provides direct and interpretable control over the frequency spectrum of sampled trajectories, enhancing sampling efficiency and control smoothness. Through extensive evaluations in Gymnasium environments, simulated quadruped locomotion, and real-world F1TENTH autonomous racing, we demonstrate that LP-MPPI consistently outperforms state-of-the-art MPPI variants, achieving significant performance improvements while reducing control signal chattering.</description>

      <title>Agentic DDQN-Based Scheduling for Licensed and Unlicensed Band Allocation in Sidelink Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06775v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present an agentic double deep Q-network (DDQN) scheduler for licensed/unlicensed band allocation in New Radio (NR) sidelink (SL) networks. Beyond conventional reward-seeking reinforcement learning (RL), the agent perceives and reasons over a multi-dimensional context that jointly captures queueing delay, link quality, coexistence intensity, and switching stability. A capacity-aware, quality of service (QoS)-constrained reward aligns the agent with goal-oriented scheduling rather than static thresholding. Under constrained bandwidth, the proposed design reduces blocking by up to 87.5% versus threshold policies while preserving throughput, highlighting the value of context-driven decisions in coexistence-limited NR SL networks. The proposed scheduler is an embodied agent (E-agent) tailored for task-specific, resource-efficient operation at the network edge.</description>

      <title>Addressing Model Inaccuracies in Transmission Network Reconfiguration via Diverse Alternatives</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.17865v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ongoing energy transition places significant pressure on the transmission network due to increasing shares of renewables and electrification. To mitigate grid congestion, transmission system operators need decision support tools to suggest remedial actions, such as transmission network reconfigurations or redispatch. However, these tools are prone to model inaccuracies and may not provide relevant suggestions with regard to important unmodeled constraints or operator preferences. We propose a human-in-the-loop modeling-to-generate alternatives (HITL-MGA) approach to address these shortcomings by generating diverse topology reconfiguration alternatives. Case studies on the IEEE 57-bus and IEEE 118-bus systems show the method can leverage expert feedback and improve the quality of the suggested remedial actions.</description>

      <title>Online Regularized Statistical Learning in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space With Non-Stationary Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03211v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the convergence of recursive regularized learning algorithms in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) with dependent and non-stationary online data streams. Firstly, we introduce the concept of random Tikhonov regularization path and decompose the tracking error of the algorithm's output for the regularization path into random difference equations in RKHS, whose non-homogeneous terms are martingale difference sequences. Investigating the mean square asymptotic stability of the equations, we show that if the regularization path is slowly time-varying, then the algorithm's output achieves mean square consistency with the regularization path. Leveraging operator theory, particularly the monotonicity of the inverses of operators and the spectral decomposition of compact operators, we introduce the RKHS persistence of excitation condition (i.e. there exists a fixed-length time period, such that the conditional expectation of the operators induced by the input data accumulated over every period has a uniformly strictly positive compact lower bound) and develop a dominated convergence method to prove the mean square consistency between the algorithm's output and an unknown function. Finally, for independent and non-identically distributed data streams, the algorithm achieves the mean square consistency if the input data's marginal probability measures are slowly time-varying and the average measure over each fixed-length time period has a uniformly strictly positive lower bound.</description>

      <title>Occlusion-Aware Consistent Model Predictive Control for Robot Navigation in Occluded Obstacle-Dense Environments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04563v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ensuring safety and motion consistency for robot navigation in occluded, obstacle-dense environments is a critical challenge. In this context, this study presents an occlusion-aware Consistent Model Predictive Control (CMPC) strategy. To account for the occluded obstacles, it incorporates adjustable risk regions that represent their potential future locations. Subsequently, dynamic risk boundary constraints are developed online to ensure safety. The CMPC then constructs multiple locally optimal trajectory branches (each tailored to different risk regions) to strike a balance between safety and performance. A shared consensus segment is generated to ensure smooth transitions between branches without significant velocity fluctuations, further preserving motion consistency. To facilitate high computational efficiency and ensure coordination across local trajectories, we use the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) to decompose the CMPC into manageable sub-problems for parallel solving. The proposed strategy is validated through simulations and real-world experiments on an Ackermann-steering robot platform. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed CMPC strategy through comparisons with baseline approaches in occluded, obstacle-dense environments.</description>

      <title>Stratified Topological Autonomy for Long-Range Coordination (STALC)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10475v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present Stratified Topological Autonomy for Long-Range Coordination (STALC), a hierarchical planning approach for coordinated multi-robot maneuvering in real-world environments with significant inter-robot spatial and temporal dependencies. At its core, STALC consists of a multi-robot graph-based planner which combines a topological graph with a novel, computationally efficient mixed-integer programming formulation to generate highly-coupled multi-robot plans in seconds. To enable autonomous planning across different spatial and temporal scales, we construct our graphs so that they capture connectivity between free-space regions and other problem-specific features, such as traversability or risk. We then use receding-horizon planners to achieve local collision avoidance and formation control. To evaluate our approach, we consider a multi-robot reconnaissance scenario where robots must autonomously coordinate to navigate through an environment while minimizing the risk of detection by observers. Through simulation-based experiments, we show that our approach is able to scale to address complex multi-robot planning scenarios. Through hardware experiments, we demonstrate our ability to generate graphs from real-world data and successfully plan across the entire hierarchy to achieve shared objectives.</description>

      <title>Sliding Speed Influences Electrovibration-Induced Finger Friction Dynamics on Touchscreens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11162v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electrovibration technology enables tactile texture rendering on capacitive touchscreens by modulating friction between the finger and the screen through electrostatic attraction forces, generated by applying an alternating voltage signal to the screen. Accurate signal calibration is essential for robust texture rendering but remains challenging due to variations in sliding speed, applied force, and individual skin mechanics, all of which unpredictably affect frictional behavior. Here, we investigate how exploration conditions affect electrovibration-induced finger friction on touchscreens and the role of skin mechanics in this process. Ten participants slid their index fingers across an electrovibration-enabled touchscreen at five sliding speeds ($20\sim100$ mm/s) and applied force levels ($0.2\sim0.6$ N). Contact forces and skin accelerations were measured while amplitude modulated voltage signals spanning the tactile frequency range were applied to the screen. We modeled the finger-touchscreen friction response as a first-order system and the skin mechanics as a mass-spring-damper system. Results showed that sliding speed influenced the friction response's cutoff frequency, along with the estimated finger moving mass and stiffness. For every $1$ mm/s increase in speed, the cutoff frequency, the finger moving mass, and stiffness increased by $13.8$ Hz, $3.23\times 10^{-5}$ kg, and $4.04$ N/m, respectively. Correlation analysis revealed that finger stiffness had a greater impact on the cutoff frequency than moving mass. Notably, we observed a substantial inter-participant variability in both finger-display interaction and skin mechanics parameters. Finally, we developed a speed-dependent friction model to support consistent and perceptually stable electrovibration-based haptic feedback across varying user conditions.</description>

      <title>A generalized global Hartman-Grobman theorem for asymptotically stable semiflows</title>

Abstract: Recently, Kvalheim and Sontag provided a generalized global Hartman-Grobman theorem for equilibria under asymptotically stable continuous vector fields. By leveraging topological properties of Lyapunov functions, their theorem works without assuming hyperbolicity. We extend their theorem to a class of possibly discontinuous vector fields, in particular, to vector fields generating asymptotically stable semiflows.</description>

      <title>A Vision for Trustworthy, Fair, and Efficient Socio-Technical Control using Karma Economies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17115v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Control systems will play a pivotal role in addressing societal-scale challenges as they drive the development of sustainable future smart cities. At the heart of these challenges is the trustworthy, fair, and efficient allocation of scarce public resources, including renewable energy, transportation, data, computation, etc.. Historical evidence suggests that monetary control -- the prototypical mechanism for managing resource scarcity -- is not always well-accepted in socio-technical resource contexts. In this vision article, we advocate for karma economies as an emerging non-monetary mechanism for socio-technical control. Karma leverages the repetitive nature of many socio-technical resources to jointly attain trustworthy, fair, and efficient allocations; by budgeting resource consumption over time and letting resource users ``play against their future selves.'' To motivate karma, we review related concepts in economics through a control systems lens, and make a case for a) shifting the viewpoint of resource allocations from single-shot and static to repeated and dynamic games; and b) adopting long-run Nash welfare as the formalization of ``fairness and efficiency'' in socio-technical contexts. We show that in many dynamic resource settings, karma Nash equilibria maximize long-run Nash welfare. Moreover, we discuss implications for a future smart city built on multi-karma economies: by choosing whether to combine different socio-technical resources, e.g., electricity and transportation, in a single karma economy, or separate into resource-specific economies, karma provides new flexibility to design the scope of fairness and efficiency.</description>

      <title>LogicGuard: Improving Embodied LLM agents through Temporal Logic based Critics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03293v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in zero-shot and single step reasoning and decision making problems, but in long horizon sequential planning tasks, their errors compound, often leading to unreliable or inefficient behavior. We introduce LogicGuard, a modular actor-critic architecture in which an LLM actor is guided by a trajectory level LLM critic that communicates through Linear Temporal Logic (LTL). Our setup combines the reasoning strengths of language models with the guarantees of formal logic. The actor selects high-level actions from natural language observations, while the critic analyzes full trajectories and proposes new LTL constraints that shield the actor from future unsafe or inefficient behavior. LogicGuard supports both fixed safety rules and adaptive, learned constraints, and is model-agnostic: any LLM-based planner can serve as the actor, with LogicGuard acting as a logic-generating wrapper. We formalize planning as graph traversal under symbolic constraints, allowing LogicGuard to analyze failed or suboptimal trajectories and generate new temporal logic rules that improve future behavior. To demonstrate generality, we evaluate LogicGuard across two distinct settings: short-horizon general tasks and long-horizon specialist tasks. On the Behavior benchmark of 100 household tasks, LogicGuard increases task completion rates by 25% over a baseline InnerMonologue planner. On the Minecraft diamond-mining task, which is long-horizon and requires multiple interdependent subgoals, LogicGuard improves both efficiency and safety compared to SayCan and InnerMonologue. These results show that enabling LLMs to supervise each other through temporal logic yields more reliable, efficient and safe decision-making for both embodied agents.</description>

      <title>Universal Dynamics with Globally Controlled Analog Quantum Simulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19075</link>

Abstract: Analog quantum simulators with global control fields have emerged as powerful platforms for exploring complex quantum phenomena. Recent breakthroughs, such as the coherent control of thousands of atoms, highlight the growing potential for quantum applications at scale. Despite these advances, a fundamental theoretical question remains unresolved: to what extent can such systems realize universal quantum dynamics under global control? Here we establish a necessary and sufficient condition for universal quantum computation using only global pulse control, proving that a broad class of analog quantum simulators is, in fact, universal. We further extend this framework to fermionic and bosonic systems, including modern platforms such as ultracold atoms in optical superlattices. Crucially, to connect the theoretical possibility with experimental reality, we introduce a new control technique into the experiment - direct quantum optimal control. This method enables the synthesis of complex effective Hamiltonians and allows us to incorporate realistic hardware constraints. To show its practical power, we experimentally engineer three-body interactions outside the blockade regime and demonstrate topological dynamics on a Rydberg atom array. Using the new control framework, we overcome key experimental challenges, including hardware limitations and atom position fluctuations in the non-blockade regime, by identifying smooth, short-duration pulses that achieve high-fidelity dynamics. Experimental measurements reveal dynamical signatures of symmetry-protected-topological edge modes, confirming both the expressivity and feasibility of our approach. Our work opens a new avenue for quantum simulation beyond native hardware Hamiltonians, enabling the engineering of effective multi-body interactions and advancing the frontier of quantum information processing with globally-controlled analog platforms.</description>

      <title>Drift Plus Optimistic Penalty - A Learning Framework for Stochastic Network Optimization with Improved Regret Bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03762v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of joint routing and scheduling in queueing networks, where the edge transmission costs are unknown. At each time-slot, the network controller receives noisy observations of transmission costs only for those edges it selects for transmission. The network controller's objective is to make routing and scheduling decisions so that the total expected cost is minimized. This problem exhibits an exploration-exploitation trade-off, however, previous bandit-style solutions cannot be directly applied to this problem due to the queueing dynamics. In order to ensure network stability, the network controller needs to optimize throughput and cost simultaneously. We show that the best achievable cost is lower bounded by the solution to a static optimization problem, and develop a network control policy using techniques from Lyapunov drift-plus-penalty optimization and multi-arm bandits. We show that the policy achieves a sub-linear regret of order $O(\sqrt{T}\log T)$, as compared to the best policy that has complete knowledge of arrivals and costs. Finally, we evaluate the proposed policy using simulations and show that its regret is indeed sub-linear.</description>
