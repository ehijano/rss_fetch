      <title>Root Number Equidistribution for Self-Dual Automorphic Representations on $GL_N$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $F$ be a totally real field. We study the root numbers $\epsilon(1/2, \pi)$ of self-dual cuspidal automorphic representations $\pi$ of $GL_{2N}/F$ with conductor $\mathfrak n$ and regular integral infinitesimal character $\lambda$. If $\pi$ is orthogonal, then $\epsilon(1/2, \pi)$ is known to be identically one. We show that for symplectic representations, the root numbers $\epsilon(1/2, \pi)$ equidistribute between $\pm 1$ as $\lambda \to \infty$, provided that there exists a prime dividing $\mathfrak n$ with power $&gt;N$. We also study conjugate self-dual representations with respect to a CM extension $E/F$, where we obtain a similar result under the assumption that $\mathfrak n$ is divisible by a large enough power of a ramified prime and provide evidence that equidistribution does not hold otherwise. In cases where there are known to be associated Galois representations, we deduce root number equidistribution results for the corresponding families of $N$-dimensional Galois representations.
  The proof generalizes a classical argument for the the case of $GL_2/\mathbb Q$ by using Arthur's trace formula and the endoscopic classification for quasisiplit classical groups similarly to a previous work (arXiv:2212.12138). The main new technical difficulty evaluating endoscopic transfers of the required test functions at central elements.</description>

      <title>CM points have everywhere good reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that for every Shimura variety $S$, there is an integral model $\mathcal{S}$ such that all CM points of $S$ have good reduction with respect to $\mathcal{S}$. In other words, every CM point is contained in $\mathcal{S}(\overline{\mathbb{Z}})$. This follows from a stronger local result wherein we characterize the points of $S$ with potentially-good reduction (with respect to some auxiliary prime $\ell$) as being those that extend to integral points of $\mathcal{S}$.</description>

Abstract: We prove asymptotics for semi-integral points of bounded height on toric varieties. We verify the Manin-type conjecture of Pieropan, Smeets, Tanimoto and V\'arilly-Alvarado for smooth and certain singular toric orbifolds upon replacing the leading constant with the one predicted by Chow, Loughran, Takloo-Bighash and Tanimoto.</description>

      <title>Iterated Radical Expansions and Convergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We treat three recurrences involving square roots, the first of which arises from an infinite simple radical expansion for the Golden mean, whose precise convergence rate was made famous by Richard Bruce Paris in 1987. A never-before-seen proof of an important formula is given. The other recurrences are non-exponential yet equally interesting. Asymptotic series developed for each of these two examples feature a constant, dependent on the initial condition but otherwise intrinsic to the function at hand.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the main objectives of the current paper is to revisit the well known Laurent series expansions of the Riemann zeta function $\zeta(s)$, Hurwitz zeta function $\zeta(s,a)$ and Dirichlet $L$-function $L(s,\chi)$ at $s=1$. Moreover, we also present a new Laurent series expansion of $L$-functions associated to cusp forms over the full modular group.</description>

      <title>Optimal Representations of Gaussian and Eisenstein Integers using digit sets closed under multiplication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study two positional numeration systems which are known for allowing very efficient addition and multiplication of complex numbers. The first one uses the base $\beta = \imath - 1$ and the digit set $\mathcal{D} = \{ 0, \pm 1, \pm \imath \}$. In this numeration system, every non-zero Gaussian integer~$x$ has an infinite number of representations. We focus on optimal representations of~$x$ -- i.e., representations with minimal possible number of non-zero digits. One of the optimal representations of~$x$ has the so-called $3$-non-adjacent form ($3$-NAF). We provide an upper bound on the number of distinct optimal representations of~$x$, depending on the number of non-zero digits in the $3$-NAF of~$x$. We also characterize the Gaussian integers for which the upper bound is attained. The same questions are answered also for the second numeration system with base $\beta = \omega - 1$ and digit set $\mathcal{D} = \{ 0, \pm 1, \pm \omega, \pm \omega^2 \}$, where $\omega = \exp(2\pi\imath / 3)$. In this system, every Eisenstein integer has a $2$-NAF, which is optimal. This paper can be understood as an analogy to the result of Grabner and Heuberger obtained for the signed binary numeration system, using base $\beta = 2$ and digit set $\mathcal{D} = \{0, \pm 1\}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove asymptotic results for the singular series associated to the distribution of three primes. Assuming a quantitative version of Hardy and Littlewood's conjecture on prime 3-tuples, we deduce an asymptotic formula related to the joint distribution of three primes. This improves recent results of Kuperberg and completes results by Montgomery and Soundararajan. Following the Montgomery and Soundararajan approach, we derive conjectural applications to the distribution of primes in short intervals.</description>

      <title>The tower property on the genericity of global theta lifts between orthogonal-symplectic dual pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the tower property concerning the genericity of global theta lifts between quasi-split $\O_{2n}$ and $\Sp_{2m}$ inspired by Rallis's tower property. By examining the relationship between the poles of partial $L$-functions and special Bessel and Fourier-Jacobi periods, we prove that the first occurrence of theta lifts between quasi-split orthogonal groups and symplectic groups preserves genericity.</description>

      <title>Computations directly on the cuspidal cohomology of congruence subgroups of $\mathrm{SL}(3, \mathbb{Z})$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In their 1984 work, Ash, Grayson, and Green compute the action of Hecke operators on a certain subspace of the cohomology of low-level congruence subgroups of $\mathsf{SL}(3, \mathbb{Z})$. This subspace contains the cuspidal cohomology, which is of primary interest. We extend their work, introducing a method that allows for computing the action of Hecke operators directly on the cuspidal cohomology. Using this method, we obtain data for prime level less than 1500, finding four additional levels at which nonzero cuspidal classes appear and calculating local factors for two of these levels.</description>

Abstract: We state and prove a formula for the Whittaker-Shintani functions associated to Fourier-Jacobi models for p-adic unitary groups and general linear groups. These generalized spherical functions play a fundamental role in the proof of the Gan-Gross-Prasad conjecture for Fourier-Jacobi models. As an application we prove the unramified Ichino-Ikeda conjecture.</description>

      <title>On the Linear Complexity Associated with a Family of Multidimentional Continued Fraction Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the complexity of S-adic sequences corresponding to a family of 216 multi-dimensional continued fractions maps, called Triangle Partition maps (TRIP maps), with an emphasis on those with low upper bounds on complexity. Our main result is to prove that the complexity of S-adic sequences corresponding the triangle map (called the (e,e,e)-TRIP map in this paper) has upper bound at most 3n. Our second main result is to prove an upper bound of 2n+1 on complexity for another TRIP map. We discuss a dynamical phenomenon, which we call ``hidden $R^2$ behavior,'' that occurs in this map and its relationship to complexity. Combining this with previously known results and a list of counter-examples, we provide a complete list of the TRIP maps which have upper bounds on complexity of at most 3n, except for one remaining case for which we conjecture such an upper bound to hold.</description>

Abstract: Linear codes with a few weights can be applied to secrete sharing, authentication codes, association schemes and strongly regular graphs. For an odd prime power $q$, we construct a class of three-weight $\F_q$-linear codes from quadratic functions via a bivariate construction and then determine the complete weight enumerators and weight hierarchies of these linear codes completely. This paper generalizes some results in Li et al. (2022) and Hu et al. (2024).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We characterise quantitative semi-uniform stability for $C_0$-semigroups arising from port-Hamiltonian systems, complementing recent works on exponential and strong stability. With the result, we present a simple universal example class of port-Hamiltonian $C_0$-semigroups exhibiting arbitrary decay rates slower than $t^{-1/2}$. The latter is based on results from the theory of Diophantine approximation as the decay rates will be strongly related to approximation properties of irrational numbers by rationals given through cut-offs of continued fraction expansions.</description>

      <title>Proof of the Goldbach's Strong Conjecture by Using Semi-Continuous Model of Even Numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.13230</link>
      <description>arXiv:1909.13230v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present an explicit and analytic proof for still unproven Goldbach's strong conjecture. To derive this proof, we first define a heuristic model for representing even numbers called Semi-continuous Model for Even Numbers or briefly S.C.E Model, and then we employ this model along with using the inequality
  \begin{center}
  $\dfrac{x}{\ln x}\leq_{x\geq 17}\pi(x)\leq_{x&gt;1}1.2251\dfrac{x}{\ln x}$,
  \end{center}
  where $\pi(x)$ denotes the number of all primes smaller than and equal to $x$, and is presented by Pierre Dusart in his paper [P. Dusart, \textit{Explicit estimates of some functions over primes},
  Ramanujan J. \textbf{45} (2016), No. 1, 227--251].
  On the one hand, this proof is given for all even numbers $E\geq22864$. On the other hand, since the assertion of Goldbach's strong conjecture is easy to verify for all even numbers $4\leq E&lt;22864$, we turn this conjecture into a theorem.</description>

      <title>Infinite order linear difference equation satisfied by a refinement of Goss zeta function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.11911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.11911v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: At the international congress of mathematicians in 1900, Hilbert claimed that the Riemann zeta function $\zeta(s)$ is not the solution of any algebraic ordinary differential equations on its region of analyticity. Let $T$ be an infinite order linear differential operator introduced by Van Gorder in 2015. Recently, Prado and Klinger-Logan (J. Number Theory 217: 422--442, 2020) showed that the Hurwitz zeta function $\zeta(s,a)$ formally satisfies the following linear differential equation $$
  T\left[\zeta (s,a) - \frac{1}{a^s}\right] = \frac{1}{(s-1)a^{s-1}}. $$
  Then in (Abh. Math. Semin. Univ. Hambg. 91: 117--135, 2021), by defining $T_{p}^{a}$, a $p$-adic analogue of Van Gorder's operator $T,$ we constructed the following convergent infinite order linear differential equation satisfied by the $p$-adic Hurwitz-type Euler zeta function $\zeta_{p,E}(s,a)$ $$ T_{p}^{a}\left[\zeta_{p,E}(s,a)-\langle a\rangle^{1-s}\right] =\frac{1}{s-1}\left(\langle a-1 \rangle^{1-s}-\langle a\rangle^{1-s}\right). $$
  In this paper, we consider this problem in the positive characteristic case. That is, by introducing $\zeta_{\infty}(s_{0},s,a,n)$, a Hurwitz type refinement of Goss zeta function, and an infinite order linear difference operator $L$, we establish the following difference equation \begin{equation*} L\left[\zeta_{\infty}\left(\frac{1}{T},s,a,0\right)\right]=\sum_{\gamma\in\mathbb{F}_{q}} \frac{1}{\langle a+\gamma\rangle^{s}}. \end{equation*}</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.05234v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish the local converse theorem and the stability of local gamma factors for $\Mp_{2n}$ via the precise local theta correspondence between $\Mp_{2n}$ and $\SO_{2n+1}$ over local fields of characteristic not equal to 2. As an application, we can prove the rigidity theorem for irreducible generic cuspidal automorphic representations of $\Mp_{2n}$ over number fields.</description>

      <title>Analogue of Ramanujan's function $k(\tau)$ for the continued fraction $X(\tau)$ of order six</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.08782v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent work of Park on the analogue of the Ramanujan's function $k(\tau)=r(\tau)r^2(2\tau)$ for the Ramanujan's cubic continued fraction, where $r(\tau)$ is the Rogers-Ramanujan continued fraction, we use the methods of Lee and Park to study the modularity and arithmetic of the function $w(\tau) = X(\tau)X(3\tau)$, which may be considered as an analogue of $k(\tau)$ for the continued fraction $X(\tau)$ of order six introduced by Vasuki, Bhaskar and Sharath. In particular, we show that $w(\tau)$ can be written in terms of the normalized generator $u(\tau)$ of the field of all modular functions on $\Gamma_0(18)$, and derive modular equations for $u(\tau)$ of smaller prime levels. We also express $j(d\tau)$ for $d\in\{1,2,3,6,9,18\}$ in terms of $u(\tau)$, where $j$ is the modular $j$-invariant.</description>

      <title>Sign changes of the partial sums of a random multiplicative function III: Average</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19845v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $V(x)$ be the number of sign changes of the partial sums up to $x$, say $M_f(x)$, of a Rademacher random multiplicative function $f$. We prove that the averaged value of $V(x)$ is at least $\gg (\log x)(\log\log x)^{-1}$. Our new method applies for the counting of sign changes of the partial sums of a system of orthogonal random variables having variance $1$ under additional hypothesis on the moments of these partial sums. The main input in our method is the ``linearity'' phase in $1\leq q\leq 1.9$ of the quantity $\log \mathbb{E} |M_f(x)|^q$, provided by the Harper's better than squareroot cancellation phenomenon for small moments of $M_f(x)$.</description>

      <title>Ordinary primes in Hilbert modular varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01182v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A well-known conjecture, often attributed to Serre, asserts that any motive over any number field has infinitely many ordinary reductions (in the sense that the Newton polygon coincides with the Hodge polygon). In the case of Hilbert modular cuspforms $f$ of parallel weight $(2, \cdots , 2)$, we show how to produce more ordinary primes by using the Sato-Tate equidistribution and combining it with the Galois theory of the Hecke field. Under the assumption of stronger forms of Sato-Tate equidistribution, we get stronger (but conditional) results. In the case of higher weights, we formulate the ordinariness conjecture for submotives of the intersection cohomology of proper algebraic varieties with motivic coefficients, and verify it for the motives whose $l$-adic Galois realisations are abelian on a finite index subgroup. We get some results for Hilbert cuspforms of weight $(3, \cdots , 3)$, weaker than those for $(2, \cdots , 2)$.</description>

      <title>Non-holomorphic modular forms from zeta generators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14816v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study non-holomorphic modular forms built from iterated integrals of holomorphic modular forms for SL$(2,\mathbb Z)$ known as equivariant iterated Eisenstein integrals. A special subclass of them furnishes an equivalent description of the modular graph forms appearing in the low-energy expansion of string amplitudes at genus one. Notably the Fourier expansion of modular graph forms contains single-valued multiple zeta values. We deduce the appearance of products and higher-depth instances of multiple zeta values in equivariant iterated Eisenstein integrals, and ultimately modular graph forms, from the appearance of simpler odd Riemann zeta values. This analysis relies on so-called zeta generators which act on certain non-commutative variables in the generating series of the iterated integrals. From an extension of these non-commutative variables we incorporate iterated integrals involving holomorphic cusp forms into our setup and use them to construct the modular completion of triple Eisenstein integrals. Our work represents a fully explicit realisation of the modular graph forms within Brown's framework of equivariant iterated Eisenstein integrals and reveals structural analogies between single-valued period functions appearing in genus zero and one string amplitudes.</description>
