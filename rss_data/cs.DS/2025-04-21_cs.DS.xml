      <title>New Results on a General Class of Minimum Norm Optimization Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the general norm optimization for combinatorial problems, initiated by Chakrabarty and Swamy (STOC 2019). We propose a general formulation that captures a large class of combinatorial structures: we are given a set $U$ of $n$ weighted elements and a family of feasible subsets $F$. Each subset $S\in F$ is called a feasible solution/set of the problem. We denote the value vector by $v=\{v_i\}_{i\in [n]}$, where $v_i\geq 0$ is the value of element $i$. For any subset $S\subseteq U$, we use $v[S]$ to denote the $n$-dimensional vector $\{v_e\cdot \mathbf{1}[e\in S]\}_{e\in U}$. Let $f: \mathbb{R}^n\rightarrow\mathbb{R}_+$ be a symmetric monotone norm function. Our goal is to minimize the norm objective $f(v[S])$ over feasible subset $S\in F$.
  We present a general equivalent reduction of the norm minimization problem to a multi-criteria optimization problem with logarithmic budget constraints, up to a constant approximation factor. Leveraging this reduction, we obtain constant factor approximation algorithms for the norm minimization versions of several covering problems, such as interval cover, multi-dimensional knapsack cover, and logarithmic factor approximation for set cover. We also study the norm minimization versions for perfect matching, $s$-$t$ path and $s$-$t$ cut. We show the natural linear programming relaxations for these problems have a large integrality gap. To complement the negative result, we show that, for perfect matching, there is a bi-criteria result: for any constant $\epsilon,\delta&gt;0$, we can find in polynomial time a nearly perfect matching (i.e., a matching that matches at least $1-\epsilon$ proportion of vertices) and its cost is at most $(8+\delta)$ times of the optimum for perfect matching. Moreover, we establish the existence of a polynomial-time $O(\log\log n)$-approximation algorithm for the norm minimization variant of the $s$-$t$ path problem.</description>

      <title>Broadcasting under Structural Restrictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the Telephone Broadcast problem we are given a graph $G=(V,E)$ with a designated source vertex $s\in V$. Our goal is to transmit a message, which is initially known only to $s$, to all vertices of the graph by using a process where in each round an informed vertex may transmit the message to one of its uninformed neighbors. The optimization objective is to minimize the number of rounds.
  Following up on several recent works, we investigate the structurally parameterized complexity of Telephone Broadcast. In particular, we first strengthen existing NP-hardness results by showing that the problem remains NP-complete on graphs of bounded tree-depth and also on cactus graphs which are one vertex deletion away from being path forests. Motivated by this (severe) hardness, we study several other parameterizations of the problem and obtain FPT algorithms parameterized by vertex integrity (generalizing a recent FPT algorithm parameterized by vertex cover by Fomin, Fraigniaud, and Golovach [TCS 2024]) and by distance to clique, as well as FPT approximation algorithms parameterized by clique-cover and cluster vertex deletion. Furthermore, we obtain structural results that relate the length of the optimal broadcast protocol of a graph $G$ with its pathwidth and tree-depth. By presenting a substantial improvement over the best previously known bound for pathwidth (Aminian, Kamali, Seyed-Javadi, and Sumedha [arXiv 2025]) we exponentially improve the approximation ratio achievable in polynomial time on graphs of bounded pathwidth from $\mathcal{O}(4^\mathrm{pw})$ to $\mathcal{O}(\mathrm{pw})$.</description>

      <title>Robust Distributed Arrays: Provably Secure Networking for Data Availability Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data Availability Sampling (DAS), a central component of Ethereum's roadmap, enables clients to verify data availability without requiring any single client to download the entire dataset. DAS operates by having clients randomly retrieve individual symbols of erasure-encoded data from a peer-to-peer network. While the cryptographic and encoding aspects of DAS have recently undergone formal analysis, the peer-to-peer networking layer remains underexplored, with a lack of security definitions and efficient, provably secure constructions.
  In this work, we address this gap by introducing a novel distributed data structure that can serve as the networking layer for DAS, which we call \emph{robust distributed arrays}. That is, we rigorously define a robustness property of a distributed data structure in an open permissionless network, that mimics a collection of arrays.
  Then, we give a simple and efficient construction and formally prove its robustness. Notably, every individual node is required to store only small portions of the data, and accessing array positions incurs minimal latency. The robustness of our construction relies solely on the presence of a minimal \emph{absolute} number of honest nodes in the network. In particular, we avoid any honest majority assumption.
  Beyond DAS, we anticipate that robust distributed arrays can have wider applications in distributed systems.</description>

      <title>The Long Arm of Nashian Allocation in Online $p$-Mean Welfare Maximization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13430v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the online allocation of divisible items to $n$ agents with additive valuations for $p$-mean welfare maximization, a problem introduced by Barman, Khan, and Maiti~(2022). Our algorithmic and hardness results characterize the optimal competitive ratios for the entire spectrum of $-\infty \le p \le 1$. Surprisingly, our improved algorithms for all $p \le \frac{1}{\log n}$ are simply the greedy algorithm for the Nash welfare, supplemented with two auxiliary components to ensure all agents have non-zero utilities and to help a small number of agents with low utilities. In this sense, the long arm of Nashian allocation achieves near-optimal competitive ratios not only for Nash welfare but also all the way to egalitarian welfare.</description>

      <title>Enumeration of Bases in Matroid with Exponentially Large Ground Set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11728v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When we deal with a matroid ${\mathcal M}=(U,{\mathcal I})$, we usually assume that it is implicitly given by means of the membership (MEM) oracle. Time complexity of many existing algorithms is polynomially bounded with respect to $|U|$ and the running time of the MEM-oracle. However, they are not efficient any more when $U$ is exponentially large in some context. In this paper, we propose two algorithms for enumerating matroid bases such that the time complexity does not depend on $|U|$. The first algorithm enumerates all minimum-weighted bases in incremental-polynomial time. To design the algorithm, we assume two oracles other than the MEM-oracle: the MinB-oracle that returns a minimum basis and the REL-oracle that returns a relevant element one by one in non-decreasing order of weight. The proposed algorithm is applicable to enumeration of minimum bases of binary matroids from cycle space and cut space, all of which have exponentially large $U$ with respect to a given graph. The highlight in this context is that, to design the REL-oracle for cut space, we develop the first polynomial-delay algorithm that enumerates all relevant cuts of a given graph in non-decreasing order of weight. The second algorithm enumerates all sets of linearly independent $r$-dimensional $r$ vectors over $\mathit{GF}(2)$ in polynomial-delay, which immediately yields a polynomial-delay algorithm with respect to the matroid rank $r$ that enumerates all unweighted bases of a binary matroid such that elements are closed under addition.</description>
