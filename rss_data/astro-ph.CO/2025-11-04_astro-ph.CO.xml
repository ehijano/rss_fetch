      <title>A cosmographic analysis using DESI-DR2 and strong lensing: I. Time-Delay measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strong gravitational lensing time-delay measurements, together with the distance sum rule (DSR), offer a model-independent approach to probe the geometry and expansion of the universe without relying on a fiducial cosmological model. In this work, we perform a cosmographic analysis by combining the latest Type Ia supernova datasets (PantheonPlus, DESY5, and Union3), baryon acoustic oscillation data from DESI-DR2, and updated time-delay distances from strong lensing systems. The analyses using SGL with individual SNIa datasets (SGL+PantheonPlus, SGL+DESY5, and SGL+Union3) indicate a preference for an open universe, though they remain consistent with spatially flat universe at the $95%$ confidence level. When DESI-DR2 data is included in each combination, the constraints tighten and shift slightly toward a closed universe, while flatness remains supported at the $68%$ confidence level. The best-fit values of $q_0$ and $j_0$ agree with $\Lambda$CDM expectations within $95%$ or $99%$ confidence depending on the dataset, whereas $s_0$ remains weakly constrained in all cases. This work is the first in a series of two companion papers on cosmography with DESI-DR2 and strong lensing.</description>

      <title>A cosmographic analysis using DESI-DR2 and strong lensing: II. Distance Ratio measurements</title>

Abstract: The distance ratio derived from strong gravitational lensing systems, combined with complementary cosmological observations, offers a model-independent means to investigate the geometry and dynamics of the universe. In this study, we carry out a cosmographic investigation using the latest compilations of Type Ia supernovae (PantheonPlus, DESY5, and Union3), baryon acoustic oscillation measurements from DESI-DR2, and updated strong lensing distance ratios. The cosmographic series is expanded to fourth order in the variable $y = z/(1+z)$ to constrain the deceleration, jerk, and snap parameters $(q_0,~j_0,~s_0)$. The analysis utilizes the distance sum rule (DSR) to provide an independent assessment of the spatial curvature parameter, $\Omega_{k0}$, without assuming a specific dynamical model. Our results based on SGL distance ratio measurements combined with individual supernova datasets suggest a mild preference for an open universe, though a flat universe is supported at the 95% confidence level. Further, the inclusion of DESI-DR2 data in each combination provides tighter constraints on the parameters and confirms flatness within the 68% confidence level as expected in standard cosmology. The results for $q_0$ and $j_0$ are consistent with $\Lambda$CDM predictions across datasets, while the constraint on $s_0$ remains limited but improves with the inclusion of DESI-DR2. This is the second and final paper in a two-part series.</description>

      <title>Generating all-sky radio continuum clustering simulations with GHOST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Techniques using multiple tracers of the large scale structure of the universe show great promise for examining the fundamentals of our Universe's cosmology. Such techniques rely on the different relationship between the overdensity of tracers and the broader matter overdensity, enabling cosmic-variance-free tests of primordial non-Gaussianity in the initial curvature perturbations. There is a great opportunity for current and future all-sky extra-galactic radio surveys to make use of this technique to test for non-Gaussianity at a precision greater than existing all-sky constraints from the cosmic microwave background. To realize this goal there is a need for accurate simulations. Previous radio galaxy simulations have either been realistic but covering only a small area (and so unhelpful for cosmological forecasts), or all-sky dark matter only cosmological simulations but having no connection to a real radio galaxy population. In this study, we use the FLAMINGO suite of cosmological surveys, as well as the matching of dark matter halos to radio galaxy population, to create an accurate sky simulation in order to examine the feasibility of multi-tracer techniques. We present an analysis of the clustering (with a bias model for the simulation), as well as redshift distributions, source counts and radio luminosity functions, and discuss future work on non-Gaussianity detection.</description>

      <title>Limits of self-interacting neutrinos from the BAO and CMB phase shift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutrinos with Standard Model interactions free-stream in the early Universe, leaving a distinct phase shift in the pattern of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO). When isolated, this phase shift allows one to robustly infer the presence of the cosmic neutrino background in BAO and cosmic microwave background (CMB) data independently of other cosmological parameters. While in the context of the Standard Model, this phase shift follows a known scale-dependent relation, new physics in the cosmic neutrino background could alter the overall shape of this feature. In this paper, we discuss how changes in the neutrino phase shift could be used to constrain self-interactions among neutrinos. We produce simple models for this phase-shift assuming universal self-interactions, and use these in order to understand what constraining power is available for the strength of such interactions in BAO and CMB data. We find that, although challenging, it may be possible to use a detection of the phase to put a more robust limit on the strength of the self-interaction, $G_{\mathrm{eff}}$, which at present suffers from bimodality in cosmological constraints. Our forecast analysis reveals that BAO data alone will not provide the precision needed to tightly constrain self-interactions; however, the combined analysis of the phase shift signature in both CMB and BAO can potentially provide a way to detect the impact of new neutrino interactions. Our results could be extended upon for models with non-universal interactions.</description>

      <title>The CatWISE2020 Quasar dipole: A Reassessment of the Cosmic Dipole Anomaly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cosmological principle, which asserts a statistically homogeneous and isotropic universe on large scales, is a foundational assumption of the standard cosmological model. A critical test of this principle involves the kinematic interpretation of the Cosmic Microwave Background temperature dipole, conventionally attributed to our peculiar motion relative to the cosmic rest frame. The Ellis-Baldwin test provides a probe of this kinematic interpretation by searching for a matching Doppler-driven dipole in the number counts of extragalactic radio sources. Recent measurements from the CatWISE2020 quasar catalog have reported a dipole amplitude significantly exceeding the kinematic expectation, with a claimed significance of $4.9\sigma$. We present a comprehensive reassessment of this test using the same dataset, incorporating major sources of uncertainty in the statistical inference. We use a simulation framework based on the FLASK package, incorporating lognormal realizations of the large-scale structure, the quasar clustering bias, the survey's radial selection function, and its exact sky coverage. Our simulations account for the kinematic dipole, the intrinsic clustering dipole, shot noise, and survey geometry effects. The analysis yields a revised significance of the kinematic dipole excess of $3.63\sigma$ in the absence of a clustering dipole, and $3.44\sigma$ in the presence of a randomly oriented clustering dipole. When the clustering dipole is aligned with the kinematic dipole direction, the significance decreases further to $3.27\sigma$. Our analysis demonstrates that although the anomaly is reduced in significance, it cannot be explained solely as a result of the clustering dipole or mode coupling arising from the survey mask.</description>

      <title>Massive neutrinos and interacting dark matter look alike through the lens of lensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the suppression in the lensing power spectrum of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) caused by massive neutrinos can be mimicked by dark matter-baryon interactions at the precision of next-generation CMB experiments. Thus, a determination of neutrino masses from the CMB lensing power spectrum may be compromised. We illustrate the degeneracy for a dark matter-proton cross section $\propto v^{-4}$, which arises in the $t$-channel exchange of an ultralight mediator in the nonrelativistic limit.</description>

      <title>Fast End-to-End Framework for Cosmological Parameter Inference from CMB Data Using Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise estimation of cosmological parameters from the cosmic microwave background (CMB) remains a central goal of modern cosmology and a key test of inflationary physics. However, this task is fundamentally limited by strong foreground contamination, primarily from Galactic emissions, which obscure the faint CMB B-mode polarization signal. In this Letter, we introduce a fast, simulation-based, end to end pipeline that integrates a robust component separation technique with machine-learning, leading to cosmological parameter estimation. Our approach combines the Analytical Blind Separation (ABS) method for foreground removal with a neural network (NN) framework optimized to extract cosmological parameters directly from full-sky simulations. We assess the performance of this methodology for the forthcoming LiteBIRD and PICO satellite missions, designed to detect CMB B modes with unprecedented sensitivity. Applying the pipeline to realistic sky simulations, we obtain 1 sigma errors of 0.0035 (LiteBIRD) and 0.0030 (PICO) for the optical depth tau, and 0.005 (LiteBIRD) and 0.0014 (PICO) for the tensor-to-scalar ratio, r. In all cases, the recovered parameters are consistent with input values within 1 sigma across most of the parameter space. Results for LiteBIRD are in excellent agreement with the latest forecasts from the collaboration. Our findings establish this combined ABS-NN pipeline as a competitive, accurate, and computationally efficient alternative for cosmological parameter inference, offering a powerful framework for forthcoming CMB experiments.</description>

      <title>Galaxy assembly bias in cosmological hydrodynamical simulations: a comparison between SIMBA and IllustrisTNG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modelling of large-scale structure is increasingly concerned with galaxy assembly bias (GAB), the dependence of galaxy clustering on quantities other than halo mass. We investigate how baryonic physics affects the strength and redshift evolution of GAB using the largest runs of two state-of-the-art cosmological hydrodynamical simulations: SIMBA and IllustrisTNG. We quantify GAB by comparing the clustering of stellar-mass-selected galaxies to that of shuffled samples, where galaxies are randomly reassigned to haloes of similar mass. We find that GAB in both simulations increases from approximately zero at $z=5$ to a $\sim\,5\%$ change in clustering amplitude at $z=2$. After this epoch, the trends diverge: GAB in TNG continues to increase, reaching $\sim\,10\%$ at $z=0$, while in SIMBA it decreases to nearly zero. By further shuffling galaxies within bins of halo mass and cosmic environment -- characterised by smoothed matter overdensity ($\delta_5$) and tidal anisotropy ($\alpha_5$) -- we show that most of the GAB in both simulations can be attributed to the overdensity, while tidal anisotropy contributes negligibly in both simulations. Exploring this effect from the point of view of the halo occupation distribution (HOD), we find that numbers of central and satellite galaxies vary with overdensity -- but only near the respective turn-on masses for these two constituents: the galaxy contents of high-mass haloes are very nearly independent of environment. We present a simple parameterisation that allows the HOD modelling to be modified to reflect this form of density-dependent GAB.</description>

      <title>Is $\Lambda$CDM on the run? Reconciling the CMB with the Lyman-$\alpha$ Forest</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present new constraints on the scale dependence of the primordial power spectrum by combining Planck, ACT DR6, SPT-3G and eBOSS Lyman-$\alpha$ forest data, extending sensitivity to smaller comoving scales. While ACT results previously indicated a mild preference for positive running of the spectral index, our joint analysis constrains both the running $\alpha_s$ and its running $\beta_s$. Including eBOSS markedly tightens these constraints, yielding a $&gt;2\sigma$ indication of nonzero $\alpha_s$ and/or $\beta_s$, challenging predictions from vanilla slow-roll inflation potentials. Comparing reconstructed spectral parameters with theoretical models, we find that inflationary potentials with localised dips, bumps, or oscillations better reproduce the observed scale dependence. We release the public PIPE code to test arbitrary inflationary potentials against these datasets.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Dark Energy from a Massive Vector Field in Generalized Proca Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we emphasise the recent observational findings from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument Data Release 2 (DESI DR2), which provide compelling evidence for a possible deviation from the standard $\Lambda$CDM (Cold Dark Matter) cosmology, suggesting the presence of a dynamically evolving effective dark energy component. Motivated by this, we construct a theoretical framework in which a massive cosmological vector field, $B^{\mu}$, couples non-minimally to the background curvature through marginal interactions, offering a controlled mechanism to realise the deviation from the $\Lambda$CDM model. A detailed analysis of the effective Equation of State (EoS) parameter $w(\tilde H)$ reveals a narrow region of parameter space consistent with current cosmological observations presented by DESI. The analysis yields a stringent upper bound for the coupling constant $\lambda$ to be $\lambda&lt;2.98\times10^{-11}$, a very strong bound on mass $3.1356\times10^{-66}~\text{g} \leq m \leq 3.3627\times10^{-66}~\text{g},$ and the admissible range $-0.405 \leq \log_{10}\tilde\gamma \leq -0.38$ for which present-day value $w_0 = w(\tilde H = 1)$ corresponding to a deviation $\delta = w_0 + 1$ that lies within the region $0.107 \leq \delta \leq 0.217$. This interval reproduces the deviation inferred from the combined DESI, Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), and Pantheon+ data, reflecting a controlled departure from the $\Lambda$CDM behaviour. In summary, the results suggest that the proposed framework of a massive vector field can account for the departure from $\Lambda$CDM behaviour highlighted by DESI in the current cosmic acceleration. Furthermore, the framework approaches the $\Lambda$CDM behaviour in late-time $t\gtrsim28$ Gyr, establishing a direct phenomenological link between the underlying parameters and the observed dynamical nature of dark energy.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Spectral Shapes as a probe of Long Lived Right-handed Neutrinos, Leptogenesis and Dark Matter: Gobal versus Local B-L Cosmic Strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The scale of the seesaw mechanism is typically much larger than the electroweak scale. This hierarchy can be naturally explained by $U(1)_{B-L}$ symmetry, which after spontaneous symmetry breaking, simultaneously generates Majorana masses for neutrinos and produces a network of cosmic strings. Such strings generate a gravitational wave (GW) spectrum which is expected to be almost uniform in frequency unless there is a departure from the usual early radiation domination. We explore this possibility in Type I, II and III seesaw frameworks, finding that only for Type-I, long-lived right-handed neutrinos (RHN) may provide a period of early matter domination for parts of the parameter space, even if they are thermally produced. Such a period leaves distinctive imprints in the GW spectrum in the form of characteristic breaks and a knee feature, arising due to the end and start of the periods of RHN domination. These features, if detected, directly determine the mass $M$, and effective neutrino mass $\tilde m$ of the dominating RHN. We find that GW detectors like LISA and ET could probe RHN masses in the range $M\in[0.1,10^{9}]$ GeV and effective neutrino masses in the $\tilde m\in[10^{-10},10^{-8}]$ eV range. We investigate the phenomenological implications of long-lived right-handed neutrinos for both local and global $U(1)_{B-L}$ strings, focusing on dark matter production and leptogenesis. We map the viable and detectable parameter space for successful baryogenesis and asymmetric dark matter production from right-handed neutrino decays. We derive analytical and semi-analytical relations correlating the characteristic gravitational-wave frequencies to the neutrino parameters $\tilde m$ and $M$, as well as to the relic abundances of dark matter and baryons.</description>

Abstract: The current cosmological paradigm, $\Lambda$CDM, is characterized its expansive description of the history of the Universe, its deep connections to particle physics and the large amounts of data that support it. Nonetheless, $\Lambda$CDM's critics and boosters alike agree on one thing: it is the not the final cosmological theory and they are anxious to see it replaced by something better! After reviewing some of the impactful events in cosmology since the last \Le Workshop, I focus on the role that the recent evidence for evolving dark energy may play in getting cosmology that better theory.</description>

      <title>$\lambda\phi^4$ as an Effective Theory in de Sitter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25826v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Effective field theories (EFTs) provide a powerful framework to parametrise unknown aspects of possible ultraviolet (UV) physics. For scalar fields in de Sitter space, however, new emergent phenomena can arise when the cut-off scale of the theory lies below the horizon scale $H$, as seen in the stochastic formalism of inflation. In this work, we study EFTs that, at leading order, reproduce the standard quartic theory in de Sitter, but with a variable cut-off identified with the mass of an integrated-out hidden sector. We perform the complete analytic computation for the tree- and loop-level matching between the effective $\lambda\phi^4$ theory and two possible UV realisations. We find that when the cut-off is much larger than the horizon, the theory admits a unitary description, up to exponentially suppressed corrections. In contrast, when the cut-off is lowered below $H$, the system evolves into a mixed state and diffusive effects emerge. Nevertheless, at leading order, the EFT remains local and reproduces the same effective quartic coefficient as in the unitary regime. Furthermore, for the EFT matching at the loop-level, the effective quartic coupling changes sign and becomes negative as the cut-off decreases, in agreement with the result obtained from the stochastic formalism. In general, for cosmological EFTs, our findings highlight the role of non-unitary effects and illustrate their regimes of validity, within and beyond perturbation theory.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mass estimates of white dwarfs via electromagnetic methods, often differ from those obtained through gravitational redshift measurements, in some cases with discrepancies ranging in $5-15\%$ across independent datasets. Although many of the discrepancies reported in large spectroscopic surveys and confirmed by high-precision techniques such as astrometric microlensing and wide-binary analyses may be attributable to thermal effects, model uncertainties or measurement errors prevent a complete description of some of the observations. Here, we explore an alternative explanation based on the presence of a gravitationally coupled bosonic scalar field that contributes to the stellar mass while remaining electromagnetically invisible. We construct stationary, static mixed configurations consisting of a white dwarf that presents a bosonic scalar field (dark matter) component, forming a composite white dwarf-boson star system. We explore families of solutions showing that a scalar field fraction $f_{\rm DM} \sim 5-15\%$ to the mass contribution can account for the observed redshift excess. Our models provide a physically motivated explanation for the mass bias, might offer new observational signatures, and allow us to place preliminary constraints on the mass and compactness of the scalar field configuration. Finally, using our theoretical framework in combination with Bayesian model selection we provide plausible bounds for the mass of the constituent (ultralight) bosonic particle.</description>

      <title>Rydberg Single Photon Detection for Probing 0.1-10 meV Dark Matter with BREAD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00145v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a Rydberg-based single photon detector (SPD) for probing dark matter in the 0.1-10 meV mass range (20 GHz-2 THz). The Rydberg SPD absorbs photons produced and focused by the BREAD dish antenna and trades them for free, detectable electrons. At the lower end of the mass range, photons drive Rydberg-Rydberg transitions, which are read out via state-selective ionization. At higher masses, they directly ionize the Rydberg atoms.</description>

      <title>Every Wrinkle Carries A Memory: An Integro-differential Bootstrap for Features in Cosmological Correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00152v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by cosmological observations, we push the cosmological bootstrap program beyond the de Sitter invariance lamppost by considering correlators that explicitly break scale invariance, thereby exhibiting primordial features. For exchange processes involving heavy fields with time-dependent masses and sound speeds, we demonstrate that locality in the bulk implies a set of integro-differential equations for correlators on the boundary. These scale-breaking boundary equations come with a built-in memory kernel in momentum-kinematic space encapsulating the universe's evolution during inflation. Specialising to heavy fields with sinusoidal masses such as those found in axion monodromy scenarios, we show that a powerful synthesis of microcausality and analyticity allows an analytical solution of these equations at leading order in the amplitude of mass oscillations. Meanwhile, we also unveil non-perturbative information in the integro-differential equations by resumming apparent infrared divergences as parametric resonances. In addition, we provide a first-of-its-kind example of numerical bootstrap that directly maps out the solution space of such boundary equations. Finally, we compute the bispectrum and uncover, in the squeezed limit, a scale-breaking cosmological collider signal, whose amplitude can be exponentially enhanced (with respect to the Boltzmann suppression) due to particle production triggered by high-frequency mass oscillations.</description>

      <title>Nucleosynthesis and CMB bounds on photophilic ALPs: a fresh look</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00157v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a fresh look at the cosmological constraints on axion-like particles (ALPs) that couple predominantly to photons, focusing on lifetimes $\tau_{a} \lesssim 10^{4}\, {\rm s}$ and masses $m_a\lesssim 10\,{\rm GeV}$. We consider Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) and Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) bounds and explore how these limits depend upon the unknown reheating temperature of the Universe, $T_{\rm reh}$. Compared with some previous studies, we account for the rare decays of these ALPs into light hadrons and show that this leads to extended constraints for several reheating temperatures. Our limits are cast in a model-independent way, and we identify regions of parameter space where these ALPs could alleviate small tensions in the determinations of $N_{\rm eff}$ and the deuterium abundance.</description>

      <title>Conserved Quantities in Expanding G\"odel Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00238v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: At linear order we study perturbations to a G\"odel background spacetime which includes expansion in addition to rotation. We investigate the transformation behaviour of these perturbations under gauge transformations and construct gauge invariant quantities. Using the perturbed energy conservation equation we find that there are conserved quantities in Expanding G\"odel (EG) Cosmology, in particular a spatial metric trace perturbation, {\zeta} SMTP , which is conserved on large scales for pressureless dust. We intend to extend our discussion to a perfect fluid matter content with a view to also obtaining conserved quantities in this context.</description>

      <title>Deep Chandra X-ray Observations of Abell 2029: the Merger History of a Relaxed, Strong Cool Core Cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present results from very deep (485 ks) Chandra X-ray observations of the relaxed, cool core cluster Abell 2029 (z = 0.0767). A2029 hosts one of the longest, most continuous sloshing spirals ever observed, which we find extends nearly 600 kpc from the cluster core. In addition to providing detailed views of the sloshing spiral, imaging and spectroscopic analysis reveals ICM substructure related to the merger history including a broad ``splash'' of cooler gas and a potential merger shock. The radio lobes of the central WAT source show evidence of alignment with the sloshing motions, consistent with ICM bulk flow, rather than host-galaxy motion, being the primary driver of lobe bending. Comparison to a 1:10 mass-ratio off-axis merger simulation indicates that the observed ICM structures are relics of a second core passage of a subcluster ~4 Gyr after the start of the merger, where the ``splash'' feature is revealed to be a wake of cool gas trailing behind the subcluster. Overall, our results suggest that A2029 is still settling from past interactions -- showing that even the initially most relaxed-looking clusters can be hiding a rich history of dynamical activity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.00253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The AXIS Community Science Book represents the collective effort of more than 500 scientists worldwide to define the transformative science enabled by the Advanced X-ray Imaging Satellite (AXIS), a next-generation X-ray mission selected by NASA's Astrophysics Probe Program for Phase A study. AXIS will advance the legacy of high-angular-resolution X-ray astronomy with ~1.5'' imaging over a wide 24' field of view and an order of magnitude greater collecting area than Chandra in the 0.3-12 keV band. Combining sharp imaging, high throughput, and rapid response capabilities, AXIS will open new windows on virtually every aspect of modern astrophysics, exploring the birth and growth of supermassive black holes, the feedback processes that shape galaxies, the life cycles of stars and exoplanet environments, and the nature of compact stellar remnants, supernova remnants, and explosive transients. This book compiles over 140 community-contributed science cases developed by five Science Working Groups focused on AGN and supermassive black holes, galaxy evolution and feedback, compact objects and supernova remnants, stellar physics and exoplanets, and time-domain and multi-messenger astrophysics. Together, these studies establish the scientific foundation for next-generation X-ray exploration in the 2030s and highlight strong synergies with facilities of the 2030s, such as JWST, Roman, Rubin/LSST, SKA, ALMA, ngVLA, and next-generation gravitational-wave and neutrino networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.00347v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new thermal view of scalar-tensor gravity, in which general relativity is the zero-temperature state of gravity, is applied to the specific subclass of $f(R)$ gravity theories and, specifically, to spatially homogeneous and isotropic universes. Within the limits of application of the new thermal formalism, results on the convergence to Einstein cosmology (or lack thereof) are first obtained for general $f(R)$ theories, and then illustrated with power-law and Starobinsky $f(R)$ gravity.</description>

      <title>Single-Point Search for eV-scale Axion-like particles with Variable-Angle Three-Beam Stimulated Resonant Photon Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00410v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report a laboratory search for axion-like particles (ALPs) in the eV-mass range using a variable-angle three-beam stimulated resonant photon collider. The scheme independently focuses and collides three laser beams, providing a cosmology- and astrophysics-independent test. By varying the angles of incidence, the center-of-mass energy can be scanned continuously across the eV range. In this work, we operated the collider in a vacuum chamber at a large-angle configuration, verified the spacetime overlap of the three short pulses, and performed a first search centered at $m_a\simeq 2.27~\mathrm{eV}$. No excess was observed. We thus set a $95\%$ C.L.\ upper limit on the pseudoscalar two-photon coupling, with a minimum sensitivity of $g/M\simeq 4.0\times 10^{-10}~\mathrm{GeV}^{-1}$ at $m_a=2.27~\mathrm{eV}$. This provides the first model-independent upper limit on the coupling that reaches the KSVZ benchmark in the eV regime and demonstrates the feasibility of eV-scale mass scans in the near future.</description>

      <title>The Atacama Cosmology Telescope: stellar mass growth in massive galaxy clusters from DR5 over the past 7 billion years</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00975v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We probe the stellar mass growth in a sample of 568 Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) selected galaxy clusters with masses greater than $2.9 \times 10^{14} \mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ and redshifts in the range $0.2 &lt; z &lt; 0.8$, drawn from the fifth data release of the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT DR5). By utilising deep photometry from the tenth data release of the Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey (DECaLS DR10), we construct redshift- and cluster mass-binned composite cluster stellar mass functions (SMFs), down to $M_* = 10^{9.5} \mathrm{M_{\odot}}$. This work presents the first analysis of the cluster SMF for this specific cluster sample at this epoch. We find that the characteristic stellar mass ($M^*$) of the cluster SMF evolves marginally from $0.55 \leq z &lt; 0.8$, with most of the measurable growth occurring at $ 0.2 &lt; z &lt; 0.55$. This suggests that most of the massive galaxy population in clusters ($M_* \gtrsim 10^{10.75} \mathrm{M_{\odot}}$) is largely established by $z \sim 0.8$, with subsequent evolution driven primarily by late-time assembly processes. The low-mass slope ($\alpha$) of the composite cluster SMF is flat at high-$z$ ($z \sim 0.8$) but steepens at $z &lt; 0.55$, suggesting an abundance of massive galaxies in high-$z$ clusters compared to low-$z$ clusters. Redshift evolution of cluster stellar mass fractions ($f^{\mathrm{cg}}_{*}$) suggest that cluster stellar mass (from galaxies with $M_* &gt; 10^{9.5} \mathrm{M_{\odot}}$) has grown by a factor of $3.3$ since $z = 0.8$.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the distribution and redshift dependence of host galaxy dispersion measures using localized fast radio bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are enigmatic radio pulses whose origins are poorly understood. The dispersion measure of host galaxy (${\rm DM_{host}}$) provides critical insights into the local environment of FRB sources. In this study, we analyze a sample of 117 well-localized FRBs to investigate the statistical properties of ${\rm DM_{host}}$ and its potential correlations with host galaxy parameters, including redshift, stellar mass, star formation rate (SFR), and galaxy age. Our results reveal that ${\rm DM_{host}}$ is consistent with a log-normal distribution, with the mean $\mu_{\rm host}=5.03\pm 0.02$ and standard deviation $\sigma_{\rm host} = 0.96\pm 0.03$, which corresponds to a median value ${\rm Med}({\rm DM_{host}})=\exp(\mu_{\rm host})=153\pm 3~{\rm pc~cm^{-3}}$. We find a moderate positive correlation between ${\rm DM_{host}}$ and redshift, but no statistically significant correlations are found between ${\rm DM_{host}}$ and stellar mass, SFR, or galaxy age. Our findings highlight the importance of ${\rm DM_{host}}$ as a diagnostic tool for unraveling FRB origins, and underscore the need for future FRB surveys with deep multiwavelength host galaxy follow-up.</description>

      <title>Black holes in a dense infinite medium: a toy-model regularizing the Schwarzschild metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01326v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the dynamics of a black hole accreting energy from a surrounding homogeneous and infinite space. We argue for a simple heuristic modification of the Schwarzschild approximation when the density of the medium is not negligible anymore. The resulting behavior is drastically modified: the mass divergence at finite time is cured and the thermodynamical properties are deeply changed. Some potential consequences for quantum gravity and bouncing models are also pointed out. Those conclusions being mostly obtained from a Newtonian approach, they only aim at guiding toward a more rigorous treatment. Still, interestingly, the behavior is far more convincing that the one usually obtained.</description>

      <title>The Spatial Distribution of Intra-Cluster Globular Clusters in the Fornax Cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01576v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the spatial distribution of the Intra-Cluster Globular Clusters (ICGCs) detected in the core of the Fornax galaxy cluster. By separately modeling different components of the observed population of Globular Clusters (GCs), we confirm the existence of an abundant ICGCs over-density with a geometrically complex, elongated morphology roughly centered on the cluster dominant galaxy NGC 1399 and stretching along the E-W direction. We identify several areas in the ICGCs distribution that deviate from a simple elliptical model and feature large density enhancements. These regions are characterized based on their statistical significance, GCs excess number, position, size and location relative to the galaxies in their surroundings. The relations between the spatial distribution and features of the ICGCs structures, mostly populated by blue GCs, and properties of the intra-cluster light and dwarf galaxies detected in the core of the Fornax cluster are described and discussed. The line-of-sight velocity distribution of spectroscopically confirmed GCs within the ICGCs structures is compatible with the systemic velocities of nearby bright galaxies in the Fornax cluster, suggesting that the ICGCs population is at least partially composed of GCs stripped from their hosts. We argue that the findings here presented suggest that, on sub-cluster scales, different mechanisms contribute to the growth of the ICGC. The western region of Fornax is likely associated with old merging events that predate the assembly of the Fornax cluster. The eastern side instead points to a mix of tidal disruption of dwarf galaxies and stripping from the GCSs of massive hosts, more typical of relaxed, high-density cluster environments.</description>

      <title>Stochastic gravitational wave from graviton bremsstrahlung in inflaton decay into massive spin 3/2 particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01579v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The detection of primordial gravitational waves would offer a direct evidence of inflation and valuable insights into the dynamics of the early universe. During post-inflation reheating period, when the inflaton coherently oscillates at the bottom of its potential, primordial stochastic gravitational waves may be sourced by its perturbative decay into particles of different spins. Assuming the behavior of the potential near the minimum as a polynomial $V(\phi)\sim \phi^k$, where $k\ge 2$, and treating the inflaton as coherently oscillating classical field, we calculate the decay of inflaton into a pair of spin $3/2$ particles accompanied by graviton emission. We numerically study the reheating dynamics and calculate the stochastic gravitational wave spectra. Our analysis shows that the gravitational wave spectra can offer insights into the microscopic physics during inflation.</description>

      <title>Direct detection of solar chameleons with electron recoil data from XENONnT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We reassess prospects for direct detection of solar chameleons, in light of recent progress in modeling their production, and the availability of new XENONnT data. We show that the contribution from Primakoff production in the electric fields of electrons and ions dominates the electron recoil event rate, which is enhanced compared to earlier estimates based on magnetic conversion in the tachocline alone. We argue that the signal is governed by the effective coupling $\beta_{\text{eff}} \equiv \beta_{\gamma}M_e^{-4}$, which encodes the combined effects of production and detection, where $\beta_{\gamma}$ and $M_e$ are the chameleon-photon (conformal) coupling and chameleon-electron disformal coupling scale, respectively. Setting the height of the chameleon potential to the dark energy (DE) scale $\Lambda \simeq 2.4\,{\text{meV}}$, we show that XENONnT electron recoil data set the upper limit $\log_{10}\beta_{\text{eff}}&lt;-6.9$. This limit is independent of the conformal matter coupling $\beta_m$ and index $n$, and applies to the whole class of inverse power-law chameleons, well beyond the $n=1$ case usually studied. We comment on how future multi-target experiments and lower-threshold analyses could distinguish solar chameleons from other light (pseudo)scalar particles such as axions. Our work demonstrates that existing dark matter direct detection experiments can probe regions of parameter space relevant to screened DE models, providing complementary tests to astrophysical and fifth-force searches at no additional experimental cost.</description>

      <title>Light Scalars in Light of UV/IR Mixing: Classicalization via Synergy between Vainshtein &amp; Chameleon Screenings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Effective field theories featuring light scalar fields play a pivotal role in addressing fundamental questions in (astro)particle physics and cosmology. However, such theories often confront hierarchy problems in the absence of a symmetry. Self-completion via classicalization offers a non-Wilsonian approach to ultraviolet (UV) completion, wherein new scalar self-interactions involving derivatives give rise to Vainshtein-like screening around energy-momentum sources. Rather than introducing new UV degrees of freedom to restore unitarity at high energies, these theories reshuffle their infrared (IR) degrees of freedom by generating extended semi-classical objects -- referred to as classicalons -- which decay into a multitude of soft particles. This mechanism incorporates non-localizable fields, thereby realizing a form of UV/IR mixing that is analogous to the dynamics of black holes in gravitational theories. In this article, having reviewed the fundamental principles of classicalization with a simple k-essence model, we then argue the necessity of maintaining a little hierarchy between the scalar mass and the scale of the first new resonances, thereby illustrating the impact of UV/IR mixing on hierarchy problems. Additionally, we investigate the effects of a scalar potential and couplings to fermions on the Vainshtein screening mechanism. We discuss that a chameleon-like screening mechanism must accompany the Vainshtein screening to preserve the integrity of classicalon solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.04169v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cosmic magnification is able to probe the geometry of large-scale structure on cosmological scales, thereby providing another window for probing theories of the late-time cosmic acceleration. It holds the potential to reveal new information on the nature of dark energy and modified gravity. By using the angular power spectrum, we investigated cosmic magnification beyond weak lensing (incorporating all known relativistic corrections) in beyond-Horndeski gravity$-$with both constant phenomenology and dynamic phenomenology, respectively. For both phenomenologies our results show that the total relativistic signal surpasses cosmic variance (considering an SKA2-like sky coverage) in the magnification angular power spectrum at low redshifts ($z\lesssim 0.5$), hence cosmic-variance reduction methods like multi-tracer analysis will not be needed for surveys at the given $z$. For the individual relativistic signals, we found that the Doppler magnification signal also surpasses cosmic variance and remains the dominant signal, at low $z$, for both phenomenologies. However, the integrated-Sachs-Wolfe, the time-delay, and the gravitational (potential) magnification signals, respectively, are subdominant to both the Doppler magnification signal and cosmic variance, at the same $z$; hence multi-tracer analysis will be needed to isolate these signals. At high redshifts ($z\gtrsim 3$), the integrated-Sachs-Wolfe, the time-delay, and the gravitational magnification signals, respectively, appear to surpass cosmic variance and dominate over the Doppler magnification signal for constant phenomenology; whereas for dynamic phenomenology, all these signals diminish significantly and are well below cosmic variance, at all $z$ (consistent with recent quintessence analysis). Suggesting that including time-variation in the parameters will be crucial in identifying the true signature of the beyond-Horndeski gravity.</description>

      <title>K-mouflage at high $k$: extending the reach of $\texttt{Hi-COLA}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00855v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $\texttt{Hi-COLA}$ code is an efficient dark matter simulation suite that flexibly handles the Horndeski family of modified gravity models. In this work we extend the scope of $\texttt{Hi-COLA}$ to accommodate Horndeski theories with K-mouflage screening, allowing for the computation of matter power spectra in the non-linear regime in these models. We explore the boost of the dark matter power spectrum relative to GR-$\Lambda$CDM in K-mouflage gravity, and also discuss how large-scale structure computations change between the Einstein and Jordan frames. A dissection of the relative contributions of the modified background, linear growth, fifth force, and the conformal factor (a new inclusion to $\texttt{Hi-COLA}$) to the boost factor is presented. The ability of $\texttt{Hi-COLA}$ to run with general Horndeski models and multiple screening mechanisms makes it an ideal tool for testing gravity with upcoming galaxy survey data.</description>

      <title>Cross-correlations of the Cosmic Neutrino Background: HR-DEMNUni simulation analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13727v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use the high-resolution HR-DEMNUni simulations to compute cross-correlations of the Cosmic Neutrino Background quantities, like neutrino density, deflection angle, and velocity, with other quantities, like cold dark matter density and effective weak lensing convergence, by accounting for the space-time delay between signals on Earth. We provide this to theoretically illustrate how much can be learned from these cross-correlation signals, once the cosmic neutrino background is detected with instruments in multiple locations. Against a naive expectation of null cross-correlation, we show that the signal is non zero, specially at the largest scales. We also discuss the scenario of co-located cross-correlations between dark matter, weak lensing and a future neutrino-induced photon emission signal. As cross-correlations will be comparable to auto-correlations of the cosmic neutrino background itself and are less affected by cosmic variance and shotnoise, these might be the ones to be measured first. Our predictions thus provide the imprint of what cosmological massive neutrinos, with total mass $\sum{m_\nu} \sim 0.1$ eV, should look like from cosmological observations.</description>

      <title>SPECTER: An Instrument Concept for CMB Spectral Distortion Measurements with Enhanced Sensitivity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12188v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deviations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) energy spectrum from a perfect blackbody uniquely probe a wide range of physics, ranging from fundamental physics in the primordial Universe ($\mu$-distortion) to late-time baryonic feedback processes ($y$-distortion). While the $y$-distortion can be detected with a moderate increase in sensitivity over that of COBE/FIRAS, the $\Lambda$CDM-predicted $\mu$-distortion is roughly two orders of magnitude smaller and requires substantial improvements, with foregrounds presenting a serious obstacle. Within the standard model, the dominant contribution to $\mu$ arises from energy injected via Silk damping, yielding sensitivity to the primordial power spectrum at wavenumbers $k \approx 1-10^{4}$ Mpc$^{-1}$. Here, we present a new instrument concept, SPECTER, with the goal of robustly detecting $\mu$. The instrument technology is similar to that of LiteBIRD, but with an absolute temperature calibration system. Using a Fisher approach, we optimize the instrument's configuration to target $\mu$ while marginalizing over foreground contaminants. Unlike Fourier-transform-spectrometer-based designs, the specific bands and their individual sensitivities can be independently set in this instrument, allowing significant flexibility. We forecast SPECTER to observe the $\Lambda$CDM-predicted $\mu$-distortion at $\approx 5\sigma$ (10$\sigma$) assuming an observation time of 1 (4) year(s) (corresponding to mission duration of 2 (8) years), after foreground marginalization. Our optimized configuration includes 16 bands spanning 1-2000 GHz with $\sim$degree-scale angular resolution at $\sim150$ GHz and 1100 total detectors. SPECTER will additionally measure the $y$-distortion at sub-percent precision and its relativistic correction at percent-level precision, yielding tight constraints on the total thermal energy and mean temperature of ionized gas.</description>

      <title>Globally Stable Dark Energy in $F(R)$ Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08617v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: $F(R)$ models for dark energy generally exhibit a weak curvature singularity, which can be cured by adding an $R^2$ term. This correction allows for a unified description of primordial and late-time accelerated expansions. However, most existing models struggle to achieve this, as they become unstable over certain negative ranges of the Ricci scalar, where either the first or second derivative of $F(R)$ turns negative. These instabilities may disrupt the post-inflationary evolution when the Ricci scalar oscillates about the vacuum state after the $R^2$ inflation. In this work, we introduce a new model-building to guarantee global stability, i.e., the first and second derivatives are positive for all real Ricci scalars. By extending the idea from Appleby and Battye, we demonstrate that viable models can be constructed by imposing a positive, bounded first derivative of $F(R)$ with a sigmoid shape. As examples, we first reformulate and generalize the original Appleby-Battye model. Then, we propose a new dark energy model, which successfully explains the acceleration of cosmic expansion and passes local gravity tests.</description>

      <title>Clustering and Runaway Merging in a Primordial Black Hole Dominated Universe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01890v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: If primordial black holes (PBH) are present in the early universe, their contribution to the energy budget grows relative to that of radiation and generically becomes dominant unless the initial abundance is exponentially small. This black hole domination scenario is largely unconstrained for PBHs with masses $\lesssim 10^9\,\mathrm{g}$, which evaporate prior to Big Bang nucleosynthesis. However, if the era of PBH domination is sufficiently long, the PBHs form clusters and can merge appreciably within these objects. We calculate the population statistics of these clusters within the Press-Schechter formalism and find that, for a wide range of PBH masses and Hubble rates at the onset of PBH domination, the mergers within PBH clusters can exhibit runaway behavior, where the majority of the cluster will eventually form a single black hole with a mass much greater than the original PBH mass. These mergers can dramatically alter the PBH mass distribution and leave behind merged relic black holes that evaporate after Big Bang nucleosynthesis and yield various observational signatures, excluding parameter choices previously thought to be viable</description>

      <title>Searching for a signature of turnaround in galaxy clusters with convolutional neural networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13304v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Galaxy clusters are important cosmological probes that have helped to establish the $\mathrm{\Lambda}$CDM paradigm as the standard model of cosmology. However, recent tensions between different types of high-accuracy data highlight the need for novel probes of the cosmological parameters. Such a probe is the turnaround density: the mass density on the scale where galaxies around a cluster join the Hubble flow. To measure it, one must locate the distance from the cluster center where turnaround occurs. Earlier work has shown that a turnaround radius can be readily identified in simulations by analyzing the 3D dark matter velocity field. However, measurements using realistic data face challenges due to projection effects. This study aims to assess the feasibility of measuring the turnaround radius using machine learning techniques applied to simulated idealized observations of galaxy clusters. We employed N-body simulations across various cosmologies to generate galaxy cluster projections. Utilizing convolutional neural networks, we assessed the predictability of the turnaround radius based on galaxy line-of-sight velocity, number density, and mass profiles. We find a strong correlation between the turnaround radius and the central mass of a galaxy cluster, rendering the mass distribution outside the virial radius of little relevance to the model's predictive power. The velocity dispersion among galaxies also contributes valuable information concerning the turnaround radius. Importantly, the accuracy of a line-of-sight velocity model remains robust even when the data within the $\mathrm{R_{200}}$ of the central overdensity are absent. Single-cluster turnaround radius inference from projected observables seems to be highly challenging. Future progress is likely to require statistical approaches, especially stacking, to exploit cosmological information encoded at turnaround scales.</description>

      <title>Using Gravitational Wave Signals to Disentangle Early Matter Dominated Epochs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03101v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Curvature perturbations induce gravitational waves (GWs) at second order, contributing to the stochastic gravitational wave background. The resulting gravitational wave spectrum is sensitive to the evolutionary history of the universe and can be substantially enhanced by early matter-dominated (eMD) epochs, particularly if they end rapidly. Such epochs can be caused by primordial black holes (PBHs) and non-topological solitons (Q-balls), for example. Prior analysis approximated the end of the eMD epoch as instantaneous or used a Gaussian smoothing. In this work, we present a complete analysis fully incorporating their time-evolving decay rates. We demonstrate that the resulting signal spectra from PBH, thin wall Q-ball, thick wall Q-ball, and delayed Q-ball eMD epochs are distinguishable for monochromatic distributions. We then consider log-normal mass distributions and discuss the distinguishability of the various GW spectra. Importantly we find that the change in the spectrum from a finite mass width is qualitatively different from the change arising from a slower transition to radiation domination.</description>

Abstract: Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) have emerged as a powerful tool for cosmological studies, particularly through the dispersion measure-redshift ($\mathrm{DM}-z$) relation. This work proposes a novel calibration method for FRBs using the Yang-Li-Zhang (YLZ) empirical relation, which links the rotation measure (RM) of FRBs to the luminosity of their associated persistent radio sources (PRS). We demonstrate that this approach provides independent constraints on cosmological parameters, bypassing limitations inherent to traditional $\mathrm{DM}-z$ method. Utilizing the current sample of four YLZ-calibrated FRBs, we derive a Hubble constant measurement of $H_0 = 86.18_{-14.99}^{+18.03}\ \mathrm{km\ s^{-1}\ Mpc^{-1}}$ (68\% CL). Monte Carlo simulations indicate that a future catalog of 400 FRB-PSR systems could reduce the relative uncertainty of $H_0$ to 4.5\%. Combining YLZ-calibrated FRBs with $\mathrm{DM}-z$ sample reveals critical synergies: joint analysis of equalized samples ($N=100$ for both methods) reduces the relative uncertainty of $H_0$ to 2.9\%, mainly because the incorporation of PRS observations substantially mitigates the degeneracy between the parameters such as IGM baryon mass fraction ($f_{\rm IGM}$) and other cosmological parameters inherent to the $\mathrm{DM}-z$ relation.</description>

      <title>Probing the Dynamics of Gaussian Dark Energy Equation of State Using DESI BAO</title>

Abstract: We present an updated reconstruction of the DE equation of state (EoS), $w(a)$, employing the newly released DESI DR2 Baryon Acoustic Oscillation data. This analysis constrains the cosmological scenarios influenced by different models through the joint examination of a range of recently available cosmological probes, specifically the Pantheon+ sample and the DESY5 sample of Type Ia Supernovae, baryon acoustic oscillations, Hubble parameter measurements derived from cosmic chronometers, and cosmic microwave background distance priors based on the Planck 2018 data. Furthermore, we provide a concise perspective on the dynamical evolution of all models (CPL, PADE, GEDE, GDE, BellDE) and their interrelations. A Bayesian inference procedure is adopted to estimate the models parameters that yield the best fit to the data. The EoS remains within the phantom regime at higher redshifts, while favoring the quintessence regime in the current epoch. In this context, we propose a new Gaussian-like form of EoS, termed BellDE, which avoids phantom behavior (\(w \geq -1\)) at higher redshifts while remaining precisely calibrated at lower redshifts. Interestingly, BellDE exhibits a transient phantom nature (\(w &lt; -1\)) around the transition redshift \(z \sim 0.5\), subsequently evolving into a quintessential regime (\(w &gt; -1\)). In particular, the BellDE model provides competitive statistical preference while offering greater flexibility in the redshift regime $z \sim 0.5-1$, where DE is observationally significant.</description>

      <title>DESI and fast radio burst used to constrain modified theories of gravity</title>

Abstract: This paper is devoted to the study of the viability of DESI and the fast radio burst to constrain the free parameters of modified theories of gravity. Thus, we present a model supported in $f(R)$ gravity involving a function of the Ricci scalar named Starobinsky-type with the peculiarity that the non-commutative essence is intrinsic to the coefficients. Additionally, to understand the dynamics within a flat Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker universe, we explore the possibility of deriving a Friedman equation (in measure) that results from an adequate mathematical treatment. As we mentioned previously, to test the outlined model, a Monte Carlo Markov chain analysis is implemented, using cosmic chronometers, type Ia supernovae, Hydrogen II galaxies, Intermediate-luminosity quasars, Baryon Acoustic oscillations and Fast Radio Bursts data, to constraint the free parameters of the model and presenting $H(z)$, $q(z)$ and $\omega_{eff}(z)$. The final results are compared with the $\Lambda$CDM model and a robust discussion is presented about the viability of DESI and fast radio burst to constraint free parameters in specific to a modified theory of gravity.</description>

      <title>Constraining $\sigma_8$ with Lensing Statistics in Low and High Density Regions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09956v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lensing studies are typically carried out around high density regions, such as groups and clusters, where the lensing signals are significant and indicative of rich density structures. However, a more comprehensive test of the cosmological model should also include the lensing effect in low density regions. In this work, we incorporate the stacked weak lensing signals around the low density positions, alongside galaxy-galaxy lensing and galaxy-galaxy two point correlation function to perform a joint cosmological analysis on $\sigma_8$. The low density positions are constructed from the DR9 data release of the DESI legacy imaging survey, using galaxies with r-band absolute magnitude cut M$&lt;$-21.5 and in the redshift range of 0.18$&lt;$z$&lt;$0.28. In doing so, we simultaneously parameterize photometric redshift errors and halo mass uncertainties while building mock catalogs from simulations using the method of SubHalo Abundance Matching (SHAM). For the weak lensing measurements, we use the shear estimators derived from the DECaLS DR8 imaging data, processed by the Fourier_Quad pipeline. The survey boundaries and masks are fully taken into account. Our analysis achieves a total significance of $31.1\sigma$ detection for lensing in the low density positions, which significantly improve the $\sigma_8$ constraint compared to galaxy-galaxy lensing and galaxy-galaxy two point correlation function by 14$\%$. For flat $\Lambda$CDM model, we constrain $\sigma_8$ =$0.824^{+0.015}_{-0.015}$, which shows a good agreement with the PLANCK result. Additionally, the halo mass uncertainty $\sigma_{\lg M}$ and photometric redshift error $\sigma_z$ are constrained to be $0.565^{+0.086}_{-0.070}$ and $0.004^{+0.004}_{-0.003}$ respectively, which are somewhat different from our expectations due to the significant degeneracy of the two parameters.</description>

      <title>Abundance and Phase-Space Distribution of Subhalos in Cosmological N-body Simulations: Testing Numerical Convergence and Correction Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07678v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Subhalos play a crucial role in accurately modeling galaxy formation and galaxy-based cosmological probes within the highly nonlinear, virialized regime. However, numerical convergence of subhalo evolution is difficult to achieve, especially in the inner regions of host halos where tidal forces are strongest. I investigate the numerical convergence and correction methods for the abundance, spatial, and velocity distributions of subhalos using two $6144^3$-particle cosmological N-body simulations with different mass resolutions -- Jiutian-300 ($1.0 \times 10^{7}\,h^{-1}M_{\odot}$) and Jiutian-1G ($3.7 \times 10^{8}\,h^{-1}M_{\odot}$) -- with subhalos identified by HBT+. My study shows that the Surviving subhalo Peak Mass Function (SPMF) converges only for subhalos with $m_{\mathrm{peak}}$ above $5000$ particles but can be accurately recovered by including orphan subhalos that survive according to the merger timescale model of Jiang et al., which outperforms other models. Including orphan subhalos also enables recovery of the real-space spatial and velocity distributions to $5$--$10\%$ accuracy down to scales of $0.1$--$0.2\,h^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}$. The remaining differences are likely due to cosmic variance and finite-box effects in the smaller Jiutian-300 simulation. Convergence below $0.1\,h^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}$ remains challenging and requires more sophisticated modeling of orphan subhalos. I further highlight that redshift-space multipoles are more difficult to recover even at larger scales because unreliable small-scale pairs at $r_{\mathrm{p}} &lt; 0.1\,h^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}$ in real space affect scales of tens of $\mathrm{Mpc}$ in redshift space due to elongated Fingers-of-God effects. Therefore, for redshift-space statistics, I recommend using modified or alternative measures that reduce sensitivity to small projected separations in subhalo-based studies.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Compact Dark Matter Population from Micro-lensing Effect of Gravitational Wave for the third-generation gravitational Wave Detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13577v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Since the pioneering detection of gravitational wave (GW) from a binary black hole merger by the LIGO-Virgo collaboration, GW has become a powerful probe for astrophysics and cosmology. If compact dark matter (DM) candidates, e.g. primordial black holes, contribute a substantial fraction of the DM component across a broad mass range, they would yield distinctive micro-lensing signatures on GW signals. In this paper, based on the third-generation ground-based GW detector, i.e. Einstein Telescope, we propose to constrain population information of compact DM by simulating micro-lensing GWs and analyzing with the hierarchical Bayesian inference framework. For a population with a power-law mass function, we demonstrate that detections of several micro-lensing GW signals in $10^4$ binary black holes coalescence events would constrain the abundance of compact DM to $\sim10^{-3}$. It suggests that searching for and identifying micro-lensing signatures in future detections could be complementary and helpful in constraining compact DM scenarios.</description>

      <title>Constraining the Baryon Content of Cosmic Filaments Using Localized Fast Radio Bursts and DESI Imaging Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19861v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cosmic filaments are thought to host a substantial fraction of the missing baryons at redshifts $z&lt;2$. In this study, we constraint the baryonic content of these filaments using localized Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs). Filaments are identified from the galaxy distribution in the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) imaging surveys using the DisPerSE algorithm. We find tentative evidence ($\sim 3 \sigma$ significance) for a divergence in the relationship between the dispersion measure (DM) contributed by the intergalactic medium and redshift for FRBs whose signals intersect cosmic filaments compared to those that do not, suggesting excess baryons in the filamentary structures. Assuming an isothermal $\beta$-model gas profile with $\beta=2/3$, this discrepancy is best explained by a central baryon overdensity of $\delta_0 = 21^{+13}_{-12}$, broadly consistent with previous simulation and observational results. The inferred baryon fraction residing in filaments decreases with redshift, from approximately $0.25$-$0.30\,\Omega_b$ at $z=0.02$ to $0.15$-$0.30\,\Omega_b$ at $z=0.5$, and $0.03$-$0.04\,\Omega_b$ at $z=0.8$. These estimates are likely lower bounds, particularly at $z&gt;0.5$, due to the limited number of identified filaments and localized FRBs at higher redshifts. We also examine various factors that may affect the statistical significance of our results. Our method offers an independent approach to tracing baryons in cosmic filaments and underscores the importance of expanding localized FRB samples and deepening galaxy surveys, i.e., key steps toward refining these estimates and addressing the missing baryon problem.</description>

      <title>Thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect at the core of CL J1226.9+3332 revealed by NOEMA</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.14048v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present first detailed maps of the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) effect on a $z = 0.89$ cluster with the NOrthern Extended Millimeter Array (NOEMA). The high sensitivity of these observations enabled the effective identification and removal of the millimetre-wave sources contaminating the tSZ signal, thus isolating the influence of the hot electron gas of the cluster on the cosmic microwave background radiation from other emissions. The tSZ observed with success by NOEMA was modelled together with previous single-dish observations (IRAM 30-metre, Green Bank Telescope, and Caltech Sub-millimeter Observatory) to obtain the first core-to-outskirts (from $\sim$ 15 to $\sim$ 1500 kpc) pressure profile reconstruction on such a high-redshift galaxy cluster. NOEMA observations with a high angular resolution have shown that the pressure profile is flat in the core of the cluster. These observations confirm the disturbed nature of CL J1226.9+3332 and map for the first time the distribution of its thermal gas at arcsecond scales in the environments of the central cluster galaxy. Our results showcase the excellent capabilities of NOEMA to complement and enhance the data provided by other millimetre-wave instruments in resolving the core of high-redshift clusters via tSZ emission.</description>

      <title>Beyond CPL: Evidence for dynamical dark energy in three-parameter models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03779v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce two three-parameter extensions of the minimal Akhtar-Hossain (mAH) dark energy parametrization, termed modified minimal AH (MmAH1 and MmAH2), which provide a smooth and bounded evolution of the dark energy equation of state while retaining $\Lambda$CDM as a limiting case. Using a joint analysis of the CMB compressed likelihood, DESI DR2 BAO, $H(z)$, redshift space distortions, and three SNeIa samples (PantheonPlus, Union3, and DESY5), we compare these models with $\Lambda$CDM, $w$CDM, mAH, CPL, and the three-parameter CPL-$w_{\rm b}$ extension. The standard cosmological parameters remain stable across all models, while CPL, MmAH1 and MmAH2 parametrizations yield modest but consistent improvements in fit ($\Delta\chi^2\simeq-6$ to $-12$ for PantheonPlus and Union3, and $\simeq-38$ for DESY5). Statistical consistency with $\Lambda$CDM, quantified via the Mahalanobis distance in one, two, and three dimensional parameter subspaces, reveals mild to moderate deviations, $\sim2$--$2.5\sigma$ for $+$PantheonPlus, $2$--$3\sigma$ for $+$Union3, and up to $4$--$5\sigma$ for $+$DESY5 combination, depending on model complexity. Among all extensions CPL, MmAH1 and MmAH2 provide the most stable and physically coherent representations of dynamical dark energy, maintaining moderate tensions with $\Lambda$CDM and well behaved parameter correlations. Overall, these results indicate consistent evidence for departures from $\Lambda$CDM.</description>

      <title>N-body Simulations of cosmologies with Light Massive Relics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18797v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The presence of additional relativistic particles at the time of recombination can be inferred through their contribution to $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$. If these species have a finite but low mass (Light Massive Relics - LiMRs), they act as a hot subcomponent of dark matter and impact late-time structure formation. Understanding these effects will be crucial to pin down the underlying particle physics properties of any future $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ detection. While their impact has been well-studied on linear scales, this work develops the framework for and presents results from the first set of cosmological N-body simulations that can track the effects of LiMRs, as a function of their mass and temperature, down to fully nonlinear scales. Importantly, our simulations model the impact of both the massive Standard Model neutrinos and LiMRs, which will be crucial in disentangling possible degeneracies. We systematically explore the effects of LiMR properties such as mass, temperature, and initial distribution, on various cosmological observables, including the total matter power spectrum, Halo Mass Functions (HMF), Mass-Concentration relation, radial halo profiles, and weak lensing signals around massive clusters. The framework and simulations developed here will enable detailed follow-up of the rich phenomenology of LiMR cosmologies.</description>

      <title>No Evidence for a Dynamically Evolving Dark Energy Scenario: Tomographic Alcock-Paczy\'nski Test with Redshift-Space Correlation Function II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24089v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We apply an extended Alcock-Paczy\'nski (AP) test to the Sloan Digital Sky Survey data to constrain the dark energy models with the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parametrization of the dark energy equation of state. The extended AP test method uses the full shape of redshift-space two-point correlation funcion(CF) as the standard shape in order to measure the expansion history of the universe. We calibrate the standard shape by using the cosmology-dependent nonlinear evolution of the CF shape in the Multiverse simulations. Further validation of the method and calibration of possible systematics are performed based on mock samples from the Horizon Run 4 simulation. Using the AP test alone, we constrain the flat CDM plus CPL-type dark energy model (flat $w^{\rm CPL}$CDM) to have $\Omega_m=0.289_{-0.029}^{+0.031}$, $w_0=-0.798_{-0.102}^{+0.192}$ and $w_a=-0.165_{-0.945}^{+0.610}$. The result does not show evidence for a dynamically evolving dark energy model. When combined with other results from the low-redshift universe, such as the PantheonPlus supernova compilation and DESI BAO data, the constraint on $w_a$ becomes $w_a=-0.124_{-0.368}^{+0.334}$, which is still consistent with zero.</description>

      <title>Light(ly)-coupled Dark Matter in the keV Range: Freeze-In and Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.03389</link>
      <description>arXiv:1911.03389v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dark matter produced from thermal freeze-out is typically restricted to have masses above roughly 1 MeV. However, if the couplings are small, the freeze-in mechanism allows for production of dark matter down to keV masses. We consider dark matter coupled to a dark photon that mixes with the photon and dark matter coupled to photons through an electric or magnetic dipole moment. We discuss contributions to the freeze-in production of such dark matter particles from standard model fermion-antifermion annihilation and plasmon decay. We also derive constraints on such dark matter from the cooling of red giant stars and horizontal branch stars, carefully evaluating the thermal processes as well as the bremsstrahlung process that dominates for masses above the plasma frequency. We find that the parameters needed to obtain the observed relic abundance from freeze-in are excluded below a few tens of keV, depending on the value of the dark gauge coupling constant for the dark photon portal model, and below a few keV, depending on the reheating temperature for dark matter with an electric or magnetic dipole moment. While laboratory probes are unlikely to probe these freeze-in scenarios in general, we show that for dark matter with an electric or magnetic dipole moment and for dark matter masses above the reheating temperature, the couplings needed for freeze-in to produce the observed relic abundance can be probed partially by upcoming direct-detection experiments.</description>

Abstract: It is common practice, both in dynamical modelling and in idealised numerical simulations, to assume that galaxies and/or dark matter haloes are spherical and have isotropic velocity distributions, such that their distribution functions are ergodic. However, there is no good reason to assume that this assumption is accurate. In this paper we use idealised $N$-body simulations to study the tidal evolution of subhaloes that are anisotropic at infall. We show that the detailed velocity anisotropy has a large impact on the subhalo's mass loss rate. In particular, subhaloes that are radially anisotropic experience much more mass loss than their tangentially anisotropic counterparts. In fact, in the former case, the stripping of highly radial orbits can cause a rapid cusp-to-core transformation, without having to resort to any baryonic feedback processes. Once the tidal radius becomes comparable to the radius of the core thus formed, the subhalo is tidally disrupted. Subhaloes that at infall are tangentially anisotropic are far more resilient to tidal stripping, and are never disrupted when simulated with sufficient resolution. We show that the preferential stripping of more radial orbits, combined with re-virialisation post stripping, causes an isotropisation of the subhalo's velocity distributions. This implies that subhaloes that have experienced significant mass loss are expected to be close to isotropic, which may alleviate the mass-anisotropy degeneracies that hamper the dynamical modelling of Milky Way satellites.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Non-Gaussianity from Neutrino Seesaw Mechanism</title>

Abstract: The neutrino mass generation via conventional seesaw mechanism is realized at high scales around $O(10^{14})$GeV with natural Yukawa couplings of $O(1)$, making the test of neutrino seesaw a great challenge. It is intriguing to note that the neutrino seesaw scale is typically around the upper range of the cosmological inflation scale. In this work, we propose a new framework incorporating inflation and neutrino seesaw in which the inflaton primarily decays into right-handed neutrinos after inflation. This decay process is governed by the inflaton interaction with the right-handed neutrinos that respects the shift symmetry. With the neutrino seesaw mechanism, we construct a new realization of the Higgs modulated reheating, in which the fluctuations of Higgs field can modulate the inflaton decays and contribute to the primordial curvature perturbation. We investigate the induced non-Gaussian signatures and demonstrate, for the first time, that such signatures provide an important means to directly probe the high scale of natural neutrino seesaw. We further analyze the interplay of the non-Gaussianity signatures with the low-energy neutrino experiments, and their interplay with the Higgs self-coupling measurements at the LHC and future colliders.</description>

Abstract: The tiny neutrino masses are most naturally explained by seesaw mechanism through singlet right-handed neutrinos, which can further explain the matter-antimatter asymmetry in the Universe. In this Letter, we propose a new approach to study cosmological signatures of neutrino seesaw through the interaction between inflaton and right-handed neutrinos that respects the shift symmetry. In our framework, after inflation the inflaton predominantly decays into right-handed neutrinos and its decay rate is modulated by the fluctuations of Higgs field that act as the source of curvature perturbations. This gives a new realization of Higgs modulated reheating, and it produces primordial non-Gaussian signatures that can be measured by the forthcoming large-scale structure surveys. We find that these surveys have the potential to probe a large portion of the neutrino seesaw parameter space, opening up a new window for testing the high scale seesaw mechanism.</description>

      <title>Causality and Stability from Acoustic Geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.21169v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In scalar-tensor theories with derivative interactions, backgrounds spontaneously break local Lorentz invariance. We study the motion of perturbations of the scalar, "phonons", on these anisotropic time-dependent backgrounds in curved spacetimes. The phonons propagate on null geodesics of an effective acoustic spacetime which has its own metric and a connection featuring non-metricity with respect to the metric defined by gravity. These acoustic geodesics correspond to motion with four-acceleration in the usual spacetime. We indicate the differences and duality between the phonons' canonical four-momenta and four-velocities, and the analogies with photons in media. For an arbitrary moving observer, we covariantly define the phonon's energy, relative phase velocity, effective refraction index and mass tensor. We point out that true instabilities (ghosts, gradient) are observer independent, being identified by the acoustic metric's signature and determinant. However, apparent instabilities, such as complex phonon energies, can stem from an ill-posed Cauchy problem in certain observer frames. Negative phonon energies appear for supersonic observers, not signaling true instabilities, but leading to Cherenkov radiation. We extend this local picture to a global foliation, deriving the condition for a spatial slice to be a Cauchy surface for a well-posed initial value problem. This Hamiltonian is bounded if the foliation's comoving observer is subsonic. Otherwise, for a Killing vector timelike in both metrics, an alternative conserved charge that bounds motion exists. The action for perturbations yields an acoustically conserved asymmetric energy-momentum tensor (EMT), not conserved in the usual spacetime. Yet, with a timelike acoustic Killing vector, this EMT forms a current conserved in both the acoustic and usual spacetimes, with the acoustic Hamiltonian functional as its conserved charge.</description>

      <title>Interference patterns for simple lens models in wave-optics regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11488v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work studies interference patterns created by simple lens models (point mass, Chang-Refsdal, and binary lens) in the wave optics regime, primarily in the context of lensing of gravitational waves (GWs) in the LIGO band at frequencies around 100 Hz. We study how the interference patterns behave close to the caustic curves which mark the high magnification regions in conventional geometric optics. In addition, we also look at the formation of highly de-amplified regions in the amplification maps close to caustics and how they differ under wave and geometric optics. We see that for a source close to caustics, the oscillations in the amplification factor (their amplitude and location of crests and troughs) can differ significantly in wave optics compared to geometric optics. As we move away from caustics, the wave optics amplification factor starts to converge towards geometric optics one, especially the frequencies at which crests and through occur in the amplification factor, although the amplitude of these oscillations can still be considerably different. For Chang-Refsdal and binary lens with ${\sim}100\:{\rm M_\odot}-200\:{\rm M_\odot}$ can introduce significant de-amplification at frequencies ${\sim}100$ Hz when the source is close to caustics, which may help us distinguish such lenses from the point mass lens.</description>

      <title>Higgs Inflation with Vector-Like Quark Stabilisation and the ACT spectral index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07488v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) collaboration has reported a scalar spectral index $n_s~=~0.9743~\pm~0.0034$. This is substantially larger than the classical prediction of Higgs Inflation, $n_s \approx 0.965$, which is 2.74$\sigma$ below the ACT mean value. We show that when an otherwise metastable Standard Model Higgs Inflation potential is stabilised by the addition of vector-like quark pairs and the potential is renormalised in the Jordan frame, the value of $n_s$ is generally larger than 0.965 and can explain the ACT observation. As an example, assuming the 2022 PDG direct measurement central value for the t quark mass, $m_{t} = 172.69$ GeV, and central values for the SM inputs to the renormalisation group equations, we obtain $n_s = 0.9792 - 0.9844$ for the case of three isosinglet vector-like B quarks with mass $m_{Q}$ in the range 1-3 TeV, with the lowest value of the $n_s$ range being 1.44$\sigma$ above the ACT mean value. The model predicts primordial gravitational wave with tensor-to-scalar ratio $r = 7.87 \times 10^{-3} - 1.21 \times 10^{-2}$ for $m_{Q} =$ 1-3 TeV, which will be easily observable in forthcoming CMB experiments. Observation of vector-like quarks of mass close to 1 TeV mass combined with a large tensor-to-scalar ratio $r \sim 0.01$ would support the model.</description>

      <title>Scatter in the star formation rate-halo mass relation: secondary bias and its impact on line-intensity mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03015v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use the IllustrisTNG cosmological hydrodynamical simulations to study the impact of secondary bias -- specifically, the correlation between star formation rate (SFR) and halo bias at fixed halo mass -- on the line-intensity mapping (LIM) power spectrum. In LIM, the galaxy contributions are flux-weighted, and therefore depend on the luminosity of emission line. We show that the (ensemble-averaged) large-scale two-halo term of the power spectrum depends only on the mean luminosity-halo mass relation if the scatter is uncorrelated with halo bias. However, when luminosity correlates with halo bias at fixed mass, this assumption breaks down. For many emission lines (e.g. H$\alpha$), luminosity is strongly correlated with SFR, making the SFR-weighted power spectrum important to study. In IllustrisTNG, secondary bias increases the two-halo term of the SFR-weighted power spectrum by 5 per cent at $z \sim 1.5$ compared to a model with random scatter. We also find that SFRs of central and satellite galaxies are correlated, enhancing the one-halo term -- which depends on the distribution of SFR inside the halo -- by 10 per cent relative to random pairings. To mitigate secondary bias in the two-halo term, we identify halo concentration (for haloes with mass $\log M_h \lesssim 12$) and satellite mass (for $\log M_h \gtrsim 12$) as effective secondary parameters. These results highlight the need to account for secondary bias when building mock catalogues and interpreting LIM observations.</description>

      <title>Indications of electron-to-proton mass ratio variations in the Galaxy. II. 3 mm methanol lines toward Sgr B2(N) and (M)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04258v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Differential measurements of the fundamental constant mu = m_e/m_p (the electron-to-proton mass ratio) for two sources near the Galactic Center - the Sgr B2(N) and B2(M) molecular clouds - suggest that mu is lower in these clouds than its laboratory value. Based on observations of methanol (CH3OH) emission lines in the 80-112 GHz range (data from the IRAM 30-m telescope), a weighted mean value (Delta mu/mu) = (mu_obs - mu_lab)/mu_lab = (-2.1 +/- 0.6)*10^(-7) (1 sigma) was obtained for Sgr B2(N) at the sample size n = 9. This value of (Delta mu/mu) has the same sign as the result of recent measurements of methanol lines in the higher frequency range of 542-543 GHz (data from the Herschel space telescope) for Sgr B2(N): (Delta mu/mu) = (-4.2 +/- 0.7)*10^(-7) (sample size n = 2).</description>

      <title>Power-Law Bounces in $f(R)$ Gravity: Analysis of the Ekpyrosis and Accelerating Regimes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00242v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of the Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker spacetime within the framework of $f(R)$ gravity using a compact, model-independent dynamical systems approach. By assuming a power-law scale factor, we explore ekpyrotic and accelerating solutions to address the big bang singularity. Our analysis demonstrates that a cosmological bounce, characterized by a transition from contraction to expansion, possibly avoids the singularity without directly using the Raychaudhuri equation, unlike previous approaches using specific $f(R) \simeq R^n$ forms. We identify a key fixed point in the phase space corresponding to the bounce, supported by perturbation analysis and qualitative description of trajectories in the phase space. The results suggest that $f(R)$ gravity provides a robust framework for non-singular cosmologies.</description>

      <title>CosmoBench: A Multiscale, Multiview, Multitask Cosmology Benchmark for Geometric Deep Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03707v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cosmological simulations provide a wealth of data in the form of point clouds and directed trees. A crucial goal is to extract insights from this data that shed light on the nature and composition of the Universe. In this paper we introduce CosmoBench, a benchmark dataset curated from state-of-the-art cosmological simulations whose runs required more than 41 million core-hours and generated over two petabytes of data. CosmoBench is the largest dataset of its kind: it contains 34 thousand point clouds from simulations of dark matter halos and galaxies at three different length scales, as well as 25 thousand directed trees that record the formation history of halos on two different time scales. The data in CosmoBench can be used for multiple tasks -- to predict cosmological parameters from point clouds and merger trees, to predict the velocities of individual halos and galaxies from their collective positions, and to reconstruct merger trees on finer time scales from those on coarser time scales. We provide several baselines on these tasks, some based on established approaches from cosmological modeling and others rooted in machine learning. For the latter, we study different approaches -- from simple linear models that are minimally constrained by symmetries to much larger and more computationally-demanding models in deep learning, such as graph neural networks. We find that least-squares fits with a handful of invariant features sometimes outperform deep architectures with many more parameters and far longer training time. Still there remains tremendous potential to improve these baselines by combining machine learning and cosmology to fully exploit the data. CosmoBench sets the stage for bridging cosmology and geometric deep learning at scale. We invite the community to push the frontier of scientific discovery by engaging with this dataset, available at https://cosmobench.streamlit.app</description>

      <title>A sample of giant radio sources from the NVGRC catalog</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00585v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the results of a search for megaparsec-scale sources in the NVGRC catalog of candidates of giant radio source (GRS) based on the NVSS sky survey. We visually inspected 370 NVGRC sources, as well as radio sources falling within a neighborhood of about one square degree around the target object. In the studied sample, 48% of objects were classified as giant radio sources, 14% as sources with a projected linear size of less than 0.72 Mpc, and 38\% as physically unrelated objects combined by the recognition algorithm into one radio source. We identified 197 gaints, of which 72 radio sources are known GRGs or GRQs, and 125 sources were identified by us as GRS for the first time. Comparing the proportion of FRI giants in four redshift bins, we found that for z&lt;0.05, the proportions of FRI and FRII sources were approximately equal, but already at z&gt;0.15 the proportion of FRI giants decreases sharply. The predominance of FRII giants in the GRS lists is most likely due to observational selection due to the sensitivity limit of existing radio surveys. Comparing the NVSS and VLASS cutouts, we found that 33% of sources can be classified as fadded. 25% of the sources show a restart of the radio source phase. 38% of the sources have deformed radio lobes. Our GRS sample includes 74% of galaxies, 15% of IR-excess galaxies, which, according to the WISE photometric data, can be attributed to quasars, and 11% of quasars. When visually examining the optical survey cutouts, we noted the presence of close neighbors for the hosts and/or their belonging to known groups or clusters of galaxies. Close neighbors at a distance of less than 50 kpc were found for 39% of radio sources, and 28% of sources are part of groups or clusters of galaxies. Thus, about 70% of gaints are in a fairly dense environment, and this proportion may be higher.</description>

      <title>Inflation in $F(R)$ gravity models revisited after ACT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08927v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The $F(R)$ gravity models of inflation are revisited in light of the recent observations of cosmic microwave background radiation by Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) and DESI Collaboration. A detailed study of the evolution equations in the Jordan frame is given and a new description of the slow-roll approximation in the $F(R)$-gravity-based models of inflation is proposed. It is found that all those models of inflation are significantly constrained by demanding a higher (than the Planck Telescope value) cosmological tilt $n_s$ of scalar perturbations and a positive running index $\alpha_s$ favored by ACT. It is not difficult to meet the ACT constraints on the scalar tilt $n_s$ by modifying the existing models of inflation, but simultaneously demanding a positive running $\alpha_s$ would rule out many of them. Using the proposed slow-roll approximation in the Jordan frame, we provide a new modification of the Starobinsky inflation model in the framework of $F(R)$ gravity, which satisfies all ACT constraints. An extension of our ACT-consistent inflation model to the unified $F(R)$-gravity description of Starobinsky-like inflation and production of primordial black holes on a smaller scale is also proposed.</description>
