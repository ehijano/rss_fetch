      <title>Collective modes in an unconventional superconductor with $j=3/2$ fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $j = 3/2$ fermions in cubic crystals or cold atomic gases can form Cooper pairs in both singlet ($J = 0$) and unconventional quintet ($J = 2$) $s$-wave states. Our study utilizes analytical field theory to examine fluctuations in these states within the framework of the Luttinger-Kohn model. We investigate how collective modes evolve with varying spin-orbit coupling (SOC) strength. In the singlet state, quintet Bardasis-Schrieffer modes soften at a finite wavevector, hinting at Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov physics. In the quintet state, we identify additional gapless and gapped modes originating from the partially broken symmetry due to SOC. Our results can be readily detected using current experimental techniques.</description>

      <title>Correlation functions and characteristic lengthscales in flat band superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The possibility of an unconventional form of high temperature superconductivity in flat band (FB) material does not cease to challenge our understanding of the physics in correlated systems. Recently, it has been argued that the coherence length in FB compounds could be decomposed into a conventional part of BCS type and a geometric contribution which characterises the FB eigenstates, the quantum metric. Here, we propose to address this issue in various FB systems and discuss whether the extracted characteristic lengthscales such as the size of the Cooper pairs obey this conjecture. It is found that the relevant lengthscales are less than one lattice spacing, weakly sensitive to the strength of the electron-electron interaction, and more importantly disconnected from the quantum metric.</description>

      <title>Effects of vortex and anti-vortex excitations in underdoped Bi-2223 bulk single crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To gain insights into mechanisms underlying superconducting transition in copper oxide high-transition temperature ($T_c$) superconductors, we studied transport properties of underdoped Bi$_2$Sr$_2$Ca$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{10+\delta}$ (Bi-2223) bulk single crystals. The power exponent $\alpha$ ($V \propto I^{\alpha}$) reached 3 just below $T_c$, and the temperature dependence of in-plane resistivity ($\rho_{ab}$) exhibited typical tailing behavior, consistent with Kosterlitz--Thouless transition characteristics. Thus, with increasing temperature, copper oxide high-$T_c$ superconductors undergo transition to the normal state because of destruction of its phase correlations, although a finite Cooper pair density exists at $T_c$.</description>

      <title>Lifting of gap nodes by disorder in ultranodal superconductor candidate FeSe1-xSx</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The observation of time-reversal symmetry breaking and large residual density of states in tetragonal FeSe$_{1-x}$S$_x$ suggests a novel type of ultranodal superconducting state with Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces (BFSs). Although such BFSs in centrosymmetric superconductors are expected to be topologically protected, the impurity effect of this exotic superconducting state remains elusive experimentally. Here, we investigate the impact of controlled defects introduced by electron irradiation on the superconducting state of tetragonal FeSe$_{1-x}$S$_x$ ($0.18\le x\le 0.25$). The temperature dependence of magnetic penetration depth is initially consistent with a model with BFSs in the pristine sample. After irradiation, we observe a nonmonotonic evolution of low-energy excitations with impurity concentrations. This nonmonotonic change indicates a transition from nodal to nodeless, culminating in gapless with Andreev bound states, reminiscent of the nodal $s_\pm$ case. This points to the accidental nature of the possible BFSs in tetragonal FeSe$_{1-x}$S$_x$, which are susceptible to disruption by the disorder.</description>

      <title>A universal phenomenology of charge-spin interconversion and dynamics in diffusive systems with spin-orbit coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an effective field theory for a unified description of transport in normal and superconducting metals in the presence of generic spin-orbit coupling (SOC). The structure of the quantum kinetic theory in the diffusive regime is determined by a set of fundamental constraints -- charge conjugation symmetry, the causality principle, and the crystal symmetry of a material. These symmetries uniquely fix the action of the Keldysh non-linear $\sigma$ model (NLSM), which at the saddle point yields the quantum kinetic Usadel-type equation. Our phenomenological approach is reminiscent of the Ginzburg-Landau theory, but is valid for superconductors in the whole temperature range, describes the diffusive transport in the normal state, and naturally captures the effects of superconducting fluctuations. As an application, we derive the NLSM and quantum transport equations which include all effects of spin-orbit coupling, allowed by the crystal symmetry, for example, the spin Hall, spin current swapping or spin-galvanic effects. Our approach can be extended to systems with broken time reversal symmetry, as well as to the description of hybrid interfaces, where the spin-charge interconversion can be enhanced due to strong interfacial SOC.</description>

      <title>Disorder-broadened phase boundary with enhanced amorphous superconductivity in pressurized In2Te5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As an empirical tool in materials science and engineering, the iconic phase diagram owes its robustness and practicality to the topological characteristics rooted in the celebrated Gibbs phase law (F = C - P + 2). When crossing the phase diagram boundary, the structure transition occurs abruptly, bringing about an instantaneous change in physical properties and limited controllability on the boundaries (F = 1). Here, we expand the sharp phase boundary to an amorphous transition region (F = 2) by partially disrupting the long-range translational symmetry, leading to a sequential crystalline-amorphous-crystalline (CAC) transition in a pressurized In2Te5 single crystal. Through detailed in-situ synchrotron diffraction, we elucidate that the phase transition stems from the rotation of immobile blocks [In2Te2]2+, linked by hinge-like [Te3]2- trimers. Remarkably, within the amorphous region, the amorphous phase demonstrates a notable 25 % increase of the superconducting transition temperature (Tc), while the carrier concentration remains relatively constant. Furthermore, we propose a theoretical framework revealing that the unconventional boost in amorphous superconductivity might be attributed to an intensified electron correlation, triggered by a disorder-augmented multifractal behavior. These findings underscore the potential of disorder and prompt further exploration of unforeseen phenomena on the phase boundaries.</description>

      <title>Interfacial spin-orbit coupling driven enhancement of superconductivity by parallel magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is commonly believed that time reversal symmetry breaking perturbations such as magnetic field or scattering on magnetic impurities destruct superconductivity and suppress the critical temperature of the superconducting phase transition. However, in the recent experimental studies significant enhancement of superconducting critical temperature by parallel magnetic field was found for several thin superconducting systems [H.J. Gardner, et al., Nature Physics {\bf 7}, 895 (2011); T. Asaba, et al., Scientific Reports {\bf 8}, 1 (2018) ]. Here we present a possible explanation of the observed phenomenon showing that combination of interfacial spin-orbit interaction and external magnetic field can cause the increase of the superconducting critical temperature of thin superconducting film in wide range of magnetic fields. We use the Ginzburg-Landau formalism taking into account Lifshitz invariant originated from Rashba spin-orbit interaction, which is also responsible for the superconducting diode effect. We also calculate the modification of the Little-Parks oscillations of the critical temperature of hollow superconducting cylinder at the presence of Rashba interfacial spin-orbit interaction.</description>

      <title>Nonlocal correlations transmitted between quantum dots via short topological superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the quasiparticle states and nonlocal correlations of a hybrid structure, comprising two quantum dots interconnected through a short-length topological superconducting nanowire hosting overlaping Majorana modes. We show that the hybridization between different components of this setup gives rise to the emergence of molecular states, which are responsible for nonlocal correlations. We inspect the resulting energy structure, focusing on the inter-dependence between the quasiparticles of individual quantum dots. We predict the existence of nonlocal effects, which could be accessed and probed by crossed Andreev reflection spectroscopy. Our study would be relevant to a recent experimental realization of the minimal Kitaev model [T. Dvir et al., Nature 614, 445 (2023)], by considering its hybrid structure with side-attached quantum dots.</description>

      <title>Josephson diode effect in junctions of superconductors with band asymmetric metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14084v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: At interfaces connecting two superconductors (SCs) separated by a metallic layer, an electric current is induced when there is a disparity in the phases of the two superconductors. We elucidate this phenomenon based on the weights of the Andreev bound states associated with the states carrying current in forward and reverse directions. Typically, current phase relation (CPR) in Josephson junctions is an odd function. When time reversal and inversion symmetries are broken at the junction, CPR ceases to be an odd function and the system may exhibit Josephson diode effect. This phenomenon has been studied in spin orbit coupled systems under an external Zeeman field wherein the magnetochiral anisotropy is responsible for the Josephson diode effect. Recently introduced the band asymmetric metal (BAM) model presents a novel avenue, featuring an asymmetric band structure. We investigate DC Josephson effect in SC-BAM-SC junctions and find that band asymmetry can lead to Josephson diode effect and anomalous Josephson effect. We explain the mechanism behind these effects based on interference of plane wave modes within the Bogoliubov de-Genne formalism. We calculate diode effect coefficient for different values of the parameters.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Superconducting Magnetoelectric Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18616v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A supercurrent flow can induce a nonvanishing spin magnetization in noncentrosymmetric superconductors with spin-orbit interaction. Often known as the non-dissipative magnetoelectric effect, these are most commonly found at linear order in supercurrent flow. Here, we argue that a nonlinear superconducting magnetoelectric effect (NSM) can naturally manifest in altermagnet/superconductor (ALM/SC) heterostructures: NSM manifests as a spin polarization generated as a second-order response to a driving supercurrent. Strikingly, we find NSM is the leading order magnetization response in ALM/SC heterostructures and survives even in the presence of centrosymmetry; $C_4 \mathcal{T}$ symmetry in altermagnets zeroes both the equilibrium magnetization as well as out-of-plane linear magnetoelectric response. This renders NSM a powerful electric and non-dissipative means of controlling magnetization in ALM/SC heterostructures, a promising platform for superconducting spintronics.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Chiral Symmetry and Symmetry-Class Conversion in Floquet Topological Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05697v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we discuss properties with no static counterpart arising in Floquet topological insulators with a dynamical chiral symmetry (DCS), i.e., a chiral symmetry which is present while driving. We explore the topological properties of Floquet insulators possessing a DCS which either does or does not survive upon taking the static limit. We consider the case of harmonic drives and employ a general framework using the quasi-energy operator in frequency space. We find that for a DCS with no static analog, the presence of driving has a negligible impact on the topological phases associated with zero quasi-energy. In stark contrast, topological gaps can open at $\pi$ quasi-energy and mainly occur at momenta where the driving perturbation vanishes. We confirm the above general predictions for an extended Kitaev chain model in the BDI symmetry class. Another possibility that opens up when adding the drive, while preserving chiral symmetry, is symmetry-class conversion. We demonstrate such an effect for a static CI class Hamiltonian which is topologically trivial in 1D. By considering a suitable driving, we obtain a CI$\rightarrow$AIII transition, which now enables the system to harbor topological $\pi$-modes. Notably, the arising topological phases strongly depend on whether the DCS has a static analog or not. Our results bring Floquet insulators with nonstandard DCS forward as ideal candidate platforms for engineering and manipulating topological $\pi$-modes.</description>
