      <title>Frequency-Aware Sparse Optimization for Diagnosing Grid Instabilities and Collapses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper aims to proactively diagnose and manage frequency instability risks from a steady-state perspective, without the need for derivative-dependent transient modeling. Specifically, we jointly address two questions (Q1) Survivability: following a disturbance and the subsequent primary frequency response, can the system settle into a healthy steady state (feasible with an acceptable frequency deviation $\Delta f$)? (Q2) Dominant Vulnerability: if found unstable, what critical vulnerabilities create instability and/or full collapse? To address these questions, we first augment steady-state power flow states to include frequency-dependent governor relationships (i.e., governor power flow). Afterwards, we propose a frequency-aware sparse optimization that finds the minimal set of bus locations with measurable compensations (corrective actions) to enforce power balance and maintain frequency within predefined/acceptable bounds. We evaluate our method on standard transmission systems to empirically validate its ability to localize dominant sources of vulnerabilities. For a 1354-bus large system, our method detects compensations to only four buses under N-1 generation outage (3424.8 MW) while enforcing a maximum allowable steady-state frequency drop of 0.06 Hz (otherwise, frequency drops by nearly 0.08 Hz). We further validate the scalability of our method, requiring less than four minutes to obtain sparse solutions for the 1354-bus system.</description>

      <title>ARGUS: A Framework for Risk-Aware Path Planning in Tactical UGV Operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This thesis presents the development of ARGUS, a framework for mission planning for Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs) in tactical environments. The system is designed to translate battlefield complexity and the commander's intent into executable action plans. To this end, ARGUS employs a processing pipeline that takes as input geospatial terrain data, military intelligence on existing threats and their probable locations, and mission priorities defined by the commander. Through a set of integrated modules, the framework processes this information to generate optimized trajectories that balance mission objectives against the risks posed by threats and terrain characteristics. A fundamental capability of ARGUS is its dynamic nature, which allows it to adapt plans in real-time in response to unforeseen events, reflecting the fluid nature of the modern battlefield. The system's interoperability were validated in a practical exercise with the Portuguese Army, where it was successfully demonstrated that the routes generated by the model can be integrated and utilized by UGV control systems. The result is a decision support tool that not only produces an optimal trajectory but also provides the necessary insights for its execution, thereby contributing to greater effectiveness and safety in the employment of autonomous ground systems.</description>

      <title>Distributed Adaptive Estimation over Sensor Networks with Partially Unknown Source Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies distributed adaptive estimation over sensor networks with partially known source dynamics. We present parallel continuous-time and discrete-time designs in which each node runs a local adaptive observer and exchanges information over a directed graph. For both time scales, we establish stability of the network coupling operators, prove boundedness of all internal signals, and show convergence of each node estimate to the source despite model uncertainty and disturbances. We further derive input-to-state stability (ISS) bounds that quantify robustness to bounded process noise. A key distinction is that the discrete-time design uses constant adaptive gains and per-step regressor normalization to handle sampling effects, whereas the continuous-time design does not. A unified Lyapunov framework links local observer dynamics with graph topology. Simulations on star, cyclic, and path networks corroborate the analysis, demonstrating accurate tracking, robustness, and scalability with the number of sensing nodes.</description>

      <title>Evolutionary Analysis of Continuous-time Finite-state Mean Field Games with Discounted Payoffs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a class of continuous-time dynamic games involving a large number of players. Each player selects actions from a finite set and evolves through a finite set of states. State transitions occur stochastically and depend on the player's chosen action. A player's single-stage reward depends on their state, action, and the population-wide distribution of states and actions, capturing aggregate effects such as congestion in traffic networks. Each player seeks to maximize a discounted infinite-horizon reward. Existing evolutionary game-theoretic approaches introduce a model for the way individual players update their decisions in static environments without individual state dynamics. In contrast, this work develops an evolutionary framework for dynamic games with explicit state evolution, which is necessary to model many applications. We introduce a mean field approximation of the finite-population game and establish approximation guarantees. Since state-of-the-art solution concepts for dynamic games lack an evolutionary interpretation, we propose a new concept - the Mixed Stationary Nash Equilibrium (MSNE) - which admits one. We characterize an equivalence between MSNE and the rest points of the proposed mean field evolutionary model and we give conditions for the evolutionary stability of MSNE.</description>

      <title>Synergistic Development of Cybersecurity and Functional Safety for Smart Electric Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The introduction of Smart Electric Vehicles (SEVs) represents an increasingly disruption on automotive area, once integrates advanced computer and communication technologies to highly electrical cars, which come with high performances, environment friendly and user friendly characteristics . But the increasing complexity of SEVs prompted by greater dependence on interconnected systems, autonomous capabilities and electrification, presents new challenges in cybersecurity as well as functional safety. The safety and reliability of such vehicles is paramount, as unsafe or unreliable operation in either case represents an unacceptable risk in terms of the performance of the vehicle and safety of the passenger. This paper investigates the integrated development of cybersecurity and functional safety for SEVs, emphasizing the requirement for the parallel development of these domains as components that are not treated separately. In SEVs, cybersecurity is quite crucial in order to prevent the threats of hacking, data breaches and unauthorized access to vehicle systems. Functional safety ensures that important vehicle functions (braking, steering, battery control, etc.) keep working even if some part fails. This convergence of functional safety issues with cybersecurity issues is becoming more crucial, since a security incident can result in a failure of catastrophic consequences for a functional safety system and, conversely. This paper reports the current state of cybersecurity and functional safety standards for SEVs, highlighting challenges that include the weaknesses of communication networks, the potential security threats of over-the-air updates, and the demand for real-time responsive systems for failure.</description>

      <title>AURORA: Autonomous Updating of ROM and Controller via Recursive Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-time model-based control of high-dimensional nonlinear systems faces computational intractability, while traditional reduced-order model (ROM) control requires manual expert tuning without online adaptation. We propose AURORA (\textbf{A}utonomous \textbf{U}pdating of \textbf{RO}M and Controller via \textbf{R}ecursive \textbf{A}daptation), a multi-agent LLM framework automating ROM-based controller design with online adaptation. AURORA employs five specialized agents collaborating through iterative generation-judge-revision cycles, with an Evaluation Agent diagnosing degradation sources and routing corrections appropriately. Validated on eight benchmark systems spanning mechanical assemblies, thermal PDEs, and robots. Comparative evaluation across five state-of-the-art LLMs demonstrates high autonomy with minimal intervention, establishing practical viability for autonomous control design.</description>

      <title>Experimental Evaluation of Fuzzy-Integral and Classical controls for Power Management in a 24 GHz mmWave 5G Transceiver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The deployment of 5G millimeter-wave (mmWave) systems poses significant challenges in maintaining power amplifier linearity and efficiency under varying conditions, such as temperature-induced gain variations that degrade error vector magnitude (EVM). This paper presents a comparative study of three control strategies-PID, pure integral, and fuzzy-integral (FI)-for adaptive power management in a 24 GHz mmWave transceiver. The FI controller integrates fuzzy logic for handling nonlinearities with integral action for zero steady-state error. Experimental results show the FI controller outperforms others in settling time, stability, and EVM minimization.</description>

      <title>Comparative Study of Q-Learning for State-Feedback LQG Control with an Unknown Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of designing a state feedback linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) con- troller for a system in which the system matrices as well as the process noise covariance are unknown. We do a rigorous comparison between two approaches. The first is the classic one in which a system identification stage is used to estimate the unknown parameters, which are then used in a state-feedback LQG (SF-LQG) controller design. The second approach is a recently proposed one using a reinforcement learning paradigm called Q-learning. We do the comparison in terms of complexity and accuracy of the resulting controller. We show that the classic approach asymptotically efficient, giving virtually no room for improvement in terms of accuracy. We also propose a novel Q-learning-based method which we show asymptotically achieves the optimal controller design. We complement our proposed method with a numerically efficient algorithmic implementation aiming at making it competitive in terms of computations. Nevertheless, our complexity analysis shows that the classic approach is still numerically more efficient than this Q-learning-based alternative. We then conclude that the classic approach remains being the best choice for addressing the SF-LQG design in the case of unknown parameters.</description>

      <title>Optimisation of Power Modulation for Hall-H\'eroult Cells: Process Operability and Constraints as Virtual Energy Storage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aluminium is manufactured through the Hall-H\'eroult process, which is very energy intensive. Power modulation, as an industrial-scale demand-side power management approach, allows aluminium smelters to operate with variable power consumption rates and as such be powered by renewable energy sources. In this way, aluminium smelting cells can be used as a large virtual energy storage to balance power demand-supply and stabilise electrical grids. This paper studies the potential optimal power modulation operating conditions, including time-varying line current and anode-cathode distance (ACD) profiles to maximise the aluminium reduction cell profitability subject to constraints on the cell thermal balance. To deal with the complex cell dynamics which are spatially distributed and multi-timescale, a novel optimisation approach that utilises both reduced-order and detailed models is developed. The results yield insight into the optimal line current and ACD profiles for different power modulation scenarios including the time of use electricity tariff and spot price. These results can form the foundation for further studies into online control policies of aluminium reduction cells.</description>

      <title>From Natural Language to Certified H-infinity Controllers: Integrating LLM Agents with LMI-Based Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present \textsc{S2C} (Specification-to-Certified-Controller), a multi-agent framework that maps natural-language requirements to certified $\mathcal{H}_\infty$ state-feedback controllers via LMI synthesis. \textsc{S2C} coordinates five roles -- \textit{SpecInt} (spec extraction), \textit{Solv} (bounded-real lemma (BRL) LMI), \textit{Tester} (Monte Carlo and frequency-domain checks), \textit{Adapt} (spec refinement), and \textit{CodeGen} (deployable code). The loop is stabilized by a severity- and iteration-aware $\gamma$-floor guardrail and a decay-rate region constraint enforcing $\Re\lambda(A{+}BK)&lt;-\alpha$ with $\alpha=3.9/T_s$ derived from settling-time targets. For state feedback, verification reports disturbance rejection $\big\|C\,(sI-(A{+}BK))^{-1}E\big\|_\infty$ alongside time-domain statistics; discrete benchmarks are converted to continuous time via a Tustin (bilinear) transform when needed. On 14 COMPleib problems, \textsc{S2C} attains \textbf{100\%} synthesis success and \textbf{100\%} convergence within six iterations, with strong decay-rate satisfaction and near-target certified $\mathcal{H}_\infty$ levels; it improves robustness metrics relative to single-shot BRL and BRL+$\alpha$ baselines. An ablation over LLM backbones (GPT-5, GPT-5 mini, DeepSeek-V3, Qwen-2.5-72B, Llama-4 Maverick) shows the pipeline is robust across models, while stronger models yield the highest effectiveness. These results indicate that LLM agents can integrate certificate-bearing control synthesis from high-level intent, enabling rapid end-to-end prototyping without sacrificing formal guarantees.</description>

      <title>An Innovations-Based Data-Driven Kalman Predictor for Predictive Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A recently developed data-driven Kalman filter requires offline measurement of the process disturbance; a requirement that is often unmet for many practical applications. We propose a solution that parametrizes the Kalman filter exclusively using measured input and output data. The key idea is to use the innovations form which naturally accounts for the process disturbance and measurement noise into a single orthogonal stochastic process. Unlike process disturbances, the innovations process can be estimated directly from input-output data via a numerically efficient projection step. The performance of the method is demonstrated using a benchmark simulation.</description>

      <title>Spacecraft Angular Rate Estimation via Event-Based Camera Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a method for determining spacecraft angular rates using event-based camera sensing. This is achieved by analyzing the temporal distribution of brightness events triggered by the apparent motion of stars. The location and polarity of the events are used to infer the apparent motion field of the stars, which is, in turn, employed to estimate the observer angular velocity in the camera frame. This can be converted to the spacecraft angular rates provided an attitude reference. The method is validated through numerical simulation for a synthetic dataset of event streams generated on random spacecraft pointing and rates conditions. The accuracy of the method is assessed, demonstrating its potential to complement or replace conventional rate sensors in spacecraft systems using event camera sensing.</description>

      <title>Multi-layer barrier function-based adaptive super-twisting controller</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article presents an adaptive Super-Twisting Sliding Mode Control framework for uncertain first-order systems, with rate-bounded perturbations, where the bound is constant but unknown. Positive definite barrier functions, when used in self-tuning super-twisting controllers may introduce some conservatism in relation to initial estimations of the perturbation rate bound. Moreover, discrete time implementation of the algorithm does not necessarily guarantee the boundedness of the closed-loop trajectories when sudden changes in the perturbation occur in between two time samples. The salient features of the proposed methodology pertain to extending the use of positive semidefinite barrier functions to Super-Twisting controller adaptation and the employment of a "nested barriers" scheme that ensures boundedness of the solutions even for "unfavourable" perturbations-to-sampling time ratios. The stability of the closed-loop system is assessed via Lyapunov analysis and simulations demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed framework.</description>

      <title>A Unified Theory for Transient Synchronization Stability Analysis of Renewable Dominated Power Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The change of electric power generation - from synchronous generator (SG) to converter - is generally regarded as the second revolution of power system. Different from rotor swing of SG in traditional grids mainly described by the swing equation (SE), the converter dynamics plays an indispensable role in modern renewable dominated power systems (RDPS). The high complexity of the RDPS, including spatial large-scale, nonlinearity, multi-time-scale, and even sequential switching, prevents us from fully understanding its dynamics and assessing its transient stability under large disturbance. Here, a variety of transient switching mechanism models of renewable devices relying on wind or solar energies under low-voltage ride-through are established and unified, which can be perfectly described by a generalized swing equation (GSE) under parameter changes for switching dynamics. The GSE focusing on the dominant phase-locking loop dynamics is similar to the SE. Mainly relying on the mechanical equivalence and the energy conservative principle, a substantially improved equal-area criterion method is proposed. Based on this method, even for large-scale renewable fields, the calculation errors for the critical clearing time are only about 1%. This elegant nonlinear-dynamics-based approach establishes a unified theory including modelling and analysis for the RDPS transient dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.08236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Standard model-based control design deteriorates when the system dynamics change during operation. To overcome this challenge, online and adaptive methods have been proposed in the literature. In this work, we consider the class of discrete-time linear systems with unknown time-varying parameters. We propose a simple, modular, and computationally tractable approach by combining two classical and well-known building blocks from estimation and control: the least mean square filter and the certainty-equivalent linear quadratic regulator. Despite both building blocks being simple and off-the-shelf, our analysis shows that they can be seamlessly combined to a powerful pipeline with stability guarantees. Namely, finite-gain $\ell^2$-stability of the closed-loop interconnection of the unknown system, the parameter estimator, and the controller is proven, despite the presence of unknown disturbances and time-varying parametric uncertainties. Real-world applicability of the proposed algorithm is showcased by simulations carried out on a nonlinear planar quadrotor.</description>

      <title>PE-TSFM: Self-Supervised Time-Series Learning for Generalizable Power Converter Health Monitoring under Unseen Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data-driven health monitoring of power converters remains limited by poor generalization to unseen operating conditions. This work addresses this out-of-distribution (OOD) challenge by building a domain-specific time-series foundation model (PE-TSFM) that learns representations directly from large-scale unlabeled converter data. Unlike generic TSFMs trained on broad time-series datasets, the proposed PE-TSFM is pre-trained entirely on domain data, enabling it to learn the physical relationships unique to power electronics. To further tailor the model to this domain, we introduce a dual-attention mechanism that captures both temporal patterns and inter-channel dependencies. While generic TSFMs primarily model temporal dependencies, the added channel attention captures inter-sensor physical relationships essential for converter degradation analysis. A dataset containing 141 million unlabeled timestamps from an operating power converter is used for pre-training. Experiments show that PE-TSFM achieves 92% accuracy under unseen operating conditions. In contrast, generic TSFMs achieve around 60% and conventional time-series models achieve around 40% accuracy. This result confirms the strong OOD generalization of the proposed PE-TSFM. Ablation studies further verify that the introduced channel attention mechanism significantly improves model performance. In addition, we conduct detailed studies on model scalability, hyperparameter sensitivity, and interpretability to provide a comprehensive understanding of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Extended Time Varying Multi-Cluster Fluctuating Two-Ray Fading Model for Maritime Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent advancements in autonomous and remote operation of maritime vessels necessitates the development of robust and reliable communication systems to support high-bandwidth applications such as real-time monitoring, navigation, and control. Existing communication channel models, including Rayleigh and Rician fading, are inadequate to accurately describe the dynamic and complex nature of maritime communication, particularly for high-speed vessels in coastal environments. This paper proposes an extension to the Multi-Cluster Fluctuating Two-Ray Fading (MFTR) model that also accounts for key phenomena such as large-scale fading, time-varying parameters and Doppler shifts. The extended MFTR model integrates Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs) to capture the time-varying characteristics of the channel, such as phase shifts and delays, while considering physical factors like delay-induced power loss and path loss. The accuracy of the proposed model is assessed in simulation.</description>

      <title>Power Hardware-in-the-loop Interfacing via $\mathcal{H}_\infty$ Model Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an $\mathcal{H}_\infty$ model matching control-based approach to the problem of power hardware-in-the-loop (PHIL) interfacing. The objective is to interconnect a grid simulation and a physical device via an interface in a way that is stable and accurate. Conventional approaches include the ideal transformer method (ITM) and its impedance-based variants, which trade accuracy for stability, as well as some $\mathcal{H}_\infty$ control-based approaches, which do not make use of all the available information in their optimization for accuracy. Designing for transparency, as opposed to accuracy as existing approaches do, would achieve both accuracy and stability, while making use of all the dynamical information present in the idealized interconnection of the grid and device. The approach proposed in this paper employs model matching to formulate the PHIL problem as an $\mathcal{H}_\infty$ control problem using transparency as the explicit frequency-domain control objective. The approach is experimentally validated in a real-time resistive-load PHIL setup, and is found to achieve accuracy levels that are comparable or superior to those of an ITM-based interface.</description>

      <title>Active Short Circuit and Safe Discharge Mechanisms in Multi-Phase Inverters During Critical Failures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The multi-phase inverter has become more complicated, particularly in an Electric Vehicle (EV)'s power train, which requires a robust fault protection system. The proposed active short circuit and safe discharge mechanisms are also included in this work, dedicated to multi-phase converters in failure conditions. With silicon carbide (SiC) power modules increasingly used in high efficiency and high-power applications, the reliability under fault conditions is an extremely important factor. Cascading failures and permanent damage will occur in multi phase inverter systems if short circuit faults are not prevented. The proposed method combines one centralized short circuit detection, active phase shorting and controlled discharge to make these structures more robust. The on chip active short circuit mechanism isolates the affected phases quickly preventing faults from spreading to other areas of the inverter and the safe discharge mechanism controls energy discharged in fault scenarios, which reduces the thermal stress placed on essential components. The experimental results show that the proposed mechanisms can effectively enhance a fault detection performance, system response during faults, and the operation as whole at faults over the several existing methods. These mechanisms are demonstrated to be very important for enhancing the safety and reliability of multiphase inverters, especially for critical applications of such inverters as EV where high operational security is required.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Safety Guarantee for Stochastic Control Systems Using Average Reward MDPs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Safety in stochastic control systems, which are subject to random noise with a known probability distribution, aims to compute policies that satisfy predefined operational constraints with high confidence throughout the uncertain evolution of the state variables. The unpredictable evolution of state variables poses a significant challenge for meeting predefined constraints using various control methods. To address this, we present a new algorithm that computes safe policies to determine the safety level across a finite state set. This algorithm reduces the safety objective to the standard average reward Markov Decision Process (MDP) objective. This reduction enables us to use standard techniques, such as linear programs, to compute and analyze safe policies. We validate the proposed method numerically on the Double Integrator and the Inverted Pendulum systems. Results indicate that the average-reward MDPs solution is more comprehensive, converges faster, and offers higher quality compared to the minimum discounted-reward solution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.08420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scaled Relative Graphs (SRGs) provide a promising tool for stability and robustness analysis of multi-input-multi-output systems. In this paper, we provide tools for exact and computable constructions of the SRG for closed linear operators, based on maximum and minimum gain computations. The results are suitable for bounded and unbounded operators, and we specify how they can be used to draw SRGs for the typical operators that are used to model linear-time-invariant dynamical systems. Furthermore, for the special case of state-space models, we show how the Bounded Real Lemma can be used to construct the SRG.</description>

      <title>Toward a Safety Argumentation Lifecycle for Automated Vehicles: Promoting Communication and Interdependency with System Lifecycle Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the growing number of automated vehicles on public roads, operating such systems in open contexts will inevitably involve incidents. This results from an inherent risk in road traffic, which arises from multiple sources of complexity and can never be fully eliminated. One central challenge lies in developing a defensible case that the residual risk has been reduced to a reasonable level. While a safety argumentation is a common means to represent this case, there is a need to guide its creation and maintenance by adequate processes. In this paper, we derive requirements for a safety argumentation lifecycle based on examining the current state of the art. In particular, the requirement-driven process design accounts for both identified limitations of current process specifications and implicit knowledge contained in related work. Subsequently, we reflect on interdependencies between the resulting safety argumentation lifecycle and the system lifecycle. Moreover, we discuss a gap in literature regarding transparent ex ante risk communication. Correspondingly, we introduce the concept of representation-supported communication that is based on deriving representations from the argumentation with respect to target stakeholders and communication purposes. Finally, we demonstrate how this approach can be integrated into the system lifecycle to facilitate stakeholder communication.</description>

      <title>A bioreactor-based architecture for in vivo model-based and sim-to-real learning control of microbial consortium composition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microbial consortia offer significant biotechnological advantages over monocultures for bioproduction. However, industrial deployment is hampered by the lack of scalable architectures to ensure stable coexistence between populations. Existing strategies rely on genetic modifications, which impose metabolic load, or environmental changes, which can reduce production. We present a versatile control architecture to regulate density and composition of a two-strain consortium without genetic engineering or drastic environmental changes. Our bioreactor-based control architecture comprises a mixing chamber where both strains are co-cultured and a reservoir sustaining the slower-growing strain. For both chambers we develop model-based and sim-to-real learning controllers. The control architecture is then validated in vivo on a two-strain Escherichia coli consortium, achieving precise and robust regulation of consortium density and composition, including tracking of time-varying references and recovery from perturbations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.08561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a promising framework for solving forward and inverse problems governed by differential equations. However, their reliability when used in ill-posed inverse problems remains poorly understood. In this study, we explore the fundamental limitations of PINNs using a simple illustrative case: RC low-pass filters. Showing that while PINNs can accurately predict system dynamics in forward problems, they fail to recover unique physical parameters when solving inverse problems when more than two parameters are approximated. Our findings provide grounds to understand the boundaries of PINNs applicability for parameter discovery in physical systems.</description>

      <title>Provably Efficient Sample Complexity for Robust CMDP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of learning policies that maximize cumulative reward while satisfying safety constraints, even when the real environment differs from a simulator or nominal model. We focus on robust constrained Markov decision processes (RCMDPs), where the agent must maximize reward while ensuring cumulative utility exceeds a threshold under the worst-case dynamics within an uncertainty set. While recent works have established finite-time iteration complexity guarantees for RCMDPs using policy optimization, their sample complexity guarantees remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we first show that Markovian policies may fail to be optimal even under rectangular uncertainty sets unlike the {\em unconstrained} robust MDP. To address this, we introduce an augmented state space that incorporates the remaining utility budget into the state representation. Building on this formulation, we propose a novel Robust constrained Value iteration (RCVI) algorithm with a sample complexity of $\mathcal{\tilde{O}}(|S||A|H^5/\epsilon^2)$ achieving at most $\epsilon$ violation using a generative model where $|S|$ and $|A|$ denote the sizes of the state and action spaces, respectively, and $H$ is the episode length. To the best of our knowledge, this is the {\em first sample complexity guarantee} for RCMDP. Empirical results further validate the effectiveness of our approach.</description>

      <title>Geometric Conditions for Lossless Convexification in Fuel-Optimal Control of Linear Systems with Discrete-Valued Inputs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07711v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Trajectory generation for autonomous systems with discrete-valued actuators is challenging due to the mixed-integer nature of the resulting optimization problems, which are generally intractable for real-time, safety-critical applications. Lossless convexification offers an alternative by reformulating mixed-integer programs as equivalent convex programs that can be solved efficiently with guaranteed convergence. This paper develops a lossless convexification framework for the fuel-optimal control of linear systems with discrete-valued inputs. We extend existing Mayer-form results by showing that, under simple geometric conditions, system normality is preserved when reformulating Lagrange-form problems into Mayer-form. Furthermore, we derive explicit algebraic conditions for normality in systems with cross-polytopic input sets. Leveraging these results and an extreme-point relaxation, we demonstrate that the fuel-optimal control problem admits a lossless convexification, enabling real-time, discrete-valued solutions without resorting to mixed-integer optimization. Numerical results from Monte Carlo simulations confirm that the proposed approach consistently yields discrete-valued control inputs with computation times compatible with real-time implementation.</description>

      <title>SONIC: Supersizing Motion Tracking for Natural Humanoid Whole-Body Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the rise of billion-parameter foundation models trained across thousands of GPUs, similar scaling gains have not been shown for humanoid control. Current neural controllers for humanoids remain modest in size, target a limited behavior set, and are trained on a handful of GPUs over several days. We show that scaling up model capacity, data, and compute yields a generalist humanoid controller capable of creating natural and robust whole-body movements. Specifically, we posit motion tracking as a natural and scalable task for humanoid control, leverageing dense supervision from diverse motion-capture data to acquire human motion priors without manual reward engineering. We build a foundation model for motion tracking by scaling along three axes: network size (from 1.2M to 42M parameters), dataset volume (over 100M frames, 700 hours of high-quality motion data), and compute (9k GPU hours). Beyond demonstrating the benefits of scale, we show the practical utility of our model through two mechanisms: (1) a real-time universal kinematic planner that bridges motion tracking to downstream task execution, enabling natural and interactive control, and (2) a unified token space that supports various motion input interfaces, such as VR teleoperation devices, human videos, and vision-language-action (VLA) models, all using the same policy. Scaling motion tracking exhibits favorable properties: performance improves steadily with increased compute and data diversity, and learned representations generalize to unseen motions, establishing motion tracking at scale as a practical foundation for humanoid control.</description>

      <title>Occlusion-Aware Ground Target Search by a UAV in an Urban Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07822v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper considers the problem of searching for a point of interest (POI) moving along an urban road network with an uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV). The UAV is modeled as a variable-speed Dubins vehicle with a line-of-sight sensor in an urban environment that may occlude the sensor's view of the POI. A search strategy is proposed that exploits a probabilistic visibility volume (VV) to plan its future motion with iterative deepening $A^\ast$. The probabilistic VV is a time-varying three-dimensional representation of the sensing constraints for a particular distribution of the POI's state. To find the path most likely to view the POI, the planner uses a heuristic to optimistically estimate the probability of viewing the POI over a time horizon. The probabilistic VV is max-pooled to create a variable-timestep planner that reduces the search space and balances long-term and short-term planning. The proposed path planning method is compared to prior work with a Monte-Carlo simulation and is shown to outperform the baseline methods in cluttered environments when the UAV's sensor has a higher false alarm probability.</description>

      <title>A Dual-Memory Ferroelectric Transistor Emulating Synaptic Metaplasticity for High-Speed Reservoir Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07830v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The exponential growth of edge artificial intelligence demands material-focused solutions to overcome energy consumption and latency limitations when processing real-time temporal data. Physical reservoir computing (PRC) offers an energy-efficient paradigm but faces challenges due to limited device scalability and reconfigurability. Additionally, reservoir and readout layers require memory of different timescales, short-term and long-term respectively - a material challenge hindering CMOS-compatible implementations. This work demonstrates a CMOS-compatible ferroelectric transistor using hafnium-zirconium-oxide (HZO) and silicon, enabling dual-memory operation. This system exhibits non-volatile long-term memory (LTM) from ferroelectric HZO polarization and volatile short-term memory (STM) from engineered non-quasi-static (NQS) channel-charge relaxation driven by gate-source/drain overlap capacitance. Ferroelectric polarization acts as non-volatile programming of volatile dynamics: by modulating threshold voltage, the ferroelectric state deterministically switches the NQS time constant and computational behavior between paired-pulse facilitation (PPF) and depression (PPD). This establishes a generalizable material-design principle applicable to diverse ferroelectric-semiconductor heterostructures, extending beyond silicon to oxide semiconductors and heterogeneously-integrated systems. The device solves second-order nonlinear tasks with 3.69 x 10^-3 normalized error using only 16 reservoir states - ~5x reduction - achieving 20 us response time (~1000x faster) and 1.5 x 10^-7 J energy consumption, providing an immediately manufacturable pathway for neuromorphic hardware and energy-efficient edge intelligence.</description>

      <title>Algorithm-Relative Trajectory Valuation in Policy Gradient Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study how trajectory value depends on the learning algorithm in policy-gradient control. Using Trajectory Shapley in an uncertain LQR, we find a negative correlation between Persistence of Excitation (PE) and marginal value under vanilla REINFORCE ($r\approx-0.38$). We prove a variance-mediated mechanism: (i) for fixed energy, higher PE yields lower gradient variance; (ii) near saddles, higher variance increases escape probability, raising marginal contribution. When stabilized (state whitening or Fisher preconditioning), this variance channel is neutralized and information content dominates, flipping the correlation positive ($r\approx+0.29$). Hence, trajectory value is algorithm-relative. Experiments validate the mechanism and show decision-aligned scores (Leave-One-Out) complement Shapley for pruning, while Shapley identifies toxic subsets.</description>

      <title>Statistically Assuring Safety of Control Systems using Ensembles of Safety Filters and Conformal Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07899v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Safety assurance is a fundamental requirement for deploying learning-enabled autonomous systems. Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability analysis is a fundamental method for formally verifying safety and generating safe controllers. However, computing the HJ value function that characterizes the backward reachable set (BRS) of a set of user-defined failure states is computationally expensive, especially for high-dimensional systems, motivating the use of reinforcement learning approaches to approximate the value function. Unfortunately, a learned value function and its corresponding safe policy are not guaranteed to be correct. The learned value function evaluated at a given state may not be equal to the actual safety return achieved by following the learned safe policy. To address this challenge, we introduce a conformal prediction-based (CP) framework that bounds such uncertainty. We leverage CP to provide probabilistic safety guarantees when using learned HJ value functions and policies to prevent control systems from reaching failure states. Specifically, we use CP to calibrate the switching between the unsafe nominal controller and the learned HJ-based safe policy and to derive safety guarantees under this switched policy. We also investigate using an ensemble of independently trained HJ value functions as a safety filter and compare this ensemble approach to using individual value functions alone.</description>

      <title>Predict-then-Optimize Method for Seaport Power-Logistics Scheduling: Generalization across Varying Tasks Stream</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Power-logistics scheduling in modern seaports typically follow a predict-then-optimize pipeline. To enhance decision quality, decision-focused learning has been proposed to align forecasting and optimization via end-to-end training. However, most formulations assume a fixed task configuration in downstream optimization, and thus generalize poorly to evolving task structures induced by varying seaport vessel arrivals. We address this gap with a decision-focused continual learning framework that adapts online to a stream of scheduling tasks. Specifically, we introduce Fisher information based regularization to enhance cross-task generalization by preserving parameters critical to prior tasks. A differentiable convex surrogate is also developed to stabilize gradient backpropagation. The proposed approach enables learning a decision-aligned forecasting model for new scheduling tasks while retaining generalization on earlier tasks. Experiments calibrated to the Jurong Port demonstrate superior decision performance and generalization over existing methods with reduced computational cost.</description>

      <title>A Two-Layer Electrostatic Film Actuator with High Actuation Stress and Integrated Brake</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robotic systems driven by conventional motors often suffer from challenges such as large mass, complex control algorithms, and the need for additional braking mechanisms, which limit their applications in lightweight and compact robotic platforms. Electrostatic film actuators offer several advantages, including thinness, flexibility, lightweight construction, and high open-loop positioning accuracy. However, the actuation stress exhibited by conventional actuators in air still needs improvement, particularly for the widely used three-phase electrode design. To enhance the output performance of actuators, this paper presents a two-layer electrostatic film actuator with an integrated brake. By alternately distributing electrodes on both the top and bottom layers, a smaller effective electrode pitch is achieved under the same fabrication constraints, resulting in an actuation stress of approximately 241~N/m$^2$, representing a 90.5\% improvement over previous three-phase actuators operating in air. Furthermore, its integrated electrostatic adhesion mechanism enables load retention under braking mode. Several demonstrations, including a tug-of-war between a conventional single-layer actuator and the proposed two-layer actuator, a payload operation, a one-degree-of-freedom robotic arm, and a dual-mode gripper, were conducted to validate the actuator's advantageous capabilities in both actuation and braking modes.</description>

      <title>Model Predictive Control via Probabilistic Inference: A Tutorial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Model Predictive Control (MPC) is a fundamental framework for optimizing robot behavior over a finite future horizon. While conventional numerical optimization methods can efficiently handle simple dynamics and cost structures, they often become intractable for the nonlinear or non-differentiable systems commonly encountered in robotics. This article provides a tutorial on probabilistic inference-based MPC, presenting a unified theoretical foundation and a comprehensive overview of representative methods. Probabilistic inference-based MPC approaches, such as Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) control, have gained significant attention by reinterpreting optimal control as a problem of probabilistic inference. Rather than relying on gradient-based numerical optimization, these methods estimate optimal control distributions through sampling-based techniques, accommodating arbitrary cost functions and dynamics. We first derive the optimal control distribution from the standard optimal control problem, elucidating its probabilistic interpretation and key characteristics. The widely used MPPI algorithm is then derived as a practical example, followed by discussions on prior and variational distribution design, tuning principles, and theoretical aspects. This article aims to serve as a systematic guide for researchers and practitioners seeking to understand, implement, and extend these methods in robotics and beyond.</description>

Abstract: Zhong-Ping Jiang devoted a large part of his work to the study of the stability properties of interconnected systems. In this short paper we celebrate Zhong-Ping Jiang's 60th birthday by studying a special class of families of interconnected systems: the so-called strings. We develop trajectory-based and Lyapunov-based tools that allow the verification of string stability to homogeneous bidirectional strings. The obtained results are applied to the problem of cruise controller design for a string of vehicles.</description>

      <title>Nash-equilibrium Seeking Algorithm for Power-Allocation Games on Networks of International Relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08033v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the field of international security, understanding the strategic interactions between countries within a networked context is crucial. Our previous research has introduced a ``games-on-signed graphs'' framework~\cite{LiMorse2022} to analyze these interactions. While the framework is intended to be basic and general, there is much left to be explored, particularly in capturing the complexity of strategic scenarios in international relations. Our paper aims to fill this gap in two key ways. First, we modify the existing preference axioms to allow for a more nuanced understanding of how countries pursue self-survival, defense of allies, and offense toward adversaries. Second, we introduce a novel algorithm that proves the existence of a pure-strategy Nash equilibrium for these revised games. To validate our model, we employ historical data from the year 1940 as the game input and predict countries' survivability. Our contributions thus extend the real-world applicability of the original framework, offering a more comprehensive view of strategic interactions in a networked security environment.</description>

      <title>Re$^{\text{2}}$MaP: Macro Placement by Recursively Prototyping and Packing Tree-based Relocating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08054v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work introduces the Re$^{\text{2}}$MaP method, which generates expert-quality macro placements through recursively prototyping and packing tree-based relocating. We first perform multi-level macro grouping and PPA-aware cell clustering to produce a unified connection matrix that captures both wirelength and dataflow among macros and clusters. Next, we use DREAMPlace to build a mixed-size placement prototype and obtain reference positions for each macro and cluster. Based on this prototype, we introduce ABPlace, an angle-based analytical method that optimizes macro positions on an ellipse to distribute macros uniformly near chip periphery, while optimizing wirelength and dataflow. A packing tree-based relocating procedure is then designed to jointly adjust the locations of macro groups and the macros within each group, by optimizing an expertise-inspired cost function that captures various design constraints through evolutionary search. Re$^{\text{2}}$MaP repeats the above process: Only a subset of macro groups are positioned in each iteration, and the remaining macros are deferred to the next iteration to improve the prototype's accuracy. Using a well-established backend flow with sufficient timing optimizations, Re$^{\text{2}}$MaP achieves up to 22.22% (average 10.26%) improvement in worst negative slack (WNS) and up to 97.91% (average 33.97%) improvement in total negative slack (TNS) compared to the state-of-the-art academic placer Hier-RTLMP. It also ranks higher on WNS, TNS, power, design rule check (DRC) violations, and runtime than the conference version ReMaP, across seven tested cases.

      <title>HardFlow: Hard-Constrained Sampling for Flow-Matching Models via Trajectory Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08425v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion and flow-matching have emerged as powerful methodologies for generative modeling, with remarkable success in capturing complex data distributions and enabling flexible guidance at inference time. Many downstream applications, however, demand enforcing hard constraints on generated samples (for example, robot trajectories must avoid obstacles), a requirement that goes beyond simple guidance. Prevailing projection-based approaches constrain the entire sampling path to the constraint manifold, which is overly restrictive and degrades sample quality. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework that reformulates hard-constrained sampling as a trajectory optimization problem. Our key insight is to leverage numerical optimal control to steer the sampling trajectory so that constraints are satisfied precisely at the terminal time. By exploiting the underlying structure of flow-matching models and adopting techniques from model predictive control, we transform this otherwise complex constrained optimization problem into a tractable surrogate that can be solved efficiently and effectively. Furthermore, this trajectory optimization perspective offers significant flexibility beyond mere constraint satisfaction, allowing for the inclusion of integral costs to minimize distribution shift and terminal objectives to further enhance sample quality, all within a unified framework. We provide a control-theoretic analysis of our method, establishing bounds on the approximation error between our tractable surrogate and the ideal formulation. Extensive experiments across diverse domains, including robotics (planning), partial differential equations (boundary control), and vision (text-guided image editing), demonstrate that our algorithm, which we name $\textit{HardFlow}$, substantially outperforms existing methods in both constraint satisfaction and sample quality.</description>

      <title>Understanding Electro-communication and Electro-sensing in Weakly Electric Fish using Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Weakly electric fish, like Gnathonemus petersii, use a remarkable electrical modality for active sensing and communication, but studying their rich electrosensing and electrocommunication behavior and associated neural activity in naturalistic settings remains experimentally challenging. Here, we present a novel biologically-inspired computational framework to study these behaviors, where recurrent neural network (RNN) based artificial agents trained via multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) learn to modulate their electric organ discharges (EODs) and movement patterns to collectively forage in virtual environments. Trained agents demonstrate several emergent features consistent with real fish collectives, including heavy tailed EOD interval distributions, environmental context dependent shifts in EOD interval distributions, and social interaction patterns like freeloading, where agents reduce their EOD rates while benefiting from neighboring agents' active sensing. A minimal two-fish assay further isolates the role of electro-communication, showing that access to conspecific EODs and relative dominance jointly shape foraging success. Notably, these behaviors emerge through evolution-inspired rewards for individual fitness and emergent inter-agent interactions, rather than through rewarding agents explicitly for social interactions. Our work has broad implications for the neuroethology of weakly electric fish, as well as other social, communicating animals in which extensive recordings from multiple individuals, and thus traditional data-driven modeling, are infeasible.</description>

      <title>Solving Quadratic Programs with Slack Variables via ADMM without Increasing the Problem Size</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Proximal methods such as the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) are effective at solving constrained quadratic programs (QPs). To tackle infeasible QPs, slack variables are often introduced to ensure feasibility, which changes the structure of the problem, increases its size, and slows down numerical resolution. In this letter, we propose a simple ADMM scheme to tackle QPs with slack variables without increasing the size of the original problem. The only modification is a slightly different projection in the z-update, while the rest of the algorithm remains standard. We prove that the method is equivalent to applying ADMM to the QP with additional slack variables, even though slack variables are not added. Numerical experiments show speedups of the approach.</description>

      <title>Safe and Optimal Learning from Preferences via Weighted Temporal Logic with Applications in Robotics and Formula 1</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.08502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous systems increasingly rely on human feedback to align their behavior, expressed as pairwise comparisons, rankings, or demonstrations. While existing methods can adapt behaviors, they often fail to guarantee safety in safety-critical domains. We propose a safety-guaranteed, optimal, and efficient approach to solve the learning problem from preferences, rankings, or demonstrations using Weighted Signal Temporal Logic (WSTL). WSTL learning problems, when implemented naively, lead to multi-linear constraints in the weights to be learned. By introducing structural pruning and log-transform procedures, we reduce the problem size and recast the problem as a Mixed-Integer Linear Program while preserving safety guarantees. Experiments on robotic navigation and real-world Formula 1 data demonstrate that the method effectively captures nuanced preferences and models complex task objectives.</description>

      <title>MIMO Communications with 1-bit RIS: Asymptotic Analysis and Over-the-Air Channel Diagonalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08534v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an asymptotic analysis of Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) systems assisted by a 1-bit Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) under Ricean fading conditions. Using random matrix theory, we show that, in the asymptotic regime, the dominant singular values and vectors of the transmitter-RIS and RIS-receiver channels converge to their deterministic Line-of-Sight (LoS) components, almost irrespective of the Ricean factors. This enables RIS phase configuration using only LoS information through a closed-form Sign Alignment (SA) rule that maximizes the channel gain. Furthermore, when the RIS is asymptotically larger than the transceiver arrays, proper RIS configuration can render the end-to-end MIMO channel in the capacity formula asymptotically diagonal, thereby eliminating inter-stream interference and enabling Over-The-Air (OTA) spatial multiplexing without channel knowledge at the transmitter. Building on this result, a waterfilling-inspired SA algorithm that allocates RIS elements to spatial streams, based on the asymptotic singular values and statistical channel parameters, is proposed. Simulation results validate the theoretical analyses, demonstrating that the proposed schemes achieve performance comparable to conventional Riemannian manifold optimization, but with orders of magnitude lower runtime.</description>

      <title>Lyapunov-Krasovskii Functionals of Robust Type for the Stability Analysis in Time-Delay Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16738v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inspired by the widespread concept of Lyapunov-Krasovskii functionals of complete type, this article proposes an alternative class of functionals, termed Lyapunov-Krasovskii functionals of robust type. Their construction aims at improving deducible robustness bounds of linear systems with a constant delay. These refer to bounds on nonlinear or uncertain terms that can be added to the system without compromising the proof of stability. The defining equation of complete-type functionals relies on the template of a Lyapunov equation. In contrast, the proposed functionals are related to an algebraic Riccati equation. The article proves properties that make these functionals suitable tools for the stability analysis via Lyapunov arguments. The derived linear bounds on the norm of admissible perturbations mirror bounds from the small gain theorem or the complex stability radius. More general sector-based absolute stability bounds can also be addressed. Existence of the functionals is proven via the Kalman-Yakubovich-Popov lemma combined with a splitting approach. In particular, for any asymptotically stable nominal system, there exists a Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional of robust type that proves a nonzero bound on admissible perturbations. This robustness bound significantly improves results from complete-type functionals.</description>

      <title>Disturbance-Adaptive Data-Driven Predictive Control: Trading Comfort Violations for Savings in Building Climate Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09238v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Model Predictive Control (MPC) has demonstrated significant potential in improving energy efficiency in building climate control, outperforming traditional controllers commonly used in modern building management systems. Among MPC variants, Data-driven Predictive Control (DPC) offers the advantage of modeling building dynamics directly from data, thereby substantially reducing commissioning efforts. However, inevitable model uncertainties and measurement noise can result in comfort violations, even with dedicated MPC setups. This paper introduces a Disturbance-Adaptive DPC (DAD-DPC) framework that ensures asymptotic satisfaction of predefined violation bounds without knowing the uncertainty and noise distributions. The framework employs a data-driven pipeline based on Willems' Fundamental Lemma and conformal prediction for application in building climate control. The proposed DAD-DPC framework was validated through four building cases using the high-fidelity BOPTEST simulation platform and an occupied campus building, Polydome. DAD-DPC successfully regulated the average comfort violations to meet pre-defined bounds. Notably, the 5%-violation DAD-DPC setup achieved 30.1%/11.2%/27.1%/20.5% energy savings compared to default controllers across four cases. These results demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in balancing energy consumption and comfort violations, offering a practical solution for building climate control applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02057v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Navigating a collision-free, optimal path for a robot poses a perpetual challenge, particularly in the presence of moving objects such as humans. In this study, we formulate the problem of finding an optimal path as a stochastic optimal control problem. However, obtaining a solution to this problem is nontrivial. Therefore, we consider a simplified problem, which is more tractable. For this simplified formulation, we are able to solve the corresponding Bellman equation. However, the solution obtained from the simplified problem does not sufficiently address the original problem of interest. To address the full problem, we propose a numerical procedure where we solve an optimization problem at each sampling instant. The solution to the simplified problem is integrated into the online formulation as a final-state penalty. We illustrate the efficiency of the proposed method using a numerical example.</description>

      <title>A Novel Online Pseudospectral Method for Approximation of Nonlinear Systems Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07234v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This note presents an online pseudospectral method for system identification using Chebyshev polynomial basis under aperiodic sampling. The system dynamics are approximated piecewise by introducing a sliding time window. The number of sampling instants (Chebyshev nodes) within each sliding window is selected dynamically based on a proposed node-selection criterion that guarantees desired approximation accuracy. The system states are measured at these aperiodic instants and used to estimate the coefficients of the basis polynomials using least squares. An adaptive state estimator is also proposed to reconstruct the continuous states using the approximated dynamics. The boundedness of the parameter and state estimation errors is proven analytically and validated numerically.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.05757v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a differentiable framework for zero-shot adaptive control over parametric families of nonlinear dynamical systems. Our approach integrates a function encoder-based neural ODE (FE-NODE) for modeling system dynamics with a differentiable predictive control (DPC) for offline self-supervised learning of explicit control policies. The FE-NODE captures nonlinear behaviors in state transitions and enables zero-shot adaptation to new systems without retraining, while the DPC efficiently learns control policies across system parameterizations, thus eliminating costly online optimization common in classical model predictive control. We demonstrate the efficiency, accuracy, and online adaptability of the proposed method across a range of nonlinear systems with varying parametric scenarios, highlighting its potential as a general-purpose tool for fast zero-shot adaptive control.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.06873v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Discrete-time stochastic systems with continuous spaces are hard to verify and control, even with MDP abstractions due to the curse of dimensionality. We propose an abstraction-based framework with robust dynamic programming mappings that deliver control strategies with provable lower bounds on temporal-logic satisfaction, quantified via approximate stochastic simulation relations. Exploiting decoupled dynamics, we reveal a Canonical Polyadic Decomposition tensor structure in value functions that makes dynamic programming scalable. The proposed method provides correct-by-design probabilistic guarantees for temporal logic specifications. We validate our results on continuous-state linear stochastic systems.</description>

      <title>QP Chaser: Polynomial Trajectory Generation for Autonomous Aerial Tracking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.14273v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Maintaining the visibility of the target is one of the major objectives of aerial tracking missions. This paper proposes a target-visible trajectory planning pipeline using quadratic programming. Our approach can handle various tracking settings, including single and dual target following and both static and dynamic environments, unlike other works that focus on a single specific setup. In contrast to other studies that fully trust the predicted trajectory of the target and consider only the visibility of the center of the target, our pipeline considers error in target path prediction and the entire body of the target to maintain the target visibility robustly. First, a prediction module uses a sample-check strategy to quickly calculate the reachable areas of moving objects, which represent the areas their bodies can reach, considering obstacles. Subsequently, the planning module formulates a single QP problem, considering path homotopy, to generate a tracking trajectory that maximizes the visibility of the target's reachable area among obstacles. The performance of the planner is validated in multiple scenarios, through high-fidelity simulations and real-world experiments.</description>

      <title>Certified Robust Invariant Polytope Training in Neural Controlled ODEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01273v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a nonlinear control system modeled as an ordinary differential equation subject to disturbance, with a state feedback controller parameterized as a feedforward neural network. We propose a framework for training controllers with certified robust forward invariant polytopes, where any trajectory initialized inside the polytope remains within the polytope, regardless of the disturbance. First, we parameterize a family of lifted control systems in a higher dimensional space, where the original neural controlled system evolves on an invariant subspace of each lifted system. We use interval analysis and neural network verifiers to further construct a family of lifted embedding systems, carefully capturing the knowledge of this invariant subspace. If the vector field of any lifted embedding system satisfies a sign constraint at a single point, then a certain convex polytope of the original system is robustly forward invariant. Treating the neural network controller and the lifted system parameters as variables, we propose an algorithm to train controllers with certified forward invariant polytopes in the closed-loop control system. Through two examples, we demonstrate how the simplicity of the sign constraint allows our approach to scale with system dimension to over $50$ states, and outperform state-of-the-art Lyapunov-based sampling approaches in runtime.</description>

      <title>SCoTT: Strategic Chain-of-Thought Tasking for Wireless-Aware Robot Navigation in Digital Twins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18212v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Path planning under wireless performance constraints is a complex challenge in robot navigation. However, naively incorporating such constraints into classical planning algorithms often incurs prohibitive search costs. In this paper, we propose SCoTT, a wireless-aware path planning framework that leverages vision-language models (VLMs) to co-optimize average path gains and trajectory length using wireless heatmap images and ray-tracing data from a digital twin (DT). At the core of our framework is Strategic Chain-of-Thought Tasking (SCoTT), a novel prompting paradigm that decomposes the exhaustive search problem into structured subtasks, each solved via chain-of-thought prompting. To establish strong baselines, we compare classical A* and wireless-aware extensions of it, and derive DP-WA*, an optimal, iterative dynamic programming algorithm that incorporates all path gains and distance metrics from the DT, but at significant computational cost. In extensive experiments, we show that SCoTT achieves path gains within 2% of DP-WA* while consistently generating shorter trajectories. Moreover, SCoTT's intermediate outputs can be used to accelerate DP-WA* by reducing its search space, saving up to 62% in execution time. We validate our framework using four VLMs, demonstrating effectiveness across both large and small models, thus making it applicable to a wide range of compact models at low inference cost. We also show the practical viability of our approach by deploying SCoTT as a ROS node within Gazebo simulations. Finally, we discuss data acquisition pipelines, compute requirements, and deployment considerations for VLMs in 6G-enabled DTs, underscoring the potential of natural language interfaces for wireless-aware navigation in real-world applications.</description>

      <title>On the Surprising Effectiveness of Spectral Clipping in Learning Stable Linear and Latent-Linear Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01168v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When learning stable linear dynamical systems from data, three important properties are desirable: i) predictive accuracy, ii) verifiable stability, and iii) computational efficiency. Unconstrained minimization of prediction errors leads to high accuracy and efficiency but cannot guarantee stability. Existing methods to enforce stability often preserve accuracy, but do so only at the cost of increased computation. In this work, we investigate if a seemingly-naive procedure can simultaneously offer all three desiderata. Specifically, we consider a post-hoc procedure in which we surgically manipulate the spectrum of the linear system after it was learned using unconstrained least squares. We call this approach spectral clipping (SC) as it involves eigen decomposition and subsequent reconstruction of the system matrix after any eigenvalues whose magnitude exceeds one have been clipped to one (without altering the eigenvectors). We also show that SC can be readily combined with Koopman operators to learn nonlinear dynamical systems that can generate stable predictions of nonlinear phenomena, such as those underlying complex dexterous manipulation skills involving multi-fingered robotic hands. Through comprehensive experiments involving two different applications and publicly available benchmark datasets, we show that this simple technique can efficiently learn highly-accurate predictive dynamics that are provably-stable. Notably, we find that SC can match or outperform strong baselines while being orders-of-magnitude faster. Finally, we find that SC can learn stable robot policies even when the training data includes unsuccessful or truncated demonstrations. Our code and datasets can be found at https://github.com/GT-STAR-Lab/spec_clip.</description>

      <title>On the Convergence and Stability of Upside-Down Reinforcement Learning, Goal-Conditioned Supervised Learning, and Online Decision Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05672v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article provides a rigorous analysis of convergence and stability of Episodic Upside-Down Reinforcement Learning, Goal-Conditioned Supervised Learning and Online Decision Transformers. These algorithms performed competitively across various benchmarks, from games to robotic tasks, but their theoretical understanding is limited to specific environmental conditions. This work initiates a theoretical foundation for algorithms that build on the broad paradigm of approaching reinforcement learning through supervised learning or sequence modeling. At the core of this investigation lies the analysis of conditions on the underlying environment, under which the algorithms can identify optimal solutions. We also assess whether emerging solutions remain stable in situations where the environment is subject to tiny levels of noise. Specifically, we study the continuity and asymptotic convergence of command-conditioned policies, values and the goal-reaching objective depending on the transition kernel of the underlying Markov Decision Process. We demonstrate that near-optimal behavior is achieved if the transition kernel is located in a sufficiently small neighborhood of a deterministic kernel. The mentioned quantities are continuous (with respect to a specific topology) at deterministic kernels, both asymptotically and after a finite number of learning cycles. The developed methods allow us to present the first explicit estimates on the convergence and stability of policies and values in terms of the underlying transition kernels. On the theoretical side we introduce a number of new concepts to reinforcement learning, like working in segment spaces, studying continuity in quotient topologies and the application of the fixed-point theory of dynamical systems. The theoretical study is accompanied by a detailed investigation of example environments and numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Optimism as Risk-Seeking in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24047v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Risk sensitivity has become a central theme in reinforcement learning (RL), where convex risk measures and robust formulations provide principled ways to model preferences beyond expected return. Recent extensions to multi-agent RL (MARL) have largely emphasized the risk-averse setting, prioritizing robustness to uncertainty. In cooperative MARL, however, such conservatism often leads to suboptimal equilibria, and a parallel line of work has shown that optimism can promote cooperation. Existing optimistic methods, though effective in practice, are typically heuristic and lack theoretical grounding. Building on the dual representation for convex risk measures, we propose a principled framework that interprets risk-seeking objectives as optimism. We introduce optimistic value functions, which formalize optimism as divergence-penalized risk-seeking evaluations. Building on this foundation, we derive a policy-gradient theorem for optimistic value functions, including explicit formulas for the entropic risk/KL-penalty setting, and develop decentralized optimistic actor-critic algorithms that implement these updates. Empirical results on cooperative benchmarks demonstrate that risk-seeking optimism consistently improves coordination over both risk-neutral baselines and heuristic optimistic methods. Our framework thus unifies risk-sensitive learning and optimism, offering a theoretically grounded and practically effective approach to cooperation in MARL.</description>
