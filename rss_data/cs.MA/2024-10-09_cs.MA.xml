      <title>Online Dynamic Pricing for Electric Vehicle Charging Stations with Reservations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transition to electric vehicles (EVs), coupled with the rise of renewable energy sources, will significantly impact the electric grid. Unlike conventional fuel sources, electricity for EVs is constrained by grid capacity, price fluctuations, and long EV charging times, requiring new pricing solutions to manage demand and supply. This paper proposes a model for online dynamic pricing of reserved EV charging services, including reservation, parking, and charging as a bundled service priced as a whole. Our approach focuses on the individual charging station operator, employing a stochastic demand model and online dynamic pricing based on expected demand. The proposed model uses a Markov Decision Process (MDP) formulation to optimize sequential pricing decisions for charging session requests. A key contribution is the novel definition and quantification of discretization error introduced by the discretization of the Poisson process for use in the MDP. The model's viability is demonstrated with a heuristic solution method based on Monte-Carlo tree search, offering a viable path for real-world application.</description>

      <title>Concurrent-Learning Based Relative Localization in Shape Formation of Robot Swarms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the shape formation problem for massive robot swarms in environments where external localization systems are unavailable. Achieving this task effectively with solely onboard measurements is still scarcely explored and faces some practical challenges. To solve this challenging problem, we propose the following novel results. Firstly, to estimate the relative positions among neighboring robots, a concurrent-learning based estimator is proposed. It relaxes the persistent excitation condition required in the classical ones such as least-square estimator. Secondly, we introduce a finite-time agreement protocol to determine the shape location. This is achieved by estimating the relative position between each robot and a randomly assigned seed robot. The initial position of the seed one marks the shape location. Thirdly, based on the theoretical results of the relative localization, a novel behavior-based control strategy is devised. This strategy not only enables adaptive shape formation of large group of robots but also enhances the observability of inter-robot relative localization. Numerical simulation results are provided to verify the performance of our proposed strategy compared to the state-of-the-art ones. Additionally, outdoor experiments on real robots further demonstrate the practical effectiveness and robustness of our methods.</description>

      <title>Coevolving with the Other You: Fine-Tuning LLM with Sequential Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06101v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a pivotal technique for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) on specific tasks. However, prevailing RL fine-tuning methods predominantly rely on PPO and its variants. Though these algorithms are effective in general RL settings, they often exhibit suboptimal performance and vulnerability to distribution collapse when applied to the fine-tuning of LLMs. In this paper, we propose CORY, extending the RL fine-tuning of LLMs to a sequential cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning framework, to leverage the inherent coevolution and emergent capabilities of multi-agent systems. In CORY, the LLM to be fine-tuned is initially duplicated into two autonomous agents: a pioneer and an observer. The pioneer generates responses based on queries, while the observer generates responses using both the queries and the pioneer's responses. The two agents are trained together. During training, the agents exchange roles periodically, fostering cooperation and coevolution between them. Experiments evaluate CORY's performance by fine-tuning GPT-2 and Llama-2 under subjective and objective reward functions on the IMDB Review and GSM8K datasets, respectively. Results show that CORY outperforms PPO in terms of policy optimality, resistance to distribution collapse, and training robustness, thereby underscoring its potential as a superior methodology for refining LLMs in real-world applications.</description>

      <title>MentalArena: Self-play Training of Language Models for Diagnosis and Treatment of Mental Health Disorders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06845v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mental health disorders are one of the most serious diseases in the world. Most people with such a disease lack access to adequate care, which highlights the importance of training models for the diagnosis and treatment of mental health disorders. However, in the mental health domain, privacy concerns limit the accessibility of personalized treatment data, making it challenging to build powerful models. In this paper, we introduce MentalArena, a self-play framework to train language models by generating domain-specific personalized data, where we obtain a better model capable of making a personalized diagnosis and treatment (as a therapist) and providing information (as a patient). To accurately model human-like mental health patients, we devise Symptom Encoder, which simulates a real patient from both cognition and behavior perspectives. To address intent bias during patient-therapist interactions, we propose Symptom Decoder to compare diagnosed symptoms with encoded symptoms, and dynamically manage the dialogue between patient and therapist according to the identified deviations. We evaluated MentalArena against 6 benchmarks, including biomedicalQA and mental health tasks, compared to 6 advanced models. Our models, fine-tuned on both GPT-3.5 and Llama-3-8b, significantly outperform their counterparts, including GPT-4o. We hope that our work can inspire future research on personalized care.

      <title>I Want to Break Free! Anti-Social Behavior and Persuasion Ability of LLMs in Multi-Agent Settings with Social Hierarchy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents become increasingly autonomous and will more freely interact with each other, studying interactions between them becomes crucial to anticipate emergent phenomena and potential risks. Drawing inspiration from the widely popular Stanford Prison Experiment, we contribute to this line of research by studying interaction patterns of LLM agents in a context characterized by strict social hierarchy. We do so by specifically studying two types of phenomena: persuasion and anti-social behavior in simulated scenarios involving a guard and a prisoner agent who seeks to achieve a specific goal (i.e., obtaining additional yard time or escape from prison). Leveraging 200 experimental scenarios for a total of 2,000 machine-machine conversations across five different popular LLMs, we provide a set of noteworthy findings. We first document how some models consistently fail in carrying out a conversation in our multi-agent setup where power dynamics are at play. Then, for the models that were able to engage in successful interactions, we empirically show how the goal that an agent is set to achieve impacts primarily its persuasiveness, while having a negligible effect with respect to the agent's anti-social behavior. Third, we highlight how agents' personas, and particularly the guard's personality, drive both the likelihood of successful persuasion from the prisoner and the emergence of anti-social behaviors. Fourth, we show that even without explicitly prompting for specific personalities, anti-social behavior emerges by simply assigning agents' roles. These results bear implications for the development of interactive LLM agents as well as the debate on their societal impact.</description>

      <title>On the Limits of Information Spread by Memory-less Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11553v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address the self-stabilizing bit-dissemination problem, designed to capture the challenges of spreading information and reaching consensus among entities with minimal cognitive and communication capacities. Specifically, a group of $n$ agents is required to adopt the correct opinion, initially held by a single informed individual, choosing from two possible opinions. In order to make decisions, agents are restricted to observing the opinions of a few randomly sampled agents, and lack the ability to communicate further and to identify the informed individual. Additionally, agents cannot retain any information from one round to the next. According to a recent publication by Becchetti et al. in SODA (2024), a logarithmic convergence time without memory is achievable in the parallel setting (where agents are updated simultaneously), as long as the number of samples is at least $\Omega(\sqrt{n \log n})$. However, determining the minimal sample size for an efficient protocol to exist remains a challenging open question. As a preliminary step towards an answer, we establish the first lower bound for this problem in the parallel setting. Specifically, we demonstrate that it is impossible for any memory-less protocol with constant sample size, to converge with high probability in less than an almost-linear number of rounds. This lower bound holds even when agents are aware of both the exact value of $n$ and their own opinion, and encompasses various simple existing dynamics designed to achieve consensus. Beyond the bit-dissemination problem, our result sheds light on the convergence time of the ``minority'' dynamics, the counterpart of the well-known majority rule, whose chaotic behavior is yet to be fully understood despite the apparent simplicity of the algorithm.</description>

      <title>Circular Distribution of Agents using Convex Layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11351v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article considers the problem of conflict-free distribution of agents on a circular periphery encompassing all agents. The two key elements of the proposed policy include the construction of a set of convex layers (nested convex polygons) using the initial positions of the agents, and a novel search space region for each of the agents. The search space for an agent on a convex layer is defined as the region enclosed between the lines passing through the agent's position and normal to its supporting edges. Guaranteeing collision-free paths, a goal assignment policy designates a unique goal position within the search space of an agent at the initial time itself, requiring no further computation thereafter. In contrast to the existing literature, this work presents a one-shot, collision-free solution to the circular distribution problem by utilizing only the initial positions of the agents. Illustrative examples demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed policy.</description>

      <title>GenSim: A General Social Simulation Platform with Large Language Model based Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04360v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), recent years have witnessed many promising studies on leveraging LLM-based agents to simulate human social behavior. While prior work has demonstrated significant potential across various domains, much of it has focused on specific scenarios involving a limited number of agents and has lacked the ability to adapt when errors occur during simulation. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel LLM-agent-based simulation platform called \textit{GenSim}, which: (1) \textbf{Abstracts a set of general functions} to simplify the simulation of customized social scenarios; (2) \textbf{Supports one hundred thousand agents} to better simulate large-scale populations in real-world contexts; (3) \textbf{Incorporates error-correction mechanisms} to ensure more reliable and long-term simulations. To evaluate our platform, we assess both the efficiency of large-scale agent simulations and the effectiveness of the error-correction mechanisms. To our knowledge, GenSim represents an initial step toward a general, large-scale, and correctable social simulation platform based on LLM agents, promising to further advance the field of social science.</description>

      <title>Peer-to-Peer Energy Trading of Solar and Energy Storage: A Networked Multiagent Reinforcement Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13947v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Utilizing distributed renewable and energy storage resources in local distribution networks via peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading has long been touted as a solution to improve energy systems' resilience and sustainability. Consumers and prosumers (those who have energy generation resources), however, do not have the expertise to engage in repeated P2P trading, and the zero-marginal costs of renewables present challenges in determining fair market prices. To address these issues, we propose multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) frameworks to help automate consumers' bidding and management of their solar PV and energy storage resources, under a specific P2P clearing mechanism that utilizes the so-called supply-demand ratio. In addition, we show how the MARL frameworks can integrate physical network constraints to realize voltage control, hence ensuring physical feasibility of the P2P energy trading and paving way for real-world implementations.</description>

      <title>Richelieu: Self-Evolving LLM-Based Agents for AI Diplomacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06813v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diplomacy is one of the most sophisticated activities in human society. The complex interactions among multiple parties/ agents involve various abilities like social reasoning, negotiation arts, and long-term strategy planning. Previous AI agents surely have proved their capability of handling multi-step games and larger action spaces on tasks involving multiple agents. However, diplomacy involves a staggering magnitude of decision spaces, especially considering the negotiation stage required. Recently, LLM agents have shown their potential for extending the boundary of previous agents on a couple of applications, however, it is still not enough to handle a very long planning period in a complex multi-agent environment. Empowered with cutting-edge LLM technology, we make the first stab to explore AI's upper bound towards a human-like agent for such a highly comprehensive multi-agent mission by combining three core and essential capabilities for stronger LLM-based societal agents: 1) strategic planner with memory and reflection; 2) goal-oriented negotiate with social reasoning; 3) augmenting memory by self-play games to self-evolving without any human in the loop.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Stochastic Control in Standard Borel Spaces: Centralized MDP Reductions, Near Optimality of Finite Window Local Information, and Q-Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13828v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Decentralized stochastic control problems are intrinsically difficult to study because of the inapplicability of standard tools from centralized control such as dynamic programming and the resulting computational complexity. In this paper, we address some of these challenges for decentralized stochastic control with Borel spaces under three different but tightly related information structures under a unified theme: the one-step delayed information sharing pattern, the K-step periodic information sharing pattern, and the completely decentralized information structure where no sharing of information occurs. We will show that the one-step delayed and K-step periodic problems can be reduced to a centralized MDP, generalizing prior results which considered finite, linear, or static models, by addressing several measurability questions. The separated nature of policies under both information structures is then established. We then provide sufficient conditions for the transition kernels of both centralized reductions to be weak-Feller, which facilitates rigorous approximation and learning theoretic results. We will then show that for the completely decentralized control problem finite memory local policies are near optimal under a joint conditional mixing condition. This is achieved by obtaining a bound for finite memory policies which goes to zero as memory size increases. We will also provide a performance bound for the K-periodic problem, which results from replacing the full common information by a finite sliding window of information. The latter will depend on the condition of predictor stability in expected total variation, which we will establish. We finally show that under the periodic information sharing pattern, a quantized Q-learning algorithm converges asymptotically towards a near optimal solution. Each of the above, to our knowledge, is a new contribution to the literature.</description>

      <title>Breaking the Curse of Multiagency in Robust Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20067v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Standard multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms are vulnerable to sim-to-real gaps. To address this, distributionally robust Markov games (RMGs) have been proposed to enhance robustness in MARL by optimizing the worst-case performance when game dynamics shift within a prescribed uncertainty set. Solving RMGs remains under-explored, from problem formulation to the development of sample-efficient algorithms. A notorious yet open challenge is if RMGs can escape the curse of multiagency, where the sample complexity scales exponentially with the number of agents. In this work, we propose a natural class of RMGs where the uncertainty set of each agent is shaped by both the environment and other agents' strategies in a best-response manner. We first establish the well-posedness of these RMGs by proving the existence of game-theoretic solutions such as robust Nash equilibria and coarse correlated equilibria (CCE). Assuming access to a generative model, we then introduce a sample-efficient algorithm for learning the CCE whose sample complexity scales polynomially with all relevant parameters. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first algorithm to break the curse of multiagency for RMGs.</description>
