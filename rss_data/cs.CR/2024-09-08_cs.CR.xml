      <title>Post-quantum encryption algorithms of high-degree 3-variable polynomial congruences: BS cryptosystems and BS key generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We will construct post-quantum encryption algorithms based on three-variable polynomial Beal-Schur congruence. After giving a proof of Beal's conjecture and citing some applications of it to selected cases where the discrete logarithm and some of its generalizations are unsolvable problems, we will investigate the formulation and validity of an appropriate version of the Beal's conjecture on finite fields of integers. In contrast to the infinite case, we will show that the corresponding Beal-Schur congruence equation $x^{p}+y^{q}\equiv z^{r} (mod \mathcal{N})$ has non-trivial solutions into the finite field $\mathbb{Z}_{\mathcal{N}} $, for all sufficiently large primes $\mathcal{N}$ that do not divide the product $xyz$, under certain mutual divisibility conditions of the exponents $p$, $q$ and $r$. We will apply this result to generate the so-called BS cryptosystems, i.e., simple and secure post-quantum encryption algorithms based on the Beal-Schur congruence equation, as well as new cryptographic key generation methods, whose post-quantum algorithmic encryption security relies on having an infinite number of options for the parameters $p$, $q$, $r$, $\mathcal{N}$.</description>

      <title>HSF: Defending against Jailbreak Attacks with Hidden State Filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the growing deployment of LLMs in daily applications like chatbots and content generation, efforts to ensure outputs align with human values and avoid harmful content have intensified. However, increasingly sophisticated jailbreak attacks threaten this alignment, aiming to induce unsafe outputs. Current defense efforts either focus on prompt rewriting or detection, which are limited in effectiveness due to the various design of jailbreak prompts, or on output control and detection, which are computationally expensive as they require LLM inference. Therefore, designing a pre-inference defense method that resists diverse jailbreak prompts is crucial for preventing LLM jailbreak attacks. We observe that jailbreak attacks, safe queries, and harmful queries exhibit different clustering patterns within the LLM's hidden state representation space. This suggests that by leveraging the LLM's hidden state representational capabilities, we can analyze the LLM's forthcoming behavior and proactively intervene for defense. In this paper, we propose a jailbreak attack defense strategy based on a Hidden State Filter (HSF), a lossless architectural defense mechanism that enables the model to preemptively identify and reject adversarial inputs before the inference process begins. We activate its defensive potential through an additional plugin module, effectively framing the defense task as a classification problem. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets, utilizing three different LLMs, show that HSF significantly enhances resilience against six cutting-edge jailbreak attacks. It significantly reduces the success rate of jailbreak attacks while minimally impacting responses to benign user queries, with negligible inference overhead, and outperforming defense baselines.Our code and data are available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Hidden-State-Filtering-8652/</description>

      <title>BreachSeek: A Multi-Agent Automated Penetration Tester</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing complexity and scale of modern digital environments have exposed significant gaps in traditional cybersecurity penetration testing methods, which are often time-consuming, labor-intensive, and unable to rapidly adapt to emerging threats. There is a critical need for an automated solution that can efficiently identify and exploit vulnerabilities across diverse systems without extensive human intervention. BreachSeek addresses this challenge by providing an AI-driven multi-agent software platform that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) integrated through LangChain and LangGraph in Python. This system enables autonomous agents to conduct thorough penetration testing by identifying vulnerabilities, simulating a variety of cyberattacks, executing exploits, and generating comprehensive security reports. In preliminary evaluations, BreachSeek successfully exploited vulnerabilities in exploitable machines within local networks, demonstrating its practical effectiveness. Future developments aim to expand its capabilities, positioning it as an indispensable tool for cybersecurity professionals.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Digital Fingerprints: Analysis of Internet attacks based on website fingerprints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parallel to our physical activities our virtual presence also leaves behind our unique digital fingerprints, while navigating on the Internet. These digital fingerprints have the potential to unveil users' activities encompassing browsing history, utilized applications, and even devices employed during these engagements. Many Internet users tend to use web browsers that provide the highest privacy protection and anonymization such as Tor. The success of such privacy protection depends on the Tor feature to anonymize end-user IP addresses and other metadata that constructs the website fingerprint. In this paper, we show that using the newest machine learning algorithms an attacker can deanonymize Tor traffic by applying such techniques. In our experimental framework, we establish a baseline and comparative reference point using a publicly available dataset from Universidad Del Cauca, Colombia. We capture network packets across 11 days, while users navigate specific web pages, recording data in .pcapng format through the Wireshark network capture tool. Excluding extraneous packets, we employ various machine learning algorithms in our analysis. The results show that the Gradient Boosting Machine algorithm delivers the best outcomes in binary classification, achieving an accuracy of 0.8363. In the realm of multi-class classification, the Random Forest algorithm attains an accuracy of 0.6297.</description>

      <title>Safeguarding AI Agents: Developing and Analyzing Safety Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI agents, specifically powered by large language models, have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in various applications where precision and efficacy are necessary. However, these agents come with inherent risks, including the potential for unsafe or biased actions, vulnerability to adversarial attacks, lack of transparency, and tendency to generate hallucinations. As AI agents become more prevalent in critical sectors of the industry, the implementation of effective safety protocols becomes increasingly important. This paper addresses the critical need for safety measures in AI systems, especially ones that collaborate with human teams. We propose and evaluate three frameworks to enhance safety protocols in AI agent systems: an LLM-powered input-output filter, a safety agent integrated within the system, and a hierarchical delegation-based system with embedded safety checks. Our methodology involves implementing these frameworks and testing them against a set of unsafe agentic use cases, providing a comprehensive evaluation of their effectiveness in mitigating risks associated with AI agent deployment. We conclude that these frameworks can significantly strengthen the safety and security of AI agent systems, minimizing potential harmful actions or outputs. Our work contributes to the ongoing effort to create safe and reliable AI applications, particularly in automated operations, and provides a foundation for developing robust guardrails to ensure the responsible use of AI agents in real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Security Implications and Mitigation Strategies in MPLS Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) is a high-performance telecommunications technology that directs data from one network node to another based on short path labels rather than long network addresses. Its efficiency and scalability have made it a popular choice for large-scale and enterprise networks. However, as MPLS networks grow and evolve, they encounter various security challenges. This paper explores the security implications associated with MPLS networks, including risks such as label spoofing, traffic interception, and denial of service attacks. Additionally, it evaluates advanced mitigation strategies to address these vulnerabilities, leveraging mathematical models and security protocols to enhance MPLS network resilience. By integrating theoretical analysis with practical solutions, this paper aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of MPLS security and propose effective methods for safeguarding network infrastructure.</description>

      <title>Protecting Activity Sensing Data Privacy Using Hierarchical Information Dissociation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Smartphones and wearable devices have been integrated into our daily lives, offering personalized services. However, many apps become overprivileged as their collected sensing data contains unnecessary sensitive information. For example, mobile sensing data could reveal private attributes (e.g., gender and age) and unintended sensitive features (e.g., hand gestures when entering passwords). To prevent sensitive information leakage, existing methods must obtain private labels and users need to specify privacy policies. However, they only achieve limited control over information disclosure. In this work, we present Hippo to dissociate hierarchical information including private metadata and multi-grained activity information from the sensing data. Hippo achieves fine-grained control over the disclosure of sensitive information without requiring private labels. Specifically, we design a latent guidance-based diffusion model, which generates multi-grained versions of raw sensor data conditioned on hierarchical latent activity features. Hippo enables users to control the disclosure of sensitive information in sensing data, ensuring their privacy while preserving the necessary features to meet the utility requirements of applications. Hippo is the first unified model that achieves two goals: perturbing the sensitive attributes and controlling the disclosure of sensitive information in mobile sensing data. Extensive experiments show that Hippo can anonymize personal attributes and transform activity information at various resolutions across different types of sensing data.</description>

      <title>Interpretable Cyber Threat Detection for Enterprise Industrial Networks: A Computational Design Science Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Enterprise industrial networks face threats that risk data and operations. However, designing efficient threat detection system is challenging due to data scarcity, especially where privacy is a concern. The complexity of enterprise industrial network data adds to this challenge, causing high false positives and interpretation issues. Towards this, we use IS computational design science paradigm to develop a two-stage cyber threat detection system for enterprise-level IS that are both secure and capable of adapting to evolving technological and business environments. The first stage generates synthetic industrial network data using a modified generative adversarial network. The second stage develops a novel bidirectional gated recurrent unit and a modified attention mechanism for effective threat detection. We also use shapley additive explanations and a decision tree technique for enhancing interpretability. Our analysis on two public datasets shows the frameworks high precision in threat detection and offers practical cybersecurity solutions and methodological advancements.</description>

      <title>A First Look At Efficient And Secure On-Device LLM Inference Against KV Leakage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Running LLMs on end devices has garnered significant attention recently due to their advantages in privacy preservation. With the advent of lightweight LLM models and specially designed GPUs, on-device LLM inference has achieved the necessary accuracy and performance metrics. However, we have identified that LLM inference on GPUs can leak privacy-sensitive intermediate information, specifically the KV pairs. An attacker could exploit these KV pairs to reconstruct the entire user conversation, leading to significant vulnerabilities. Existing solutions, such as Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) and Trusted Execution Environments (TEE), are either too computation-intensive or resource-limited. To address these issues, we designed KV-Shield, which operates in two phases. In the initialization phase, it permutes the weight matrices so that all KV pairs are correspondingly permuted. During the runtime phase, the attention vector is inversely permuted to ensure the correctness of the layer output. All permutation-related operations are executed within the TEE, ensuring that insecure GPUs cannot access the original KV pairs, thus preventing conversation reconstruction. Finally, we theoretically analyze the correctness of KV-Shield, along with its advantages and overhead.</description>

      <title>Exploring User Privacy Awareness on GitHub: An Empirical Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: GitHub provides developers with a practical way to distribute source code and collaboratively work on common projects. To enhance account security and privacy, GitHub allows its users to manage access permissions, review audit logs, and enable two-factor authentication. However, despite the endless effort, the platform still faces various issues related to the privacy of its users. This paper presents an empirical study delving into the GitHub ecosystem. Our focus is on investigating the utilization of privacy settings on the platform and identifying various types of sensitive information disclosed by users. Leveraging a dataset comprising 6,132 developers, we report and analyze their activities by means of comments on pull requests. Our findings indicate an active engagement by users with the available privacy settings on GitHub. Notably, we observe the disclosure of different forms of private information within pull request comments. This observation has prompted our exploration into sensitivity detection using a large language model and BERT, to pave the way for a personalized privacy assistant. Our work provides insights into the utilization of existing privacy protection tools, such as privacy settings, along with their inherent limitations. Essentially, we aim to advance research in this field by providing both the motivation for creating such privacy protection tools and a proposed methodology for personalizing them.</description>

      <title>Context is the Key: Backdoor Attacks for In-Context Learning with Vision Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to the high cost of training, large model (LM) practitioners commonly use pretrained models downloaded from untrusted sources, which could lead to owning compromised models. In-context learning is the ability of LMs to perform multiple tasks depending on the prompt or context. This can enable new attacks, such as backdoor attacks with dynamic behavior depending on how models are prompted.
  In this paper, we leverage the ability of vision transformers (ViTs) to perform different tasks depending on the prompts. Then, through data poisoning, we investigate two new threats: i) task-specific backdoors where the attacker chooses a target task to attack, and only the selected task is compromised at test time under the presence of the trigger. At the same time, any other task is not affected, even if prompted with the trigger. We succeeded in attacking every tested model, achieving up to 89.90\% degradation on the target task. ii) We generalize the attack, allowing the backdoor to affect \emph{any} task, even tasks unseen during the training phase. Our attack was successful on every tested model, achieving a maximum of $13\times$ degradation. Finally, we investigate the robustness of prompts and fine-tuning as techniques for removing the backdoors from the model. We found that these methods fall short and, in the best case, reduce the degradation from 89.90\% to 73.46\%.</description>

      <title>Do Android App Developers Accurately Report Collection of Privacy-Related Data?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many Android applications collect data from users. The European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) requires vendors to faithfully disclose which data their apps collect. This task is complicated because many apps use third-party code for which the same information is not readily available. Hence we ask: how accurately do current Android apps fulfill these requirements?
  In this work, we first expose a multi-layered definition of privacy-related data to correctly report data collection in Android apps. We further create a dataset of privacy-sensitive data classes that may be used as input by an Android app. This dataset takes into account data collected both through the user interface and system APIs.
  We manually examine the data safety sections of 70 Android apps to observe how data collection is reported, identifying instances of over- and under-reporting. Additionally, we develop a prototype to statically extract and label privacy-related data collected via app source code, user interfaces, and permissions. Comparing the prototype's results with the data safety sections of 20 apps reveals reporting discrepancies. Using the results from two Messaging and Social Media apps (Signal and Instagram), we discuss how app developers under-report and over-report data collection, respectively, and identify inaccurately reported data categories.
  Our results show that app developers struggle to accurately report data collection, either due to Google's abstract definition of collected data or insufficient existing tool support.</description>

      <title>Mind The Gap: Can Air-Gaps Keep Your Private Data Secure?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Personal data has become one of the most valuable assets and lucrative targets for attackers in the modern digital world. This includes personal identification information (PII), medical records, legal information, biometric data, and private communications. To protect it from hackers, 'air-gap' measures might be employed. This protective strategy keeps sensitive data in networks entirely isolated (physically and logically) from the Internet. Creating a physical 'air gap' between internal networks and the outside world safeguards sensitive data from theft and online threats. Air-gap networks are relevant today to governmental organizations, healthcare industries, finance sectors, intellectual property and legal firms, and others. In this paper, we dive deep into air-gap security in light of modern cyberattacks and data privacy. Despite this level of protection, publicized incidents from the last decade show that even air-gap networks are not immune to breaches. Motivated and capable adversaries can use sophisticated attack vectors to penetrate the air-gapped networks, leaking sensitive data outward. We focus on different aspects of air gap security. First, we overview cyber incidents that target air-gap networks, including infamous ones such Agent.btz. Second, we introduce the adversarial attack model and different attack vectors attackers may use to compromise air-gap networks. Third, we present the techniques attackers can apply to leak data out of air-gap networks and introduce more innovative ones based on our recent research. Finally, we propose the necessary countermeasures to protect the data, both defensive and preventive.</description>

      <title>Towards Fine-Grained Webpage Fingerprinting at Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Website Fingerprinting (WF) attacks can effectively identify the websites visited by Tor clients via analyzing encrypted traffic patterns. Existing attacks focus on identifying different websites, but their accuracy dramatically decreases when applied to identify fine-grained webpages, especially when distinguishing among different subpages of the same website. WebPage Fingerprinting (WPF) attacks face the challenges of highly similar traffic patterns and a much larger scale of webpages. Furthermore, clients often visit multiple webpages concurrently, increasing the difficulty of extracting the traffic patterns of each webpage from the obfuscated traffic. In this paper, we propose Oscar, a WPF attack based on multi-label metric learning that identifies different webpages from obfuscated traffic by transforming the feature space. Oscar can extract the subtle differences among various webpages, even those with similar traffic patterns. In particular, Oscar combines proxy-based and sample-based metric learning losses to extract webpage features from obfuscated traffic and identify multiple webpages. We prototype Oscar and evaluate its performance using traffic collected from 1,000 monitored webpages and over 9,000 unmonitored webpages in the real world. Oscar demonstrates an 88.6% improvement in the multi-label metric Recall@5 compared to the state-of-the-art attacks.</description>

      <title>Deanonymizing Ethereum Validators: The P2P Network Has a Privacy Issue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many blockchain networks aim to preserve the anonymity of validators in the peer-to-peer (P2P) network, ensuring that no adversary can link a validator's identifier to the IP address of a peer due to associated privacy and security concerns. This work demonstrates that the Ethereum P2P network does not offer this anonymity. We present a methodology that enables any node in the network to identify validators hosted on connected peers and empirically verify the feasibility of our proposed method. Using data collected from four nodes over three days, we locate more than 15% of Ethereum validators in the P2P network. The insights gained from our deanonymization technique provide valuable information on the distribution of validators across peers, their geographic locations, and hosting organizations. We further discuss the implications and risks associated with the lack of anonymity in the P2P network and propose methods to help validators protect their privacy. The Ethereum Foundation has awarded us a bug bounty, acknowledging the impact of our results.</description>

      <title>Achieving the Safety and Security of the End-to-End AV Pipeline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03899v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the current landscape of autonomous vehicle (AV) safety and security research, there are multiple isolated problems being tackled by the community at large. Due to the lack of common evaluation criteria, several important research questions are at odds with one another. For instance, while much research has been conducted on physical attacks deceiving AV perception systems, there is often inadequate investigations on working defenses and on the downstream effects of safe vehicle control.
  This paper provides a thorough description of the current state of AV safety and security research. We provide individual sections for the primary research questions that concern this research area, including AV surveillance, sensor system reliability, security of the AV stack, algorithmic robustness, and safe environment interaction. We wrap up the paper with a discussion of the issues that concern the interactions of these separate problems. At the conclusion of each section, we propose future research questions that still lack conclusive answers. This position article will serve as an entry point to novice and veteran researchers seeking to partake in this research domain.</description>

      <title>WaterMAS: Sharpness-Aware Maximization for Neural Network Watermarking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03902v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nowadays, deep neural networks are used for solving complex tasks in several critical applications and protecting both their integrity and intellectual property rights (IPR) has become of utmost importance. To this end, we advance WaterMAS, a substitutive, white-box neural network watermarking method that improves the trade-off among robustness, imperceptibility, and computational complexity, while making provisions for increased data payload and security. WasterMAS insertion keeps unchanged the watermarked weights while sharpening their underlying gradient space. The robustness is thus ensured by limiting the attack's strength: even small alterations of the watermarked weights would impact the model's performance. The imperceptibility is ensured by inserting the watermark during the training process. The relationship among the WaterMAS data payload, imperceptibility, and robustness properties is discussed. The secret key is represented by the positions of the weights conveying the watermark, randomly chosen through multiple layers of the model. The security is evaluated by investigating the case in which an attacker would intercept the key. The experimental validations consider 5 models and 2 tasks (VGG16, ResNet18, MobileNetV3, SwinT for CIFAR10 image classification, and DeepLabV3 for Cityscapes image segmentation) as well as 4 types of attacks (Gaussian noise addition, pruning, fine-tuning, and quantization). The code will be released open-source upon acceptance of the article.</description>

      <title>Efficient Fault-Tolerant Quantum Protocol for Differential Privacy in the Shuffle Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04026v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a quantum protocol which securely and implicitly implements a random shuffle to realize differential privacy in the shuffle model. The shuffle model of differential privacy amplifies privacy achievable via local differential privacy by randomly permuting the tuple of outcomes from data contributors. In practice, one needs to address how this shuffle is implemented. Examples include implementing the shuffle via mix-networks, or shuffling via a trusted third-party. These implementation specific issues raise non-trivial computational and trust requirements in a classical system. We propose a quantum version of the protocol using entanglement of quantum states and show that the shuffle can be implemented without these extra requirements. Our protocol implements k-ary randomized response, for any value of k &gt; 2, and furthermore, can be efficiently implemented using fault-tolerant computation.</description>

      <title>Unmasking Covert Intrusions: Detection of Fault-Masking Cyberattacks on Differential Protection Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Line Current Differential Relays (LCDRs) are high-speed relays progressively used to protect critical transmission lines. However, LCDRs are vulnerable to cyberattacks. Fault-Masking Attacks (FMAs) are stealthy cyberattacks performed by manipulating the remote measurements of the targeted LCDR to disguise faults on the protected line. Hence, they remain undetected by this LCDR. In this paper, we propose a two-module framework to detect FMAs. The first module is a Mismatch Index (MI) developed from the protected transmission line's equivalent physical model. The MI is triggered only if there is a significant mismatch in the LCDR's local and remote measurements while the LCDR itself is untriggered, which indicates an FMA. After the MI is triggered, the second module, a neural network-based classifier, promptly confirms that the triggering event is a physical fault that lies on the line protected by the LCDR before declaring the occurrence of an FMA. The proposed framework is tested using the IEEE 39-bus benchmark system. Our simulation results confirm that the proposed framework can accurately detect FMAs on LCDRs and is not affected by normal system disturbances, variations, or measurement noise. Our experimental results using OPAL-RT's real-time simulator confirm the proposed solution's real-time performance capability.</description>

      <title>Best Linear Unbiased Estimate from Privatized Histograms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04387v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In differential privacy (DP) mechanisms, it can be beneficial to release "redundant" outputs, in the sense that a quantity can be estimated by combining different combinations of privatized values. Indeed, this structure is present in the DP 2020 Decennial Census products published by the U.S. Census Bureau. With this structure, the DP output can be improved by enforcing self-consistency (i.e., estimators obtained by combining different values result in the same estimate) and we show that the minimum variance processing is a linear projection. However, standard projection algorithms are too computationally expensive in terms of both memory and execution time for applications such as the Decennial Census. We propose the Scalable Efficient Algorithm for Best Linear Unbiased Estimate (SEA BLUE), based on a two step process of aggregation and differencing that 1) enforces self-consistency through a linear and unbiased procedure, 2) is computationally and memory efficient, 3) achieves the minimum variance solution under certain structural assumptions, and 4) is empirically shown to be robust to violations of these structural assumptions. We propose three methods of calculating confidence intervals from our estimates, under various assumptions. We apply SEA BLUE to two 2010 Census demonstration products, illustrating its scalability and validity.</description>

      <title>Towards Flexible Anonymous Networks</title>

Abstract: Anonymous Communication designs such as Tor build their security on distributed trust over many volunteers running relays in diverse global locations. In practice, this distribution leads to a heterogeneous network in which many versions of the Tor software co-exist, each with differing sets of protocol features. Because of this heterogeneity, Tor developers employ forward-compatible protocol design as a strategy to maintain network extensibility. This strategy aims to guarantee that different versions of the Tor software interact without unrecoverable errors. In this work, we cast protocol tolerance that is enabled by forward-compatible protocol considerations as a fundamental security issue. We argue that, while being beneficial for the developers, protocol tolerance has resulted in a number of strong attacks against Tor in the past fifteen years.
  To address this issue, we propose Flexible Anonymous Network (FAN), a new software architecture for volunteer-based distributed networks that shifts the dependence away from protocol tolerance without losing the ability for developers to ensure the continuous evolution of their software. We i) instantiate an implementation, ii) evaluate its overheads and, iii) experiment with several of FAN's benefits to defend against a severe attack still applicable to Tor today.</description>

      <title>A Hypergraph-Based Machine Learning Ensemble Network Intrusion Detection System</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.03933v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Network intrusion detection systems (NIDS) to detect malicious attacks continue to meet challenges. NIDS are often developed offline while they face auto-generated port scan infiltration attempts, resulting in a significant time lag from adversarial adaption to NIDS response. To address these challenges, we use hypergraphs focused on internet protocol addresses and destination ports to capture evolving patterns of port scan attacks. The derived set of hypergraph-based metrics are then used to train an ensemble machine learning (ML) based NIDS that allows for real-time adaption in monitoring and detecting port scanning activities, other types of attacks, and adversarial intrusions at high accuracy, precision and recall performances. This ML adapting NIDS was developed through the combination of (1) intrusion examples, (2) NIDS update rules, (3) attack threshold choices to trigger NIDS retraining requests, and (4) a production environment with no prior knowledge of the nature of network traffic. 40 scenarios were auto-generated to evaluate the ML ensemble NIDS comprising three tree-based models. The resulting ML Ensemble NIDS was extended and evaluated with the CIC-IDS2017 dataset. Results show that under the model settings of an Update-ALL-NIDS rule (specifically retrain and update all the three models upon the same NIDS retraining request) the proposed ML ensemble NIDS evolved intelligently and produced the best results with nearly 100% detection performance throughout the simulation.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Noise for $f$-Differential Privacy via Anti-Concentration and Stochastic Dominance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.08343v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish anti-concentration inequalities for additive noise mechanisms which achieve $f$-differential privacy ($f$-DP), a notion of privacy phrased in terms of a tradeoff function $f$ which limits the ability of an adversary to determine which individuals were in the database. We show that canonical noise distributions (CNDs), proposed by Awan and Vadhan (2023), match the anti-concentration bounds at half-integer values, indicating that their tail behavior is near-optimal. We also show that all CNDs are sub-exponential, regardless of the $f$-DP guarantee. In the case of log-concave CNDs, we show that they are the stochastically smallest noise compared to any other noise distributions with the same privacy guarantee. In terms of integer-valued noise, we propose a new notion of discrete CND and prove that a discrete CND always exists, can be constructed by rounding a continuous CND, and that the discrete CND is unique when designed for a statistic with sensitivity 1. We further show that the discrete CND at sensitivity 1 is stochastically smallest compared to other integer-valued noises. Our theoretical results shed light on the different types of privacy guarantees possible in the $f$-DP framework and can be incorporated in more complex mechanisms to optimize performance.</description>

      <title>PreCurious: How Innocent Pre-Trained Language Models Turn into Privacy Traps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09562v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The pre-training and fine-tuning paradigm has demonstrated its effectiveness and has become the standard approach for tailoring language models to various tasks. Currently, community-based platforms offer easy access to various pre-trained models, as anyone can publish without strict validation processes. However, a released pre-trained model can be a privacy trap for fine-tuning datasets if it is carefully designed. In this work, we propose PreCurious framework to reveal the new attack surface where the attacker releases the pre-trained model and gets a black-box access to the final fine-tuned model. PreCurious aims to escalate the general privacy risk of both membership inference and data extraction on the fine-tuning dataset. The key intuition behind PreCurious is to manipulate the memorization stage of the pre-trained model and guide fine-tuning with a seemingly legitimate configuration. While empirical and theoretical evidence suggests that parameter-efficient and differentially private fine-tuning techniques can defend against privacy attacks on a fine-tuned model, PreCurious demonstrates the possibility of breaking up this invulnerability in a stealthy manner compared to fine-tuning on a benign pre-trained model. While DP provides some mitigation for membership inference attack, by further leveraging a sanitized dataset, PreCurious demonstrates potential vulnerabilities for targeted data extraction even under differentially private tuning with a strict privacy budget e.g. $\epsilon=0.05$. Thus, PreCurious raises warnings for users on the potential risks of downloading pre-trained models from unknown sources, relying solely on tutorials or common-sense defenses, and releasing sanitized datasets even after perfect scrubbing.</description>

      <title>Armored Core of PKI: Removing Signing Keys for CA via Efficient and Trusted Physical Certification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15582v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The signing key exposure of Certificate Authorities (CAs) remains a critical concern in PKI. These keys can be exposed even today by various attacks or operational errors. Traditional protections fail to eliminate such risk and one leaked key is enough to compromise the CA. This long-standing dilemma motivates us to consider removing CAs' signing keys and propose Armored Core, a PKI security extension using the trusted binding of Physically Unclonable Function (PUF) for certificate operations. It makes key exposure impossible by eliminating the digital signing keys for CA.
  To achieve this, we design a set of PUF-based X.509v3 certificate functions for CAs to generate physically trusted "signatures" without using a digital key. We have presented cryptographic proofs for these functions. Moreover, we introduce the first PUF transparency mechanism to effectively monitor the PUF operations in CAs. Armored Core is integrated into real-world PKI systems including Let's Encrypt Pebble and Certbot. We also provide a PUF-embedded RISC-V CPU prototype to verify the feasibility. The evaluation results show that Armored Core achieves key removal without introducing extra overhead, but improves the performance by 11% on storage and 4.9%~73.7% on computation.</description>

      <title>Rolling in the Shadows: Analyzing the Extraction of MEV Across Layer-2 Rollups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00138v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The emergence of decentralized finance has transformed asset trading on the blockchain, making traditional financial instruments more accessible while also introducing a series of exploitative economic practices known as Maximal Extractable Value (MEV). Concurrently, decentralized finance has embraced rollup-based Layer-2 solutions to facilitate asset trading at reduced transaction costs compared to Layer-1 solutions such as Ethereum. However, rollups lack a public mempool like Ethereum, making the extraction of MEV more challenging. In this paper, we investigate the prevalence and impact of MEV on Ethereum and prominent rollups such as Arbitrum, Optimism, and zkSync over a nearly three-year period. Our analysis encompasses various metrics including volume, profits, costs, competition, and response time to MEV opportunities. We discover that MEV is widespread on rollups, with trading volume comparable to Ethereum. We also find that, although MEV costs are lower on rollups, profits are also significantly lower compared to Ethereum. Additionally, we examine the prevalence of sandwich attacks on rollups. While our findings did not detect any sandwiching activity on popular rollups, we did identify the potential for cross-layer sandwich attacks facilitated by transactions that are sent across rollups and Ethereum. Consequently, we propose and evaluate the feasibility of three novel attacks that exploit cross-layer transactions, revealing that attackers could have already earned approximately 2 million USD through cross-layer sandwich attacks.</description>

      <title>UnsafeBench: Benchmarking Image Safety Classifiers on Real-World and AI-Generated Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03486v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the advent of text-to-image models and concerns about their misuse, developers are increasingly relying on image safety classifiers to moderate their generated unsafe images. Yet, the performance of current image safety classifiers remains unknown for both real-world and AI-generated images. In this work, we propose UnsafeBench, a benchmarking framework that evaluates the effectiveness and robustness of image safety classifiers, with a particular focus on the impact of AI-generated images on their performance. First, we curate a large dataset of 10K real-world and AI-generated images that are annotated as safe or unsafe based on a set of 11 unsafe categories of images (sexual, violent, hateful, etc.). Then, we evaluate the effectiveness and robustness of five popular image safety classifiers, as well as three classifiers that are powered by general-purpose visual language models. Our assessment indicates that existing image safety classifiers are not comprehensive and effective enough to mitigate the multifaceted problem of unsafe images. Also, there exists a distribution shift between real-world and AI-generated images in image qualities, styles, and layouts, leading to degraded effectiveness and robustness. Motivated by these findings, we build a comprehensive image moderation tool called PerspectiveVision, which addresses the main drawbacks of existing classifiers with improved effectiveness and robustness, especially on AI-generated images. UnsafeBench and PerspectiveVision can aid the research community in better understanding the landscape of image safety classification in the era of generative AI.</description>

      <title>Bytes to Schlep? Use a FEP: Hiding Protocol Metadata with Fully Encrypted Protocols</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13310v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fully Encrypted Protocols (FEPs) have arisen in practice as a technique to avoid network censorship. Such protocols are designed to produce messages that appear completely random. This design hides communications metadata, such as version and length fields, and makes it difficult to even determine what protocol is being used. Moreover, these protocols frequently support padding to hide the length of protocol fields and the contained message. These techniques have relevance well beyond censorship circumvention, as protecting protocol metadata has security and privacy benefits for all Internet communications. The security of FEP designs depends on cryptographic assumptions, but neither security definitions nor proofs exist for them. We provide novel security definitions that capture the metadata-protection goals of FEPs. Our definitions are given in both the datastream and datagram settings, which model the ubiquitous TCP and UDP interfaces available to protocol designers. We prove relations among these new notions and existing security definitions. We further present new FEP constructions and prove their security. Finally, we survey existing FEP candidates and characterize the extent to which they satisfy FEP security. We identify novel ways in which these protocols are identifiable, including their responses to the introduction of data errors and the sizes of their smallest protocol messages.</description>

      <title>AI Agents Under Threat: A Survey of Key Security Challenges and Future Pathways</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02630v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An Artificial Intelligence (AI) agent is a software entity that autonomously performs tasks or makes decisions based on pre-defined objectives and data inputs. AI agents, capable of perceiving user inputs, reasoning and planning tasks, and executing actions, have seen remarkable advancements in algorithm development and task performance. However, the security challenges they pose remain under-explored and unresolved. This survey delves into the emerging security threats faced by AI agents, categorizing them into four critical knowledge gaps: unpredictability of multi-step user inputs, complexity in internal executions, variability of operational environments, and interactions with untrusted external entities. By systematically reviewing these threats, this paper highlights both the progress made and the existing limitations in safeguarding AI agents. The insights provided aim to inspire further research into addressing the security threats associated with AI agents, thereby fostering the development of more robust and secure AI agent applications.</description>

      <title>SoK: A Literature and Engineering Review of Regular Expression Denial of Service</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11618v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Regular expression denial of service (ReDoS) is an asymmetric cyberattack that has become prominent in recent years. This attack exploits the slow worst-case matching time of regular expression (regex) engines. In the past, problematic regular expressions have led to outages at Cloudflare and Stack Overflow, showing the severity of the problem. While ReDoS has drawn significant research attention, there has been no systematization of knowledge to delineate the state of the art and identify opportunities for further research.
  In this paper, we describe the existing knowledge on ReDoS. We first provide a systematic literature review, dividing works into two classes: measurement studies and defenses. Then, our engineering review surveys the latest regex engines to examine whether and how ReDoS defenses have been realized. Combining our findings, we observe that (1) in the literature, almost no studies evaluate whether and how ReDoS vulnerabilities can be weaponized against real systems, making it difficult to assess their real-world impact; and (2) from an engineering view, many mainstream regex engines now have ReDoS defenses, rendering many threat models obsolete. The open challenges in ReDoS research are to evaluate the emerging defenses, and to support engineers in migrating to defended engines. To support these directions, we conclude by presenting the wrk-redos tool. This tool supports controlled measurements of ReDoS on a web service, and includes proof-of-concept Docker images that allow engineers to substitute different regex engines in their applications.</description>

      <title>GlucOS: Security, correctness, and simplicity for automated insulin delivery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18262v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present GlucOS, a novel system for trustworthy automated insulin delivery. Fundamentally, this paper is about a system we designed, implemented, and deployed on real humans and the lessons learned from our experiences. GlucOS combines algorithmic security, driver security, and end-to-end verification to protect against malicious ML models, vulnerable pump drivers, and drastic changes in human physiology. We use formal methods to prove correctness of critical components and incorporate humans as part of our defensive strategy. Our evaluation includes both a real-world deployment with seven individuals and results from simulation to show that our techniques generalize. Our results show that GlucOS maintains safety and improves glucose control even under attack conditions. This work demonstrates the potential for secure, personalized, automated healthcare systems.</description>

      <title>Threat-Informed Cyber Resilience Index: A Probabilistic Quantitative Approach to Measure Defence Effectiveness Against Cyber Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19374v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the dynamic cyber threat landscape, effective decision-making under uncertainty is crucial for maintaining robust information security. This paper introduces the Cyber Resilience Index (CRI), a threat-informed probabilistic approach to quantifying an organisation's defence effectiveness against cyber-attacks (campaigns). Building upon the Threat-Intelligence Based Security Assessment (TIBSA) methodology, we present a mathematical model that translates complex threat intelligence into an actionable, unified metric similar to a stock market index, that executives can understand and interact with while teams can act upon. Our method leverages Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) to simulate attacker behaviour considering real-world uncertainties and the latest threat actor tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). This allows for dynamic, context-aware evaluation of an organization's security posture, moving beyond static compliance-based assessments. As a result, decision-makers are equipped with a single metric of cyber resilience that bridges the gap between quantitative and qualitative assessments, enabling data-driven resource allocation and strategic planning. This can ultimately lead to more informed decision-making, mitigate under or overspending, and assist in resource allocation.</description>

      <title>Refusing Safe Prompts for Multi-modal Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09050v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have become the cornerstone of today's generative AI ecosystem, sparking intense competition among tech giants and startups. In particular, an MLLM generates a text response given a prompt consisting of an image and a question. While state-of-the-art MLLMs use safety filters and alignment techniques to refuse unsafe prompts, in this work, we introduce MLLM-Refusal, the first method that induces refusals for safe prompts. In particular, our MLLM-Refusal optimizes a nearly-imperceptible refusal perturbation and adds it to an image, causing target MLLMs to likely refuse a safe prompt containing the perturbed image and a safe question. Specifically, we formulate MLLM-Refusal as a constrained optimization problem and propose an algorithm to solve it. Our method offers competitive advantages for MLLM model providers by potentially disrupting user experiences of competing MLLMs, since competing MLLM's users will receive unexpected refusals when they unwittingly use these perturbed images in their prompts. We evaluate MLLM-Refusal on four MLLMs across four datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in causing competing MLLMs to refuse safe prompts while not affecting non-competing MLLMs. Furthermore, we explore three potential countermeasures-adding Gaussian noise, DiffPure, and adversarial training. Our results show that though they can mitigate MLLM-Refusal's effectiveness, they also sacrifice the accuracy and/or efficiency of the competing MLLM. The code is available at https://github.com/Sadcardation/MLLM-Refusal.</description>

      <title>LLM-PBE: Assessing Data Privacy in Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12787v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become integral to numerous domains, significantly advancing applications in data management, mining, and analysis. Their profound capabilities in processing and interpreting complex language data, however, bring to light pressing concerns regarding data privacy, especially the risk of unintentional training data leakage. Despite the critical nature of this issue, there has been no existing literature to offer a comprehensive assessment of data privacy risks in LLMs. Addressing this gap, our paper introduces LLM-PBE, a toolkit crafted specifically for the systematic evaluation of data privacy risks in LLMs. LLM-PBE is designed to analyze privacy across the entire lifecycle of LLMs, incorporating diverse attack and defense strategies, and handling various data types and metrics. Through detailed experimentation with multiple LLMs, LLM-PBE facilitates an in-depth exploration of data privacy concerns, shedding light on influential factors such as model size, data characteristics, and evolving temporal dimensions. This study not only enriches the understanding of privacy issues in LLMs but also serves as a vital resource for future research in the field. Aimed at enhancing the breadth of knowledge in this area, the findings, resources, and our full technical report are made available at https://llm-pbe.github.io/, providing an open platform for academic and practical advancements in LLM privacy assessment.</description>

      <title>Recent Advances in Attack and Defense Approaches of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03274v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized artificial intelligence and machine learning through their advanced text processing and generating capabilities. However, their widespread deployment has raised significant safety and reliability concerns. Established vulnerabilities in deep neural networks, coupled with emerging threat models, may compromise security evaluations and create a false sense of security. Given the extensive research in the field of LLM security, we believe that summarizing the current state of affairs will help the research community better understand the present landscape and inform future developments. This paper reviews current research on LLM vulnerabilities and threats, and evaluates the effectiveness of contemporary defense mechanisms. We analyze recent studies on attack vectors and model weaknesses, providing insights into attack mechanisms and the evolving threat landscape. We also examine current defense strategies, highlighting their strengths and limitations. By contrasting advancements in attack and defense methodologies, we identify research gaps and propose future directions to enhance LLM security. Our goal is to advance the understanding of LLM safety challenges and guide the development of more robust security measures.</description>

      <title>Certifiable Black-Box Attacks with Randomized Adversarial Examples: Breaking Defenses with Provable Confidence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.04343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.04343v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Black-box adversarial attacks have demonstrated strong potential to compromise machine learning models by iteratively querying the target model or leveraging transferability from a local surrogate model. Recently, such attacks can be effectively mitigated by state-of-the-art (SOTA) defenses, e.g., detection via the pattern of sequential queries, or injecting noise into the model. To our best knowledge, we take the first step to study a new paradigm of black-box attacks with provable guarantees -- certifiable black-box attacks that can guarantee the attack success probability (ASP) of adversarial examples before querying over the target model. This new black-box attack unveils significant vulnerabilities of machine learning models, compared to traditional empirical black-box attacks, e.g., breaking strong SOTA defenses with provable confidence, constructing a space of (infinite) adversarial examples with high ASP, and the ASP of the generated adversarial examples is theoretically guaranteed without verification/queries over the target model. Specifically, we establish a novel theoretical foundation for ensuring the ASP of the black-box attack with randomized adversarial examples (AEs). Then, we propose several novel techniques to craft the randomized AEs while reducing the perturbation size for better imperceptibility. Finally, we have comprehensively evaluated the certifiable black-box attacks on the CIFAR10/100, ImageNet, and LibriSpeech datasets, while benchmarking with 16 SOTA black-box attacks, against various SOTA defenses in the domains of computer vision and speech recognition. Both theoretical and experimental results have validated the significance of the proposed attack. The code and all the benchmarks are available at \url{https://github.com/datasec-lab/CertifiedAttack}.</description>

      <title>Unconditionally Secure Commitments with Quantum Auxiliary Inputs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.18566v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show the following unconditional results on quantum commitments in two related yet different models:
  1. We revisit the notion of quantum auxiliary-input commitments introduced by Chailloux, Kerenidis, and Rosgen (Comput. Complex. 2016) where both the committer and receiver take the same quantum state, which is determined by the security parameter, as quantum auxiliary inputs. We show that computationally-hiding and statistically-binding quantum auxiliary-input commitments exist unconditionally, i.e., without relying on any unproven assumption, while Chailloux et al. assumed a complexity-theoretic assumption, ${\bf QIP}\not\subseteq{\bf QMA}$. On the other hand, we observe that achieving both statistical hiding and statistical binding at the same time is impossible even in the quantum auxiliary-input setting. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example of unconditionally proving computational security of any form of (classical or quantum) commitments for which statistical security is impossible. As intermediate steps toward our construction, we introduce and unconditionally construct post-quantum sparse pseudorandom distributions and quantum auxiliary-input EFI pairs which may be of independent interest.
  2. We introduce a new model which we call the common reference quantum state (CRQS) model where both the committer and receiver take the same quantum state that is randomly sampled by an efficient setup algorithm. We unconditionally prove that there exist statistically hiding and statistically binding commitments in the CRQS model, circumventing the impossibility in the plain model.
  We also discuss their applications to zero-knowledge proofs, oblivious transfers, and multi-party computations.</description>
