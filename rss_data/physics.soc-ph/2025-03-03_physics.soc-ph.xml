      <title>A new approach to sustainable solid waste incineration: the concept and generic feasibility study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A method of waste incineration using pure oxygen or atmospheric air enriched with oxygen is proposed, demonstrating several advantages over conventional burning in atmospheric air. The higher flame temperature is predicted, even with low calorific value waste, ensuring the complete decomposition of harmful substances such as dioxins. This process also increases the efficiency of heat-to-electricity generation via steam turbine and facilitates the melting of ash and dust, leading to the production of gravel or rock fibre. Additionally, it enables the incineration of a wide range of waste, including sewage sludge. The higher partial pressure of water vapor in the combustion gases allows to develop a novel method of filtration: condensation filtration. The method promises less or next to zero fly ash by-production. The process produces concentrated carbon dioxide suitable for storage or use in industrial and agricultural applications. Moreover, air separation as part of this method generates large quantities of argon, which can be utilized in high-tech industries. This approach offers a comprehensive solution to waste management and resource recovery. The paper presents the principal scheme for the process, its initial modelling and general feasibility study demonstrating its technological and commercial potential.</description>

      <title>A Unifying Model of Information Loss in Communication Across Populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many of today's most pressing issues require a more robust understanding of how information spreads in populations. Current models of information spread can be thought of as falling into one of two varieties: epidemiologically-inspired rumor spreading models, which do not account for the noisy nature of communication, or information theory-inspired communication models, which do not account for spreading dynamics in populations. The viral proliferation of misinformation and harmful messages seen both online and offline, however, suggests the need for a model that accounts for both noise in the communication process, as well as disease-like spreading dynamics.
  In this work, we leverage communication theory to meaningfully synthesize models of rumor spreading with models of noisy communication to develop a model for the noisy spread of structurally encoded messages. Furthermore, we use this model to develop a framework that allows us to consider not only the dynamics of messages, but the amount of information in the average message received by members of the population at any point in time. We find that spreading models and noisy communication models constitute the upper and lower bounds for the amount of information received, while our model fills the space in between. We conclude by considering our model and findings with respect to both modern communication theory and the current information landscape to glean important insights for the development of communication-based interventions to fight rising threats to democracy, public health, and social justice.</description>

      <title>Response of social norms to individual differences in error-proneness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Indirect reciprocity explains the evolution of cooperation by considering how our cooperative behavior toward someone is reciprocated by someone else who has observed us. A cohesive society has a shared norm that prescribes how to assess observed behavior as well as how to behave toward others based on the assessments, and the eight social norms that are evolutionarily stable against the invasion of mutants with different behavioral rules are referred to as the leading eight, whose member norms are called L1 to L8, respectively. Among the leading eight, L8 (also known as `Judging') has been deemed mostly irrelevant due to its poor performance in maintaining cooperation when each person may have a different opinion about someone instead of forming a public consensus. In this work, we propose that L8 can nevertheless be best protected from assessment errors among the leading eight if we take into account the intrinsic heterogeneity of error proneness among individuals because this norm heavily punishes those who are prone to errors in following its assessment rule. This finding suggests that individual differences should be explicitly taken into account as quenched randomness to obtain a thorough understanding of a social norm working in a heterogeneous environment.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Evolving Cortical Neuronal Networks Using Visual Informatics</title>

Abstract: Understanding the nature of the changes exhibited by evolving neuronal dynamics from high-dimensional activity data is essential for advancing neuroscience, particularly in the study of neuronal network development and the pathophysiology of neurological disorders. This work examines how advanced dimensionality reduction techniques can efficiently summarize and enhance our understanding of the development of neuronal networks over time and in response to stimulation. We develop a framework based on the Minimum-Distortion Embedding (MDE) methods and demonstrate how MDE outperforms better known benchmarks based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) by effectively preserving both global structures and local relationships within complex neuronal datasets. Our \emph{in silico} experiments reveal MDE's capability to capture the evolving connectivity patterns of simulated neuronal networks, illustrating a clear trajectory tracking the simulated network development. Complementary \emph{in vitro} experiments further validate MDE's advantages, highlighting its ability to identify behavioral differences and connectivity changes in neuronal cultures over a 35-day observation period. Additionally, we explore the effects of stimulation on neuronal activity, providing valuable insights into the plasticity and learning mechanisms of neuronal networks. Our findings underscore the importance of metric selection in dimensionality reduction, showing that correlation metrics yield more meaningful embeddings compared to Euclidean distance. The implications of this research extend to various areas, including the potential development of therapeutic intervention strategies for neurological disorders, and the identification of distinct phases of neuronal activity for advancing cortical-based computing devices.</description>

      <title>A data augmentation strategy for deep neural networks with application to epidemic modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we integrate the predictive capabilities of compartmental disease dynamics models with machine learning ability to analyze complex, high-dimensional data and uncover patterns that conventional models may overlook. Specifically, we present a proof of concept demonstrating the application of data-driven methods and deep neural networks to a recently introduced SIR-type model with social features, including a saturated incidence rate, to improve epidemic prediction and forecasting. Our results show that a robust data augmentation strategy trough suitable data-driven models can improve the reliability of Feed-Forward Neural Networks (FNNs) and Nonlinear Autoregressive Networks (NARs), making them viable alternatives to Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). This approach enhances the ability to handle nonlinear dynamics and offers scalable, data-driven solutions for epidemic forecasting, prioritizing predictive accuracy over the constraints of physics-based models. Numerical simulations of the post-lockdown phase of the COVID-19 epidemic in Italy and Spain validate our methodology.</description>

      <title>The amplifier effect of artificial agents in social contagion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in artificial intelligence have led to the proliferation of artificial agents in social contexts, ranging from education to online social media and financial markets, among many others. The increasing rate at which artificial and human agents interact makes it urgent to understand the consequences of human-machine interactions for the propagation of new ideas, products, and behaviors in society. Across two distinct empirical contexts, we find here that artificial agents lead to significantly faster and wider social contagion. To this end, we replicate a choice experiment previously conducted with human subjects by using artificial agents powered by large language models (LLMs). We use the experiment's results to measure the adoption thresholds of artificial agents and their impact on the spread of social contagion. We find that artificial agents tend to exhibit lower adoption thresholds than humans, which leads to wider network-based social contagions. Our findings suggest that the increased presence of artificial agents in real-world networks may accelerate behavioral shifts, potentially in unforeseen ways.</description>

      <title>From trust in news to disagreement: is misinformation more controversial?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12053v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The growing prevalence of fruitless disagreement threatens social cohesion and constructive public discourse. While polarised discussions often reflect distrust in the news, the link between disagreement and misinformation remains unclear. In this study, we used data from "Cartesio", an online experiment rating the trustworthiness of Italian news articles annotated for reliability by experts, to develop a disagreement metric that accounts for differences in mean trust values. Our findings show that while misinformation is rated as less trustworthy, it is not more controversial. Furthermore, disagreement correlates with increased commenting on Facebook. This suggests that combating misinformation alone may not reduce polarisation. Disagreement focuses more on the divergence of opinions, trust, and their effects on social cohesion. Our study lays the groundwork for unsupervised news analysis and highlights the need for platform design that promotes constructive interactions and reduces divisiveness.</description>

      <title>Evidence of Replica Symmetry Breaking under the Nishimori conditions in epidemic inference on graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13249v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In Bayesian inference, computing the posterior distribution from the data is typically a non-trivial problem, which usually requires approximations such as mean-field approaches or numerical methods, like the Monte Carlo Markov Chain. Being a high-dimensional distribution over a set of correlated variables, the posterior distribution can undergo the notorious replica symmetry breaking transition. When it happens, several mean-field methods and virtually every Monte Carlo scheme can not provide a reasonable approximation to the posterior and its marginals. Replica symmetry is believed to be guaranteed whenever the data is generated with known prior and likelihood distributions, namely under the so-called Nishimori conditions. In this paper, we break this belief, by providing a counter-example showing that, under the Nishimori conditions, replica symmetry breaking arises. Introducing a simple, geometrical model that can be thought of as a patient zero retrieval problem in a highly infectious regime of the epidemic Susceptible-Infectious model, we show that under the Nishimori conditions, there is evidence of replica symmetry breaking. We achieve this result by computing the instability of the replica symmetric cavity method toward the one step replica symmetry broken phase. The origin of this phenomenon -- replica symmetry breaking under the Nishimori conditions -- is likely due to the correlated disorder appearing in the epidemic models.</description>
