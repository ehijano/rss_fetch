      <title>Lower bounds of uncertainty and upper limits on the accuracy of forecasts of macroeconomic variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04644v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the randomness of values and volumes of market deals as a major factor that describes lower bounds of uncertainty and upper limits on the accuracy of the forecasts of macroeconomic variables, prices, and returns. We introduce random macroeconomic variables, whose average values coincide with usual macroeconomic variables, and describe their uncertainty by coefficients of variation that depend on the volatilities, correlations, and coefficients of variation of random values or volumes of trades. The same approach describes bounds of uncertainty and limits on the accuracy of forecasts for growth rates, inflation, interest rates, etc. Limits on the accuracy of forecasts of macroeconomic variables depend on the certainty of predictions of their probabilities. The number of predicted statistical moments determines the veracity of macroeconomic probability. To quantify macroeconomic 2nd statistical moments, one needs additional econometric methodologies, data, and calculations of variables determined as sums of squares of values or volumes of market trades. Forecasting of macroeconomic 2nd statistical moments requires 2nd order economic theories. All of that is absent and for many years to come, the accuracy of forecasts of the probabilities of random macroeconomic variables, prices, and returns will be limited by the Gaussian approximations, which are determined by the first two statistical moments.</description>

      <title>Endogenous distress contagion in a dynamic interbank model: how possible future losses may spell doom today</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.15431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.15431v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a dynamic and stochastic interbank model with an endogenous notion of distress contagion, arising from rational worries about future defaults and ensuing losses. This entails a mark-to-market valuation adjustment for interbank claims, leading to a forward-backward approach to the equilibrium dynamics whereby future default probabilities are needed to determine today's balance sheets. Distinct from earlier models, the resulting distress contagion acts, endogenously, as a stochastic volatility term that exhibits clustering and down-market spikes. Furthermore, by incorporating multiple maturities, we provide a novel framework for constructing systemic interbank term structures, reflecting the intertemporal risk of contagion. We present the analysis in two parts: first, the simpler single maturity setting that extends the classical interbank network literature and, then, the multiple maturity setting for which we can examine how systemic risk materialises in the shape of the resulting term structures.</description>
