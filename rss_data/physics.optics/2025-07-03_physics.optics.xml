      <title>Optical Vortex Spin-Orbit Control of Refractive Index in Iron Garnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interaction between light's angular momentum (AM) and material systems has unlocked new avenues in structured photonics, including in magneto-optical (MO) materials. While spin angular momentum (SAM) effects in MO systems are well-established, orbital angular momentum (OAM) introduces novel opportunities for new nonreciprocal light-matter interactions. In this study, we demonstrate a unique optical phenomenon where OAM states undergo state-specific nonreciprocal operation within an MO medium, reducing Faraday rotation. This effect arises from transverse momentum transfer into the material, inducing spin-orbit coupling (SOC) at a perturbed electronic transition rate. The resulting OAM-dependent optical SOC modifies the material's refractive index, directly linking structured light and MO response. Our findings extend previous observations of paraxial beams and reveal a deeper fundamental mechanism governing OAM-driven nonreciprocal interactions. These insights pave the way for OAM-selective nonreciprocal photonic devices, chiral optical logic, quantum memory elements, and ultrafast spintronic architectures. This work advances MO integration with structured light for enhanced control over photonic and spintronic systems.</description>

      <title>Observation of wave amplification and temporal topological state in a genuine photonic time crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photonic time crystals (PTCs) are materials whose dielectric permittivity is periodically modulated in time, giving rise to bandgaps not in energy-as in conventional photonic crystals-but in momentum, known as k-gaps. These k-gaps enable wave amplification by extracting energy from temporal modulation, offering a mechanism for coherent light generation that bypasses traditional optical gain. PTCs also extend the concept of topological insulators to the time domain, inducing a temporal topological state at the mid-gap of the k-gap, characterized by the Zak phase-a topological invariant originally defined for spatial lattices. Here, we experimentally demonstrate the properties of a k gap in a genuine PTC, realized in a dynamically modulated transmission-line metamaterial. Wave amplification within the k-gap is observed, with an initial power spectrum narrowing and shifting toward the gap. To probe the mid-gaptopological state, we introduce a temporal interface separating two PTCs with distinct topological phases. The measured phase shift between time-reflected and time-refracted waves, together with the temporal confinement of the topological state, provides direct evidence of nontrivial temporal topology. By integrating kgap amplification with time-domain topological features, our work opens new avenues for light generation and manipulation in time-varying photonic materials.</description>

      <title>A scalable and programmable optical neural network in a time-synthetic dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Programmable optical neural networks (ONNs) can offer high-throughput and energy-efficient solutions for accelerating artificial intelligence (AI) computing. However, existing ONN architectures, typically based on cascaded unitary transformations such as Mach-Zehnder interferometer meshes, face inherent scalability limitations due to spatial encoding, which causes optical components and system complexity to scale quadratically with network size. A promising solution to this challenge is the use of synthetic dimensions to enhance scalability, though experimental demonstration has remained scarce. Here, we present the first experimental demonstration of an all-optical, highly scalable, programmable ONN operating in a time-synthetic dimension. By implementing a time-cycle computation paradigm analogous to gate cycling in conventional spatial photonic circuits, our approach achieves a gate count surpassing that of state-of-the-art programmable photonic processors. Unlike conventional ONN architectures that rely on real-space wave interferences, our framework exploits time-reflection and time-refraction to perform computations, fundamentally eliminating backscattering errors through causality constraints. To bridge the gap between simulation and reality, we introduce an in-situ training framework that dynamically adapts to experimental errors, achieving performance exceeding traditional in silico learning paradigms. Our synthetic-dimension-based approach provides a compact, scalable, backscattering-free, and programmable neuromorphic computing architecture, advancing the potential for next-generation photonic AI systems.</description>

      <title>Direct Reconstruction of Terahertz-driven Subcycle Electron Emission Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While field-driven electron emission is theoretically understood down to the subcycle regime, its direct experimental temporal characterization using long-wavelength terahertz (THz) fields remains elusive. Here, by driving a graphite tip with phase-stable quasi-single-cycle THz pulses, we reveal distinct subcycle electron emission dynamics including: (1) At a carrier-envelope phase (CEP) near zero, spectral peaks scale linearly with THz field strength, characteristic of subcycle emission; (2) At the opposite CEP, dominant deceleration fields generate stationary low-energy peaks. Crucially, we develop a pump-probe-free, direct reconstruction method extracting electron pulse profiles solely from measured energy spectra, obtaining durations from 97.3 to 114.3 fs as the field increases (191-290 kV/cm). Phase-resolved simulations further reveal a 71.2% modulation in the cutoff energy and a near-total (99.7%) suppression of the emission current. This work not only validates the Fowler-Nordheim model under THz excitation but also establishes a general framework for the direct temporal characterization of subcycle electron emission, opening pathways for precise electron control in ultrafast electron sources and lightwave nanoelectronics.</description>

      <title>Toward a Robust and Generalizable Metamaterial Foundation Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advances in material functionalities drive innovations across various fields, where metamaterials-defined by structure rather than composition-are leading the way. Despite the rise of artificial intelligence (AI)-driven design strategies, their impact is limited by task-specific retraining, poor out-of-distribution(OOD) generalization, and the need for separate models for forward and inverse design. To address these limitations, we introduce the Metamaterial Foundation Model (MetaFO), a Bayesian transformer-based foundation model inspired by large language models. MetaFO learns the underlying mechanics of metamaterials, enabling probabilistic, zero-shot predictions across diverse, unseen combinations of material properties and structural responses. It also excels in nonlinear inverse design, even under OOD conditions. By treating metamaterials as an operator that maps material properties to structural responses, MetaFO uncovers intricate structure-property relationships and significantly expands the design space. This scalable and generalizable framework marks a paradigm shift in AI-driven metamaterial discovery, paving the way for next-generation innovations.</description>

      <title>Cascaded frequency conversion of highly charged femtosecond spatiotemporal optical vortices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The degrees of freedom inherent in spatiotemporal optical vortices (STOV's) afford intriguing opportunties to manipulate complex light fields for broad applications such as optical communication, light-matter interactions, particle manipulation, quantum optics, and electron acceleration in the relativistic regime. Unlike previous studies examining the second harmonic generation (SHG) of STOV's having an input topological charge (TC) l^{\left(\omega\right)}=1, here we experimentally demonstrate cascaded second and third harmonic generation of STOV's to achieve more diverse wavelength selectivity via sum frequency generation (SFG), achieving unprecedented TC values up to l^{\left(\omega\right)}=40. The large TC values are attributed to second (third) harmonic generation of an incident beam satisfying l^{\left(2\omega\right)}=2l^{\left(\omega\right)} (l^{\left(3\omega\right)}=3l^{\left(\omega\right)}). What is more, the wavelength of the generated STOV field was found to be tunable by controlling the position of the phase singularity in the frequency domain, and optimizing the nonlinear phase matching condition. Our experimental measurements extend the principle of conservation of the spatiotemporal topological charge to general nonlinear optical parametric processes, suggesting a fundamental approach to the production of STOV fields of arbitrarily large TC and at arbitrary visible wavelengths, and beyond (e.g., the ultraviolet range).</description>

      <title>Design of a three-dimensional parallel-to-point imaging system based on inverse methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an inverse method for designing a three-dimensional imaging system comprising of freeform optical surfaces. We impose an imaging condition on the optical map and combine it with the law of conservation of energy to conclude that the ratio of energy distributions at the source and target of an imaging system must be constant. A mathematical model for the design of a parallel-to-point system consisting of two freeform reflectors is presented. A Schwarzschild telescope, a classical design known for maximum correction of third-order aberrations, is utilized to specify the design parameters in the mathematical model, enabling us to compute an inverse freeform imaging system. The performance of both designs is compared by ray tracing various parallel beams of light and determining the corresponding spot sizes of the image. We demonstrate that our inverse freeform design is superior to the classical design.</description>

      <title>Zeptosecond Electron Pulse Train and Ultrafast Coherent Control of Quantum States via Multiphoton Inelastic Cherenkov Diffraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the quantum dynamics of fermionic particles interacting with a laser field in a gaseous medium, in the regime of inelastic diffraction scattering on the phase lattice of a slowed travelling wave, below the critical field of induced Cherenkov process. Using a relativistic quantum kinetic framework and numerical solutions of Dirac equation in the rest frame of the slowed wave, we analyze the evolution of actual electron wave packets and beams at the inelastic scattering on the actual laser pulses of finite duration. Our results reveal coherent multiphoton exchange involving up to $10^{4}$ photons and the emergence of attosecond-zeptosecond electron sub-bunches after the free-space propagation. The pulse compression by such mechanism is robust to laser pulse duration but sensitive to the initial momentum spread of the particles/beams. We propose a mechanism to achieve electron pulses in zeptosecond time scales with potentiality for ultrafast coherent control of quantum states that opens new avenues in high-resolution temporal structuring of electron beams for time-resolved quantum technologies and attosecond-zeptosecond science, as well as, for application in high-resolution electron microscopy.</description>

      <title>The geometric phase of rotations and 3D coordinate transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The wave description of geometric phase uses the superposition of light waves to explain the geometric phase's origin. While our previous work focused on a basis of linearly polarized waves, here we show that the same concepts can be applied to circularly polarized waves, and to any case in which a rotator is itself subjected to rotation. As with a linear polarization basis, we show that the addition of two vectors (rotators) with different orientations and magnitudes causes the orientation of the resulting vector to shift towards the component vector of greater magnitude, i.e. it introduces a geometric phase. We illustrate this approach with two classic examples of the geometric phase of rotations in space: a system of three fold mirrors, and the helical coiled fiber. In both cases we show that it is possible to derive the phase shift directly from the electromagnetic wave vector without needing to resort to mathematical abstractions such as differential geometry, or calculating solid angles in the space of directions.</description>

      <title>Attosecond physics in optical near fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Attosecond science, the electron control by the field of ultrashort laser pulses, is maturing into lightfield-driven electronics, called petahertz electronics. Based on optical field-driven nanostructures, elements for petahertz electronics have been demonstrated. These hinge on the understanding of the electron dynamics in the optical near field of the nanostructure. Here we show near field-induced low energy stripes (NILES) in carrier-envelope phase-dependent electron spectra, a new spectral feature appearing in the direct electrons emitted from a strongly driven nanostructure, i.e., in the easily accessible energy region between 0 and a few electron volts. NILES emerge due to the sub-cycle sensitivity of ponderomotive acceleration of electrons injected into a strong near field gradient by a few-cycle optical waveform. NILES enables us to track the emission of direct and re-scattered electrons down to sub-cycle time-scales and to infer the electron momentum width at emission. Because NILES shows up in the direct part of the electrons, a large fraction of the emitted electrons can now be steered in new ways, facilitating the isolation of individual electron bursts with high charge density of 430 attosecond duration. These results not only substantially advance the understanding of attosecond physics in optical near fields, but also provide new ways of electron control for the nascent field of petahertz electronics.</description>

      <title>Generation of Intense Deep-Ultraviolet Pulses at 200 nm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the generation of intense deep ultraviolet pulses at 200 nm with a duration of 48 fs and pulse energy of 130 uJ, achieved via cascaded sum frequency generation using 800 nm femtosecond pulses in barium borate crystals. Efficient frequency up-conversion is realized by optimizing phase-matching conditions and implementing dispersion control, while maintaining the ultrashort pulse characteristics. The generated deep ultraviolet pulses are characterized using two-photon absorption frequency-resolved optical gating, providing detailed insight into their temporal profile and phase. This approach addresses key challenges in ultrashort deep ultraviolet pulse generation, delivering a high-energy, ultrashort source suitable for ultrafast spectroscopy, nonlinear optics, and strong-field physics. These results represent a significant advancement in the generation of high-energy, ultrashort deep ultraviolet pulses, opening new possibilities for time-resolved investigations in ultrafast molecular dynamics, as well as emerging applications in semiconductor science, quantum materials, and photochemistry.</description>

      <title>Terahertz Chip-Scale Meta-Networks with LSPR Routing: A Theoretical Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient chip-scale interconnects are essential for modern microelectronic-photonic systems, supporting high bandwidth and low-latency processing. Traditional wired links face high resistivity and latency, while millimeter-wave wireless solutions suffer from bandwidth congestion and interference. Terahertz (THz) plasmonic communication, based on surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs), offers high data rates and broad bandwidth, and is compatible with nanophotonic platforms. This work introduces a Binary Field-Driven Meta-Routing Method supported by a semi-analytical framework that models the tunable interaction between THz plasmonic phenomena and graphene's electromagnetic properties. By modulating graphene's impedance, the method enables dynamic coupling and routing of localized surface plasmon resonances (LSPRs) across a meta-network, facilitating real-time beam steering in chip-scale systems. Combining analytical conductivity models, coupled-mode theory, and algorithmic control, the approach enables predictive configuration of LSPR-based steering in reconfigurable graphene metasurfaces. Four meta-pixel antenna configurations Y-MetaRouter, MetaSwitcher, Penta-MetaEmitter, and CP-MetaCore are designed to support unidirectional radiation, bi-directional steering, frequency-driven transitions, and circular polarization, respectively. Chemical potential modulation creates reconfigurable LSPR pathways and virtual SPP channels. A Coupled-Mode Theory for Field-Driven LSPR Meta-Networks is proposed to model current distributions and predict far-field characteristics. Results show strong agreement between theory and full-wave simulations. A point-to-point meta-wireless link is analyzed, demonstrating scalability for low-latency, high-performance THz communication in WiNoC and chiplet applications. System-level metrics confirm feasibility for space-constrained, high-speed interconnects.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal modes of Floquet media slabs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exploiting non-Hermitian wave-matter interactions in time-modulated media to enable the dynamic control of electromagnetic waves requires advanced theoretical tools. In this article we bridge concepts from photonic quasinormal modes (QNMs) and time-varying metamaterials providing the foundation for designing dynamic optical devices with prescribed scattering properties. Establishing the QNM framework for slabs with time-periodic permittivity, and solving the associated nonlinear eigenvalue problem, allows us to derive the QNM expansion capturing the resonant features of the system. This reduced-order model enables highly efficient computation of scattered fields while revealing insight into how modulation couples to resonant modes, creating tailored gain-loss engineering. Our approach is validated through numerical experiments on time-modulated systems, and we design strategies to engineer tailored excitations selectively amplifying or suppressing specific modal contributions.</description>

      <title>Frequency reproducibility of solid-state Th-229 nuclear clocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01180v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solid-state $^{229}$Th nuclear clocks are set to provide new opportunities for precision metrology and fundamental physics. Taking advantage of a nuclear transition's inherent low sensitivity to its environment, orders of magnitude more emitters can be hosted in a solid-state crystal compared to current optical lattice atomic clocks. Furthermore, solid-state systems needing only simple thermal control are key to the development of field-deployable compact clocks. In this work, we explore and characterize the frequency reproducibility of the $^{229}$Th:CaF$_2$ nuclear clock transition, a key performance metric for all clocks. We measure the transition linewidth and center frequency as a function of the doping concentration, temperature, and time. We report the concentration-dependent inhomogeneous linewidth of the nuclear transition, limited by the intrinsic host crystal properties. We determine an optimal working temperature for the $^{229}$Th:CaF$_2$ nuclear clock at 195(5) K where the first-order thermal sensitivity vanishes. This would enable in-situ temperature co-sensing using different quadrupole-split lines, reducing the temperature-induced systematic shift below the 10$^{-18}$ fractional frequency uncertainty level. At 195 K, the reproducibility of the nuclear transition frequency is 280 Hz (fractionally $1.4\times10^{-13}$) for two differently doped $^{229}$Th:CaF$_2$ crystals over four months. These results form the foundation for understanding, controlling, and harnessing the coherent nuclear excitation of $^{229}$Th in solid-state hosts, and for their applications in constraining temporal variations of fundamental constants.</description>

      <title>Topological Reality Switch: Towards Bulk-Boundary Selective Lasing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02038v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emergence of complex spectra in non-Hermitian systems causes dramatic changes even under weak perturbations, significantly hindering their precise control for study and integration into practical applications. Achieving a controlled method to generate a real spectrum in non-Hermitian systems has long been a key objective in the field. In this study, we explore the 2D non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model and introduce a reality switch that allows for the controllable induction of a real spectrum depending on the imposed boundary condition. We show that a topological phase transition in the complex gap accompanies the switching process. Our work lays the cornerstone for developing a selective bulk-boundary control mechanism for the gain and lasing behaviors in non-Hermitian systems.</description>

      <title>Synergistic Effects of Spin-Orbit Coupling and Intercomponent Interactions in Two-Component (2+1)D Photonic Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02505v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study investigates the formation, stability and dynamic advancement of two-dimensional vortex quantum droplets within binary Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs), shaped by the interplay of photonic spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and quantum fluctuation effects. SOC leads to significant droplet stretching, resulting in vortex clusters forming in each component. The competition between photonic SOC and Lee-Huang-Yang (LHY) interactions introduces vortices into the condensate, described by the numerically solved Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE). The results show that droplets like structures arise at low SOC strengths and interaction parameters. The transition to vortex takes place as the SOC increases. Enhanced interactions give rise to the emergence of quantum droplets as the vortices dissipate, demonstrating fascinating dynamics. These findings enhance understanding of the physical properties of photonic SOC coupled binary BECs in 2D with LHY correction, impacting cold-atom physics and condensed matter research. The study can also be expanded to explore quantum droplets with a small atom count, which is advantageous for experimental applications.</description>

      <title>Induced Berry Connection and Photonic Spin Hall Effect in Optical Dirac Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01016v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Within the framework of optical Dirac theory, we present a field-theoretical model of spin-orbit interaction and photonic spin/orbit Hall effects. Our approach reformulates light propagation along helical paths as solving the Maxwell equations in a ray-based curvilinear coordinate system. This system can alternatively be interpreted as a spin-degenerate medium with antisymmetric elements in the dielectric tensor, corresponding to the spin-1 excitation mode characterized by a rotational dipole vector. We show that, at leading order, the resulting effective Hamiltonian is equivalent to the Maxwell theory in a uniformly rotating frame, incorporating both spin-rotation and orbit-rotation coupling. This rotation arises from the torsion of helical paths, manifesting as extrinsic orbital angular momentum (EOAM) of photons. Notably, the spin angular momentum (SAM) of the photon and its intrinsic orbital angular momentum (IOAM) contribute jointly to the geometric phase. In the Heisenberg picture, the spin and orbital Hall effects naturally emerge from interaction terms in the ray equations. Furthermore, we find that the transverse spin of evanescent waves couples with EOAM, revealing that the geometric phase of elliptically polarized light differs from that of circularly polarized light. This distinction underscores the role of spin-orbit coupling in modifying phase accumulation.</description>

      <title>Chiral high-harmonic generation in metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10368v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-harmonic generation (HHG) provides the only source of attosecond pulses -- currently the shortest accessible time intervals, and it is employed as the only table-top source of light in extreme UV and soft X-ray spectral regions. Chiral HHG can be employed as an efficient tool for studying the ultrafast response of chiral properties of matter, as well as for amplifying chiroptical effects. Traditionally, chiral high harmonics were associated with gases of enantiomer molecules or, more recently, solid surfaces with helicity in their crystalline structure. Here, we bring the concept of chiral high-harmonic generation to nanophotonics, specifically to metasurfaces consisting of arrays of nanoresonators. Our system is achiral at the material as well as at the level of individual nanoresonators. Chirality rises and falls in a controlled manner via an interplay of the nanoresonator symmetry and the symmetry of the metasurface lattice. Our calculations predict high contrast in harmonic brightness between the two orthogonal circular polarizations of the pump. Our findings, at the intersection of chiral nanophotonics and strong-field optics, pave the way for chiral attosecond physics and chiral extreme UV optics in nanostructured solids.</description>

      <title>Bistable quartic soliton in saturable nonlinear media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23847v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This report presents a theoretical demonstration of a novel bistable quartic soliton (BQS) in saturable nonlinear media, specifically within a realistic dispersion-engineered ridge waveguide made of Lithium Niobate (\( \text{LiNbO}_3 \)). The study employs the variational method to establish the amplitude-width relationship, indicating the coexistence of stable solitons with the same duration but differing amplitudes. Additionally, the impact of shock on the bistable soliton is examined through perturbative variational analysis, supported by numerical results. The robustness of the BQS under perturbations is further investigated via linear stability analysis.</description>

      <title>Structured squeezed light allows for high-harmonic generation in classical forbidden geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11042v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-harmonic generation (HHG) is a nonlinear process in which a strong driving field interacts with a material, resulting in the frequency up-conversion of the driver into its high-order harmonics. This process is highly sensitive to the field's polarization: circular polarization, for instance, inhibits HHG. In this work, we demonstrate that the use of non-classical structured light enables HHG in this otherwise prohibitive configuration for classical drivers. We consider circularly polarized light with non-classical fluctuations, introduced via squeezing along one polarization direction, and show that these non-classical features prompt the HHG process. We find that the spectral properties of the emitted harmonics depend on the type of squeezing applied and, by analyzing the inner electron dynamics, we relate the observed differences to modifications of the HHG three-step mechanism induced by the specific squeezing type. This approach opens new pathways for integrating quantum optics in HHG, providing novel means of controlling the light-matter interaction dynamics.</description>

      <title>A Liquid-Nitrogen-Cooled Ca+ Ion Optical Clock with a Systematic Uncertainty of 4.6E-19</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17423v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report a single-ion optical clock based on the 4S_1/2-3D_5/2 transition of the 40Ca+ ion, operated in a liquid nitrogen cryogenic environment,achieving a total systematic uncertainty of 4.6E-19. We employ a refined temperature evaluation scheme to reduce the frequency uncertainty due to blackbody radiation (BBR), and the 3D sideband cooling has been implemented to minimize the second-order Doppler shift. We have precisely determined the average Zeeman coefficient of the 40Ca+ clock transition to be 14.345(40) Hz/mT^2, thereby significantly reducing the quadratic Zeeman shift uncertainty. Moreover, the cryogenic environment enables the lowest reported heating rate due to ambient electric field noise in trapped-ion optical clocks.</description>
