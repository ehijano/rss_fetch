      <title>The classification of ACM curves on a surface in $\mathbb{P}^{3}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We classify ACM curves contained in a surface of degree d in $\mathbb{P}^{3}$ in terms of weak admissible pairs. In the case of a very general smooth determinantal quartic surface, we provide a geometric description of these curves and compute their Picard classes on the surface. Finally, we present a generalization to ACM closed subvarieties of codimension $1$ on a hypersurface in $\mathbb{P}^{n}$.</description>

      <title>Evolving Ranking Functions for Canonical Blow-Ups in Positive Characteristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Resolution of singularities in positive characteristic remains a long-standing open problem in algebraic geometry. In characteristic zero, the problem was solved by Hironaka in 1964, work for which he was awarded the Fields Medal. Modern proofs proceed by constructing suitable ranking functions, that is, invariants shown to strictly decrease along canonical sequences of blow-ups, ensuring termination. In positive characteristic, however, no such general ranking function is known: Frobenius-specific pathologies, such as the kangaroo phenomenon, can cause classical characteristic-zero invariants to plateau or even temporarily increase, presenting a fundamental obstruction to existing approaches. In this paper we report a sequence of experiments using the evolutionary search model AlphaEvolve, designed to discover candidate ranking functions for a toy canonical blow-up process. Our test benchmarks consist of carefully selected hypersurface singularities in dimension $4$ and characteristic $p=3$, with monic purely inseparable leading term, a regime in which naive order-based invariants often fail. After iteratively refining the experimental design, we obtained a discretized five-component lexicographic ranking function satisfying a bounded-delay descent criterion with zero violations across the benchmark. These experiments in turn motivated our main results: the conjectural delayed ranking functions in characteristic $3$ formulated in two conjectures.</description>

      <title>121 Patchworked Curves of Degree Seven</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The 121 real schemes, i.e., ambient isotopy classes, of smooth real plane algebraic curves of degree seven were classified by Viro (1984). By constructing one patchwork of the dilated triangle $7\cdot\Delta_2$ for each real scheme, we provide an explicit method for constructing polynomials realizing each real scheme. In particular, every real scheme of degree seven can be realized as a T-curve; this settles a question raised by Itenberg and Viro (1996).</description>

      <title>Higher rank bundles on Hopf surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that all filtrable bundles on a Hopf surface $X$ must have jumps and we prove the existence of filtrable stable bundles on $X$ with any value of $c_2&gt;0$. On a somewhat opposite direction, for each integer $r\ge 2$ we prove the existence of irreducible rank $r$ vector bundles on $X$ with trivial determinant, $c_2=1$, and no jumps.
  We then apply elementary operations in codimension $2$ to points of the moduli space $\mathcal M_{r,n}$ of rank $r$ stable vector bundles on $X$ with $c_2=n$ to obtain torsion free sheaves with $c_2=n+1$. Namely, starting with a surjection $v\colon E \rightarrow \mathbb C_p$ from a vector bundle $E \in \mathcal M_{r,n}$ to a skyscraper sheaf supported at a point $p\in X$, we prove that if $E'$ is any torsion free sheaf fitting into a short exact sequence of the form $0 \longrightarrow E'\longrightarrow E\stackrel{v}{\longrightarrow}\mathbb C_p \longrightarrow 0,$ then $E'$ is in the closure of $\mathcal M_{r,n+1}$.
  We discuss various properties of vector bundles and torsion free sheaves and introduce the concept of very irreducible bundles to describe bundles whose symmetric powers $S^n(E)$ are irreducible for all $n&gt; 0$. We then show that any rank $2$ bundle on $X$ whose graph contains a component corresponding to a surjective morphism $\mathbb P^1\to \mathbb P^1$ is very irreducible.</description>

      <title>Algebraic Robustness Verification of Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We formulate formal robustness verification of neural networks as an algebraic optimization problem. We leverage the Euclidean Distance (ED) degree, which is the generic number of complex critical points of the distance minimization problem to a classifier's decision boundary, as an architecture-dependent measure of the intrinsic complexity of robustness verification. To make this notion operational, we define the associated ED discriminant, which characterizes input points at which the number of real critical points changes, distinguishing test instances that are easier or harder to verify. We provide an explicit algorithm for computing this discriminant. We further introduce the parameter discriminant of a neural network, identifying parameters where the ED degree drops and the decision boundary exhibits reduced algebraic complexity. We derive closed-form expressions for the ED degree for several classes of neural architectures, as well as formulas for the expected number of real critical points in the infinite-width limit. Finally, we present an exact robustness certification algorithm based on numerical homotopy continuation, establishing a concrete link between metric algebraic geometry and neural network verification.</description>

      <title>Automorphic Cohomology and the Limits of Algebraic Cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06865v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper establishes an explicit obstruction to constructing algebraic cycles from automorphic cohomology classes on Shimura varieties. We produce a rational Hodge class $\Omega_E$ in the intersection cohomology of the Baily-Borel compactification of a Shimura variety for $\text{SO}(2,26)$, arising from a stable residual automorphic representation via theta lift from the weight-$2$ newform of conductor $11$. While $\Omega_E$ is automorphic and of pure Hodge type, we prove it is non-interior and hence cannot be obtained from special cycles, theta lifts, endoscopic transfers, or boundary pushforwards, all of which yield interior classes. The result is unconditional, relying only on Arthur's classification, Vogan-Zuckerman theory, the fundamental lemma, and the Zucker conjecture (proven by Looijenga-Saper-Stern), and it highlights a fundamental asymmetry between automorphic cohomology and geometric access to algebraic cycles, refining the Hodge conjecture from a question of existence to one of constructive tractability.</description>

Abstract: This paper studies the integration problem in differential fields that may involve quantities reminiscent of the Weierstrass $\wp$ function, which are defined by a first-order nonlinear differential equation. We extend the classical notion of special polynomials to elements of Weierstrass-like extensions and present algorithms for reduction in such extensions. As an application of these results, we derive some new formulae for integrals of powers of $\wp$.</description>

      <title>Towards Lang--Vojta via Degeneration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.06956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Towards the Lang--Vojta conjecture, we prove results on finiteness and Zariski degeneracy of $S$-integral points of varieties over number fields $k$, including many cases with geometrically irreducible boundary divisors. Our approach builds on the study of arithmetic and geometric properties of moduli spaces of curves with extra structure. As an application, we provide families of explicit examples of geometrically irreducible divisors on the projective plane (such as the dual of any smooth curve of degree at least $3$), with respect to which the sets of $S$-integral points are finite. Answering a question of Achenjang and Morrow, we show that, other than the case of curves, every normal projective variety admits a geometrically irreducible divisor $D$ for which finiteness of $(D,S)$-integral points holds over every finite extension of $k$.</description>

      <title>Stability conditions in the mathematical Gauged Linear Sigma Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.11174v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The theory of Mixed-Spin-P (MSP) fields was introduced by Chang-Li-Li-Liu for the quintic threefold, aiming at studying its higher-genus Gromov-Witten invariants. Chang-Guo-Li has successfully applied it to prove conjectures including the BCOV Feynman rule, Yamaguchi-Yau's polynomiality conjecture and the Holomorphic Anomaly Equation. Meanwhile, Fan-Jarvis-Ruan introduced a mathematical theory of Gauged Linear Sigma Model (GLSM), associating a counting theory to a GIT quotient with a super-potential, under suitable assumptions.
  This paper provides a common generalization of both works, by introducing new stability conditions in the mathematical GLSM. We show that our stability condition guarantees the separatedness and properness of the cosection degeneracy locus in the moduli. It generalizes the MSP fields construction to more general GIT quotients, including Calabi-Yau global complete intersections in toric varieties. This hopefully provides a geometric platform to effectively compute their higher-genus Gromov-Witten invariants.</description>

Abstract: Let $G$ be a reductive group acting on an affine scheme $V$. We study the set of principal $G$-bundles on a smooth projective curve $\mathcal C$ such that the associated $V$-bundle admits a section sending the generic point of $\mathcal C$ into the GIT stable locus $V^{\mathrm{s}}(\theta)$. We show that after fixing the degree of the line bundle induced by the character $\theta$, the set of such principal $G$-bundles is bounded. The statement of our theorem is made slightly more general so that we deduce from it the boundedness for $\epsilon$-stable quasimaps and $\Omega$-stable LG-quasimap.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07315v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a new algebraic linearization of the discrete periodic Toda flow by using Mumford's algebraic description of the Jacobian of a hyperelliptic curve. In particular, the discrete periodic Toda flow can be expressed in terms of the famous Gau{\ss} composition law for quadratic forms adapted to the framework of hyperelliptic curves by Cantor. One surprising consequence of our approach is a new integrality property for the discrete periodic Toda flow which leads to a $p$-adic description of the closely related periodic box-ball flow, which has very surprising connections to number theory.</description>

      <title>Canonical torus action on symplectic singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15791v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that any symplectic singularity lying on a smoothable projective symplectic variety locally admits a good action of $(\mathbb{C}^*)^r$, which is canonical. Under mild assumptions, we actually prove such singularity germ is the cone vertex over a contact orbifold with weak K\"ahler-Einstein metric, forcing $r=1$. In particular, it admits a (canonical) good $\mathbb{C}^*$-action, which also extends to (canonical) actions of $\mathbb{H}^*\supset SU(2)$. These settle Kaledin's conjecture conditionally but in a substantially stronger form by establishing the canonicity, the extensibility of the action, for instance. Our key idea is to use the Donaldson-Sun theory on local K\"ahler metrics in complex differential geometry to connect with the theory of Poisson deformations of symplectic varieties.
  For general symplectic singularities, we prove the same assertions, assuming that the Donaldson-Sun theory extends to such singularities along with suitable singular (hyper)K\"ahler metrics. Conversely, our results can also be used to study the local behavior of such metrics around the germ.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.18475v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let G be a connected reductive algebraic group over a perfect field. We study the representability of the equivariant automorphism group of G-varieties. For a broad class of complexity-one G-varieties, we show that this group is representable by a group scheme locally of finite type when the base field has characteristic zero. We also establish representability by a linear algebraic group in the case of almost homogeneous G-varieties of arbitrary complexity. Finally, using an exact sequence description of the equivariant automorphism group, we deduce that complexity-one G-varieties with representable equivariant automorphism group admit only finitely many real forms.</description>

      <title>The Chow Ring of the Hilbert Cube</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.08399v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a smooth projective variety $X$ over an algebraically closed field $k$, we compute the Chow ring of the Hilbert scheme of three points on $X$, $\operatorname{Hilb}^3(X)$, as an algebra with generators and relations over the Chow ring of $X\times\operatorname{Sym}^2(X)$. If in addition the characteristic of $k$ is zero, we extend the computation to the quasi-projective case.</description>

      <title>Counting point configurations in projective space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15421v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the enumerative geometry of point configurations in projective space. We define "projective configuration counts": these enumerate configurations of points in projective space such that certain specified subsets are in fixed relative positions. The $\mathbb{P}^1$ case recovers cross-ratio degrees, which arise naturally in numerous contexts. We establish two main results. The first is a combinatorial upper bound given by the number of weighted transversals of a bipartite graph. The second is a recursion that relates counts associated to projective spaces of different dimensions, by projecting away from a given point. Key inputs include the Gelfand-MacPherson correspondence, the Jacobi-Trudi and Thom-Porteous formulae, and the notion of surplus from matching theory of bipartite graphs.</description>

      <title>Relative Langlands Duality of Toric Periods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18231v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The relative Langlands program introduced by Ben-Zvi--Sakellaridis--Venkatesh posits a duality structure exchanging automorphic periods and L-functions, which can be encoded by pairs of dual Hamiltonian actions. In work of the author and Venkatesh, an extension of the definitions to certain singular spaces was made with the objective of restoring duality in some well-known automorphic integrals. In this companion article we apply these definitions to establish duality in the context of affine toric varieties, and study finer structures regarding regularization and stabilizers that are instructive for the general case.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics for resolutions and smoothings of Calabi-Yau conifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16702v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the Calabi-Yau metrics with isolated conical singularities of Hein-Sun admit polyhomogeneous expansions near their singularities. Moreover, we show that, under certain generic assumptions, natural families of smooth Calabi-Yau metrics on crepant resolutions and on polarized smoothings of conical Calabi-Yau manifolds degenerating to the initial conical Calabi-Yau metric admit polyhomogeneous expansions where the singularities are forming. The construction proceeds by performing weighted Melrose-type blow-ups and then gluing conical and scaled asymptotically conical Calabi-Yau metrics on the fibers, close to the blow-up's front face without compromising polyhomogeneity. This yields a polyhomogeneous family of K\"ahler metrics that are approximately Calabi-Yau. Solving formally a complex Monge-Amp\`ere equation, we obtain a polyhomogeneous family of K\"ahler metrics with Ricci potential converging rapidly to zero as the family is degenerating. We can then conclude that the corresponding family of degenerating Calabi-Yau metrics is polyhomogeneous by using a fixed point argument.</description>

      <title>Non-standard Holomorphic Structures on Line Bundles over the Quantum Projective Line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14263v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study non-standard holomorphic structures on line bundles over the quantum projective line $\mathbb{C} P^1_q$. We show that there exist infinitely many non-gauge equivalent holomorphic structures on those line bundles. This gives a negative answer to a question raised by Khalkhali, Landi, and Van Suijlekom in 2011.</description>
