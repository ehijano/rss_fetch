      <title>A novel particle-in-well technology for single-molecule sequencing by surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-molecule surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy based on a particle trapped in a plasmonic nanopores provides a unique method for continued and controlled detection of peptide and DNA oligonucleotides in liquid medium. However, the Brownian motion of the particle and the molecule diffusion acting on the particle hinder single-molecule sequencing. In this study, we developed a method for trapping a gold nanoparticle in an air-filled gold nanowell (particle-in-well) to stabilize the particle and provide a powerful platform for continuous single molecule readout. The unlimited resident time of the particle-in-well device with single-molecule level sensitivity elevates nucleobase detection to a new level. We present a technique capable of detecting and monitoring solid-phase molecule diffusion within the plasmonic hotspot. Furthermore, the measured spectra were employed as input data for the validation of the plasmonic hotspot size and, consequently, the distance between the particle and the well. The obtained results form the statistical and experimental base for molecular translocation and DNA sequencing technologies.</description>

      <title>Generation of neutron Airy beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Airy wave packet is a solution to the potential-free Schrodinger equation that exhibits remarkable properties such as self-acceleration, non-diffraction, and self-healing. Although Airy beams are now routinely realized with electromagnetic waves and electrons, the implementation with neutrons has remained elusive due to small transverse coherence lengths, low fluence rates, and the absence of neutron lenses. In this work, we overcome these challenges through a holographic approach and present the first experimental demonstration of neutron Airy beams. The presented techniques pave the way for fundamental physics studies with Airy beams of non-elementary particles, the development of novel neutron optics components, and the realization of neutron Airy-vortex beams.</description>

      <title>Fatigue life prediction at mesoscopic scale of samples containing casting defects: A novel energy based non-local model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fatigue failure driven by stress gradients associated to casting defects was studied in two cast nickel-based superalloys. The experimental campaign revealed complex damage phenomena linked to spongeous shrinkages, characterized by their intricate arrangement of defects in the material medium, forming defect clusters. Multiple cracks were observed to initiate from defect volumes, coalescing with neighboring void surfaces along crystallographic planes. Defects were characterized using X-ray computed tomography, and image-based finite element (FE) models were constructed as digital representations of each experimental sample explicitly containing all real casting defects. Numerical simulations of these FE models under the same conditions as the experiments revealed that tortuous defects contain small ligaments where very high local stresses develop. These ligaments initiate early cracks, but due to the limited stressed volumes, these cracks do not drive the life of the material. A thorough comparison of simulations with experiments led to the development of an original method to define stressed volumes and address small ligaments. Finally, a novel energy-based non-local model was proposed, using two parameters to predict the fatigue lives of samples containing casting defects at the mesoscopic scale. The model was validated against samples with varying porosity levels, sizes, and geometries, accurately predicting fatigue lives within a factor of 3 compared to experimental results. This new approach generalizes the application of non-local methods to real casting defects by considering their shape and stressed volumes to estimate fatigue properties.</description>

      <title>Exploring quantum sensing for fine-grained liquid recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent years have witnessed the use of pervasive wireless signals (e.g., Wi-Fi, RFID, and mmWave) for sensing purposes. Due to its non-intrusive characteristic, wireless sensing plays an important role in various intelligent sensing applications. However, limited by the inherent thermal noise of RF transceivers, the sensing granularity of existing wireless sensing systems are still coarse, limiting their adoption for fine-grained sensing applications. In this paper, we introduce the quantum receiver, which does not contain traditional electronic components such as mixers, amplifiers, and analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) to wireless sensing systems, significantly reducing the source of thermal noise. By taking non-intrusive liquid recognition as an application example, we show the superior performance of quantum wireless sensing. By leveraging the unique property of quantum receiver, we propose a novel double-ratio method to address several well-known challenges in liquid recognition, eliminating the effect of liquid volume, device-target distance and container. We implement the quantum sensing prototype and evaluate the liquid recognition performance comprehensively. The results show that our system is able to recognize 17 commonly seen liquids, including very similar ones~(e.g., Pepsi and Coke) at an accuracy higher than 99.9\%. For milk expiration monitoring, our system is able to achieve an accuracy of 99.0\% for pH value measurements at a granularity of 0.1, which is much finer than that required for expiration monitoring.</description>

      <title>Measuring the Adhesion of Graphene Flake Networks via Button Shear Tests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graphene flake-based dispersions are attractive materials for various applications in microelectronics because of their ease of fabrication and the potential to deposit them on diverse substrates. The integration of these materials into conductive networks and microdevices requires thorough knowledge of their mechanical material properties, including adhesion. This paper presents quantitative adhesion measurements of graphene flake networks on silicon dioxide (SiO${_2}$) via button shear testing (BST). In this method, shear forces are applied to prefabricated micrometric buttons until they delaminate, providing information about the shear strength of the underlying graphene. We applied BST to graphene flake networks with different flake structures and defect densities. Flat flakes, a flat network structure, and a high flake defect density improve adhesion. We further demonstrate that graphene flake networks have stronger adhesion than chemical vapor deposited monolayer graphene grown on copper and transferred to SiO${_2}$. Hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS) increases the total adhesion force by improving flake network formation. Finally, we provide flake-type-specific delamination patterns by combining BST, optical microscopy, and Raman spectroscopy. We establish BST as a quantitative technique for measuring the adhesion of graphene dispersions and show the crucial role of interflake junctions in the overall adhesion of graphene flake networks.</description>

      <title>Requirements on bit resolution in optical Ising machine implementations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical Ising machines have emerged as a promising dynamical hardware solver for computational hard optimization problems. These Ising machines typically require an optical modulator to represent the analog spin variables of these problems. However, modern day optical modulators have a relatively low modulation resolution. We therefore investigate how the low bit-resolution of optical hardware influences the performance of this type of novel computing platform. Based on numerical simulations, we determine the minimum required bit-resolution of an optical Ising machine for different benchmark problems of different sizes. Our study shows that a limited bit-resolution of 8bit is sufficient for the optical modulator. Surprisingly, we also observe that the use of a 1bit-resolution modulator significantly improves the performance of the Ising machine across all considered benchmark problems.</description>

      <title>Ultrahigh pyroelectricity in monoelemental 2D tellurium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19083v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report an ultrahigh pyroelectric response in van der Waals bonded layers of two-dimensional (2D) tellurium (Te) nanosheets (thickness, d = 4 to 5 nm) at periodic on-off temperature oscillations. For the first time a large pyroelectric coefficient, Pc ~ 3 mC.m-2.K-1, is observed which is eightfold higher than the traditional state-of-the-art pyroelectrics (lead zirconate titanate, PZT). The first-principles calculations point out that the breakdown of centro-symmetry in the 1-3 Te-layers (P-3m1 space group) of a non-centrosymmetry (higher-order symmetry of C2 space group) on an angular twist in the Te-Te bonds of an exotic electronic state in 2D Te. The angular Te-Te twisting elicits a surface-enhanced Raman band at 101 cm-1 (absent in bulk Te). The stimulation of the Born effective charge, in-plane piezoelectricity and thermal expansion coefficient are shown to tailor the large pyroelectricity. Thus, 2D Te nanosheets present a new paradigm for the wide application of pyroelectric materials for developing thermal energy-based flexible electronics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an improved compact model for TeraFETs employing a nonlinear transmission line approach to describe the non-uniform carrier density oscillations and electron inertia effects in the TeraFET channels. By calculating the equivalent components for each segment of the channel: conductance, capacitance, and inductance, based on the voltages at the segment's nodes, our model accommodates non-uniform variations along the channel. We validate the efficacy of this approach by comparing terahertz (THz) response simulations with experimental data and MOSA1, EKV TeraFET SPICE models, analytical theories, and Multiphysics simulations.</description>

      <title>High-efficiency broadband achromatic metalens in the visible</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19249v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The metalenses have been extensively studied for their compact and flexible characteristics in focusing and imaging applications. However, it remains a significant challenge to design a broadband achromatic metalens that maintains high efficiency under arbitrary polarization incidence. In this work, we design a broadband achromatic metalens that achieves polarization-independent, high-efficiency focusing by effectively utilizing both co-polarization and cross-polarization components of the transmitted light. Using a minimalist anisotropic nanofin library, we optimize the phase distribution of the metalens at each designed wavelength with the particle swarm algorithm. Numerical simulations demonstrate a stable focal length with a deviation of less than 4$\%$ and an average focusing efficiency of 80.5$\%$ in the visible wavelength range of 450 to 650 nm. Moreover, we design a multi-wavelength off-axis bi-focal metalens to demonstrate the flexible control of output light phase and dispersion achieved by this method. The generality of this design enables its implementation in various metasurface devices, accelerating applications in broadband imaging and virtual/augmented reality.</description>

      <title>Ultralow-loss spiral resonators for precise LiDAR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19360v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Swept laser interferometry is an extremely powerful solution embedded in several recent technologies such as absolute distance measurement, light detection and ranging, optical frequency domain reflectometry, optical coherence tomography, microresonator characterization, and gas spectroscopy. Nonlinearity in the optical frequency sweeping of tunable lasers is a fatal drawback in gaining the expected outcome from these technologies. Here, we introduce an onchip, millimeter scale, 7 m spiral resonator that is made of ultralow loss silicon nitride to act as a frequency ruler for correction of the tunable lasers sweeping nonlinearities. The sharp 2 MHz frequency lines of the 85 M high-quality resonator and the narrow spaced 25.57 MHz frequency ticks of the 7 m spiral allow unprecedented precise nonlinearity correction on an integrated photonics platform. Accurate measurements of the rulers frequency spacing, linewidth, and temperature and wavelength sensitivities of the frequency ticks are performed here to demonstrate the quality of the frequency ruler. In addition, the spiral resonator is implemented in an FMCW LiDAR experiment to demonstrate a potential application of the proposed onchip frequency ruler.</description>

      <title>Upper bounds on broadband absorption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the question of the optimal broadband absorption of waves in an open, dissipative system. We develop a general framework for absorption induced by multiple overlapping resonances, based on quasi-normal modes and radiative and non-radiative decay rates. Upper bounds on broadband absorption in a slab of thickness $d$ take the simple form: $A= 1-\exp(-F \alpha d)$, where $\alpha$ is the absorption coefficient and $F$ the path enhancement factor. We apply these results to sunlight absorption in photovoltaics and answer the long-standing debate on the best light-trapping strategy in solar cells. For angle-independent absorption, we derive the isotropic scattering upper bound $F = 4 n^2$ ($n$ the refractive index), extending the well-know Yablonovitch limit beyond the ray optics and weak absorption regimes. For angle-restricted illumination, we show that $F$ can be further increased up to $8 \pi n^2 / \sqrt{3}$ using multi-resonant absorption induced by periodical patterning. These results have a general scope in the field of wave physics and open new opportunities to maximize absorption, detection, and attenuation of electromagnetic or mechanical waves in ultrathin devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19576v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scanning probe microscopy with multi-qubit sensors offers the potential to improve imaging speed and measure previously inaccessible quantities, such as two-point correlations. We develop a multiplexed quantum sensing approach with scanning probes containing two nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers at the tip apex. A shared optical channel is used for simultaneous qubit initialization and readout, while phase- and frequency-dependent microwave spin manipulations are leveraged for de-multiplexing the optical readout signal. Scanning dual-NV magnetometry is first demonstrated by simultaneously imaging multiple field projections of a ferrimagnetic racetrack device. Then, we record the two-point covariance of spatially correlated field fluctuations across a current-carrying wire. Our multiplex framework establishes a method to investigate a variety of spatio-temporal correlations, including phase transitions and electronic noise, with nanoscale resolution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19601v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that Purcell effect can lead to a substantial enhancement in the maximum cooling power for solid-state laser cooling. We numerically demonstrate such enhancement in a patterned slot-waveguide structure using ytterbium-doped silica as the active material. The enhancement arises primarily from the increase of saturation power density and the escape efficiency, and can persist in spite of the presence of parasitic absorption in the structure surrounding the active material. Our results point to a new opportunity in photonic structure design for optical refrigeration.</description>

Abstract: This paper reports the achievement of 120W single-frequency narrow linewidth 1018nm laser based on wide-tunable DBR fiber seed source. The DBR structure seed source uses 8mm long doped optical fibers with a line width of 3.25k. The wavelength tuning range of this seed source exceeds 1.5 nm with the temperature range from 1{\deg}C to 95{\deg}C. The tuning wavelength and temperature show extremely high linearity, and there is no mode hopping during the tuning process. By adopting a multi-level fiber amplification structure, selecting appropriate doped fibers and optimizing their length, an output power exceeding 120W of 1018nm laser has been achieved. Measurement results indicate that the slope efficiency of the main amplification 77.3%, with an amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) suppression ratio greater than 60 dB. he output linewidth is 10.3 kHz, and the beam quality factor M2 is less than 1.3.</description>

      <title>Unraveling the role of Ta in the phase transition of Pb(Ta1+xSe2)2 using low-temperature Raman spectroscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19653v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phase engineering strategies in two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (2D-TMDs) have garnered significant attention due to their potential applications in electronics, optoelectronics, and energy storage. Various methods, including direct synthesis, pressure control, and chemical doping, have been employed to manipulate structural transitions in 2D-TMDs. Metal intercalation emerges as an effective technique to modulate phase transition dynamics by inserting external atoms or ions between the layers of 2D-TMDs, altering their electronic structure and physical properties. Here, we investigate the significant structural phase transitions in Pb(Ta1+xSe2)2 single crystals induced by Ta intercalation using a combination of Raman spectroscopy and first-principles calculations. The results highlight the pivotal role of Ta atoms in driving these transitions and elucidate the interplay between intercalation, phase transitions, and resulting electronic and vibrational properties in 2D-TMDs. By focusing on Pb(Ta1+xSe2)2 as an ideal case study and investigating like metal intercalation, this study advances understanding in the field and paves the way for the development of novel applications for 2D-TMDs, offering insights into the potential of these materials for future technological advancements.</description>

      <title>Constructing artificial life and materials scientists with accelerated AI using Deep AndersoNN</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep AndersoNN accelerates AI by exploiting the continuum limit as the number of explicit layers in a neural network approaches infinity and can be taken as a single implicit layer, known as a deep equilibrium model. Solving for deep equilibrium model parameters reduces to a nonlinear fixed point iteration problem, enabling the use of vector-to-vector iterative solvers and windowing techniques, such as Anderson extrapolation, for accelerating convergence to the fixed point deep equilibrium. Here we show that Deep AndersoNN achieves up to an order of magnitude of speed-up in training and inference. The method is demonstrated on density functional theory results for industrial applications by constructing artificial life and materials `scientists' capable of classifying drugs as strongly or weakly polar, metal-organic frameworks by pore size, and crystalline materials as metals, semiconductors, and insulators, using graph images of node-neighbor representations transformed from atom-bond networks. Results exhibit accuracy up to 98\% and showcase synergy between Deep AndersoNN and machine learning capabilities of modern computing architectures, such as GPUs, for accelerated computational life and materials science by quickly identifying structure-property relationships. This paves the way for saving up to 90\% of compute required for AI, reducing its carbon footprint by up to 60 gigatons per year by 2030, and scaling above memory limits of explicit neural networks in life and materials science, and beyond.</description>

      <title>Brain-inspired polymer dendrite networks for morphology-dependent computing hardware</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19847v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Variability has always been a challenge to mitigate in electronics. This especially holds true for organic semiconductors, where reproducibility and long-term stability concerns hinder industrialization. By relying on a bio-inspired computing paradigm, we show that AC-electropolymerization is a powerful platform for the development of morphology-dependent computing hardware. Our findings reveal that electropolymerized polymer dendrite networks exhibit a complex relationship between structure and operation that allows them to implement nearly linear to nonlinear functions depending on the complexity of their structure. Moreover, dendritic networks can integrate a limitless number of inputs from their environment, for which their unique morphologies induce specific patterns in the dynamic encoding of the network's output. We demonstrate that this property can be used to our advantage in the context of in materio computing to discriminate between different spatiotemporal inputs. These results show how, due to its inherent stochasticity, electropolymerization is a pivotal technique for the bottom-up implementation of computationally powerful objects. We anticipate this study will help shifting the negative perception of variability in the material science community and promote the electropolymerization framework as a foundation for the development of a new generation of hardware defined by its topological richness.</description>

      <title>Methane Sensing via Unbalanced Nonlinear Interferometry using a CMOS Camera</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Here we present a high-sensitivity, rapid, and low-cost method for methane sensing based on a nonlinear interferometer. This method utilizes signal photons generated by stimulated parametric down-conversion (ST-PDC), enabling the use of a silicon detector to capture high-precision methane absorption spectra in the mid-infrared region. By controlling the system loss, we achieve more significant changes in visibility, thereby increasing sensitivity. The methane concentration within a gas cell is determined accurately. In addition, ST-PDC enables long-distance sensing and the capability to measure low ambient methane concentrations in the real world. A low-cost CMOS camera is employed to capture spatial interference fringes, ensuring fast and efficient detection.</description>

      <title>Oxygen Vacancies in Niobium Pentoxide as a Source of Two-Level System Losses in Superconducting Niobium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.13352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2108.13352v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We identify a major source of quantum decoherence in three-dimensional superconducting radio-frequency (SRF) resonators and two-dimensional transmon qubits composed of oxidized niobium: oxygen vacancies in the niobium pentoxide which drive two-level system (TLS) losses. By probing the effect of sequential \textit{in situ} vacuum baking treatments on the RF performance of bulk Nb SRF resonators and on the oxide structure of a representative Nb sample using time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS), we find a non-monotonic evolution of cavity quality factor $Q_0$ which correlates with the interplay of Nb\textsubscript{2}O\textsubscript{5} vacancy generation and oxide thickness reduction. We localize this effect to the oxide itself and present the insignificant role of diffused interstitial oxygen in the underlying Nb by regrowing a new oxide \textit{via} wet oxidation which reveals a mitigation of aggravated TLS losses. We hypothesize that such vacancies in the pentoxide serve as magnetic impurities and are a source of TLS-driven RF loss.</description>

      <title>Ultrastrongly-coupled and Directionally-nonreciprocal Magnon-polaritons in Magnetochiral Metamolecules</title>

Abstract: We report an experimental demonstration of magnon-polaritons in a three-dimensional metamolecule lacking time-reversal and space-inversion symmetries with ultrastrong coupling and directional nonreciprocity at room temperature. These experimental results are reproduced well via numerical simulations and theoretical consideration. Ultrastrong coupling is due to a direct coupling between microwave photons confined in the chiral meta-atom and magnons in the magnetic meta-atom. Our results reveal a crucial step in identifying cavity-free, deepstrongly-coupled, nonreciprocal magnon-polaritons for hybrid quantum systems and quasi-particle ``chemistry''using metamaterials.</description>

      <title>Rapid cargo verification with cosmic ray muon scattering and absorption tomography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01020v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cosmic ray muon tomography is considered a promising method for the non-invasive inspection of shipping containers and trucks. It utilizes highly penetrating cosmic-ray muons and their interactions with various materials to generate three-dimensional images of large and dense, like inter-modal shipping containers, typically not transparent with conventional X-ray radiography technique. The commonly used methods for imaging with muons are based on muon scattering or absorption-transmission data analysis. Due to large thickness of cargo material in shipping container substantial scattering and absorption occur when muons passing through cargo.
  One of the key tasks of customs and border security is to verify shipping container declarations to prevent illegal trafficking, and muon tomography could be a viable choice for this task. In this paper, we demonstrate through Monte Carlo simulations using the GEANT4 toolkit that a combined analysis of muon scattering and absorption data can improve the identification of cargo materials compared to using scattering or absorption data alone. The statistical differences in scattering and absorption data for several cargo materials are quantified. For a particular smuggling scenario where tobacco declared as paper towel rolls, it is demonstrated that the combined analysis can accurately distinguish between tobacco and paper towel rolls with 5.5$\sigma$ accuracy for detector spatial resolution (FWHM) of 0.235 mm, 4.5$\sigma$ for 1.175 mm resolution (FWHM), and 3.5$\sigma$ accuracy for 2.35 mm spatial resolution (FWHM), in a short scanning time of 10 seconds. This rapid detection capability has significant implications for anti-smuggling efforts and cargo inspection.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.12398v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scalable quantum information processing with superconducting circuits is expected to advance from individual processors located in single dilution refrigerators to more powerful distributed quantum computing systems. The realization of hardware platforms for quantum local area networks (QLANs) compatible with superconducting technology is of high importance in order to achieve a practical quantum advantage. Here, we present a fundamental prototype platform for a microwave QLAN based on a cryogenic link connecting two separate dilution cryostats over a distance of $6.6$ m with a base temperature of $52$ mK in the center. Superconducting microwave coaxial cables are employed to form a quantum communication channel between the distributed network nodes. We demonstrate the continuous-variable entanglement distribution between the remote dilution refrigerators in the form of two-mode squeezed microwave states, reaching squeezing of $2.10 \pm 0.02$ dB and negativity of $0.501 \pm 0.011$. Furthermore, we show that quantum entanglement is preserved at channel center temperatures up to $1$ K, paving the way towards microwave quantum communication at elevated temperatures. Consequently, such a QLAN system can form the backbone for future distributed quantum computing with superconducting circuits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.06049v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum illumination (QI) and quantum radar have emerged as potentially groundbreaking technologies, leveraging the principles of quantum mechanics to revolutionise the field of remote sensing and target detection. The protocol, particularly in the context of quantum radar, has been subject to a great deal of aspirational conjecture as well as criticism with respect to its realistic potential. In this review, we present a broad overview of the field of quantum target detection focusing on QI and its potential as an underlying scheme for a quantum radar operating at microwave frequencies. We provide context for the field by considering its historical development and fundamental principles. Our aim is to provide a balanced discussion on the state of theoretical and experimental progress towards realising a working QI-based quantum radar, and draw conclusions about its current outlook and future directions.</description>

      <title>Synergizing Deep Learning and Phase Change Materials for Four-state Broadband Multifunctional Metasurfaces in the Visible Range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05519v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we report, for the first time, broadband multifunctional metasurfaces with more than four distinct functionalities. The constituent meta-atoms combine two different phase change materials, $\mathrm{VO_2}$ and $\mathrm{Sb_2S_3}$ in a multi-stage configuration. FDTD simulations demonstrate a broadband reflection amplitude switching between the four states in visible range due to the enhanced cavity length modulation effect from the cascaded Fabry-Perot cavities, overcoming the inherent small optical contrast between the phase change material (PCM) states. This, along with the reflection phase control between the four states, allows us to incorporate both amplitude and phase-dependent properties in the same metasurface - achromatic deflection, wavelength beam splitting, achromatic focusing, and broadband absorption, overcoming the limitations of previous functionality switching mechanisms for the visible band. We have used a Tandem Neural network-based inverse design scheme to ensure the stringent requirements of different states are realized. We have used two forward networks for predicting the reflection amplitude and phase for a meta-atom within the pre-defined design space. The excellent prediction capability of these surrogate models is utilized to train the reverse network. The inverse design network, trained with a labeled data set, is capable of producing the optimized meta-units given the desired figure-of-merits in terms of reflection amplitude and phase for the four states. The optical characteristics of two inverse-designed metasurfaces have been evaluated as test cases for two different sets of design parameters in the four states. Both structures demonstrate the four desired broadband functionalities while closely matching the design requirements, suggesting their potential in visible-range portable medical imaging devices.</description>

      <title>Stability of Cantilever-like Structures with Applications to Soft Robot Arms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07601v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The application of variational principles for analyzing problems in the physical sciences is widespread. Cantilever-like problems, where one end is subjected to a fixed value and the other end is free, have been less studied in terms of their stability despite their abundance. In this article, we develop the stability conditions for these problems by examining the second variation of the energy functional using the generalized Jacobi condition. This involves computing conjugate points that are determined by solving a set of initial value problems from the linearized equilibrium equations. We apply these conditions to investigate the nonlinear stability of intrinsically curved elastic cantilevers subject to a tip load. Kirchhoff rod theory is employed to model the elastic rod deformations. The role of intrinsic curvature in inducing complex nonlinear phenomena, such as snap-back instability, is particularly emphasized. This snap-back instability is demonstrated using various examples, highlighting its dependence on various system parameters. The presented examples illustrate the potential applications in the design of flexible soft robot arms and innovative mechanisms.</description>
