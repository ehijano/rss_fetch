      <title>Peeking under the clouds: Is exoplanet imaging with the solar gravitational lens feasible?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exoplanet imaging using the solar gravitational lens is an enticing prospect. The fundamental physical properties of the lens, including its angular resolution and light amplification, promise exceptional capabilities. These expectations, however, are tempered by the realization of numerous challenges, including imperfections of the lens itself, noise sources, the properties of the imaging target and difficult technical issues. We discuss, in particular, a subject not previously addressed, the impact of temporally varying surface features, notably a variable cloud cover, obscuring the target exoplanet. This has a substantial detrimental effect on image recovery, leading to our cautious assessment of the practical feasibility of using the Sun's gravitational field as an effective telescope.</description>

      <title>Preliminary Baseline Antenna Design for the Black Hole Explorer (BHEX) Mission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Black Hole Explorer (BHEX) mission extends the submillimeter Very-Long-Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) to space. The preliminary baseline design of a shaped axial-symmetric displaced-axis dual-reflector antenna for the BHEX is presented. The main goal of the antenna design optimization is to maximize aperture efficiency given the geometric and mechanical constraints of a space-borne antenna.</description>

      <title>The Relationship between Image Dynamic Range and Antenna-based Gain Errors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ngVLA science requirements call for continuum image dynamic ranges of 45 dB and 35 dB at 8 and 27 GHz respectively. In interferometric aperture synthesis imaging, visibility amplitude and phase errors result in errors in the final images, limiting the dynamic range attained. In order to achieve the ngVLA dynamic range requirements it is necessary to limit the amplitude and phase errors to within appropriate levels. The relationship between the number of antennas N in an interferometric aperture synthesis array and the error in the constructed image has been previously derived and conventionally adopted to be a scaling of \approx N. In this short memo, we argue that this relationship may not hold everywhere in an image and derive the relationship in a more stringent limit. We derive a more stringent \sqrt N dependence as opposed to the previous, generally adopted N scaling and compare with existing simulations. This relationship is at the root of allowable amplitude and phase errors arising from practically every corrupting effect, e.g. antenna pointing, primary beam characteristics, tropospheric and ionospheric phase fluctuations and polarimetric imperfections, among others. Thus, it is central to ngVLA calibration requirements and strategies. We recommend the adoption of a conservative \sqrt N dependence as the basis to derive the requirements and to identify applicable strategies.</description>

      <title>Study of the UHV compatibility of selected ferritic stainless steels for application in vacuum systems of future gravitational wave detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Next-generation gravitational wave detectors (GWDs) such as the Cosmic Explorer and Einstein Telescope demand extensive ultra-high vacuum systems, making material cost and performance critical considerations. This study investigates the potential of ferritic stainless steel as a cost-effective alternative to the commonly used austenitic stainless steel for UHV components, focusing on the analysis of outgassing rates pre and post-bakeout at 80{\deg}C and 150{\deg}C for 48 hours. The tested ferritic stainless steels exhibit significantly lower hydrogen content than standard AISI 304L steel. After bakeout, the hydrogen outgassing rates - measured down to 10$^{-15}$ mbar l s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ - are three orders of magnitude lower than those of similarly conditioned austenitic stainless steels. These results highlight ferritic stainless steel as a promising, economical, and high-performance candidate for future GWDs vacuum systems.</description>

      <title>Using the Translation Theorem for the Automated Stationkeeping of Extremely-Low Lunar Missions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extremely-Low Lunar Orbits (eLLOs) (altitudes $\leq 50$ km) exhibit severe perturbations due to the highly non-spherical lunar gravitational field, presenting unique challenges to orbit maintenance. These altitudes are too low for the existence of stable `frozen' orbits, and naive stationkeeping methods, such as circularization, perform poorly. However, mission designers have noticed a particular characteristic of low lunar orbits, which they have found useful for stationkeeping and dubbed the "translation theorem", wherein the eccentricity vector follows a predictable monthly pattern that is independent of its starting value. We demonstrate this feature results from the low orbital eccentricity combined with the dominant effect of a particular subset of sectoral and tesseral harmonics. Subsequently, automated stationkeeping strategies for eLLOs are presented, utilizing this theorem for eccentricity vector control. Several constraints within the eccentricity vector plane are explored, including circular, annular, and elevation-model derived regions, each forming distinct stationkeeping strategies for varying orbital configurations. Subsequently, the optimal control profiles for these maneuvers within the eccentricity plane are obtained using Sequential Convex Programming (SCP). The proposed strategies offer computational simplicity and clear advantages when compared to traditional methods and are comparable to full trajectory optimization.</description>

      <title>Latest developments in wide-field VLBI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19579v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) combines the signals of telescopes distributed across thousands of kilometres to provide some of the highest angular resolution images of astrophysical phenomena. Due to computational expense, typical VLBI observations are restricted to a single target and a small (few arcseconds) field-of-view per pointing. The technique of wide-field VLBI was born to enable the targeting of multiple sources and has been successful in providing new insights into Active Galactic Nuclei, the interstellar medium, supernovae, gravitational lenses and much more. However, this technique is still only employed in a few experiments, restricting the scientific potential of VLBI observations. In this conference proceeding, we outline new developments in wide-field VLBI, including an end-to-end correlation and calibration workflow, distributed correlation, and new calibration routines. These developments aim to enable wide-field VLBI to be a standard observing mode on all major VLBI arrays.</description>

      <title>SHINS, the SHARK-NIR Instrument Control Software</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: SHARK-NIR is a new compact instrument for coronagraphic imaging, direct imaging, and coronagraphic spectroscopy in the near-infrared wavelengths mounted at LBT. Taking advantage of the telescope's adaptive optics system, it provides high contrast imaging with coronagraphic and spectroscopic capabilities and is focused on the direct imaging of exoplanets and circumstellar discs. We present SHINS, the SHARK-NIR instrument control software, mainly realized with the TwiceAsNice framework from MPIA - Heidelberg and the ICE framework using the C++ programming language. We describe how we implemented the software components controlling several instrument subsystems, through the adaptation of already tested libraries from other instruments at LBT, such as LINC-NIRVANA. The scientific detector comes with its own readout electronic and control software interfaced with our software through INDI. We describe the C++ core software Observation Control Software, responsible for dispatching commands to the subsystems, also implementing a software solution to avoid a potential collision between motorized components, fully transparent to final users. It exposes an ICE interface and can be controlled by clients developed in different languages. Observation, calibration, and maintenance procedures are implemented by means of template scripts, written in python language, controlling Observation Control Software through its ICE interface. These templates and their parameters are configured using "ESO-style", XML Observation Blocks prepared by observers, or in general SHARK-NIR users. The high-level control is carried out by REST HTTP APIs implemented in a python back-end, also acting as a web server for the several browser-based front-end GUIs. Finally, we present the first scientific results obtained by SHARK-NIR using coronagraphic mode.</description>

      <title>Explainable Deep-Learning Based Potentially Hazardous Asteroids Classification Using Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classifying potentially hazardous asteroids (PHAs) is crucial for planetary defense and deep space navigation, yet traditional methods often overlook the dynamical relationships among asteroids. We introduce a Graph Neural Network (GNN) approach that models asteroids as nodes with orbital and physical features, connected by edges representing their similarities, using a NASA dataset of 958,524 records. Despite an extreme class imbalance with only 0.22% of the dataset with the hazardous label, our model achieves an overall accuracy of 99% and an AUC of 0.99, with a recall of 78% and an F1-score of 37% for hazardous asteroids after applying the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique. Feature importance analysis highlights albedo, perihelion distance, and semi-major axis as main predictors. This framework supports planetary defense missions and confirms AI's potential in enabling autonomous navigation for future missions such as NASA's NEO Surveyor and ESA's Ramses, offering an interpretable and scalable solution for asteroid hazard assessment.</description>

      <title>Validation and Calibration of Semi-Analytical Models for the Event Horizon Telescope Observations of Sagittarius A*</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18624v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) enables the exploration of black hole accretion flows at event-horizon scales. Fitting ray-traced physical models to EHT observations requires the generation of synthetic images, a task that is computationally demanding. This study leverages \alinet, a generative machine learning model, to efficiently produce radiatively inefficient accretion flow (RIAF) images as a function of the specified physical parameters. \alinet has previously been shown to be able to interpolate black hole images and their associated physical parameters after training on a computationally tractable set of library images. We utilize this model to estimate the uncertainty introduced by a number of anticipated unmodeled physical effects, including interstellar scattering and intrinsic source variability. We then use this to calibrate physical parameter estimates and their associated uncertainties from RIAF model fits to mock EHT data via a library of general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics models.</description>

      <title>exoALMA VII: Benchmarking Hydrodynamics and Radiative Transfer Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18643v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Forward modeling is often used to interpret substructures observed in protoplanetary disks. To ensure the robustness and consistency of the current forward modeling approach from the community, we conducted a systematic comparison of various hydrodynamics and radiative transfer codes. Using four grid-based hydrodynamics codes (FARGO3D, Idefix, Athena++, PLUTO) and a smoothed particle hydrodynamics code (Phantom), we simulated a protoplanetary disk with an embedded giant planet. We then used two radiative transfer codes (mcfost, RADMC-3D) to calculate disk temperatures and create synthetic 12CO cubes. Finally, we retrieved the location of the planet from the synthetic cubes using DISCMINER. We found strong consistency between the hydrodynamics codes, particularly in the density and velocity perturbations associated with planet-driven spirals. We also found a good agreement between the two radiative transfer codes: the disk temperature in mcfost and RADMC-3D models agrees within $\lesssim 3~\%$ everywhere in the domain. In synthetic $^{12}$CO channel maps, this results in brightness temperature differences within $\pm1.5$ K in all our models. This good agreement ensures consistent retrieval of planet's radial/azimuthal location with only a few % of scatter, with velocity perturbations varying $\lesssim 20~\%$ among the models. Notably, while the planet-opened gap is shallower in the Phantom simulation, we found that this does not impact the planet location retrieval. In summary, our results demonstrate that any combination of the tested hydrodynamics and radiative transfer codes can be used to reliably model and interpret planet-driven kinematic perturbations.</description>

      <title>GReX: An Instrument Overview and New Upper Limits on the Galactic FRB Population</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18680v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the instrument design and initial results for the Galactic Radio Explorer (GReX), an all-sky monitor for exceptionally bright transients in the radio sky. This instrument builds on the success of STARE2 to search for fast radio bursts (FRBs) from the Milky Way and its satellites. This instrument has deployments across the globe, with wide sky coverage and searching down to $32\,\mu\text{s}$ time resolution, enabling the discovery of new super giant pulses. Presented here are the details of the hardware and software design of the instrument, performance in sensitivity and other key metrics, and experience in building a global-scale, low-cost experiment. We follow this discussion with experimental results on validation of the sensitivity via hydrogen-line measurements. We then update the rate of Galactic FRBs based on a non-detection in $0.5\,\text{sky}\,\text{yr}$ of exposure, with twice the sensitivity of STARE2. Our results suggest FRB-like events are even rarer than initially implied by the detection of a MJy burst from SGR J1935+2154 in April 2020.</description>

Abstract: Planet formation is a hugely dynamic process requiring the transport, concentration and assimilation of gas and dust to form the first planetesimals and cores. With access to extremely high spatial and spectral resolution observations at unprecedented sensitivities, it is now possible to probe the planet forming environment in detail. To this end, the exoALMA Large Program targeted fifteen large protoplanetary disks ranging between ${\sim}1\arcsec$ and ${\sim}7\arcsec$ in radius, and mapped the gas and dust distributions. $^{12}$CO J=3-2, $^{13}$CO J=3-2 and CS J=7-6 molecular emission was imaged at high angular (${\sim}~0\farcs15$) and spectral (${\sim}~100~{\rm m\,s^{-1}}$) resolution, achieving a surface brightness temperature sensitivity of ${\sim}1.5$~K over a single channel, while the 330~GHz continuum emission was imaged at 90~mas resolution and achieved a point source sensitivity of ${\sim}\,40~\mu{\rm Jy~beam^{-1}}$. These observations constitute some of the deepest observations of protoplanetary disks to date. Extensive substructure was found in all but one disk, traced by both dust continuum and molecular line emission. In addition, the molecular emission allowed for the velocity structure of the disks to be mapped with excellent precision (uncertainties on the order of $10~{\rm m\,s^{-1}}$), revealing a variety of kinematic perturbations across all sources. From this sample it is clear that, when observed in detail, all disks appear to exhibit physical and dynamical substructure indicative of on-going dynamical processing due to young, embedded planets, large-scale, (magneto-)hydrodynamical instabilities or winds.</description>

      <title>A Search for Exoplanet Candidates in TESS 2-min Light Curves using Joint Bayesian Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we apply an exploratory joint Bayesian transit detector (Taaki et al. 2020), previously evaluated using Kepler data, to the 2 min simple aperture photometry light curve data in the continuous viewing zone for the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) over three years of observation. The detector uses Bayesian priors, adaptively estimated, to model unknown systematic noise and stellar variability incorporated in a Neyman-Pearson likelihood ratio test for a candidate transit signal; a primary goal of the algorithm is to reduce overfitting. The detector was adapted to the TESS data and refined to improve outlier rejection and suppress false alarm detections in post-processing. The statistical performance of the detector was evaluated using transit injection tests, where the joint Bayesian detector achieves an 80.0 % detection rate and a 19.1% quasi-false alarm rate at a detection threshold {\tau} = 10; this is a marginal, although not statistically significant, improvement of 0.2% over a reference sequential detrending and detection algorithm. In addition, a full search of the input TESS data was performed to evaluate the recovery rate of known TESS objects of interest (TOI) and to perform an independent search for new exoplanet candidates. The joint detector has a 73% recall rate and a 63% detection rate for known TOI; the former considers a match against all detection statistics above threshold while the latter considers only the maximum detection statistic.</description>

      <title>exoALMA IV: Substructures, Asymmetries, and the Faint Outer Disk in Continuum Emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18725</link>

Abstract: The exoALMA Large Program targeted a sample of 15 disks to study gas dynamics within these systems, and these observations simultaneously produced continuum data at 0.9 mm (331.6 GHz) with exceptional surface brightness sensitivity at high angular resolution. To provide a robust characterization of the observed substructures, we performed a visibility space analysis of the continuum emission from the exoALMA data, characterizing axisymmetric substructures and nonaxisymmetric residuals obtained by subtracting an axisymmetric model from the observed data. We defined a nonaxisymmetry index and found that the most asymmetric disks predominantly show an inner cavity and consistently present higher values of mass accretion rate and near-infrared excess. This suggests a connection between outer disk dust substructures and inner disk properties. The depth of the data allowed us to describe the azimuthally averaged continuum emission in the outer disk, revealing that larger disks (both in dust and gas) in our sample tend to be gradually tapered compared to the sharper outer edge of more compact sources. Additionally, the data quality revealed peculiar features in various sources, such as shadows, inner disk offsets, tentative external substructures, and a possible dust cavity wall.</description>

      <title>exoALMA XII: Weighing and sizing exoALMA disks with rotation curve modelling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.18726v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The exoALMA large program offers a unique opportunity to investigate the fundamental properties of protoplanetary disks, such as their masses and sizes, providing important insights in the mechanism responsible for the transport of angular momentum. In this work, we model the rotation curves of CO isotopologues $^{12}$CO and $^{13}$CO of ten sources within the exoALMA sample, and we constrain the stellar mass, the disk mass and the density scale radius through precise characterization of the pressure gradient and disk self gravity. We obtain dynamical disk masses for our sample measuring the self-gravitating contribution to the gravitational potential. We are able to parametrically describe their surface density, and all of them appear gravitationally stable. By combining dynamical disk masses with dust continuum emission data, we determine an averaged gas-to-dust ratio of approximately 400, not statistically consistent with the standard value of 100, assuming optically thin dust emission. In addition, the measurement of the dynamical scale radius allows for direct comparison with flux-based radii of gas and dust. This comparison suggests that substructures may influence the size of the dust disk, and that CO depletion might reconcile our measurements with thermochemical models. Finally, with the stellar mass, disk mass, scale radius, and accretion rate, and assuming self-similar evolution of the surface density, we constrain the effective $\alpha_S$ for these systems. We find a broad range of $\alpha_S$ values ranging between $10^{-5}$ and $10^{-2}$.</description>

      <title>A Next-Generation Exoplanet Atmospheric Retrieval Framework for Transmission Spectroscopy (NEXOTRANS): Comparative Characterization for WASP-39 b Using JWST NIRISS, NIRSpec PRISM, and MIRI Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advent of JWST has marked a new era in exoplanetary atmospheric studies, offering higher-resolution data and greater precision across a broader spectral range than previous space-based telescopes. Accurate analysis of these datasets requires advanced retrieval frameworks capable of navigating complex parameter spaces. We present NEXOTRANS, an atmospheric retrieval framework that integrates Bayesian inference using UltraNest/PyMultiNest with four machine learning algorithms: Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, K-Nearest Neighbor, and Stacking Regressor. This hybrid approach enables a comparison between traditional Bayesian methods and computationally efficient machine learning techniques. Additionally, NEXOTRANS incorporates NEXOCHEM, a module for solving equilibrium chemistry. We applied NEXOTRANS to JWST observations of the Saturn-mass exoplanet WASP-39 b, spanning wavelengths from 0.6 microns to 12.0 microns using NIRISS, NIRSpec PRISM, and MIRI. Four chemistry models-free, equilibrium, modified hybrid equilibrium, and modified equilibrium-offset chemistry-were explored to retrieve precise Volume Mixing Ratios (VMRs) for H2O, CO2, CO, H2S, and SO2. Absorption features in both NIRSpec PRISM and MIRI data constrained SO2 log VMRs to values between -6.67 and -5.31 for all models except equilibrium chemistry. High-altitude aerosols, including ZnS and MgSiO3, were inferred, with constraints on their VMRs, particle sizes, and terminator coverage fractions, providing insights into cloud composition. For the best-fit modified hybrid equilibrium model, we derived super-solar elemental abundances of O/H = 7.94 (+0.18/-0.18) x solar, C/H = 10.96 (+0.42/-0.41) x solar, and S/H = 3.98 (+0.29/-0.35) x solar, along with a C/O ratio of 1.17 (+0.03/-0.03) x solar, demonstrating NEXOTRANS's potential for atmospheric characterization in the JWST era and beyond.</description>

      <title>exoALMA IX: Regularized Maximum Likelihood Imaging of Non-Keplerian Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19111v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The planet-hunting ALMA large program exoALMA observed 15 protoplanetary disks at ~0.15" angular resolution and ~100 m/s spectral resolution, characterizing disk structures and kinematics in enough detail to detect non-Keplerian features (NKFs) in the gas emission. As these features are often small and low-contrast, robust imaging procedures are critical for identifying and characterizing NKFs, including determining which features may be signatures of young planets. The exoALMA collaboration employed two different imaging procedures to ensure the consistent detection of NKFs: CLEAN, the standard iterative deconvolution algorithm, and regularized maximum likelihood (RML) imaging. This paper presents the exoALMA RML images, obtained by maximizing the likelihood of the visibility data given a model image and subject to regularizer penalties. Crucially, in the context of exoALMA, RML images serve as an independent verification of marginal features seen in the fiducial CLEAN images. However, best practices for synthesizing RML images of multi-channeled (i.e. velocity-resolved) data remain undefined, as prior work on RML imaging for protoplanetary disk data has primarily addressed single-image cases. We used the open source Python package MPoL to explore RML image validation methods for multi-channeled data and synthesize RML images from the exoALMA observations of 7 protoplanetary disks with apparent NKFs in the 12CO J=3-2 CLEAN images. We find that RML imaging methods independently reproduce the NKFs seen in the CLEAN images of these sources, suggesting that the NKFs are robust features rather than artifacts from a specific imaging procedure.</description>

      <title>Probing Dark Matter Substructures with Free-Form Modelling: A Case Study of the `Jackpot' Strong Lens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19177v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Characterising the population and internal structure of sub-galactic halos is critical for constraining the nature of dark matter. These halos can be detected near galaxies that act as strong gravitational lenses with extended arcs, as they perturb the shapes of the arcs. However, this method is subject to false-positive detections and systematic uncertainties: particularly degeneracies between an individual halo and larger-scale asymmetries in the distribution of lens mass. We present a new free-form lens modelling code, developed within the framework of the open-source software \texttt{PyAutoLens}, to address these challenges. Our method models mass perturbations that cannot be captured by parametric models as pixelized potential corrections and suppresses unphysical solutions via a Mat\'ern regularisation scheme that is inspired by Gaussian process regression. This approach enables the recovery of diverse mass perturbations, including subhalos, line-of-sight halos, external shear, and multipole components that represent the complex angular mass distribution of the lens galaxy, such as boxiness/diskiness. Additionally, our fully Bayesian framework objectively infers hyperparameters associated with the regularisation of pixelized sources and potential corrections, eliminating the need for manual fine-tuning. By applying our code to the well-known `Jackpot' lens system, SLACS0946+1006, we robustly detect a highly concentrated subhalo that challenges the standard cold dark matter model. This study represents the first attempt to independently reveal the mass distribution of a subhalo using a fully free-form approach.</description>

      <title>exoALMA. VIII. Probabilistic Moment Maps and Data Products using Non-parametric Linear Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19416v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extracting robust inferences on physical quantities from disk kinematics measured from Doppler-shifted molecular line emission is challenging due to the data's size and complexity. In this paper we develop a flexible linear model of the intensity distribution in each frequency channel, accounting for spatial correlations from the point spread function. The analytic form of the model's posterior enables probabilistic data products through sampling. Our method debiases peak intensity, peak velocity, and line width maps, particularly in disk substructures that are only partially resolved. These are needed in order to measure disk mass, turbulence, pressure gradients, and to detect embedded planets. We analyse HD 135344B, MWC 758, and CQ Tau, finding velocity substructures 50--200 ${\rm m s^{-1}}$ greater than with conventional methods. Additionally, we combine our approach with discminer in a case study of J1842. We find that uncertainties in stellar mass and inclination increase by an order of magnitude due to the more realistic noise model. More broadly, our method can be applied to any problem requiring a probabilistic model of an intensity distribution conditioned on a point spread function.</description>

      <title>Polarized pulse pair observations during a long duration interstellar communication experiment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In prior work, conducted since 2017, two celestial pointing directions have been observed to be associated with the measurement of anomalous high counts of narrow bandwidth, short duration, polarized radio frequency pulse pairs. The prior experimental work utilized up to three geographically-spaced synchronized radio telescopes, a single-dish radio telescope, and a radio interferometer. The experimental work reported here examines full right ascension coverage at one declination, utilizing the interferometer, during 124.1 days. Results suggest the possible presence of an additional anomalous celestial pointing direction. Seven standard deviations of noise-modeled shifts of mean polarized pulse pair count were observed in three celestial directions. Indications of interferometer space delay aliasing were observed. A phase noise test, celestial source identification methods and associated measurements were used to seek potential explanations of the unusual observed phenomena.</description>

Abstract: Comets, during their journeys into the inner solar system, deliver volatile gases, organics, and particulates into their comae that provide crucial information for assessing the physico-chemical conditions in the outer disk from which they formed. Here we present observational and modeling results of a JWST NIRSpec and MIRI MRS integral-field-unit (IFU) spatial-spectral study of the inner coma of the Oort Cloud comet C/2017 K2 (PanSTARRS) at a heliocentric distance of 2.35 au. We find the comet is hyperactive (water ice active fraction greater than or equal to 86%), with a nucleus radius of $&lt;$4.2 km, exhibiting strong emission from H$_{2}$O, $^{12}$CO, $^{13}$CO, and CO$_{2}$ as well as CN, H$_2$CO, CH$_3$OH, CH$_4$, C$_2$H$_6$, HCN, NH$_2$, and OH prompt emission. The water ortho-to-para ratio is greater than or equal to 2.75. The modeled dust composition (relative mass fraction of the sub-micron grains) in the coma is dominated by amorphous carbon ($\simeq 25$%), amorphous Mg:Fe olivine ($\simeq 19$%), amorphous Mg:Fe pyroxene ($\simeq 16$%), and Mg-rich crystalline olivine ($\simeq 39$%) and the crystalline mass fraction of the sub-micron grains in the coma is, $f_{cryst} \simeq 0.384 \pm 0.065$. Analysis of residuals in 3 to 8 $\mu$m region of the spectral energy distribution strongly suggests the presence of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAHs) species in the coma.</description>

Abstract: The exoALMA Large Program was designed to search for subtle kinematic deviations from Keplerian motion, indicative of embedded planets, in high angular and spectral resolution Band 7 observations of $^{12}$CO, $^{13}$CO and CS emission from protoplanetary disks. This paper summarizes the calibration and imaging pipelines used by the exoALMA collaboration. With sources ranging in diameter from 2.4" to 13.8" when probed by $^{12}$CO, multiple antennae configurations were required to maximally recover all spatial information (including the ACA for 7 sources). Combining these datasets warranted particular care in their alignment during calibration and prior to imaging, so as not to introduce spurious features that might resemble the kinematic deviations being investigated. Phase decoherence was found in several datasets, which was corrected by an iterative self-calibration procedure, and we explored the effects of the order of operations of spatial alignment, flux scaling, and self-calibration. A number of different imaging sets were produced for the continuum and line emission, employing an iterative masking procedure that minimizes bias due to non-Keplerian motions in the disk.</description>

Abstract: In this document we consider the problem of finding the optimal layout for the array of water Cherenkov detectors proposed by the SWGO collaboration to study very-high-energy gamma rays in the southern hemisphere. We develop a continuous model of the secondary particles produced by atmospheric showers initiated by high-energy gamma rays and protons, and build an optimization pipeline capable of identifying the most promising configuration of the detector elements. The pipeline employs stochastic gradient descent to maximize a utility function aligned with the scientific goals of the experiment. We demonstrate how the software is capable of finding the global maximum in the high-dimensional parameter space, and discuss its performance and limitations.</description>

      <title>Competition between Increasing and Decreasing Effects of the Afterpulsing Rate of PMTs during Night-Sky Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02423v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) have been widely used in imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes (IACTs). The Large-Sized Telescopes (LSTs) of the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO), the latest-generation IACTs, are optimized for challenging observations of low-energy gamma rays, specifically in the 20 to 150 GeV range. To this end, PMTs with an exceptionally low afterpulsing probability have been developed and installed. However, the afterpulsing rate increases over time due to the infiltration of atmospheric molecules, particularly helium, into the tube. Interestingly, we found that the afterpulsing rate decreases when PMTs are operated at high voltage and exposed to light -- a condition naturally met during IACT observations. To evaluate the latest instrument response, after five years of operation, we removed several PMTs from the first LST, which is currently the only operational telescope among the CTAO instruments. Our laboratory measurements showed no increase in afterpulsing compared to pre-installation values. This suggests that the decrease in afterpulsing during operation offsets the increase, thereby maintaining the long-term performance of the PMTs.</description>

Abstract: Cataclysmic variables (CVs) are binary systems with a white dwarf accreting matter from a low-mass star, making them significant sources of X-ray emission in the Galaxy. We present a systematic search for X-ray emitting CV candidates by cross-matching four X-ray catalogs (eROSITA, XMM-Newton, Swift, and ROSAT) with Gaia sources located in the bridge region between the main sequence and white dwarf cooling sequence in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. From 444 candidates (267 confirmed CVs and 177 new candidates), we detect orbital modulation in 56 sources using ZTF/TESS light curves. The eROSITA catalog contributes 51% of candidates, outperforming other surveys due to its wider sky coverage and higher sensitivity (~10^{-14} erg cm^{-2} s^{-1}). Our method demonstrates the efficiency of combining X-ray data with time-domain analysis for CV identification, with future eROSITA observations expected to expand the population of X-ray emitting CVs.</description>

      <title>Evidence of Ultra-faint Radio Frequency Interference in Deep 21~cm Epoch of Reionization Power Spectra with the Murchison Widefield Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.03851v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present deep upper limits from the 2014 Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) Phase I observing season, with a particular emphasis on identifying the spectral fingerprints of extremely faint radio frequency interference (RFI) contamination in the 21~cm power spectra (PS). After meticulous RFI excision involving a combination of the \textsc{SSINS} RFI flagger and a series of PS-based jackknife tests, our lowest upper limit on the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) 21~cm PS signal is $\Delta^2 \leq 1.61\cdot10^4 \text{ mK}^2$ at $k=0.258\text{ h Mpc}^{-1}$ at a redshift of 6.5 using 14.7 hours of data. By leveraging our understanding of how even fainter RFI is likely to contaminate the EoR PS, we are able to identify ultra-faint RFI signals in the cylindrical PS. Surprisingly this signature is most obvious in PS formed with less than an hour of data, but is potentially subdominant to other systematics in multiple-hour integrations. Since the total RFI budget in a PS detection is quite strict, this nontrivial integration behavior suggests a need to more realistically model coherently integrated ultra-faint RFI in PS measurements so that its potential contribution to a future detection can be diagnosed.</description>

      <title>The Importance of Subtleties in the Scaling of the 'Terminal Momentum' For Galaxy Formation Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16987v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In galaxy formation simulations, it is increasingly common to represent supernovae (SNe) at finite resolution (when the Sedov-Taylor phase is unresolved) via hybrid energy-momentum coupling with some 'terminal momentum' $p_{\rm term}$ (depending weakly on ambient density and metallicity) that represents unresolved work from an energy-conserving phase. Numerical implementations can ensure momentum and energy conservation of such methods, but these require that couplings depend on the surrounding gas velocity field (radial velocity $\langle v_{r} \rangle$). This raises the question of whether $p_{\rm term}$ should also be velocity-dependent, which we explore analytically and in simulations. We show that for simple spherical models, the dependence of $p_{\rm term}$ on $\langle v_{r} \rangle$ introduces negligible corrections beyond those already imposed by energy conservation if $\langle v_{r} \rangle \ge 0$. However, for SNe in some net converging flow ($\langle v_{r} \rangle&lt;0$), naively coupling the total momentum when a blastwave reaches the standard cooling/snowplow phase (or some effective cooling time/velocity/temperature criterion) leads to enormous $p_{\rm term}$ and potentially pathological behaviors. We propose an alternative $\Delta$-Momentum formulation which represents the differential SNe effect and show this leads to opposite behavior of $p_{\rm term}$ in this limit. We also consider a more conservative velocity-independent formulation. Testing in numerical simulations, these directly translate to large effects on predicted star formation histories and stellar masses of massive galaxies, explaining differences between some models and motivating further study in idealized simulations.</description>

      <title>Impact of relativistic waveforms in LISA's science objectives with extreme-mass-ratio inspirals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17310v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Extreme-Mass-Ratio Inspirals (EMRIs) are one of the key targets for future space-based gravitational wave detectors, such as LISA. The scientific potential of these sources can only be fully realized with fast and accurate waveform models. In this work, we extend the \textsc{FastEMRIWaveform} (\texttt{FEW}) framework by providing fully relativistic waveforms at adiabatic order for circular, equatorial orbits in Kerr spacetime, for mass ratios up to $10^{-3}$. We investigate the significance of including relativistic corrections in the waveform for both vacuum and non-vacuum environments. Specifically, we develop relativistic non-vacuum EMRI waveforms including two different environmental effects in the EMRI waveforms: power-law migration torques, and superradiance scalar clouds. For EMRIs in vacuum, we find that non-relativistic waveforms incorrectly estimate the predicted source's horizon redshift by approximately $35\%$ error. Our analysis shows that incorporating relativistic corrections enhances constraints on accretion disks, modeled through power-law torques, and improves the constraints on disk parameter estimates (error $\simeq 8\%$), representing a significant improvement over previous estimates. Additionally, we assess the evidence for models in a scenario where ignoring the accretion disk biases the parameter estimation (PE), reporting a $\log_{10}$ Bayes factor of $1.1$ in favor of the accretion disk model. In a fully relativistic setup, we also estimate the parameters of superradiant scalar clouds with relative errors $\simeq 0.3\%$ for the scalar cloud's mass. These results demonstrate that incorporating relativistic effects is essential for LISA science objectives with EMRIs.</description>

      <title>Probing the origins. I. Generalised Additive Model inference of birth radii for Milky Way stars in the solar vicinity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20441v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We employ a Generalised Additive Model (GAM) to address the limitations inherent in radial metallicity gradients predicted by chemical evolution models, thereby facilitating the estimation of birth radii for the thin disc stars in our sample based on their ages and chemical composition. We then juxtapose the birth radius predictions derived from the GAM with the calculated guiding radii, among other dynamic parameters. Metal-rich stars, formed in the inner regions of the Milky Way, seem to be predominantly churned outward. Their metal-poor counterparts, formed in the outer thin disc, exhibit the opposite behaviour. The proportion of blurred/undisturbed stars generally increases with decreasing metallicity when compared to their churned counterparts. Approximately $3/4$ of the sample has been affected by (inward or outward) churning, while the remaining $\sim 1/4$ has either been influenced by blurring or remained undisturbed. These percentages vary considerably across different metallicity-stratified groups. Also, a large age gap is identified between churned and blurred/undisturbed sub-samples within each HC-based group, being the outward-churned stars systematically the oldest, inward-churned stars the youngest, and blurred/undisturbed stars in intermediate ages. We also detect significant differences in angular momenta in the $z$ component, for stars that have either churned inward or outward, when compared to their blurred/undisturbed counterparts. Additionally, we observe the potential effects of the pericentric passage of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy in our most metal-poor subset of stars, formed in the outer disc. Finally, we estimate that the Sun's most probable birth radius is $7.08 \pm 0.24$ kpc, with a 3$\sigma$ range spanning from 6.46 to 7.81 kpc, in agreement with previous studies.</description>

      <title>Systematic Reanalysis of KMTNet Microlensing Events, Paper II: Two New Planets in Giant-Source Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19471v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we continue to apply the updated KMTNet tender-love care (TLC) photometric pipeline to historical microlensing events. We apply the pipeline to a subsample of events from the KMTNet database, which we refer to as the giant source sample. Leveraging the improved photometric data, we conduct a systematic search for anomalies within this sample. The search successfully uncovers four new planet-like anomalies and recovers two previously known planetary signals. After detailed analysis, two of the newly discovered anomalies are confirmed as clear planets: KMT-2019-BLG-0578 and KMT-2021-BLG-0736. Their planet-to-host mass ratios are $q\sim4\times10^{-3}$ and $q\sim1\times10^{-4}$, respectively. Another event, OGLE-2018-BLG-0421 (KMT-2018-BLG-0831), remains ambiguous. Both a stellar companion and a giant planet in the lens system could potentially explain the observed anomaly. The anomaly signal of the last event, MOA-2022-BLG-038 (KMT-2022-BLG-2342), is attributed to an extra source star. Within this sample, our procedure doubles the number of confirmed planets, demonstrating a significant enhancement in the survey sensitivity.</description>

      <title>[C II]-deficit caused by self-absorption in an ionized carbon-filled bubble in RCW79</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08976v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent spectroscopic observations of the [C II] 158$\,\mathrm{\mu m}$ fine-structure line of ionized carbon (C$^+$), using the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA), have revealed expanding [C II] shells in Galactic H II regions. We report the discovery of a bubble-shaped source (S144 in RCW79), associated with a compact H II region, excited by a single O7.5--9.5V/III star, which is consistent with a scenario that the bubble is still mostly ``filled'' with C$^+$. This indicates most likely a very early evolutionary state, in which the stellar wind has not yet blown material away, as it is the case for more evolved H II regions. Using the SimLine non-LTE radiative transfer code, the [C II] emission can be modeled to originate from three regions. First, a central H II region with little C$^+$ in the fully ionized phase, followed by two layers with gas density around $2500\,\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$ of partially photo-dissociated gas. The second layer is a slowly expanding [C II] shell with an expansion velocity of $\sim\,$$2.6\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$. The outermost layer exhibits a temperature and velocity gradient that produces the observed self-absorption features in the optically thick [C II] line ($\tau \sim 4$) leading to an apparent deficit in [C II] emission and a low ratio of [C II] to total far-infrared (FIR) emission. We developed a procedure to approximate the missing [C II] flux and find a linear correlation between [C II] and FIR without a [C II]-deficit. This demonstrates that at least some of the [C II]-deficit found in Galactic H II bubbles can be attributed to self-absorption.</description>
