      <title>An Ohsawa-Takegoshi-type $L^2$ extension for upper semi-continuous $L^2$-optimal functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we obtain an Ohsawa-Takegoshi-type $L^2$-extension for upper semi-continuous $L^2$-optimal functions via a Lebesgue-type differentiation theorem. As applications, we give a characterization of plurisubharmonic functions via the multiple coarse $L^2$-estimate property for (strongly) upper semi-continuous functions and show that (strongly) upper semi-continuous $L^2$-optimal functions satisfy Skoda's integrability theorem and the strong openness property.</description>

      <title>Inverse conductivity problem on a Riemann surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an application of the Faddeev-Henkin exponential ansatz and of the d-to-d-bar map on the boundary to inverse conductivity problem on a bordered Riemann surface in CP2. In our approach we use integral formulas for operator d-bar developed in [HP1]-[HP4] and integral formulas for holomorphic functions on Riemann surfaces from [P].</description>

      <title>On multidimensional Bohr radius of finite dimensional Banach spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we improve the lower estimate of multidimensional Bohr radius for unit ball of $\ell^n_q$-spaces ($1\leq q\leq \infty$) for bounded holomorphic functions with values in finite dimensional complex Banach spaces. The new estimate provides the improved lower bound for the Bohr radius which was previously given by Defant, Maestre, and Schwarting [Adv. Math. 231 (2012), 2837--2857].</description>

      <title>A Schwarz-Jack lemma, circularly symmetric domains and numerical ranges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a Schwarz-Jack lemma for holomorphic functions on the unit disk with the property that their maximum modulus on each circle about the origin is attained at a point on the positive real axis. With the help of this result, we establish monotonicity and convexity properties of conformal maps of circularly symmetric and bi-circularly symmetric domains. As an application, we give a new proof of Crouzeix's theorem that the numerical range of any $2\times 2$ matrix is a $2$-spectral set for the matrix. Unlike other proofs, our approach does not depend on the explicit formula for the conformal mapping of an ellipse onto the unit disk.</description>

      <title>Regularity of infinitesimal automorphisms of involutive structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.24105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove that infinitesimal automorphisms of an involutive structure are smooth. For this, we build a regularity theory for sections of vector bundles over an involutive structure $(M,V)$ endowed with a connection compatible with $V$, which we call $V$-connection. We show that $V$-sections, i.e. sections which are parallel with respect to $V$ under the $V$-connection, satisfy an analogue of Hans Lewy's theorem as formulated for CR functions on an abstract CR manifold by Berhanu and Xiao, and introduce certain (generically satisfied) nondegeneracy conditions ensuring their smoothness.</description>

      <title>On the zero sets of harmonic polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.24116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we consider nonzero harmonic functions vanishing on certain subvarieties. Among other things, we give a positive solution to the Problem 151 from the Scottish Book posed by R. Wavre in 1936. In more detail, we construct a nonzero harmonic function in the whole space that vanishes on the edges of the unit cube. Moreover, using harmonic morphisms we construct certain new nontrivial families of harmonic polynomials that vanish at the same set in the unit ball in n-dimensional space for all n greater than or equal to 4. This extends results of Logunov and Malinnikova. We also present some (presumably) new results on harmonic functions in the space whose nodal sets are unions of (affine) subspaces.</description>

      <title>The lightning method for the heat equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22576v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a new method for solving the planar heat equation based on the Lightning Method. The lightning method is a recent development in the numerical solution of linear PDEs which expresses solutions using sums of polynomials and rational functions, or more generally as sums of fundamental solutions. The method is particularly well suited to handle domains with sharp corners where solution singularities are present. Boundary conditions are formed on a set of collocation points which is then solved as an overdetermined linear system. The approach of the present work is to utilize the Laplace transform to obtain a modified Helmholtz equation which is solved by an application of the lightning method. The numerical inversion of the Laplace transform is then performed by means of Talbot integration. Our validation of the method against existing results and multiple challenging test problems shows the method attains spectral accuracy with root-exponential convergence while being robust across a wide range of time intervals and adaptable to a variety of geometric scenarios.</description>

      <title>Compact K\"ahler manifolds with nef anti-canonical bundle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23218v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove that a compact K\"ahler manifold $X$ with the nef anti-canonical bundle $-K_{X}$ admits a locally trivial fibration $\phi \colon X \to Y$, where the fiber $F$ is a rationally connected manifold and the base $Y$ is a Calabi--Yau manifold. We introduce a suitable approach that extends the strategy of Cao--H\"oring, originally developed for smooth projective varieties, to more general singular K\"ahler spaces. A key technical ingredient is a flatness criterion for pseudo-effective sheaves with vanishing first Chern class.</description>

      <title>A linear topological invariant for weighted spaces of holomorphic functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the linear topological invariant $(\Omega)$ for a class of Fr\'echet spaces of holomorphic functions of rapid decay on strip-like domains in the complex plane, defined via weight function systems. We obtain a complete characterization of the property $(\Omega)$ for such spaces in terms of an explicit condition on the defining weight function systems. As an application, we investigate the surjectivity of the Cauchy-Riemann operator on certain weighted spaces of vector-valued smooth functions.</description>

      <title>Tangent Currents, King's Residue Formula and Intersection Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06964v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the intersection of positive closed currents on domains using the theory of tangent currents in connection with King's residue formula. One of the main results provides a reasonable sufficient condition for the definition of the (proper) intersection of positive closed currents on domains. Another is an analytic description of the self-intersection of analytic subsets. The key idea is to connect tangent currents to complex Monge-Amp\`ere type currents. We also investigate the existence, the $h$-dimension and the shadow of tangent currents. Additionally, we introduce local regularizations of positive closed currents, examine classical examples and look into the relationship between our approach and slicing theory. Our work extends to general complex manifolds including compact K\"ahler manifolds.</description>

Abstract: Pointwise lower bounds on the open unit disc $\bbD$ for the sum of the moduli of two analytic functions $f$ and $g$ (or their derivatives) are known in several cases, like $f,g$ belonging to the Bloch space $\cB$, $BMOA$ or the weighted Hardy space $H_\omega^\infty$. We find complementary results of Ramey-Ullrich and Abakumov-Doubtsov for functions with little o conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12697v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we expand the theory of Weierstrassian elliptic functions by introducing auxiliary zeta functions $\zeta_\lambda$, zeta differences of first kind $\Delta_\lambda$ and second kind $\Delta_{\lambda,\mu}$ where $\lambda,\mu=1,2,3$. Fundamental and novel results pertaining to these functions are proven. Furthermore, results already existing in the literature are translated in terms of auxiliary zeta functions. Their relationship to Jacobian elliptic functions and Jacobian functions are given.</description>

      <title>Envelopes of Horospheres and Weingarten Surfaces in Hyperbolic 3-Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12115v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive basic differential geometric formulae for surfaces in hyperbolic space represented as envelopes of horospheres. The dual notion of parallel hypersurfaces is also studied. The representation is applied to prove existence and regularity theorems for Weingarten surfaces in H^3, which satisfy (1-a)K = a(2-H), for an a &lt; 0, and have a specified boundary curve at infinity. These surfaces are shown to be closely connected to conformal mappings of domains in S^2 into the unit disk and provide Riemannian interpretations for some conformal invariants associated to such mappings.
  This paper was originally written in 1984, before I learned to use TeX, and was typed by one of the secretaries in the Princeton Math Department. It was more or less, my first original work after my dissertation. For some reason, I was not able to get this paper published in a timely manner. The results and perspective in this paper have proved to be useful to a variety of people, some of whom asked me to render the article into TeX and post it to the arXiv. I had been seriously thinking about doing this, when Martin Bridgeman sent me a transcription of my original article into TeX. I am extremely grateful to him for the effort he has put into this project.
  The paper is now formatted in a more or less modern AMS-article style, but for lots of additional punctuation, a few corrections and some minor stylistic changes, the content has been largely reproduced as it originally was. Remarks about the 'state-of-the-art' in hyperbolic geometry are obviously way out of date, as there has been enormous progress in many aspects of this still rich subject.</description>

      <title>Hypercyclicity of Weighted shifts on weighted Bergman and Dirichlet spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16354v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $B_w$ and $F_w$ denote, respectively, the weighted backward and forward shift operators defined on the weighted Bergman space $A^p_{\phi}$, or the weighted Dirichlet space ${D}^p_{\phi}$ of the unit disc, where the weight function $\phi(z)$ is mostly radial. We first obtain sufficient conditions for $B_w$ and $F_w$ to be continuous on these spaces. For radial weights, we derive norm estimates for coefficient functionals on $A^p_{\phi}$ and $D^p_{\phi}$, and using those estimates we infer when the weighted shifts or their adjoints are hypercyclic. We also deal with a non-radial case.</description>

      <title>Computing algebraic Belyi functions on Bring's curve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23780v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explicitly compute two kinds of algebraic Belyi functions on Bring's curve. One is related to a congruence subgroup of ${\rm SL}_2(\mathbb{Z})$ and the other is related to a congruence subgroup of the triangle group $\Delta(2,4,5)\subset \SL_2(\R)$. To carry out the computation, we use elliptic cusp forms of weight 2 for the former case and the automorphism group of Bring's curve for the latter case. We also discuss a suitable base field (a number field) for describing isomorphisms between Hulek-Craig's curve, Bring's curve, and another algebraic model obtained as a modular curve.</description>
