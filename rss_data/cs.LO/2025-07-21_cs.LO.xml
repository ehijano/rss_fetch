      <title>A Proof System with Causal Labels (Part I): checking Individual Fairness and Intersectionality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we propose an extension to the typed natural deduction calculus TNDPQ to model verification of individual fairness and intersectionality in probabilistic classifiers. Their interpretation is obtained by formulating specific conditions for the application of the structural rule of Weakening. Such restrictions are given by causal labels used to check for conditional independence between protected and target variables.</description>

      <title>PSPACE-completeness of bimodal transitive weak-density logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Windows have been introduce in \cite{BalGasq25} as a tool for designing polynomial algorithms to check satisfiability of a bimodal logic of weak-density. In this paper, after revisiting the ``folklore'' case of bimodal $\K4$ already treated in \cite{Halpern} but which is worth a fresh review, we show that windows allow to polynomially solve the satisfiability problem when adding transitivity to weak-density, by mixing algorithms for bimodal K together with windows-approach. The conclusion is that both satisfiability and validity are PSPACE-complete for these logics.</description>

      <title>A meta-modal logic for bisimulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a modal study of the notion of bisimulation. Our contribution is twofold. First, we extend the basic modal language with a new modality [b], whose intended meaning is universal quantification over all states that are bisimilar to the current one. We show that bisimulations are definable in this object language. Second, we provide a sound and complete axiomatisation of the class of all pairs of Kripke models linked by bisimulations.</description>

      <title>STL-GO: Spatio-Temporal Logic with Graph Operators for Distributed Systems with Multiple Network Topologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MASs) consisting of a number of autonomous agents that communicate, coordinate, and jointly sense the environment to achieve complex missions can be found in a variety of applications such as robotics, smart cities, and internet-of-things applications. Modeling and monitoring MAS requirements to guarantee overall mission objectives, safety, and reliability is an important problem. Such requirements implicitly require reasoning about diverse sensing and communication modalities between agents, analysis of the dependencies between agent tasks, and the spatial or virtual distance between agents. To capture such rich MAS requirements, we model agent interactions via multiple directed graphs, and introduce a new logic -- Spatio-Temporal Logic with Graph Operators (STL-GO). The key innovation in STL-GO are graph operators that enable us to reason about the number of agents along either the incoming or outgoing edges of the underlying interaction graph that satisfy a given property of interest; for example, the requirement that an agent should sense at least two neighboring agents whose task graphs indicate the ability to collaborate. We then propose novel distributed monitoring conditions for individual agents that use only local information to determine whether or not an STL-GO specification is satisfied. We compare the expressivity of STL-GO against existing spatio-temporal logic formalisms, and demonstrate the utility of STL-GO and our distributed monitors in a bike-sharing and a multi-drone case study.</description>

      <title>Quantum Programming in Polylogarithmic Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polylogarithmic time delineates a relevant notion of feasibility on several classical computational models such as Boolean circuits or parallel random access machines. As far as the quantum paradigm is concerned, this notion yields the complexity class FBQPOLYLOG of functions approximable in polylogarithmic time with a quantum random-access Turing machine. We introduce a quantum programming language with first-order recursive procedures, which provides the first programming-language-based characterization of FBQPOLYLOG. Each program computes a function in FBQPOLYLOG (soundness) and, conversely, each function of this complexity class is computed by a program (completeness). We also provide a compilation strategy from programs to uniform families of quantum circuits of polylogarithmic depth and polynomial size, whose set of computed functions is known as QNC, and recover the well-known separation result FBQPOLYLOG $\subsetneq$ QNC.</description>

      <title>A SHACL-based Data Consistency Solution for Contract Compliance Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, there have been many developments for GDPR-compliant data access and sharing based on consent. For more complex data sharing scenarios, where consent might not be sufficient, many parties rely on contracts. Before a contract is signed, it must undergo the process of contract negotiation within the contract lifecycle, which consists of negotiating the obligations associated with the contract. Contract compliance verification (CCV) provides a means to verify whether a contract is GDPR-compliant, i.e., adheres to legal obligations and there are no violations. The rise of knowledge graph (KG) adoption, enabling semantic interoperability using well-defined semantics, allows CCV to be applied on KGs. In the scenario of different participants negotiating obligations, there is a need for data consistency to ensure that CCV is done correctly. Recent work introduced the automated contracting tool (ACT), a KG-based and ODRL-employing tool for GDPR CCV, which was developed in the Horizon 2020 project smashHit (https://smashhit.eu). Although the tool reports violations with respect to obligations, it had limitations in verifying and ensuring compliance, as it did not use an interoperable semantic formalism, such as SHACL, and did not support users in resolving data inconsistencies. In this work, we propose a novel approach to overcome these limitations of ACT. We semi-automatically resolve CCV inconsistencies by providing repair strategies, which automatically propose (optimal) solutions to the user to re-establish data consistency and thereby support them in managing GDPR-compliant contract lifecycle data. We have implemented the approach, integrated it into ACT and tested its correctness and performance against basic CCV consistency requirements.</description>

      <title>Computation of Interpolants for Description Logic Concepts in Hard Cases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While the computation of Craig interpolants for description logics (DLs) with the Craig Interpolation Property (CIP) is well understood, very little is known about the computation and size of interpolants for DLs without CIP or if one aims at interpolating concepts in a weaker DL than the DL of the input ontology and concepts. In this paper, we provide the first elementary algorithms computing (i) ALC-interpolants between ALC-concepts under ALCH-ontologies and (ii) ALC-interpolants between ALCQ-concepts under ALCQ-ontologies. The algorithms are based on recent decision procedures for interpolant existence. We also observe that, in contrast, uniform (possibly depth restricted) interpolants might be of non-elementary size.</description>

      <title>Cognitive Castes: Artificial Intelligence, Epistemic Stratification, and the Dissolution of Democratic Discourse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14218v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence functions not as an epistemic leveller, but as an accelerant of cognitive stratification, entrenching and formalising informational castes within liberal-democratic societies. Synthesising formal epistemology, political theory, algorithmic architecture, and economic incentive structures, the argument traces how contemporary AI systems selectively amplify the reasoning capacity of individuals equipped with recursive abstraction, symbolic logic, and adversarial interrogation, whilst simultaneously pacifying the cognitively untrained through engagement-optimised interfaces. Fluency replaces rigour, immediacy displaces reflection, and procedural reasoning is eclipsed by reactive suggestion. The result is a technocratic realignment of power: no longer grounded in material capital alone, but in the capacity to navigate, deconstruct, and manipulate systems of epistemic production. Information ceases to be a commons; it becomes the substrate through which consent is manufactured and autonomy subdued. Deliberative democracy collapses not through censorship, but through the erosion of interpretive agency. The proposed response is not technocratic regulation, nor universal access, but the reconstruction of rational autonomy as a civic mandate, codified in education, protected by epistemic rights, and structurally embedded within open cognitive infrastructure.</description>

      <title>SDSC:A Structure-Aware Metric for Semantic Signal Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14516v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose the Signal Dice Similarity Coefficient (SDSC), a structure-aware metric function for time series self-supervised representation learning. Most Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) methods for signals commonly adopt distance-based objectives such as mean squared error (MSE), which are sensitive to amplitude, invariant to waveform polarity, and unbounded in scale. These properties hinder semantic alignment and reduce interpretability. SDSC addresses this by quantifying structural agreement between temporal signals based on the intersection of signed amplitudes, derived from the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC).Although SDSC is defined as a structure-aware metric, it can be used as a loss by subtracting from 1 and applying a differentiable approximation of the Heaviside function for gradient-based optimization. A hybrid loss formulation is also proposed to combine SDSC with MSE, improving stability and preserving amplitude where necessary. Experiments on forecasting and classification benchmarks demonstrate that SDSC-based pre-training achieves comparable or improved performance over MSE, particularly in in-domain and low-resource scenarios. The results suggest that structural fidelity in signal representations enhances the semantic representation quality, supporting the consideration of structure-aware metrics as viable alternatives to conventional distance-based methods.</description>

      <title>Complexity of Faceted Explanations in Propositional Abduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14962v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Abductive reasoning is a popular non-monotonic paradigm that aims to explain observed symptoms and manifestations. It has many applications, such as diagnosis and planning in artificial intelligence and database updates. In propositional abduction, we focus on specifying knowledge by a propositional formula. The computational complexity of tasks in propositional abduction has been systematically characterized - even with detailed classifications for Boolean fragments. Unsurprisingly, the most insightful reasoning problems (counting and enumeration) are computationally highly challenging. Therefore, we consider reasoning between decisions and counting, allowing us to understand explanations better while maintaining favorable complexity. We introduce facets to propositional abductions, which are literals that occur in some explanation (relevant) but not all explanations (dispensable). Reasoning with facets provides a more fine-grained understanding of variability in explanations (heterogeneous). In addition, we consider the distance between two explanations, enabling a better understanding of heterogeneity/homogeneity. We comprehensively analyze facets of propositional abduction in various settings, including an almost complete characterization in Post's framework.</description>

      <title>Automated planning with ontologies under coherence update semantics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15120v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Standard automated planning employs first-order formulas under closed-world semantics to achieve a goal with a given set of actions from an initial state. We follow a line of research that aims to incorporate background knowledge into automated planning problems, for example, by means of ontologies, which are usually interpreted under open-world semantics. We present a new approach for planning with DL-Lite ontologies that combines the advantages of ontology-based action conditions provided by explicit-input knowledge and action bases (eKABs) and ontology-aware action effects under the coherence update semantics. We show that the complexity of the resulting formalism is not higher than that of previous approaches and provide an implementation via a polynomial compilation into classical planning. An evaluation of existing and new benchmarks examines the performance of a planning system on different variants of our compilation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate multi-label classification involving large sets of labels, where the output labels may be known to satisfy some logical constraints. We look at an architecture in which classifiers for individual labels are fed into an expressive sequential model, which produces a joint distribution. One of the potential advantages for such an expressive model is its ability to modelling correlations, as can arise from constraints. We empirically demonstrate the ability of the architecture both to exploit constraints in training and to enforce constraints at inference time.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Separation Logic</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bayesian probabilistic programming languages (BPPLs) let users denote statistical models as code while the interpreter infers the posterior distribution. The semantics of BPPLs are usually mathematically complex and unable to reason about desirable properties such as expected values and independence of random variables. To reason about these properties in a non-Bayesian setting, probabilistic separation logics such as PSL and Lilac interpret separating conjunction as probabilistic independence of random variables. However, no existing separation logic can handle Bayesian updating, which is the key distinguishing feature of BPPLs.
  To close this gap, we introduce Bayesian separation logic (BaSL), a probabilistic separation logic that gives semantics to BPPL. We prove an internal version of Bayes' theorem using a result in measure theory known as the Rokhlin-Simmons disintegration theorem. Consequently, BaSL can model probabilistic programming concepts such as Bayesian updating, unnormalised distribution, conditional distribution, soft constraint, conjugate prior and improper prior while maintaining modularity via the frame rule. The model of BaSL is based on a novel instantiation of Kripke resource monoid via $\sigma$-finite measure spaces over the Hilbert cube, and the semantics of Hoare triple is compatible with an existing denotational semantics of BPPL based on the category of $s$-finite kernels. Using BaSL, we then prove properties of statistical models such as the expected value of Bayesian coin flip, correlation of random variables in the collider Bayesian network, and the posterior distributions of the burglar alarm model, a parameter estimation algorithm, and the Gaussian mixture model.</description>

      <title>Formal Analysis of Networked PLC Controllers Interacting with Physical Environments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) are widely used in industrial automation to control physical systems. As PLC applications become increasingly complex, ensuring their correctness is crucial. Existing formal verification techniques focus on individual PLC programs in isolation, often neglecting interactions with physical environments and network communication between controllers. This limitation poses significant challenges in analyzing real-world industrial systems, where continuous dynamics and communication delays play a critical role. In this paper, we present a unified formal framework that integrates discrete PLC semantics, networked communication, and continuous physical behaviors. To mitigate state explosion, we apply partial order reduction, significantly reducing the number of explored states while maintaining correctness. Our framework enables precise analysis of PLC-driven systems with continuous dynamics and networked communication.</description>

Abstract: Abductive forgetting is removing variables from a logical formula while maintaining its abductive explanations. It is carried in two alternative ways depending on its intended application. Both differ from the usual forgetting, which maintains consequences rather than explanations. Differently from that, abductive forgetting from a propositional formula may not be expressed by any propositional formula. A necessary and sufficient condition tells when it is. Checking it is $\Pi^p_3$-complete. A way to guarantee expressibility of abductive forgetting is to switch from propositional to default logic. Another is to introduce new variables.</description>

      <title>Deciding the Existence of Interpolants and Definitions in First-Order Modal Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.04598v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: None of the first-order modal logics between $\mathsf{K}$ and $\mathsf{S5}$ under the constant domain semantics enjoys Craig interpolation or projective Beth definability, even in the language restricted to a single individual variable. It follows that the existence of a Craig interpolant for a given implication or of an explicit definition for a given predicate cannot be directly reduced to validity as in classical first-order and many other logics. Our concern here is the decidability and computational complexity of the interpolant and definition existence problems. We first consider two decidable fragments of first-order modal logic $\mathsf{S5}$: the one-variable fragment $\mathsf{Q^1S5}$ and its extension $\mathsf{S5}_{\mathcal{ALC}^u}$ that combines $\mathsf{S5}$ and the description logic$\mathcal{ALC}$ with the universal role. We prove that interpolant and definition existence in $\mathsf{Q^1S5}$ and $\mathsf{S5}_{\mathcal{ALC}^u}$ is decidable in coN2ExpTime, being 2ExpTime-hard, while uniform interpolant existence is undecidable. These results transfer to the two-variable fragment $\mathsf{FO^2}$ of classical first-order logic without equality. We also show that interpolant and definition existence in the one-variable fragment $\mathsf{Q^1K}$ of first-order modal logic $\mathsf{K}$ is non-elementary decidable, while uniform interpolant existence is again undecidable.</description>

      <title>A Monoidal View on Fixpoint Checks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.02957v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fixpoints are ubiquitous in computer science as they play a central role in providing a meaning to recursive and cyclic definitions. Bisimilarity, behavioural metrics, termination probabilities for Markov chains and stochastic games are defined in terms of least or greatest fixpoints. Here we show that our recent work which proposes a technique for checking whether the fixpoint of a function is the least (or the largest) admits a natural categorical interpretation in terms of gs-monoidal categories. The technique is based on a construction that maps a function to a suitable approximation. We study the compositionality properties of this mapping and show that under some restrictions it can naturally be interpreted as a (lax) gs-monoidal functor. This guides the development of a tool, called UDEfix that allows us to build functions (and their approximations) like a circuit out of basic building blocks and subsequently perform the fixpoints checks. We also show that a slight generalisation of the theory allows one to treat a new relevant case study: coalgebraic behavioural metrics based on Wasserstein liftings.</description>

      <title>The Monadic Theory of Toric Words</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.04895v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For which unary predicates $P_1, \ldots, P_m$ is the MSO theory of the structure $\langle \mathbb{N}; &lt;, P_1, \ldots, P_m \rangle$ decidable? We survey the state of the art, leading us to investigate combinatorial properties of almost-periodic, morphic, and toric words. In doing so, we show that if each $P_i$ can be generated by a toric dynamical system of a certain kind, then the attendant MSO theory is decidable.</description>

      <title>A parametricity-based formalization of semi-simplicial and semi-cubical sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00512v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Semi-simplicial and semi-cubical sets are commonly defined as presheaves over respectively, the semi-simplex or semi-cube category. Homotopy Type Theory then popularized an alternative definition, where the set of n-simplices or n-cubes are instead regrouped into the families of the fibers over their faces, leading to a characterization we call indexed. Moreover, it is known that semi-simplicial and semi-cubical sets are related to iterated Reynolds parametricity, respectively in its unary and binary variants. We exploit this correspondence to develop an original uniform indexed definition of both augmented semi-simplicial and semi-cubical sets, and fully formalize it in Coq.</description>

      <title>On the Decidability of Presburger Arithmetic Expanded with Powers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05191v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that for any integers $\alpha, \beta &gt; 1$, the existential fragment of the first-order theory of the structure $\langle \mathbb{Z}; 0,1,&lt;, +, \alpha^{\mathbb{N}}, \beta^{\mathbb{N}}\rangle$ is decidable (where $\alpha^{\mathbb{N}}$ is the set of positive integer powers of $\alpha$, and likewise for $\beta^{\mathbb{N}}$). On the other hand, we show by way of hardness that decidability of the existential fragment of the theory of $\langle \mathbb{N}; 0,1, &lt;, +, x\mapsto \alpha^x, x \mapsto \beta^x\rangle$ for any multiplicatively independent $\alpha,\beta &gt; 1$ would lead to mathematical breakthroughs regarding base-$\alpha$ and base-$\beta$ expansions of certain transcendental numbers.</description>

      <title>A Simple and Effective ASP-Based Tool for Enumerating Minimal Hitting Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09194v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The hitting set problem is a fundamental problem in computer science and mathematics. Given a family of sets over a universe of elements, a minimal hitting set is a subset-minimal collection of elements that intersects each set in the family. Enumerating all minimal hitting sets is crucial in various real-world applications.
  In this paper, we address the full enumeration of all minimal hitting sets for a given family of sets. We formulate the problem using Answer Set Programming (ASP) and leverage existing ASP solvers for efficient enumeration. We propose an ASP-based tool, MinHit-ASP, and our empirical evaluation shows that it effectively enumerates minimal hitting sets across benchmarks from diverse problem domains.</description>

      <title>Taint Analysis for Graph APIs Focusing on Broken Access Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08947v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first systematic approach to static and dynamic taint analysis for Graph APIs focusing on broken access control. The approach comprises the following. We taint nodes in the Graph API if they represent data requiring specific privileges in order to be retrieved or manipulated, and identify API calls which are related to sources and sinks. Then, we statically analyze whether tainted information flow between API source and sink calls occurs. To this end, we model the API calls using graph transformation rules. We subsequently use critical pair analysis to automatically analyze potential dependencies between rules representing source calls and rules representing sink calls. We distinguish direct from indirect tainted information flow and argue under which conditions the CPA is able to detect not only direct, but also indirect tainted flow. The static taint analysis (i) identifies flows that need to be further reviewed, since tainted nodes may be created by an API call and used or manipulated by another API call later without having the necessary privileges, and (ii) can be used to systematically design dynamic security tests for broken access control. The dynamic taint analysis checks if potential broken access control risks detected during the static taint analysis really occur. We apply the approach to a part of the GitHub GraphQL API. The application illustrates that our analysis supports the detection of two types of broken access control systematically: the case where users of the API may not be able to access or manipulate information, although they should be able to do so; and the case where users (or attackers) of the API may be able to access/manipulate information that they should not.</description>

      <title>Universal Gluing and Contextual Choice: Categorical Logic and the Foundations of Analytic Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22693v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new categorical and constructive foundation for analytic approximation based on a Contextual Choice Principle (CCP), which enforces locality and compatibility in the construction of mathematical objects. Central to our approach is the Universal Embedding and Linear Approximation Theorem (UELAT), which establishes that functions in broad spaces -- including C(K), Sobolev spaces W^{k,p}(Omega), and distributions D'(Omega) -- can be explicitly approximated by finite-rank linear projections, each with a constructive, algorithmically verifiable certificate of accuracy.
  These constructions are governed categorically by a functorial adjunction between local logical probes and analytic models, making analytic existence both formally certifiable and programmatically extractable. As a key result, we prove a uniform certificate stability theorem, ensuring that approximation certificates persist under uniform convergence.
  The CCP avoids classical pathologies (e.g., non-measurable sets, Banach--Tarski paradoxes) by eliminating non-constructive choice and replacing it with a coherent, local-to-global semantic logic. Our framework strengthens the foundations of constructive analysis while contributing tools relevant to formal verification, type-theoretic proof systems, and computational mathematics.</description>

      <title>Modeling Deontic Modal Logic in the s(CASP) Goal-directed Predicate Answer Set Programming System</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05519v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of implementing deontic modal logic. We show how (deontic) modal operators can be expressed elegantly using default negation (negation-as-failure) and strong negation present in answer set programming (ASP). We propose using global constraints of ASP to represent obligations and impermissibilities of deontic modal logic. We show that our proposed representation results in the various paradoxes of deontic modal logic being elegantly resolved.</description>
