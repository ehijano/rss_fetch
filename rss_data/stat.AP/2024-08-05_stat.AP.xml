      <title>Kairosis: A method for dynamical probability forecast aggregation informed by Bayesian change point detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new method, informed by work on Bayesian change-point detection, for aggregating probability forecasts over time, which we call "kairosis". Our method begins by constructing for every point in time a posterior probability that this point partitions the forecasts into two sets which are distributed differently. These posterior probabilities are then integrated to give a cumulative mass function from which a weighted median forecast is calculated. Kairosis outperforms standard methods, and is especially suitable for geopolitical forecasting tournaments because it is observed to be robust across disparate questions and forecaster distributions.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Inversion Modeling of Gas Emissions: A Gradient-Based MCMC Estimation of Gaussian Plume Parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In response to global concerns regarding air quality and the environmental impact of greenhouse gas emissions, detecting and quantifying sources of emissions has become critical. To understand this impact and target mitigations effectively, methods for accurate quantification of greenhouse gas emissions are required. In this paper, we focus on the inversion of concentration measurements to estimate source location and emission rate. In practice, such methods often rely on atmospheric stability class-based Gaussian plume dispersion models. However, incorrectly identifying the atmospheric stability class can lead to significant bias in estimates of source characteristics. We present a robust approach that reduces this bias by jointly estimating the horizontal and vertical dispersion parameters of the Gaussian plume model, together with source location and emission rate, atmospheric background concentration, and sensor measurement error variance. Uncertainty in parameter estimation is quantified through probabilistic inversion using gradient-based MCMC methods. A simulation study is performed to assess the inversion methodology. We then focus on inference for the published Chilbolton dataset which contains controlled methane releases and demonstrates the practical benefits of estimating dispersion parameters in source inversion problems.</description>

      <title>Application of Superconducting Technology in the Electricity Industry: A Game-Theoretic Analysis of Government Subsidy Policies and Power Company Equipment Upgrade Decisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the potential impact of "LK-99," a novel material developed by a Korean research team, on the power equipment industry. Using evolutionary game theory, the interactions between governmental subsidies and technology adoption by power companies are modeled. A key innovation of this research is the introduction of sensitivity analyses concerning time delays and initial subsidy amounts, which significantly influence the strategic decisions of both government and corporate entities. The findings indicate that these factors are critical in determining the rate of technology adoption and the efficiency of the market as a whole. Due to existing data limitations, the study offers a broad overview of likely trends and recommends the inclusion of real-world data for more precise modeling once the material demonstrates room-temperature superconducting characteristics. The research contributes foundational insights valuable for future policy design and has significant implications for advancing the understanding of technology adoption and market dynamics.</description>

      <title>Performance of the stochastic MV-PURE estimator in highly noisy settings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1303.4956</link>
      <description>arXiv:1303.4956v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The stochastic minimum-variance pseudo-unbiased reduced-rank estimator (stochastic MV-PURE estimator) has been developed to provide linear estimation with robustness against high noise levels, imperfections in model knowledge, and ill-conditioned systems. In this paper, we investigate the theoretical performance of the stochastic MV-PURE estimator under varying levels of additive noise. We prove that the mean-square-error (MSE) of this estimator in the low signal-to-noise (SNR) region is much smaller than that obtained with its full-rank version, the minimum-variance distortionless estimator, and the gap becomes larger as the noise level increases. These results shed light on the excellent performance of the stochastic MV-PURE estimator in highly noisy settings obtained in simulations so far. Furthermore, we extend previous numerical simulations to show how the insight gained from the results of this paper can be used in practice.</description>

      <title>A marginalized three-part interrupted time series regression model for proportional data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.09996v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Interrupted time series (ITS) is often used to evaluate the effectiveness of a health policy intervention that accounts for the temporal dependence of outcomes. When the outcome of interest is a percentage or percentile, the data can be highly skewed, bounded in $[0, 1]$, and have many zeros or ones. A three-part Beta regression model is commonly used to separate zeros, ones, and positive values explicitly by three submodels. However, incorporating temporal dependence into the three-part Beta regression model is challenging. In this article, we propose a marginalized zero-one-inflated Beta time series model that captures the temporal dependence of outcomes through copula and allows investigators to examine covariate effects on the marginal mean. We investigate its practical performance using simulation studies and apply the model to a real ITS study.</description>
