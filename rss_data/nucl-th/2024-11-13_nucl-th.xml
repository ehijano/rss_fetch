      <title>Heavy quark potential and thermal charm production in heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heavy quark mass in QGP is related to the heavy quark potential at a large distance. In this study we test three different heavy quark potentials, namely, the free energy, the internal energy of the heavy quark pair in QGP, and the unscreened potential, which was recently proposed by the HotQCD Collaboration, through the thermal production of charm quarks in heavy-ion collisions at the LHC. We find that the free energy potential overestimates charm production in heavy-ion collisions at the LHC, while the unscreened potential produces results closest to the experimental data from the ALICE Collaboration among the three potentials.</description>

      <title>Ab initio informed 20Ne(p, p$\alpha$)16O reaction elucidates the emergence of alpha clustering from chiral potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the first \textit{ab initio} informed $\alpha$ knock-out reaction in the intermediate-mass region, with the aim to probe the underlying chiral potential and its impact on the emergence of alpha clustering in this mass region. The theoretical predictions of the $\alpha+^{16}$O clustering in the $^{20}$Ne ground state, based on the \textit{ab initio} symmetry-adapted no-core shell model with continuum, yield a triple differential cross section for $^{20}$Ne(p, p$\alpha$)$^{16}$O that is in a remarkable agreement with the data. This allows us to examine predictions of surface and in-medium $\alpha$-cluster features from a chiral potential and to compare these to the successful antisymmetrized molecular dynamics approach.</description>

      <title>Nonlocal interaction and collective excitation in deuteron breakup on ${}^{24}$Mg nucleus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deuteron breakup in collision with a ${}^{24}\mathrm{Mg}$ nucleus is studied using rigorous three-body scattering equations, extended to include also the excitation of the nucleus. Predictions based on local and nonlocal nucleon-nucleus optical potentials with rotational quadrupole deformation enabling the excitation of the ${}^{24}\mathrm{Mg}(2^+)$ state are compared. The nonlocality effect is less pronounced than in the deuteron inelastic scattering ${}^{24}\mathrm{Mg}(d,d')$ at the same energies, and manifests itself quite differently for semi-inclusive differential cross sections of elastic and inelastic breakup.</description>

      <title>Berry curvature and spin-one color superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Berry curvature and topological aspects of a spin-one color superconductor. In the ultra-relativistic limit, the ground state is the color-spin locking phase (CSL) with the pairing between quarks of opposite chirality. Li and Haldane show that for generic Cooper pairs formed by Weyl fermions that carry opposite chirality, the gap function must have topologically protected nodes. However, the CSL phase has been known as a fully gapped system and lacks any nodes within one-flavor Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). We present a general formulation relating the total topological number associated with the nodal structure and the monopole charges of the Berry curvature, including the color structure of the pair quarks. In the CSL phase, the contribution from the chirality, which is assumed to lead to the nodes within the conventional argument, is canceled out by the novel color contribution. Moreover, this non-trivial color Berry structure is manifested through the presence of gapless quasi-particles that exhibit the "color" helicity $\pm 1$, resulting in total monopole charges of $\pm 3/2$ rather than $\pm 1/2$ of a single Weyl fermion.</description>

      <title>Skyrme-Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov mass models on a 3D mesh: IV. Improved description of the isospin dependence of pairing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08007v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Providing reliable data on the properties of atomic nuclei and infinite nuclear matter to astrophysical applications remains extremely challenging, especially when treating both properties coherently within the same framework. Methods based on energy density functionals (EDFs) enable manageable calculations of nuclear structure throughout the entire nuclear chart and of the properties of infinite nuclear matter across a wide range of densities and asymmetries. To address these challenges, we present BSkG4, the latest Brussels-Skyrme-on-a-Grid model. It is based on an EDF of the extended Skyrme type with terms that are both momentum and density-dependent, and refines the treatment of $^1S_0$ nucleon pairing gaps in asymmetric nuclear matter as inspired by more advanced many-body calculations. The newest model maintains the accuracy of earlier BSkGs for known atomic masses, radii and fission barriers with rms deviations of 0.633 MeV w.r.t. 2457 atomic masses, 0.0246 fm w.r.t. 810 charge radii, and 0.36 MeV w.r.t 45 primary fission barriers of actinides. It also improves some specific pairing-related properties, such as the $^1S_0$ pairing gaps in asymmetric nuclear matter, neutron separation energies, $Q_\beta$ values, and moments of inertia of finite nuclei. This improvement is particularly relevant for describing the $r$-process nucleosynthesis as well as various astrophysical phenomena related to the rotational evolution of neutron stars, their oscillations, and their cooling.</description>

      <title>How neutron star properties disfavor a nuclear chiral density wave</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cold and dense matter may break rotational symmetry spontaneously and thus form an anisotropic phase in the interior of neutron stars. We consider the concrete example of an anisotropic chiral condensate in the form of a chiral density wave. Employing a nucleon-meson model and taking into account fermionic vacuum fluctuations, we improve and extend previous results by imposing the conditions of electric charge neutrality and electroweak equilibrium, by allowing for a more general form of the vector meson self-interactions, and by including properties of pure neutron matter into the fit of the model parameters. We find that the conditions inside neutron stars postpone the onset of the chiral density wave to larger densities compared to isospin-symmetric nuclear matter. While this still allows for the construction of stars with an anisotropic core, we find that the chiral density wave is energetically preferred only in a corner of the parameter space where matter is too soft to generate stars with realistic masses. Therefore, taking into account constraints from astrophysical data, our calculation predicts an isotropic neutron star core.</description>

      <title>Centrality definition in e+A collisions at the Electron-Ion Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the feasibility of defining centrality in electron-ion collisions at the Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) by examining the correlation between the impact parameter and several observables, including total energy, total transverse momentum, and total number of particles. Using the BeAGLE Monte Carlo generator, we simulate e+Au and e+Ru collisions at different energies and analyze the correlation between the impact parameter and these observables across different kinematic regions. Our findings indicate that the correlation is weak in the central rapidity region but becomes stronger in the forward and far-forward rapidity regions. However, the correlation is not sufficiently robust to allow for precise centrality determination. We conclude that defining centrality in electron-ion collisions is more challenging than in ion-ion collisions, necessitating further studies to develop a robust centrality definition for the EIC.</description>

      <title>Schwinger-Keldysh effective action for hydrodynamics with approximate symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the hydrodynamic theories with approximate symmetries in the recently developed effective action approach on the Schwinger-Keldysh (SK) contour. We employ the method of spurious symmetry transformation for small explicit symmetry-breaking parameters to systematically constrain symmetry-breaking effects in the non-equilibrium effective action for hydrodynamics. We apply our method to the hydrodynamic theory of chiral symmetry in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) at finite temperature and density and its explicit breaking by quark masses. We show that the spurious symmetry and the Kubo-Martin-Schwinger (KMS) relation dictate that the Ward-Takahashi identity for the axial symmetry, i.e., the partial conservation of axial vector current (PCAC) relation, contains a relaxational term proportional to the axial chemical potential, whose kinetic coefficient is at least of the second order in the quark mass. In the phase where the chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken, and the pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone pions appear as hydrodynamic variables, this relaxation effect is subleading compared to the conventional pion mass term in the PCAC relation, which is of the first order in the quark mass. On the other hand, in the chiral symmetry-restored phase, we show that our relaxation term, which is of the second order in the quark mass, becomes the leading contribution to the axial charge relaxation. Therefore, the leading axial charge relaxation mechanism is parametrically different in the quark mass across a chiral phase transition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14463v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: At the earliest stage of ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions the produced matter is a highly populated system of gluons called glasma which can be approximately described in terms of classical chromodynamic fields. Although the system's dynamics is governed by Yang-Mills equations, glasma evolution is shown to strongly resemble hydrodynamic behaviour.</description>

      <title>The Theoretical Study of $p\bar{p}\to\bar{\Lambda}\Sigma\eta$ Reaction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17088v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the production of hyperon resonances in the $p\bar{p}\to\bar{\Lambda}\Sigma\eta$ reaction within an effective Lagrangian approach. The model includes the production of $\Sigma(1750)$ and $\Lambda(1670)$ in the intermediate state excited by the $K$ and $K^*$ meson exchanges between the initial proton and antiproton. Due to the large coupling of $\Sigma(1750)\Sigma\eta$ vertex, $\Sigma(1750)$ is found a significant contribution near the threshold in this reaction. We provide total and differential cross section predictions for the reation and discuss the possible influence of $\Sigma(1750)\Sigma\eta$ vertex coupling and model parameters, which will be useful in future experimental studies. This reaction can provide a platform for studying the features of $\Sigma(1750)$ resonance, especially the coupling to $\Sigma\eta$ channel.</description>

      <title>The Ghent Hybrid Model in NuWro: a new neutrino single-pion production model in the GeV regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05212v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neutrino-induced single-pion production constitutes an essential interaction channel in modern neutrino oscillation experiments, with its products building up a significant fraction of the observable hadronic final states. Frameworks of oscillation analyses strongly rely on Monte Carlo neutrino event generators, which provide theoretical predictions of neutrino interactions on nuclear targets. Thus, it is crucial to integrate state-of-the-art single-pion production models with Monte Carlo simulations to prepare for the upcoming systematics-dominated landscape of neutrino measurements. In this work, we present the implementation of the Ghent Hybrid model for neutrino-induced single-pion production in the NuWro Monte Carlo event generator. The interaction dynamics includes coherently-added contributions from nucleon resonances and a non-resonant background, merged into the pythia branching predictions in the deep-inelastic regime, as instrumented by NuWro. This neutrino-nucleon interaction model is fully incorporated into the nuclear framework of the generator, allowing it to account for the influence of both initial- and final-state nuclear medium effects. We compare the predictions of this integrated implementation with recent pion production data from accelerator-based neutrino experiments. The results of the novel model show improved agreement of the generator predictions with the data and point to the significance of the refined treatment of the description of pion-production processes beyond the $\Delta$ region.</description>

      <title>Probe and Prejudice: Classification of compact objects and model comparison using EOS knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07837v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nuclear theory and experiments, alongside astrophysical observations, constrain the equation of state (EOS) of supranuclear-dense matter. Conversely, knowledge of the EOS allows an improved interpretation of nuclear or astrophysical data. In this article, we use several established constraints on the EOS and the new NICER measurement of PSR J0437-4715 to comment on the nature of the primary companion in GW230529 and the companion of PSR J0514-4002E. We find that, with a probability of $\gtrsim 84\%$ and $\gtrsim 68\%$, respectively, both objects are black holes. These likelihoods increase to above $95\%$ when one uses GW170817's remnant as an upper limit on the TOV mass. We also demonstrate that the current knowledge of the EOS substantially disfavors high masses and radii for PSR J0030+0451, inferred recently when combining NICER with XMM-Newton background data and using particular hot-spot models. Finally, we also use our obtained EOS knowledge to comment on measurements of the nuclear symmetry energy, finding that the large value predicted by the PREX-II measurement displays some mild tension with other constraints on the EOS.</description>

      <title>Gravitational form factors of pion from top-down holographic QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21113v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The gravitational form factors (GFFs) of pions are calculated from a top-down holographic quantum chromodynamics (QCD) approach with momentum transfer dependence for the first time. It is important because the GFFs of hadrons have information on the internal stress distribution that may provide insight into the mechanism of how QCD forms hadrons. The forward limit value of this GFFs, i.e. the D-term, was also obtained. Furthermore, in this approach, we observe the so-called glueball dominance, in which pions have gravitational interactions via infinite glueball spectra.</description>
