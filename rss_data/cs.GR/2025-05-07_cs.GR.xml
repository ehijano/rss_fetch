      <title>StableMotion: Training Motion Cleanup Models with Unpaired Corrupted Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motion capture (mocap) data often exhibits visually jarring artifacts due to inaccurate sensors and post-processing. Cleaning this corrupted data can require substantial manual effort from human experts, which can be a costly and time-consuming process. Previous data-driven motion cleanup methods offer the promise of automating this cleanup process, but often require in-domain paired corrupted-to-clean training data. Constructing such paired datasets requires access to high-quality, relatively artifact-free motion clips, which often necessitates laborious manual cleanup. In this work, we present StableMotion, a simple yet effective method for training motion cleanup models directly from unpaired corrupted datasets that need cleanup. The core component of our method is the introduction of motion quality indicators, which can be easily annotated through manual labeling or heuristic algorithms and enable training of quality-aware motion generation models on raw motion data with mixed quality. At test time, the model can be prompted to generate high-quality motions using the quality indicators. Our method can be implemented through a simple diffusion-based framework, leading to a unified motion generate-discriminate model, which can be used to both identify and fix corrupted frames. We demonstrate that our proposed method is effective for training motion cleanup models on raw mocap data in production scenarios by applying StableMotion to SoccerMocap, a 245-hour soccer mocap dataset containing real-world motion artifacts. The trained model effectively corrects a wide range of motion artifacts, reducing motion pops and frozen frames by 68% and 81%, respectively.

      <title>Evaluating Foveated Frame Rate Reduction in Virtual Reality for Head-Mounted Displays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03682v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Foveated rendering methods usually reduce spatial resolution in the periphery of the users' view. However, using foveated rendering to reduce temporal resolution, i.e., rendering frame rate, seems less explored. In this work, we present the results of a user study investigating the perceptual effects of foveated temporal resolution reduction, where only the temporal resolution (frame rate) is reduced in the periphery without affecting spatial quality (pixel density). In particular, we investigated the perception of temporal resolution artifacts caused by reducing the frame rate dependent on the eccentricity of the user's gaze. Our user study with 15 participants was conducted in a virtual reality setting using a head-mounted display. Our results indicate that it was possible to reduce average rendering costs, i.e., the number of rendered pixels, to a large degree before participants consistently reported perceiving temporal artifacts.</description>

      <title>VR-Doh: Hands-on 3D Modeling in Virtual Reality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00814v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce VR-Doh, an open-source, hands-on 3D modeling system that enables intuitive creation and manipulation of elastoplastic objects in Virtual Reality (VR). By customizing the Material Point Method (MPM) for real-time simulation of hand-induced large deformations and enhancing 3D Gaussian Splatting for seamless rendering, VR-Doh provides an interactive and immersive 3D modeling experience. Users can naturally sculpt, deform, and edit objects through both contact- and gesture-based hand-object interactions. To achieve real-time performance, our system incorporates localized simulation techniques, particle-level collision handling, and the decoupling of physical and appearance representations, ensuring smooth and responsive interactions. VR-Doh supports both object creation and editing, enabling diverse modeling tasks such as designing food items, characters, and interlocking structures, all resulting in simulation-ready assets. User studies with both novice and experienced participants highlight the system's intuitive design, immersive feedback, and creative potential. Compared to existing geometric modeling tools, VR-Doh offers enhanced accessibility and natural interaction, making it a powerful tool for creative exploration in VR.</description>

      <title>CK-MPM: A Compact-Kernel Material Point Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10399v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Material Point Method (MPM) has become a cornerstone of physics-based simulation, widely used in geomechanics and computer graphics for modeling phenomena such as granular flows, viscoelasticity, fracture mechanics, etc. Despite its versatility, the original MPM suffers from cell-crossing instabilities caused by discontinuities in particle-grid transfer kernels. Existing solutions mostly mitigate these issues by adopting smoother shape functions, but at the cost of increased numerical diffusion and computational overhead due to larger kernel support. In this paper, we propose a novel C^2-continuous compact kernel for MPM that achieves a unique balance in terms of stability, accuracy, and computational efficiency. Our method integrates seamlessly with Affine Particle-In-Cell (APIC) and Moving Least Squares (MLS) MPM, while only doubling the number of grid nodes associated with each particle compared to linear kernels. At its core is an innovative dual-grid framework, which associates particles with grid nodes exclusively within the cells they occupy on two staggered grids, ensuring consistent and stable force computations. We demonstrate that our method can be conveniently implemented using a domain-specific language, Taichi, or based on open-source GPU MPM frameworks, achieving faster runtime and less numerical diffusion compared to quadratic B-spline MPM. Comprehensive validation through unit tests, comparative studies, and stress tests demonstrates the efficacy of our approach in conserving both linear and angular momentum, handling stiff materials, and scaling efficiently for large-scale simulations. Our results highlight the transformative potential of compact, high-order kernels in advancing MPM's capabilities for stable, accurate, and high-performance simulations.</description>

      <title>PhysicsFC: Learning User-Controlled Skills for a Physics-Based Football Player Controller</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21216v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose PhysicsFC, a method for controlling physically simulated football player characters to perform a variety of football skills--such as dribbling, trapping, moving, and kicking--based on user input, while seamlessly transitioning between these skills. Our skill-specific policies, which generate latent variables for each football skill, are trained using an existing physics-based motion embedding model that serves as a foundation for reproducing football motions. Key features include a tailored reward design for the Dribble policy, a two-phase reward structure combined with projectile dynamics-based initialization for the Trap policy, and a Data-Embedded Goal-Conditioned Latent Guidance (DEGCL) method for the Move policy. Using the trained skill policies, the proposed football player finite state machine (PhysicsFC FSM) allows users to interactively control the character. To ensure smooth and agile transitions between skill policies, as defined in the FSM, we introduce the Skill Transition-Based Initialization (STI), which is applied during the training of each skill policy. We develop several interactive scenarios to showcase PhysicsFC's effectiveness, including competitive trapping and dribbling, give-and-go plays, and 11v11 football games, where multiple PhysicsFC agents produce natural and controllable physics-based football player behaviors. Quantitative evaluations further validate the performance of individual skill policies and the transitions between them, using the presented metrics and experimental designs.</description>

      <title>GarmentImage: Raster Encoding of Garment Sewing Patterns with Diverse Topologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02592v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Garment sewing patterns are the design language behind clothing, yet their current vector-based digital representations weren't built with machine learning in mind. Vector-based representation encodes a sewing pattern as a discrete set of panels, each defined as a sequence of lines and curves, stitching information between panels and the placement of each panel around a body. However, this representation causes two major challenges for neural networks: discontinuity in latent space between patterns with different topologies and limited generalization to garments with unseen topologies in the training data. In this work, we introduce GarmentImage, a unified raster-based sewing pattern representation. GarmentImage encodes a garment sewing pattern's geometry, topology and placement into multi-channel regular grids. Machine learning models trained on GarmentImage achieve seamless transitions between patterns with different topologies and show better generalization capabilities compared to models trained on vector-based representation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of GarmentImage across three applications: pattern exploration in latent space, text-based pattern editing, and image-to-pattern prediction. The results show that GarmentImage achieves superior performance on these applications using only simple convolutional networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02720v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Photo-realistic image rendering from 3D scene reconstruction has advanced significantly with neural rendering techniques. Among these, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) outperforms Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) in quality and speed but struggles with shape and color discontinuities. We propose 3D Half-Gaussian (3D-HGS) kernels as a plug-and-play solution to address these limitations. Our experiments show that 3D-HGS enhances existing 3D-GS methods, achieving state-of-the-art rendering quality without compromising speed.</description>

      <title>CleAR: Robust Context-Guided Generative Lighting Estimation for Mobile Augmented Reality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02179v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-quality environment lighting is essential for creating immersive mobile augmented reality (AR) experiences. However, achieving visually coherent estimation for mobile AR is challenging due to several key limitations in AR device sensing capabilities, including low camera FoV and limited pixel dynamic ranges. Recent advancements in generative AI, which can generate high-quality images from different types of prompts, including texts and images, present a potential solution for high-quality lighting estimation. Still, to effectively use generative image diffusion models, we must address two key limitations of content quality and slow inference. In this work, we design and implement a generative lighting estimation system called CleAR that can produce high-quality, diverse environment maps in the format of 360{\deg} HDR images. Specifically, we design a two-step generation pipeline guided by AR environment context data to ensure the output aligns with the physical environment's visual context and color appearance. To improve the estimation robustness under different lighting conditions, we design a real-time refinement component to adjust lighting estimation results on AR devices. Through a combination of quantitative and qualitative evaluations, we show that CleAR outperforms state-of-the-art lighting estimation methods on both estimation accuracy, latency, and robustness, and is rated by 31 participants as producing better renderings for most virtual objects. For example, CleAR achieves 51% to 56% accuracy improvement on virtual object renderings across objects of three distinctive types of materials and reflective properties. CleAR produces lighting estimates of comparable or better quality in just 3.2 seconds -- over 110X faster than state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Don't Mesh with Me: Generating Constructive Solid Geometry Instead of Meshes by Fine-Tuning a Code-Generation LLM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15279v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While recent advancements in machine learning, such as LLMs, are revolutionizing software development and creative industries, they have had minimal impact on engineers designing mechanical parts, which remains largely a manual process. Existing approaches to generating 3D geometry most commonly use meshes as a 3D representation. While meshes are suitable for assets in video games or animations, they lack sufficient precision and adaptability for mechanical engineering purposes. This paper introduces a novel approach for the generation of 3D geometry that generates surface-based Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG) by leveraging a code-generation LLM. First, we create a dataset of 3D mechanical parts represented as code scripts by converting Boundary Representation geometry (BREP) into CSG-based Python scripts. Second, we create annotations in natural language using GPT-4. The resulting dataset is used to fine-tune a code-generation LLM. The fine-tuned LLM can complete geometries based on positional input and natural language in a plausible way, demonstrating geometric understanding.</description>

      <title>HumanEdit: A High-Quality Human-Rewarded Dataset for Instruction-based Image Editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04280v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present HumanEdit, a high-quality, human-rewarded dataset specifically designed for instruction-guided image editing, enabling precise and diverse image manipulations through open-form language instructions. Previous large-scale editing datasets often incorporate minimal human feedback, leading to challenges in aligning datasets with human preferences. HumanEdit bridges this gap by employing human annotators to construct data pairs and administrators to provide feedback. With meticulously curation, HumanEdit comprises 5,751 images and requires more than 2,500 hours of human effort across four stages, ensuring both accuracy and reliability for a wide range of image editing tasks. The dataset includes six distinct types of editing instructions: Action, Add, Counting, Relation, Remove, and Replace, encompassing a broad spectrum of real-world scenarios. All images in the dataset are accompanied by masks, and for a subset of the data, we ensure that the instructions are sufficiently detailed to support mask-free editing. Furthermore, HumanEdit offers comprehensive diversity and high-resolution $1024 \times 1024$ content sourced from various domains, setting a new versatile benchmark for instructional image editing datasets. With the aim of advancing future research and establishing evaluation benchmarks in the field of image editing, we release HumanEdit at https://huggingface.co/datasets/BryanW/HumanEdit.</description>

      <title>Deformable Beta Splatting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18630v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has advanced radiance field reconstruction by enabling real-time rendering. However, its reliance on Gaussian kernels for geometry and low-order Spherical Harmonics (SH) for color encoding limits its ability to capture complex geometries and diverse colors. We introduce Deformable Beta Splatting (DBS), a deformable and compact approach that enhances both geometry and color representation. DBS replaces Gaussian kernels with deformable Beta Kernels, which offer bounded support and adaptive frequency control to capture fine geometric details with higher fidelity while achieving better memory efficiency. In addition, we extended the Beta Kernel to color encoding, which facilitates improved representation of diffuse and specular components, yielding superior results compared to SH-based methods. Furthermore, Unlike prior densification techniques that depend on Gaussian properties, we mathematically prove that adjusting regularized opacity alone ensures distribution-preserved Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), independent of the splatting kernel type. Experimental results demonstrate that DBS achieves state-of-the-art visual quality while utilizing only 45% of the parameters and rendering 1.5x faster than 3DGS-MCMC, highlighting the superior performance of DBS for real-time radiance field rendering. Interactive demonstrations and source code are available on our project website: https://rongliu-leo.github.io/beta-splatting/.</description>

      <title>Instance Segmentation of Scene Sketches Using Natural Image Priors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09608v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sketch segmentation involves grouping pixels within a sketch that belong to the same object or instance. It serves as a valuable tool for sketch editing tasks, such as moving, scaling, or removing specific components. While image segmentation models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in recent years, sketches present unique challenges for these models due to their sparse nature and wide variation in styles. We introduce InkLayer, a method for instance segmentation of raster scene sketches. Our approach adapts state-of-the-art image segmentation and object detection models to the sketch domain by employing class-agnostic fine-tuning and refining segmentation masks using depth cues. Furthermore, our method organizes sketches into sorted layers, where occluded instances are inpainted, enabling advanced sketch editing applications. As existing datasets in this domain lack variation in sketch styles, we construct a synthetic scene sketch segmentation dataset, InkScenes, featuring sketches with diverse brush strokes and varying levels of detail. We use this dataset to demonstrate the robustness of our approach.</description>

      <title>DEFT: Differentiable Branched Discrete Elastic Rods for Modeling Furcated DLOs in Real-Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15037v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Autonomous wire harness assembly requires robots to manipulate complex branched cables with high precision and reliability. A key challenge in automating this process is predicting how these flexible and branched structures behave under manipulation. Without accurate predictions, it is difficult for robots to reliably plan or execute assembly operations. While existing research has made progress in modeling single-threaded Deformable Linear Objects (DLOs), extending these approaches to Branched Deformable Linear Objects (BDLOs) presents fundamental challenges. The junction points in BDLOs create complex force interactions and strain propagation patterns that cannot be adequately captured by simply connecting multiple single-DLO models. To address these challenges, this paper presents Differentiable discrete branched Elastic rods for modeling Furcated DLOs in real-Time (DEFT), a novel framework that combines a differentiable physics-based model with a learning framework to: 1) accurately model BDLO dynamics, including dynamic propagation at junction points and grasping in the middle of a BDLO, 2) achieve efficient computation for real-time inference, and 3) enable planning to demonstrate dexterous BDLO manipulation. A comprehensive series of real-world experiments demonstrates DEFT's efficacy in terms of accuracy, computational speed, and generalizability compared to state-of-the-art alternatives.
