      <title>Uniqueness of asymptotically conical K\"ahler-Ricci flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the uniqueness problem for the K\"ahler-Ricci flow with a conical initial condition. Given a complete gradient expanding K\"ahler-Ricci soliton on a non compact manifold with quadratic curvature decay, including its derivatives, we establish that any complete solution to the Kahler-Ricci flow emerging from the soliton's tangent cone at infinity--appearing as a K\"ahler cone--must coincide with the forward self-similar K\"ahler-Ricci flow associated with the soliton, provided certain conditions hold. Specifically, if its K\"ahler form remains in the same cohomology class as that of the soliton's self-similar K\"ahler-Ricci flow, its full Riemann curvature operator is bounded for each fixed positive time, its Ricci curvature is bounded from above by A/t, its scalar curvature is bounded from below by -A/t, and it shares a same Killing vector field with the soliton metric. This paper gives a partial answer to a question in paper of Feldman-Ilmanen-Knopf, and generalizes the earlier work of Conlon-Deruelle and the work of Conlon-Deruelle-Sun.</description>

      <title>A note on Chern-Weil classes of Cartan connections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a construction of Chern-Weil characteristic classes for pairs Cartan geometries sharing the same underlying data. Given any model Cartan geometry $(Q,\omega)$ with underlying data $(G,V)$ and a second Cartan geometry $(P,\theta)$ with the same underlying data, we define a subalgebra of polynomials on the Atiyah algebroid of $Q$ together with a characteristic map that recovers the classical Chern-Weil map of a Cartan connection when $(Q,\omega)$ arises from a Klein pair modeling $(P,\theta)$.</description>

Abstract: This paper is dedicated to the local parametric classification of Wintgen ideal submanifolds in space forms. These submanifolds are characterized by the pointwise attainment of equality in the DDVV inequality, which relates the scalar curvature, the length of the mean curvature vector field and the normal curvature tensor.</description>

      <title>An explicit description of the K\"{a}hler-Einstein metrics of Guenancia-Hamenst\"{a}dt</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fine and Premoselli (FP) constructed the first examples of manifolds that do not admit a locally symmetric metric but do admit a negatively curved Einstein metric. The manifolds here are hyperbolic branched covers like those used by Gromov and Thurston, and the construction of their model Einstein metric is a variation of the hyperbolic metric written in polar coordinates. Very recently, Guenancia and Hamenst\"{a}dt (GH) proved the existence of the first examples of manifolds that are not locally symmetric but admit a negatively curved K\"{a}hler-Einstein metric. The GH metrics are realized on complex hyperbolic branched covers constructed by Stover and Toledo. In this article we generalize the construction of FP to the complex hyperbolic setting and show that this yields a negatively curved Einstein metric that asymptotically approaches the metric of GH.</description>

      <title>On quasi-local spin-angular momentum and the construction of axial vector fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14251v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A novel procedure is presented which allows the construction of all axial vector fields on Riemannian two-spheres. Using these axial vector fields and the centre-of-mass unit sphere reference systems, a constructive definition of quasi-local spin-angular momentum is introduced. Balance relations are also derived, with respect to arbitrary Lie-propagated unit sphere reference systems, to characterize the angular momentum transports in spacetimes without symmetries.</description>

      <title>Extension operators and geometric decompositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Geometric decomposition is a widely used tool for constructing local bases for finite element spaces. For finite element spaces of differential forms on simplicial meshes, Arnold, Falk, and Winther showed that geometric decompositions can be constructed from extension operators satisfying certain properties. In this paper, we generalize their results to function spaces and meshes satisfying very minimal hypotheses, while at the same time reducing the conditions that must hold for the extension operators. In particular, the geometry of the mesh and the mesh elements can be completely arbitrary, and the function spaces need only have well-defined restrictions to subelements. In this general context, we show that extension operators yield geometric decompositions for both the primal and dual function spaces. Later, we specialize to simplicial meshes, and we show that, to obtain geometric decompositions, one needs only to construct extension operators on the reference simplex in each dimension. In particular, for simplicial meshes, the existence of geometric decompositions depends only on the dimension of the mesh.</description>

      <title>Nonexistence of Solutions to classes of parabolic inequalities in the Riemannian setting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00203v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish conditions for nonexistence of global solutions for a class of quasilinear parabolic problems with a potential on complete, non-compact Riemannian manifolds, including the Porous Medium Equation and the p-Laplacian with a potential term. Our results reveal the interplay between the manifold's geometry, the power nonlinearity, and the potential's behavior at infinity. Using a test function argument, we identify explicit parameter ranges where nonexistence holds.</description>

      <title>A method for determining Cartan geometries from the local behavior of automorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.00561v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a construction for a Cartan geometry that captures the local behavior of a given geometric automorphism near a distinguished element. The result of this construction, which we call the sprawl generated by the automorphism, is uniquely characterized by a kind of universal property that allows us to compare different Cartan geometries that admit automorphisms with equivalent local behavior near a distinguished element. As example applications, we describe how to construct non-flat real projective structures admitting nontrivial automorphisms with higher-order fixed points and extend some known local automorphisms with higher-order fixed points on non-flat parabolic geometries to global automorphisms.</description>

      <title>Low Morse index for the systole function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.05801v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that for any $k\ge0$, all critical points for the systole function and the $\text{sys}_T$ functions in $\mathcal{M}_{g,n}$ have index at least $k$, for all but finitely many pairs $(g,n)$. This implies that the lowest Morse index can be bounded from below by a positive number that goes to infinity as the dimension of the moduli space increases. We conclude by Morse theory that all the rational (co)homology of the Deligne-Mumford compactification $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{g,n}$ of degree at most $k$ comes from the boundary $\partial\mathcal{M}_{g,n}$ for all but finitely many pairs $(g,n)$.
  In particular, we show that there exists a universal constant $C&gt;0$, such that the lowest Morse index is at least $C\log\log(-\chi+1)$. Developing the theorems, we also obtain an explicit upper bound on the cardinality of a $j$-system on a $(g,n)$-surface.</description>

      <title>The Ricci iteration towards cscK metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15524v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the problem of finding constant scalar curvature K\"ahler metrics, we investigate a Ricci iteration sequence of Rubinstein that discretizes the pseudo-Calabi flow. While the long time existence of the flow is still an open question, we show that the iteration sequence does exist for all steps, along which the K-energy decreases. We further show that the iteration sequence, modulo automorphisms, converges smoothly to a constant scalar curvature K\"ahler metric if there is one, thus confirming a conjecture of Rubinstein from 2007 and extending results of Darvas--Rubinstein to arbitrary K\"ahler classes.</description>

Abstract: We prove that the existence of a $Z$-positive and $Z$-critical Hermitian metric on a rank 2 holomorphic vector bundle over a compact K\"ahler surface implies that the bundle is $Z$-stable. As particular cases, we obtain stability results for the deformed Hermitian Yang-Mills equation and the almost Hermite-Einstein equation for rank 2 bundles over surfaces. We show examples of $Z$-unstable bundles and $Z$-critical metrics away from the large volume limit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14125v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent interest among geometers in $f$-structures of K. Yano is due to the study of topology and dynamics of contact foliations, which generalize the flow of the Reeb vector field on contact manifolds to higher dimensions. Weak metric structures introduced by V. Rovenski and R. Wolak as a generalization of Hermitian and K\"{a}hler structures, as well as $f$-structures, allow a fresh look at the classical theory. In this paper, we study a new $f$-structure of this kind, called the weak $\beta$-Kenmotsu $f$-structure, as a generalization of K. Kenmotsu's concept. We prove that a weak $\beta$-Kenmotsu $f$-manifold is locally a twisted product of the Euclidean space and a weak K\"{a}hler manifold. Our main results show that such manifolds with $\beta=const$ and equipped with an $\eta$-Ricci soliton structure whose potential vector field satisfies certain conditions are $\eta$-Einstein manifolds of constant scalar curvature.</description>

Abstract: We find the information geometry of tempered stable processes. Beginning with the derivation of $\alpha$-divergence between two tempered stable processes, we obtain the corresponding Fisher information matrices and the $\alpha$-connections on their statistical manifolds. Furthermore, we explore statistical applications of this geometric framework. Various tempered stable processes such as generalized tempered stable processes, classical tempered stable processes, and rapidly-decreasing tempered stable processes are presented as illustrative examples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19430v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the comparison of nonholonomic mechanics and constrained variational mechanics, invariant affine subbundles arise in the determination of the initial conditions where the two methods yield the same trajectories. Motivated by this, differential conditions are considered for invariant affine subbundles as they arise in the comparison of nonholonomic and constrained variational mechanics. First of all, the formal integrability of the resulting linear partial differential equation is determined using Spencer cohomology. Second, iterative formulae are provided that permit the determination of the largest invariant affine subbundle invariant under an affine vector field. Finally, the problem of a disc rolling on an inclined plane with no-slip is considered as an example to illustrate the theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2101.10990v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a general theory of pushforward operations for principal $G$-bundles equipped with a certain type of orientation.
  In the case $G=BU(1)$ and orientations in twisted K-theory we construct two pushforward operations, the projective Euler operation, whose existence was conjectured by Joyce, and the projective rank operation. We classify all stable pushforward operations in this context and show that they are all generated by the projective Euler and rank operation.
  As an application, we construct a graded Lie algebra structure on the homology of a commutative H-space with a compatible $BU(1)$-action and orientation. These play an important role in the context of wall-crossing formulas in enumerative geometry.</description>

Abstract: The moduli space of Anosov representations of a surface group in a semisimple group, which is an open set in the character variety, admits many more natural functions than the regular functions. We will study in particular length functions and, correlation functions. Our main result is a formula that computes the Poisson bracket of those functions using some combinatorial devices called {\em ghost polygons} and {\em ghost bracket} encoded in a formal algebra called {\em ghost algebra} related in some cases to the swapping algebra introduced by the second author. As a consequence of our main theorem, we show that the set of those functions -- length and correlation -- is stable under the Poisson bracket. We give two applications: firstly in the presence of positivity we prove the convexity of length functions, generalising a result of Kerckhoff in Teichm\"uller space, secondly we exhibit subalgebras of commuting functions. An important tool is the study of {\em uniformly hyperbolic bundles} which is a generalisation of Anosov representations beyond periodicity.</description>

      <title>Flux Quantization on 11-dimensional Superspace</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16456v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Flux quantization of the C-field in 11d supergravity is arguably necessary for the (UV-)completion of the theory, in that it determines the torsion charges carried by small numbers of M-branes. However, hypotheses about C-field flux-quantization ("models of the C-field") have previously been discussed only in the bosonic sector of 11d supergravity and ignoring the supergravity equations of motion. Here we highlight a duality-symmetric formulation of on-shell 11d supergravity on superspace, observe that this naturally lends itself to completion of the theory by flux quantization, and indeed that 11d super-spacetimes are put on-shell by carrying quantizable duality-symmetric super-C-field flux; the proof of which we present in detail.</description>

      <title>Flux Quantization on M5-branes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11304v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We highlight the need for global completion of the field content in the M5-brane sigma-model analogous to Dirac's charge/flux quantization, and we point out that the superspace Bianchi identities on the worldvolume and on its ambient supergravity background constrain the M5's flux-quantization law to be in a non-abelian cohomology theory rationally equivalent to a twisted form of co-Homotopy. In order to clearly bring out this subtle point we give a streamlined re-derivation of the worldvolume 3-flux via M5 "super-embeddings". Finally, assuming the flux-quantization law to actually be in co-Homotopy ("Hypothesis H") we show how this implies Skyrmion-like solitons on general M5-worldvolumes and (abelian) anyonic solitons on the boundaries of "open M5-branes" in heterotic M-theory.</description>

      <title>Monotonicity of the Liouville entropy along the Ricci flow on surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07290v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using geometric and microlocal methods, we show that the Liouville entropy of the geodesic flow of a closed surface of non-constant negative curvature is strictly increasing along the normalized Ricci flow. This affirmatively answers a question of Manning from 2004. More generally, we obtain an explicit formula for the derivative of the Liouville entropy along arbitrary area-preserving conformal perturbations in this setting. In addition, we show the mean root curvature, a purely geometric quantity which is a lower bound for the Liouville entropy, is also strictly increasing along the normalized Ricci flow.</description>

      <title>A decomposition lemma in convex integration via classical algebraic geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21300v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a decomposition lemma that allows error terms to be expressed using fewer rank-one symmetric matrices than $\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$ within the convex integration scheme of constructing flexible $C^{1,\alpha}$ solutions to a system of nonlinear PDEs in dimension $n\geq 2$, which can be viewed as a kind of truncation of the codimension one local isometric embedding equation in Nash-Kuiper Theorem. This leads to flexible solutions with higher H\"older regularity, and consequently, improved very weak solutions to certain induced equations for any $n$, including Monge-Amp\`ere systems and $2$-Hessian systems. The H\"older exponent of the solutions can be taken as any $\alpha &lt;(n^2+1)^{-1}$ for $n=2,4,8,16$, and any $\alpha&lt;(n^2+n-2\rho(\frac{n}{2})-1)^{-1}$ for other $n$, thereby improving the previously known bound $\alpha&lt;(n^2+n+1)^{-1}$ for $n\geq 3$. Here, $\rho(n)$ is the Radon-Hurwitz number, which exhibits an $8$-fold periodicity on $n$ that is related to Bott periodicity.
  Our arguments involve novel applications of several results from algebraic geometry and topology, including Adams' theorem on maximum linearly independent vector fields on spheres, the intersection of projective varieties, and projective duality. We also use an elliptic method ingeniously that avoids loss of differentiability.</description>
