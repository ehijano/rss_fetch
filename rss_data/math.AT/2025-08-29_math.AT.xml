      <title>Equivariant homotopic distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce and investigate the equivariant homotopic distance between G-maps, an equivariant homotopy invariant that extends the notion of homotopic distance to the setting of spaces equipped with a continuous action of a topological group. This new invariant provides a unifying framework that generalizes both the equivariant Lusternik-Schnirelmann category and the equivariant topological complexity. We establish fundamental properties of the equivariant homotopic distance, including a triangle inequality, cohomological lower bounds, homotopy dimension-connectivity upper bound, and behavior under composition and product of maps.
  We further establish several sufficient conditions for Hopf G-spaces to admit a division G-map and prove that their G-equivariant topological complexity equals their equivariant Lusternik-Schnirelmann category, thus extending Lupton and Scherer's theorem to the equivariant setting. In addition, we provide sharp estimates for the equivariant topological complexity of Hopf G-spheres. Moreover, we estimate the equivariant homotopic distance between fibre-preserving, equivariant maps of G-fibrations in terms of the equivariant homotopic distance between the corresponding G-maps on the fibres and the equivariant Lusternik-Schnirelmann category of the base space.</description>

      <title>A chromatic approach to homological stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a way to organise the subject of ``higher-order homological stability'', in the context of a graded $E_2$-algebra $\mathbf{R}$, along the same lines that the chromatic perspective organises stable homotopy theory.
  From this point of view proving a (higher-order) homological stability theorem corresponds to producing Smith--Toda complexes in the category of $\mathbf{R}$-modules: using this perspective we prove that whenever $\mathbf{R}$ is defined over a field of positive characteristic and satisfies some standard properties, there is a sequence of higher-order homological stability theorems whose slopes tend to 1.
  We propose that in a higher-order stable range the ``stable homology'' should be interpreted as certain Bousfield localisations in the category of $\mathbf{R}$-modules, leading to a chromatic tower and monochromatic layers. Given the existence of suitable Smith--Toda complexes we establish several properties of these localisations, in particular explaining how higher-order stabilisation maps yield periodic families in the monochromatic layers.
  We explain how to associate to such an $\mathbf{R}$ a Hopf algebra which completely governs the kinds of higher-order stability maps that it enjoys, in the sense that the cohomology of this Hopf algebra has precisely the same stability patterns as $\mathbf{R}$. When $\mathbf{R}$ comes from a sequence of groups, this Hopf algebra has a concrete description as the coinvariants of the $E_1$-Steinberg modules.</description>

      <title>Enumerating submonoids of finite commutative monoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a finite commutative monoid $M$, we show that submonoids of $M\times [n]$ - where $[n] = \{0,1,\ldots,n\}$ is equipped with the max operation $\vee$ - may be enumerated via the transfer matrix method. When $M$ is also idempotent, we show that there are finitely many integers $\lambda$ and rational numbers $b_\lambda$ (only depending on $M$) such that the number of submonoids of $M\times [n]$ is $\sum_\lambda b_\lambda\lambda^n$. This answers a question of Knuth regarding ternary (and higher order) max-closed relations, and has applications to the enumeration of saturated transfer systems in equivariant infinite loop space theory.</description>

      <title>Geometric Kernels of Proper Maps Between Non-Compact Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A map between connected $2$-manifolds has a geometric kernel if it sends a non-contractible simple loop to a null-homotopic loop. While every non-$\pi_1$-injective map between compact surfaces admits a geometric kernel, this generally fails for compact bordered or non-compact surfaces. In this paper, we use Brown's proper fundamental group to give a sufficient condition under which a degree-one map between non-compact surfaces admits a geometric kernel. Furthermore, we characterize conjugacy classes in the proper fundamental group and use this characterization to establish sufficient conditions for the existence of geometric kernels.</description>

      <title>Conley-Morse persistence barcode: a homological signature of a combinatorial bifurcation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17105v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bifurcation characterizes the qualitative changes in parameterized dynamical systems and is one of the major topics in the field. In this work, we study combinatorial bifurcations within the framework of combinatorial dynamical systems -- a young but already well-established theory. We introduce the Conley-Morse persistence barcode, a compact algebraic descriptor of combinatorial bifurcations. This barcode captures structural changes in a dynamical system at the level of Morse decompositions and provides a characterization of the nature of observed transitions in terms of the Conley index. The construction of Conley-Morse persistence barcode builds upon ideas from topological persistence. Specifically, we consider a persistence module obtained from the Conley index of invariant sets indexed over a poset. Using gentle algebras, we prove that this module decomposes into simple intervals (bars) and compute them by adapting the zigzag persistence algorithm to our purpose.</description>
