      <title>Optimizing Non-Intersecting Synthetic Vascular Trees in Nonconvex Organs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The understanding of the mechanisms driving vascular development is still limited. Techniques to generate vascular trees synthetically have been developed to tackle this problem. However, most algorithms are limited to single trees inside convex perfusion volumes. We introduce a new framework for generating multiple trees inside general nonconvex perfusion volumes. Our framework combines topology optimization and global geometry optimization into a single algorithmic approach. Our first contribution is defining a baseline problem based on Murray's original formulation, which accommodates efficient solution algorithms. The problem of finding the global minimum is cast into a nonlinear optimization problem (NLP) with merely super-linear solution effort. Our second contribution extends the NLP to constrain multiple vascular trees inside any nonconvex boundary while avoiding intersections. We test our framework against a benchmark of an anatomic region of brain tissue and a vasculature of the human liver. In all cases, the total tree energy is improved significantly compared to local approaches. By avoiding intersections globally, we can reproduce key physiological features such as parallel running inflow vessels and tortuous vessels. The ability to generate non-intersecting vascular trees inside nonconvex organs can improve the functional assessment of organs.</description>

      <title>Hierarchy of chaotic dynamics in random modular networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a model of randomly connected neural populations and study its dynamics by means of the dynamical mean-field theory and simulations. Our analysis uncovers a rich phase diagram, featuring high- and low-dimensional chaotic phases, separated by a crossover region characterized by low values of the maximal Lyapunov exponent and participation ratio dimension, but with high and rapidly changing values of the Lyapunov dimension. Counterintuitively, chaos can be attenuated by either adding noise to strongly modular connectivity or by introducing modularity into random connectivity. Extending the model to include a multilevel, hierarchical connectivity reveals that a loose balance between activities across levels drives the system towards the edge of chaos.</description>

      <title>Curved edges in the vertex model increase tissue fluidity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Vertex Model for epithelia models the apical surface of the tissue by a tiling, with polygons representing cells and edges representing cell-cell junctions. The mechanics are described by an energy governed by deviations from a target area and perimeter for each cell. It has been shown that the target perimeter, p0, governs a solid-to-fluid phase transition: when the target perimeter is low there is an energy barrier to rearrangement, and when it is high cells may rearrange for free and the tissue can flow like a liquid. One simplification often made is modelling junctions using straight edges. However, the Young-Laplace equation states that interfaces should be circular arcs, with the curvature being equal to the pressure difference between the neighbouring cells divided by the interfacial tension. Here, we investigate how including curved edges alters the mechanical properties of the vertex model and equilibrium shape of individual cells. Importantly, we show how curved edges shift the solid-to-fluid transition point, from $p0 = 3.81$ to $p0 = 3.73$, allowing tissues to fluidise sooner than in the traditional model with straight edges.</description>

      <title>Fluid flow generates bacterial conjugation hotspots by increasing the rate of shear-driven cell-cell encounters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conjugation accelerates bacterial evolution by enabling bacteria to acquire genes horizontally from their neighbors. Because plasmid donors must physically connect with recipients to allow plasmid transfer, environmental fluid flows may increase conjugation rates by increasing cell-cell encounters through mixing driven by fluid shear, which creates relative movement between donors and recipients. However, existing experimental assays do not directly control cell-cell encounters, which hinders the establishment of a connection between the population-level conjugation rate and the microscale mechanisms that bring cells together. Here, we performed conjugation experiments between E. coli bacteria, varying the shear flow to control the rate of cell-cell encounters. We discovered that the conjugation rate increases with shear until it peaks at an optimal shear rate (approximately 100 1/s), reaching a value five-fold higher than the baseline set by diffusion-driven encounters. This optimum marks the transition from a regime in which shear promotes conjugation by increasing the rate of cell-cell encounters to a regime in which shear disrupts conjugation. Fluid flows are widely present in aquatic systems, gut, and soil, and our results indicate that fluid shear could induce hotspots of bacterial conjugation in the environment.</description>

      <title>Learning and Unlearning: Bridging classification, memory and generative modeling in Recurrent Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The human brain is a complex system that is fascinating scientists since a long time. Its remarkable capabilities include categorization of concepts, retrieval of memories and creative generation of new examples. At the same time, modern artificial neural networks are trained on large amounts of data to accomplish these same tasks with a considerable degree of precision. By contrast with biological systems, machines appear to be either significantly slow and energetically expensive to train, suggesting the need for a paradigmatic change in the way they learn. We here review a general learning prescription that allows to perform classification, memorization and generation of new examples in bio-inspired artificial neural networks. The training procedure can be split into a prior Hebbian learning phase and a subsequent anti-Hebbian one (usually referred to as Unlearning). The separation of training in two epochs allows the algorithm to go fully unsupervised while partially aligning with some modern biological theories of learning.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Adaptive Continuous Attractor Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Attractor neural networks consider that neural information is stored as stationary states of a dynamical system formed by a large number of interconnected neurons. The attractor property empowers a neural system to encode information robustly, but it also incurs the difficulty of rapid update of network states, which can impair information update and search in the brain. To overcome this difficulty, a solution is to include adaptation in the attractor network dynamics, whereby the adaptation serves as a slow negative feedback mechanism to destabilize which are otherwise permanently stable states. In such a way, the neural system can, on one hand, represent information reliably using attractor states, and on the other hand, perform computations wherever rapid state updating is involved. Previous studies have shown that continuous attractor neural networks with adaptation (A-CANNs) exhibits rich dynamical behaviors accounting for various brain functions. In this paper, we present a comprehensive view of the rich diverse dynamics of A-CANNs. Moreover, we provide a unified mathematical framework to understand these different dynamical behaviors, and briefly discuss about their biological implications.</description>

      <title>The multiscale self-similarity of the weighted human brain connectome</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Anatomical connectivity between different regions in the brain can be mapped to a network representation, the connectome, where the intensities of the links, the weights, influence its structural resilience and the functional processes it sustains. Yet, many features associated with the weights in the human brain connectome are not fully understood, particularly their multiscale organization. In this paper, we elucidate the architecture of weights, including weak ties, in multiscale hierarchical human brain connectomes reconstructed from empirical data. Our findings reveal multiscale self-similarity in the weighted statistical properties, including the ordering of weak ties, that remain consistent across the analyzed length scales of every individual and the group representatives. This phenomenon is effectively captured by a renormalization of the weighted structure applied to hyperbolic embeddings of the connectomes, based on a unique weighted geometric model that integrates links of all weights across all length scales. This eliminates the need for separate generative weighted connectivity rules for each scale or to replicate weak and strong ties at specific scales in brain connectomes. The observed symmetry represents a distinct signature of criticality in the weighted connectivity of human brain connectomes, aligning with the fractality observed in their topology, and raises important questions for future research, like the existence of a resolution threshold where the observed symmetry breaks, or whether it is preserved in cases of neurodegenerative disease or psychiatric disorder.</description>

      <title>Active fluids form system-spanning filamentary networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent experimental realizations of liquid-liquid phase separation of active liquid crystals have offered an insight into the interaction between phase separation, ubiquitous in soft matter and biology, and chaotic active flows. In this Letter, we use continuum theory to examine phase separation of an active liquid crystal and a passive fluid and report two new results. First, we provide an analytical derivation of the activity-induced suppression of the phase boundary of the coexistence region - a result first reported in simulations and experiments. We show that the shift in the critical point is a result of the balance between self-stirring active flows and phase-separating diffusive fluxes. Second, we show that this same balance is responsible for dramatically changing the morphology of the phase separated state, resulting in the emergence of a new mixed active phase consisting of a dynamical filamentous active network that invades the entire system area, trapping droplets of passive material. This structure exists even for very low volume fractions of active material. Our work provides an important step towards the goal of understanding how to use activity as a new handle for sculpting interfaces.</description>

      <title>Multiple Pareto-optimal solutions of the dissipation-adaptation trade-off</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07106v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adaptation refers to the ability to recover and maintain ``normal'' function upon perturbations of internal of external conditions and is essential for sustaining life. Biological adaptation mechanisms are dissipative, i.e. they require a supply of energy such as the coupling to the hydrolysis of ATP. Via evolution the underlying biochemical machinery of living organisms evolved into highly optimized states. However, in the case of adaptation processes two quantities are optimized simultaneously, the adaptation speed or accuracy and the thermodynamic cost. In such cases one typically faces a trade-off, where improving one quantity implies worsening the other. The solution is no longer unique but rather a Pareto set -- the set of all physically attainable protocols along which no quantity can be improved without worsening another. Here we investigate Pareto fronts in adaptation-dissipation trade-offs for a cellular thermostat and a minimal ATP-driven receptor-ligand reaction network. We find convex sections of Pareto fronts to be interrupted by concave regions, implying the coexistence of distinct optimization mechanisms. We discuss the implications of such ``compromise-optimal'' solutions and argue that they may endow biological systems with a superior flexibility to evolve, resist, and adapt to different environments.</description>
