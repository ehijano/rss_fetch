      <title>Operator dependence and robustness of spacetime-localized response in a quantum critical spin chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the phenomenon of spacetime-localized response in a quantum critical spin system, with particular attention to how it depends on the spatial profile and operator content of the applied perturbation, as well as its robustness against increase of amplitude and temporal discretization. Motivated by recent theoretical proposals linking such response patterns to the anti-de Sitter/conformal field theory correspondence, we numerically analyze the real-time dynamics of the one-dimensional transverse-field Ising model at criticality using the time-evolving block decimation algorithm. We find that sharply localized and periodically recurring responses emerge only for specific types of perturbations, namely those that correspond to local density fields in the continuum limit. In contrast, perturbations involving other spin components produce conventional propagating excitations without localization. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the response remains qualitatively robust when the time-dependent perturbation is approximated by a piecewise-linear function, highlighting the practical relevance of our findings for quantum simulation platforms with limited temporal resolution. Our results clarify the operator dependence of emergent bulk-like dynamics in critical spin chains and offer guidance for probing holographic physics in experimental settings.</description>

      <title>Continuum Model of Isospectrally Patterned Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04518v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Isospectrally patterned lattices (IPL) have recently been shown to exhibit a rich band structure comprising both regimes of localized as well as extended states. The localized states show a single center localization behaviour with a characteristic localization length. We derive a continuum analogue of the IPL which allows us to determine analytically its eigenvalue spectrum and eigenstates thereby obtaining an expression for the localization length which involves the ratio of the coupling among the cells of the lattice and the phase gradient across the lattice. This continuum model breaks chiral symmetry but still shows a pairing of partner states with positive and negative energies except for the ground state. We perform a corresponding symmetry analysis which illuminates the continuum models structure as compared to a corresponding chirally symmetric Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>All-optical nonlinear phase modulation in open semiconductor microcavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report a significant advancement in ultra low power light-by-light phase modulation using open semiconductor microcavities in the strong light-matter coupling regime. We achieve cross-phase modulation of up to 247$\pm$17 mrad per particle between laser beams attenuated to single-photon average intensities. This breakthrough extends the potential for quantum information processing and nonlinear quantum optics in strongly coupled light-matter systems, setting a new benchmark in the field without relying on atom-like emitters. Our findings suggest promising new avenues for scalable quantum optical technologies.</description>

      <title>Interaction effects on electronic Floquet spectra: Excitonic effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07428v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Floquet engineering of electronic states by light is a central topic in modern experiments. However, the impact of many-body interactions on the single-electron properties remains unclear in this non-equilibrium situation. We propose that interaction effects could be reasonably understood by performing perturbative expansion in both the pump field and the electron-electron interaction when computing physical quantities. As an example, we apply this approach to semiconductors and show analytically that excitonic effects, i.e., effects of electron-hole interaction, lead to dramatic corrections to the single-electron Floquet spectra even when the excitons are only virtually excited by the pump light. We compute these effects in phosphorene and monolayer MoS$_2$ for time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and ultrafast optical experiments.</description>

      <title>Double rotatory power reversal, continuous Kerr angle, and enhanced reflectance in bi-isotropic media with anomalous Hall current</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15338v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the optical properties of bi-isotropic materials under the anomalous Hall effect (AHE) of axion electrodynamics. Four refractive indices associated with circularly polarized waves are achieved, implying circular birefringence with rotatory power endowed with double sign reversal, an exotic optical signature for chiral dielectrics. The Kerr rotation and ellipticity are analyzed, with an unusual observation of a giant rotation angle deprived of discontinuity. Anomalous enhanced reflectance (R greater than unity) is also reported, associated with negative refraction stemming from the anomalous transport properties. These effects constitute the singular optical signature of a nonequilibrium bi-isotropic medium with the AHE.</description>

      <title>Decoupling thermoelectric coefficients of multilayer graphene by nanomeshing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03436v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nanostructuring materials at small scales enables control over their physical properties, revealing behaviors not observed at larger dimensions. This strategy is particularly effective in two-dimensional (2D) materials, where surface effects dominate, and has been applied in the thermoelectric field. Here, we use multilayer graphene (4-6 nm thick) as a test platform to study the effect of nanomeshing on its thermoelectric properties. The nanomesh consists of a hexagonal array of holes, with a measured diameter and neck-width of ~360 nm and ~160 nm, respectively. The multilayer graphene is integrated into field-effect transistor-like devices supported by hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), allowing simultaneous electric and thermoelectric measurements, with nanomeshing applied to only part of the material. We use modulated thermoreflectance to investigate thermal transport in equivalent nanomeshed and pristine graphene flakes, extracting key parameters that affect thermoelectric performance. The nanomesh geometry suppresses thermal transport without significantly impacting charge transport, highlighting the different scattering lengths of phonons and electrons while enhancing the thermopower response. We observe a twofold improvement in the device power factor, PF = S^2 sigma (with S the Seebeck coefficient and sigma the electrical conductivity), at room temperature, along with a nearly threefold reduction in thermal conductivity k. The results show that nanomeshing can significantly improve the thermoelectric performance of multilayer graphene, paving the way for novel energy conversion strategies using 2D materials.</description>

      <title>Magnetic monopoles with an internal degree of freedom</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13879v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a class of spontaneously broken $SU(2)$ gauge theories with adjoint scalar and look for exact magnetic monopole solutions in the Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield (BPS) limit. We find that some of the resulting solutions exhibit a new internal degree of freedom (a moduli space parameter) that controls the energy density profile of the monopole while keeping the total energy (mass) constant.</description>

      <title>Riemannian Optimization on Tree Tensor Networks with Application in Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21726v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tree tensor networks (TTNs) are widely used in low-rank approximation and quantum many-body simulation. In this work, we present a formal analysis of the differential geometry underlying TTNs. Building on this foundation, we develop efficient first- and second-order optimization algorithms that exploit the intrinsic quotient structure of TTNs. Additionally, we devise a backpropagation algorithm for training TTNs in a kernel learning setting. We validate our methods through numerical experiments on a representative machine learning task.</description>

      <title>Infrared Spectroradiometry of Lithium Benzoate from 21 to 235 THz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11643v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an extensive survey of the thermal radiation properties of lithium benzoate. We heated the sample from 313 to 553 K, just below the melting point, while performing an infrared spectroradiometry with an FT-IR spectrometer from 21 to 235 THz (700-7800 cm$^{-1}$). We have provided a detailed analysis of the infrared spectrum data and a comparison of the absorption spectrum of the same sample. It turned out that the recorded spectra are not only different from ordinary absorption spectra but also carry substantial information about the temperature dependence of the population of vibrationally excited states. We conclude by proposing a hypothesis on the thermal excitation mechanism of vibrational energy levels of molecules consistent with the distinct characteristics of the obtained infrared emission spectra.</description>
