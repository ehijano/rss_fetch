      <title>Brain Tumor Segmentation in Sub-Sahara Africa with Advanced Transformer and ConvNet Methods: Fine-Tuning, Data Mixing and Ensembling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brain tumors are among the deadliest cancers worldwide, with particularly devastating impact in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) where limited access to medical imaging infrastructure and expertise often delays diagnosis and treatment planning. Accurate brain tumor segmentation is crucial for treatment planning, surgical guidance, and monitoring disease progression, yet manual segmentation is time-consuming and subject to inter-observer variability. Recent advances in deep learning, based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformers have demonstrated significant potential in automating this critical task. This study evaluates three state-of-the-art architectures, SwinUNETR-v2, nnUNet, and MedNeXt for automated brain tumor segmentation in multi-parametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans. We trained our models on the BraTS-Africa 2024 and BraTS2021 datasets, and performed validation on the BraTS-Africa 2024 validation set. We observed that training on a mixed dataset (BraTS-Africa 2024 and BraTS2021) did not yield improved performance on the SSA validation set in all tumor regions compared to training solely on SSA data with well-validated methods. Ensembling predictions from different models also lead to notable performance increases. Our best-performing model, a finetuned MedNeXt, achieved an average lesion-wise Dice score of 0.84, with individual scores of 0.81 (enhancing tumor), 0.81 (tumor core), and 0.91 (whole tumor). While further improvements are expected with extended training and larger datasets, these results demonstrate the feasibility of deploying deep learning for reliable tumor segmentation in resource-limited settings. We further highlight the need to improve local data acquisition protocols to support the development of clinically relevant, region-specific AI tools.</description>

      <title>Holistic Bioprocess Development Across Scales Using Multi-Fidelity Batch Bayesian Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bioprocesses are central to modern biotechnology, enabling sustainable production in pharmaceuticals, specialty chemicals, cosmetics, and food. However, developing high-performing processes is costly and complex, requiring iterative, multi-scale experimentation from microtiter plates to pilot reactors. Conventional Design of Experiments (DoE) approaches often struggle to address process scale-up and the joint optimization of reaction conditions and biocatalyst selection.
  We propose a multi-fidelity batch Bayesian optimization framework to accelerate bioprocess development and reduce experimental costs. The method integrates Gaussian Processes tailored for multi-fidelity modeling and mixed-variable optimization, guiding experiment selection across scales and biocatalysts. A custom simulation of a Chinese Hamster Ovary bioprocess, capturing non-linear and coupled scale-up dynamics, is used for benchmarking against multiple simulated industrial DoE baselines. Multiple case studies show how the proposed workflow can achieve a reduction in experimental costs and increased yield.
  This work provides a data-efficient strategy for bioprocess optimization and highlights future opportunities in transfer learning and uncertainty-aware design for sustainable biotechnology.</description>

      <title>Driving Accurate Allergen Prediction with Protein Language Models and Generalization-Focused Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10541v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Allergens, typically proteins capable of triggering adverse immune responses, represent a significant public health challenge. To accurately identify allergen proteins, we introduce Applm (Allergen Prediction with Protein Language Models), a computational framework that leverages the 100-billion parameter xTrimoPGLM protein language model. We show that Applm consistently outperforms seven state-of-the-art methods in a diverse set of tasks that closely resemble difficult real-world scenarios. These include identifying novel allergens that lack similar examples in the training set, differentiating between allergens and non-allergens among homologs with high sequence similarity, and assessing functional consequences of mutations that create few changes to the protein sequences. Our analysis confirms that xTrimoPGLM, originally trained on one trillion tokens to capture general protein sequence characteristics, is crucial for Applm's performance by detecting important differences among protein sequences. In addition to providing Applm as open-source software, we also provide our carefully curated benchmark datasets to facilitate future research.</description>

      <title>A Review of Modern Stochastic Modeling: SDE/SPDE Numerics, Data-Driven Identification, and Generative Methods with Applications in Biology and Epidemiology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This review maps developments in stochastic modeling, highlighting non-standard approaches and their applications to biology and epidemiology. It brings together four strands: (1) core models for systems that evolve with randomness; (2) learning key parts of those models directly from data; (3) methods that can generate realistic synthetic data in continuous time; and (4) numerical techniques that keep simulations stable, accurate, and faithful over long runs. The objective is practical: help researchers quickly see what is new, how the pieces fit together, and where important gaps remain. We summarize tools for estimating changing infection or reaction rates under noisy and incomplete observations, modeling spatial spread, accounting for sudden jumps and heavy tails, and reporting uncertainty in a way that is useful for decisions. We also highlight open problems that deserve near-term attention: separating true dynamics from noise when data are irregular; learning spatial dynamics under random influences with guarantees of stability; aligning training with the numerical method used in applications; preserving positivity and conservation in all simulations; reducing cost while controlling error for large studies; estimating rare but important events; and adopting clear, comparable reporting standards. By organizing the field around these aims, the review offers a concise guide to current methods, their practical use, and the most promising directions for future work in biology and epidemiology.s.</description>

      <title>Dissecting Microbial Community Structure and Heterogeneity via Multivariate Covariate-Adjusted Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11036v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In microbiome studies, it is often of great interest to identify clusters or partitions of microbiome profiles within a study population and to characterize the distinctive attributes of each resulting microbial community. While raw counts or relative compositions are commonly used for such analysis, variations between clusters may be driven or distorted by subject-level covariates, reflecting underlying biological and clinical heterogeneity across individuals. Simultaneously detecting latent communities and identifying covariates that differentiate them can enhance our understanding of the microbiome and its association with health outcomes. To this end, we propose a Dirichlet-multinomial mixture regression (DMMR) model that enables joint clustering of microbiome profiles while accounting for covariates with either homogeneous or heterogeneous effects across clusters. A novel symmetric link function is introduced to facilitate covariate modeling through the compositional parameters. We develop efficient algorithms with convergence guarantees for parameter estimation and establish theoretical properties of the proposed estimators. Extensive simulation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the method in clustering, feature selection, and heterogeneity detection. We illustrate the utility of DMMR through a comprehensive application to upper-airway microbiota data from a pediatric asthma study, uncovering distinct microbial subtypes and their associations with clinical characteristics.</description>

      <title>SHREC: A Framework for Advancing Next-Generation Computational Phenotyping with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16359v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Computational phenotyping is a central informatics activity with resulting cohorts supporting a wide variety of applications. However, it is time-intensive because of manual data review and limited automation. Since LLMs have demonstrated promising capabilities for text classification, comprehension, and generation, we posit they will perform well at repetitive manual review tasks traditionally performed by human experts. To support next-generation computational phenotyping, we developed SHREC, a framework for integrating LLMs into end-to-end phenotyping pipelines. We applied and tested three lightweight LLMs (Gemma2 27 billion, Mistral Small 24 billion, and Phi-4 14 billion) to classify concepts and phenotype patients using phenotypes for ARF respiratory support therapies. All models performed well on concept classification, with the best (Mistral) achieving an AUROC of 0.896. For phenotyping, models demonstrated near-perfect specificity for all phenotypes with the top-performing model (Mistral) achieving an average AUROC of 0.853 for single-therapy phenotypes. In conclusion, lightweight LLMs can assist researchers with resource-intensive phenotyping tasks. Several advantages of LLMs included their ability to adapt to new tasks with prompt engineering alone and their ability to incorporate raw EHR data. Future steps include determining optimal strategies for integrating biomedical data and understanding reasoning errors</description>

      <title>Effective Stimulus Propagation in Neural Circuits: Driver Node Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13615v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Precise control of signal propagation in modular neural networks represents a fundamental challenge in computational neuroscience. We establish a framework for identifying optimal control nodes that maximize stimulus transmission between weakly coupled neural populations. Using spiking stochastic block model networks, we systematically compare driver node selection strategies - including random sampling and topology-based centrality measures (degree, betweenness, closeness, eigenvector, harmonic, and percolation centrality) - to determine minimal control inputs for achieving inter-population synchronization. Targeted stimulation of just 10-20% of the most central neurons in the source population significantly enhances spiking propagation fidelity compared to random selection. This approach yields a 64-fold increase in signal transfer efficiency at critical inter-module connection densities. These findings establish a theoretical foundation for precision neuromodulation in biological neural systems and neurotechnology applications.</description>
