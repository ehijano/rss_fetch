      <title>Beam Profiling and Beamforming Modeling for mmWave NextG Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an experimental study on mmWave beam profiling on a mmWave testbed, and develops a machine learning model for beamforming based on the experiment data. The datasets we have obtained from the beam profiling and the machine learning model for beamforming are valuable for a broad set of network design problems, such as network topology optimization, user equipment association, power allocation, and beam scheduling, in complex and dynamic mmWave networks. We have used two commercial-grade mmWave testbeds with operational frequencies on the 27 Ghz and 71 GHz, respectively, for beam profiling. The obtained datasets were used to train the machine learning model to estimate the received downlink signal power, and data rate at the receivers (user equipment with different geographical locations in the range of a transmitter (base station). The results have shown high prediction accuracy with low mean square error (loss), indicating the model's ability to estimate the received signal power or data rate at each individual receiver covered by a beam. The dataset and the machine learning-based beamforming model can assist researchers in optimizing various network design problems for mmWave networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a secure wire-line telephone prototype that leverages physical layer security (PLS) techniques to protect communications from wiretapping. The system generates artificial noise (AN) in both directions over a telephone line and utilizes a telephone hybrid circuit to achieve effective AN cancellation. We conduct a thorough analysis of the secrecy capacity and evaluate the system's performance through both simulations and practical experiments. The results demonstrate that the proposed scheme significantly enhances communication security while preserving the integrity of legitimate signals, making it a robust and viable solution for secure telephone systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this correspondence, we analyze the performance of a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided communication system that involves a fluid antenna system (FAS)-enabled receiver. By applying the central limit theorem (CLT), we derive approximate expressions for the system outage probability when the RIS has a large number of elements. Also, we adopt the block-correlation channel model to simplify the outage probability expressions, reducing the computational complexity and shedding light on the impact of the number of ports. Numerical results validate the effectiveness of our analysis, especially in scenarios with a large number of RIS elements.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This correspondence investigates the novel fluid antenna system (FAS) technology, combining with reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) for wireless communications, where a base station (BS) communicates with a FAS-enabled user with the assistance of a RIS. To analyze this technology, we derive the outage probability based on the block-diagonal matrix approximation (BDMA) model. With this, we obtain the upper bound, lower bound, and asymptotic approximation of the outage probability to gain more insights. Moreover, we design the phase shift matrix of the RIS in order to minimize the system outage probability. Simulation results confirm the accuracy of our approximations and that the proposed schemes outperform benchmarks significantly.</description>

      <title>Performance Analysis of Photon-Limited Free-Space Optical Communications with Practical Photon-Counting Receivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The non-perfect factors of practical photon-counting receiver are recognized as a significant challenge for long-distance photon-limited free-space optical (FSO) communication systems. This paper presents a comprehensive analytical framework for modeling the statistical properties of time-gated single-photon avalanche diode (TG-SPAD) based photon-counting receivers in presence of dead time, non-photon-number-resolving and afterpulsing effect. Drawing upon the non-Markovian characteristic of afterpulsing effect, we formulate a closed-form approximation for the probability mass function (PMF) of photon counts, when high-order pulse amplitude modulation (PAM) is used. Unlike the photon counts from a perfect photon-counting receiver, which adhere to a Poisson arrival process, the photon counts from a practical TG-SPAD based receiver are instead approximated by a binomial distribution. Additionally, by employing the maximum likelihood (ML) criterion, we derive a refined closed-form formula for determining the threshold in high-order PAM, thereby facilitating the development of an analytical model for the symbol error rate (SER). Utilizing this analytical SER model, the system performance is investigated. The numerical results underscore the crucial need to suppress background radiation below the tolerated threshold and to maintain a sufficient number of gates in order to achieve a target SER.</description>

      <title>Transmissive RIS Enabled Transceiver Systems:Architecture, Design Issues and Opportunities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is anticipated to augment the performance of beyond fifth-generation (B5G) and sixth-generation (6G) networks by intelligently manipulating the state of its components. Rather than employing reflective RIS for aided communications, this paper proposes an innovative transmissive RIS-enabled transceiver (TRTC) architecture that can accomplish the functions of traditional multi-antenna systems in a cost-effective and energy-efficient manner. First, the proposed network architecture and its corresponding transmission scheme are elaborated from the perspectives of downlink (DL) and uplink (UL) transmissions. Then, we illustrate several significant advantages and differences of TRTC compared to other multiantenna systems. Furthermore, the downlink modulation and extraction principle based on time-modulation array (TMA) is introduced in detail to tackle the multi-stream communications. Moreover, a near-far field channel model appropriate for this architecture is proposed. Based on the channel model, we summarize some state-of-the-art channel estimation schemes, and the channel estimation scheme of TRTC is also provided. Considering the optimization for DL and UL communications, we present numerical simulations that confirm the superiority of the proposed optimization algorithm. Lastly, numerous prospective research avenues for TRTC systems are delineated to inspire further exploration.</description>

      <title>Grover Adaptive Search for Maximum Likelihood Detection of Generalized Spatial Modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a quantum-assisted solution for the maximum likelihood detection (MLD) of generalized spatial modulation (GSM) signals. Specifically, the MLD of GSM is first formulated as a novel polynomial optimization problem, followed by the application of a quantum algorithm, namely, the Grover adaptive search. The performance in terms of query complexity of the proposed method is evaluated and compared to the classical alternative via a numerical analysis, which reveals that under fault-tolerant quantum computation, the proposed method outperforms the classical solution if the number of data symbols and the constellation size are relatively large.</description>

      <title>Synesthesia of Machines (SoM)-Enhanced ISAC Precoding for Vehicular Networks with Double Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) technology plays a crucial role in vehicular networks. However, the communication channel within this context exhibits time-varying characteristics, and potential targets may move rapidly, resulting in double dynamics. These presents significant challenges for real-time ISAC precoding design that have not been thoroughly explored. While optimization-based precoding methods have been extensively studied, they are computationally complex and heavily rely on perfect prior information that is rarely available in situations with double dynamics. In this paper, we propose a synesthesia of machine (SoM)-enhanced precoding paradigm, where the base station leverages various modalities such as positioning and channel information to adapt to double dynamics, and effectively utilizes environmental information to stretch ISAC performance boundaries through a deep reinforcement learning framework. Additionally, a parameter-shared actor-critic architecture is tailored to expedite training in complex state and action spaces. Extensive experimental validation has demonstrated the multifaceted superiority of our method over existing approaches.</description>

      <title>A Superdirective Beamforming Approach based on MultiTransUNet-GAN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In traditional multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication systems, the antenna spacing is often no smaller than half a wavelength. However, by exploiting the coupling between more closely-spaced antennas, a superdirective array may achieve a much higher beamforming gain than traditional MIMO. In this paper, we present novel utilization of neural networks in the context of superdirective arrays. Specifically, a new model called MultiTransUNet-GAN is proposed, which aims to forecast the excitation coefficients to achieve ``superdirectivity" or ``super-gain" in the compact uniform linear or planar antenna arrays. In this model, we integrate a multi-level guided attention and a multi-scale skip connection. Furthermore, generative adversarial networks are integrated into our model. To improve the prediction accuracy and convergence speed of our model, we introduce the warm up aided cosine learning rate (LR) schedule during the model training, and the objective function is improved by incorporating the normalized mean squared error (NMSE) between the generated value and the actual value. Simulations demonstrate that the array directivity and array gain achieved by our model exhibit a strong agreement with the theoretical values. Overall, it shows the advantage of enhanced precision over the existing models, and a reduced requirement for measurement and the computation of the excitation coefficients.</description>

      <title>DebriSense: Terahertz-based Integrated Sensing and Communications (ISAC) for Debris Detection and Classification in the Internet of Space (IoS)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proliferation of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite constellations has intensified the challenge of space debris management. This paper introduces DebriSense-THz, a novel Terahertz-Enabled Debris Sensing system for LEO satellites that leverages Integrated Sensing and Communications (ISAC) technology. We present a comprehensive THz channel model for LEO environments, incorporating debris interactions such as reflection, scattering, and diffraction. The DebriSense-THz architecture employs machine learning techniques for debris detection and classification using Channel State Information (CSI) features. Performance evaluation across different frequencies (30 GHz-5 THz), MIMO configurations, debris densities, and SNR levels demonstrates significant improvements in debris detection and classification accuracy (95-99% at 5 THz compared to 62-81% at 30 GHz). Higher SNR configurations enhance sensing performance, particularly at higher frequencies. The system shows robust performance across various debris densities and MIMO size in the THz range, with a noted trade-off between communication reliability and sensing accuracy at lower frequencies. DebriSense-THz represents a significant advance in space situational awareness, paving the way for more effective debris mitigation strategies in increasingly congested LEO environments.</description>

      <title>Learning Multi-Rate Task-Oriented Communications Over Symmetric Discrete Memoryless Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter introduces a multi-rate task-oriented communication (MR-ToC) framework. This framework dynamically adapts to variations in affordable data rate within the communication pipeline. It conceptualizes communication pipelines as symmetric, discrete, memoryless channels. We employ a progressive learning strategy to train the system, comprising a nested codebook for encoding and task inference. This configuration allows for the adjustment of multiple rate levels in response to evolving channel conditions. The results from our experiments show that this system not only supports edge inference across various coding levels but also excels in adapting to variable communication environments.</description>

      <title>Sensing-aided Near-Field Secure Communications with Mobile Eavesdroppers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The additional degree of freedom (DoF) in the distance domain of near-field communication offers new opportunities for physical layer security (PLS) design. However, existing works mainly consider static eavesdroppers, and the related study with mobile eavesdroppers is still in its infancy due to the difficulty in obtaining the channel state information (CSI) of the eavesdropper. To this end, we propose to leverage the sensing capability of integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems to assist PLS design. To comprehensively study the dynamic behaviors of the system, we propose a Pareto optimization framework, where a multi-objective optimization problem (MOOP) is formulated to simultaneously optimize three key performance metrics: power consumption, number of securely served users, and tracking performance, while guaranteeing the achievable rate of the users with a given leakage rate constraint. A globally optimal design based on the generalized Benders decomposition (GBD) method is proposed to achieve the Pareto optimal solutions. To reduce the computational complexity, we further design a low-complexity algorithm based on zero-forcing (ZF) beamforming and successive convex approximation (SCA). Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms and reveal the intrinsic trade-offs between the three performance metrics. It is observed that near-field communication offers a favorable beam diffraction effect for PLS, where the energy of the information signal is nulled around the eavesdropper and focused on the users.</description>

      <title>Diversity and Multiplexing for Continuous Aperture Array (CAPA)-Based Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The performance of multiplexing and diversity achieved by continuous aperture arrays (CAPAs) over fading channels is analyzed. Angular-domain fading models are derived for CAPA-based multiple-input single-output (MISO), single-input multiple-output (SIMO), and multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channels using the Fourier relationship between the spatial response and its angular-domain counterpart. Building on these models, angular-domain transmission frameworks are proposed to facilitate CAPA-based communications, under which the performance of multiplexing and diversity is analyzed. 1) For SIMO and MISO channels, closed-form expressions are derived for the average data rate (ADR) and outage probability (OP). Additionally, asymptotic analyses are performed in the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime to unveil the maximal multiplexing gain and maximal diversity gain. The diversity-multiplexing trade-off (DMT) is also characterized, along with the array gain within the DMT framework. 2) For MIMO channels, high-SNR approximations are derived for the ADR and OP, based on which the DMT and associated array gain are revealed. The performance of CAPAs is further compared with that of conventional spatially discrete arrays (SPDAs) to highlight the superiority of CAPAs. The analytical and numerical results demonstrate that: i) compared to SPDAs, CAPAs achieve a lower OP and higher ADR, resulting in better spectral efficiency; ii) CAPAs achieve the same DMT as SPDAs with half-wavelength antenna spacing while attaining a larger array gain; and iii) CAPAs achieve a better DMT than SPDAs with antenna spacing greater than half a wavelength.</description>

      <title>UAV-Enabled Integrated Sensing and Communication in Maritime Emergency Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With line-of-sight mode deployment and fast response, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), equipped with the cutting-edge integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) technique, is poised to deliver high-quality communication and sensing services in maritime emergency scenarios. In practice, however, the real-time transmission of ISAC signals at the UAV side cannot be realized unless the reliable wireless fronthaul link between the terrestrial base station and UAV are available. This paper proposes a multicarrier-division duplex based joint fronthaul-access scheme, where mutually orthogonal subcarrier sets are leveraged to simultaneously support four types of fronthaul/access transmissions. In order to maximize the end-to-end communication rate while maintaining an adequate sensing quality-of-service (QoS) in such a complex scheme, the UAV trajectory, subcarrier assignment and power allocation are jointly optimized. The overall optimization process is designed in two stages. As the emergency area is usually far away from the coast, the optimal initial operating position for the UAV is first found. Once the UAV passes the initial operating position, the UAV's trajectory and resource allocation are optimized during the mission period to maximize the end-to-end communication rate under the constraint of minimum sensing QoS. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme in dealing with the joint fronthaul-access optimization problem in maritime ISAC networks, offering the advantages over benchmark schemes.</description>

      <title>5G-NR PRACH Detection Performance Optimization in Context of Intra/Inter-Cell Interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ever-evolving landscape of wireless communication technologies has led to the development of 5G-NR (5G New Radio) networks promising higher data rates and lower latency. However, with these advancements come challenges in managing intra-cell and inter-cell interference, particularly during the random-access procedure. This article aims to explore the impact of UE (User Equipment) and cell configuration parameters on interference and establish improved interference management strategies. To assess the effectiveness of these strategies, Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) such as Correct Detection Rate (CDR) will be considered. Additionally, the Matched Filtering (MF)-Based PRACH (Physical Random-Access CHannel) detection algorithm will be studied to evaluate the PRACH performance. The findings underscore the critical role of interference management and the configuration of User Equipment (UE)/Cell parameters in ensuring the robustness and reliability of the NR-PRACH performance in 5G NR networks. Optimizing these configurations can lead to improved network performance and enhanced communication quality.</description>

      <title>An RIS-enabled Time Reversal Scheme for Multipath Near-Field Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time reversal (TR) is a promising technique that exploits multipaths for achieving energy focusing in high-frequency wideband communications. In this letter, we focus on a TR scheme facilitated by a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) which, due to the higher frequency and large array aperture, operates in the near-field region. The proposed scheme enriches the propagation environment for the TR in such weak scattering conditions and does not need channel knowledge for the RIS configuration. Specifically, the RIS is employed to create multiple virtual propagation paths that are required to efficiently apply the TR. We derive a performance bound for the proposed scheme under near-field modeling through the received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and we examine how various system design parameters affect the performance. We observe that a linear RIS topology maximizes the number of resolvable paths. It is also demonstrated that the proposed scheme improves the SNR, while for a large number of elements it can outperform the conventional passive beamforming at the RIS.</description>

      <title>Topological filtering of a signal over a network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph Signal Processing deals with the problem of analyzing and processing signals defined on graphs. In this paper, we introduce a novel filtering method for graph-based signals by employing ideas from topological data analysis. We begin by working with signals over general graphs and then extend our approach to what we term signals over graphs with faces. To construct the filter, we introduce a new structure called the Basin Hierarchy Tree, which encodes the persistent homology. We provide an efficient algorithm and demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through examples with synthetic and real datasets. This work bridges topological data analysis and signal processing, presenting a new application of persistent homology as a topological data processing tool.</description>

      <title>Integrated Sensing, Communication, and Powering over Multi-antenna OFDM Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers a multi-functional orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) system with integrated sensing, communication, and powering (ISCAP), in which a multi-antenna base station (BS) transmits OFDM signals to simultaneously deliver information to multiple information receivers (IRs), provide energy supply to multiple energy receivers (ERs), and sense potential targets based on the echo signals. To facilitate ISCAP, the BS employs the joint transmit beamforming design by sending dedicated sensing/energy beams jointly with information beams. Furthermore, we consider the beam scanning for sensing, in which the joint beams scan in different directions over time to sense potential targets. In order to ensure the sensing beam scanning performance and meet the communication and powering requirements, it is essential to properly schedule IRs and ERs and design the resource allocation over time, frequency, and space. More specifically, we optimize the joint transmit beamforming over multiple OFDM symbols and subcarriers, with the objective of minimizing the average beampattern matching error of beam scanning for sensing, subject to the constraints on the average communication rates at IRs and the average harvested power at ERs. We find converged high-quality solutions to the formulated problem by proposing efficient iterative algorithms based on advanced optimization techniques. We also develop various heuristic designs based on the principles of zero-forcing (ZF) beamforming, round-robin user scheduling, and time switching, respectively. Numerical results show that our proposed algorithms adaptively generate information and sensing/energy beams at each time-frequency slot to match the scheduled IRs/ERs with the desired scanning beam, significantly outperforming the heuristic designs.</description>

      <title>PAPR Reduction based on Deep Learning Autoencoder in Coherent Optical OFDM Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an innovative approach to reducing Peak-to-Average Power Ratio (PAPR) in Coherent Optical Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (CO-OFDM) systems. The proposed deep learning autoencoder-based model eliminates the computational complexity of existing PAPR reduction techniques, such as Selective Mapping (SLM), by leveraging a novel decoder architecture at the receiver. In addition, No side information is needed in our approach, unlike SLM which requires knowledge of the PAPR distribution. Simulation results demonstrate significant improvements in both PAPR reduction and Bit Error Rate (BER) performance compared to traditional techniques. It achieves error-free transmission with over 10 dB PAPR reduction compared to unmitigated and 1 dB gain over SLM technique. Furthermore, our approach exhibits robustness against noise and nonlinearity effects, enabling reliable transmission over optical channels with varying levels of impairment. The proposed technique has far-reaching implications for next-generation optical communication systems, where efficient PAPR reduction is crucial for ensuring reliable data transfer.</description>

      <title>Securing FC-RIS and UAV Empowered Multiuser Communications Against a Randomly Flying Eavesdropper</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates a wireless network consisting of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) base station (BS), a fully-connected reconfigurable intelligent surface (FC-RIS), and multiple users, where the downlink signal can simultaneously be captured by an aerial eavesdropper at a random location. To improve the physical-layer security (PLS) of the considered downlink multiuser communications, we propose the fully-connected reconfigurable intelligent surface aided round-robin scheduling (FCR-RS) and the FC-RIS and ground channel state information (CSI) aided proportional fair scheduling (FCR-GCSI-PFS) schemes. Thereafter, we derive closed-form expressions of the zero secrecy rate probability (ZSRP). Numerical results not only validate the closed-form ZSRP analysis, but also verify that the proposed GCSI-PFS scheme obtains the same performance gain as the full-CSI-aided PFS in FC-RIS-aided communications. Furthermore, optimizing the hovering altitude remarkably enhances the PLS of the FC-RIS and UAV empowered multiuser communications.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Singular Value Decomposition for Extremely Large-scale Antenna Array Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, the problems of decentralized Singular Value Decomposition (d-SVD) and decentralized Principal Component Analysis (d-PCA) are studied, which are fundamental in various signal processing applications. Two scenarios of d-SVD are considered depending on the availability of the data matrix under consideration. In the first scenario, the matrix of interest is row-wisely available in each local node in the network. In the second scenario, the matrix of interest implicitly forms an outer product generated from two different series of measurements. Combining the lightweight local rational function approximation approach and parallel averaging consensus algorithms, two d-SVD algorithms are proposed to cope with the two aforementioned scenarios. We demonstrate the proposed algorithms with two respective application examples for Extremely Large-scale Antenna Array (ELAA) systems: decentralized sensor localization via low-rank matrix completion and decentralized passive radar detection. Moreover, a non-trivial truncation technique, which employs a representative vector that is orthonormal to the principal signal subspace, is proposed to further reduce the associated communication cost with the d-SVD algorithms. Simulation results show that the proposed d-SVD algorithms converge to the centralized solution with reduced communication cost compared to those facilitated with the state-of-the-art decentralized power method.</description>

      <title>CDMA and Non-Uniform Multiplexing: Dynamic Range in MIMO Radar Waveforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a performance comparison of various MIMO radar multiplexing approaches where the increasing number of transmitters adversely affects the dynamic range of the resultant MIMO system. The investigated multiplexing techniques are code-division multiplexing in phase-coded frequency-modulated continuous wave (FMCW) and phase-modulated continuous wave (PMCW) radar. Additionally, random fast/slow time multiplexing in time and frequency is considered for frequency-modulated continuous wave and orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) radars. The comparative analysis is conducted through simulations, evaluating the scalability with the number of transmitters and addressing other pertinent implementation concerns. The findings provide insights into the trade-offs associated with each approach, aiding in selecting suitable MIMO radar multiplexing strategies for practical applications.</description>

      <title>Multi-Beam Object-Localization for Millimeter-Wave ISAC-Aided Connected Autonomous Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Millimeter wave (mmWave) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems capable of integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) constitute a key technology for connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs). In this context, we propose a multi-beam object-localization (MBOL) model for enhancing the sensing beampattern (SBP) gain of adjacent objects in CAV scenarios. Given the ultra-narrow beams of mmWave MIMO systems, a single pencil beam is unsuitable for closely located objects, which tend to require multiple beams. Hence, we formulate the SBP gain maximization problem, considering also the constraints on the signal-to-interference and noise ratio (SINR) of the communication users (CUs), on the transmit power, and the constant modulus of the phase-shifters in the mmWave hybrid transceiver. To solve this non-convex problem, we propose a penalty-based triple alternating optimization algorithm to design the hybrid beamformer. Finally, simulation results are provided for demonstrating the efficacy of the proposed model.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To enhance the field of continuous motor health monitoring, we present FAN-COIL-I, an extensive vibration sensor dataset derived from a Fan Coil motor. This dataset is uniquely positioned to facilitate the detection and prediction of motor health issues, enabling a more efficient maintenance scheduling process that can potentially obviate the need for regular checks. Unlike existing datasets, often created under controlled conditions or through simulations, FAN-COIL-I is compiled from real-world operational data, providing an invaluable resource for authentic motor diagnosis and predictive maintenance research. Gathered using a high-resolution 32KHz sampling rate, the dataset encompasses comprehensive vibration readings from both the forward and rear sides of the Fan Coil motor over a continuous two-week period, offering a rare glimpse into the dynamic operational patterns of these systems in a corporate setting. FAN-COIL-I stands out not only for its real-world applicability but also for its potential to serve as a reliable benchmark for researchers and practitioners seeking to validate their models against genuine engine conditions.</description>

      <title>Cloud-Based Federation Framework and Prototype for Open, Scalable, and Shared Access to NextG and IoT Testbeds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present a new federation framework for UnionLabs, an innovative cloud-based resource-sharing infrastructure designed for next-generation (NextG) and Internet of Things (IoT) over-the-air (OTA) experiments. The framework aims to reduce the federation complexity for testbeds developers by automating tedious backend operations, thereby providing scalable federation and remote access to various wireless testbeds. We first describe the key components of the new federation framework, including the Systems Manager Integration Engine (SMIE), the Automated Script Generator (ASG), and the Database Context Manager (DCM). We then prototype and deploy the new Federation Plane on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) public cloud, demonstrating its effectiveness by federating two wireless testbeds: i) UB NeXT, a 5G-and-beyond (5G+) testbed at the University at Buffalo, and ii) UT IoT, an IoT testbed at the University of Utah. Through this work we aim to initiate a grassroots campaign to democratize access to wireless research testbeds with heterogeneous hardware resources and network environment, and accelerate the establishment of a mature, open experimental ecosystem for the wireless community. The API of the new Federation Plane will be released to the community after internal testing is completed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Digital Twin (DT) technology is expected to play a pivotal role in NextG wireless systems. However, a key challenge remains in the evaluation of data-driven algorithms within DTs, particularly the transfer of learning from simulations to real-world environments. In this work, we investigate the sim-to-real gap in developing a digital twin for the NSF PAWR Platform, POWDER. We first develop a 3D model of the University of Utah campus, incorporating geographical measurements and all rooftop POWDER nodes. We then assess the accuracy of various path loss models used in training modeling and control policies, examining the impact of each model on sim-to-real link performance predictions. Finally, we discuss the lessons learned from model selection and simulation design, offering guidance for the implementation of DT-enabled wireless networks.</description>

      <title>Submodular Maximization Approaches for Equitable Client Selection in Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13683v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a conventional Federated Learning framework, client selection for training typically involves the random sampling of a subset of clients in each iteration. However, this random selection often leads to disparate performance among clients, raising concerns regarding fairness, particularly in applications where equitable outcomes are crucial, such as in medical or financial machine learning tasks. This disparity typically becomes more pronounced with the advent of performance-centric client sampling techniques. This paper introduces two novel methods, namely SUBTRUNC and UNIONFL, designed to address the limitations of random client selection. Both approaches utilize submodular function maximization to achieve more balanced models. By modifying the facility location problem, they aim to mitigate the fairness concerns associated with random selection. SUBTRUNC leverages client loss information to diversify solutions, while UNIONFL relies on historical client selection data to ensure a more equitable performance of the final model. Moreover, these algorithms are accompanied by robust theoretical guarantees regarding convergence under reasonable assumptions. The efficacy of these methods is demonstrated through extensive evaluations across heterogeneous scenarios, revealing significant improvements in fairness as measured by a client dissimilarity metric.</description>

      <title>Decentralised Gradient-based Variational Inference for Multi-sensor Fusion and Tracking in Clutter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13689v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the task of tracking multiple objects in clutter under a distributed multi-sensor network with time-varying connectivity. Designed with the same objective as the centralised variational multi-object tracker, the proposed method achieves optimal decentralised fusion in performance with local processing and communication with only neighboring sensors. A key innovation is the decentralised construction of a locally maximised evidence lower bound, which greatly reduces the information required for communication. Our decentralised natural gradient descent variational multi-object tracker, enhanced with the gradient tracking strategy and natural gradients that adjusts the direction of traditional gradients to the steepest, shows rapid convergence. Our results verify that the proposed method is empirically equivalent to the centralised fusion in tracking accuracy, surpasses suboptimal fusion techniques with comparable costs, and achieves much lower communication overhead than the consensus-based variational multi-object tracker.</description>

      <title>Chirp Group Delay based Onset Detection in Instruments with Fast Attack</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The onset of a musical note is the earliest time at which a note can be reliably detected. Detection of these musical onsets pose challenges in the presence of ornamentation such as vibrato, bending, and if the attack of the note transient is slower. The legacy systems such as spectral difference or flux and complex domain functions suffer from the addition of false positives due to ornamentation posing as viable onsets. We propose that this can be solved by appropriately improving the resolution of the onset strength signal (OSS) and smoothening it to increase true positives and decrease false positives, respectively. An appropriate peak picking algorithm that works well in unison with the OSS generated is also desired. Since onset detection is a low-level process upon which many other tasks are built, computational complexity must also be reduced. We propose an onset detection alogrithm that is a combination of short-time spectral average-based OSS estimation, chirp group delay-based smoothening, and valley-peak distance-based peak picking. This algorithm performs on par with the state-of-the-art, superflux and convolutional neural networks-based onset detection, with an average F1 score of 0.88, across three datasets. Subsets from the IDMT-SMT-Guitar, Guitarset, and Musicnet datasets that fit the scope of the work, are used for evaluation. It is also found that the proposed algorithm is computationally 300\% more efficient than superflux. The positive effects of smoothening an OSS, in determining the onset locations, is established by refining the OSS produced by legacy algorithms, where consistent improvement in onset detection performance is observed. To provide insights into the performance of the proposed algorithms when different ornamentation styles are present in the recording, three levels of results are computed, by selecting different subsets of the IDMT dataset.</description>

      <title>Generalization of Graph Neural Networks is Robust to Model Mismatch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have demonstrated their effectiveness in various tasks supported by their generalization capabilities. However, the current analysis of GNN generalization relies on the assumption that training and testing data are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d). This imposes limitations on the cases where a model mismatch exists when generating testing data. In this paper, we examine GNNs that operate on geometric graphs generated from manifold models, explicitly focusing on scenarios where there is a mismatch between manifold models generating training and testing data. Our analysis reveals the robustness of the GNN generalization in the presence of such model mismatch. This indicates that GNNs trained on graphs generated from a manifold can still generalize well to unseen nodes and graphs generated from a mismatched manifold. We attribute this mismatch to both node feature perturbations and edge perturbations within the generated graph. Our findings indicate that the generalization gap decreases as the number of nodes grows in the training graph while increasing with larger manifold dimension as well as larger mismatch. Importantly, we observe a trade-off between the generalization of GNNs and the capability to discriminate high-frequency components when facing a model mismatch. The most important practical consequence of this analysis is to shed light on the filter design of generalizable GNNs robust to model mismatch. We verify our theoretical findings with experiments on multiple real-world datasets.</description>

      <title>Mini-Slot-Assisted Short Packet URLLC:Differential or Coherent Detection?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14089v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the primary challenges in short packet ultra-reliable and low-latency communications (URLLC) is to achieve reliable channel estimation and data detection while minimizing the impact on latency performance. Given the small packet size in mini-slot-assisted URLLC, relying solely on pilot-based coherent detection is almost impossible to meet the seemingly contradictory requirements of high channel estimation accuracy, high reliability, low training overhead, and low latency. In this paper, we explore differential modulation both in the frequency domain and in the time domain, and propose adopting an adaptive approach that integrates both differential and coherent detection to achieve mini-slot-assisted short packet URLLC, striking a balance among training overhead, system performance, and computational complexity. Specifically, differential (especially in the frequency domain) and coherent detection schemes can be dynamically activated based on application scenarios, channel statistics, information payloads, mini-slot deployment options, and service requirements. Furthermore, we derive the block error rate (BLER) for pilot-based, frequency domain, and time domain differential OFDM using non-asymptotic information-theoretic bounds. Simulation results validate the feasibility and effectiveness of adaptive differential and coherent detection.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Learning and Computing over Space-Ground Integrated Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14116v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Space-ground integrated networks hold great promise for providing global connectivity, particularly in remote areas where large amounts of valuable data are generated by Internet of Things (IoT) devices, but lacking terrestrial communication infrastructure. The massive data is conventionally transferred to the cloud server for centralized artificial intelligence (AI) models training, raising huge communication overhead and privacy concerns. To address this, we propose a hierarchical learning and computing framework, which leverages the lowlatency characteristic of low-earth-orbit (LEO) satellites and the global coverage of geostationary-earth-orbit (GEO) satellites, to provide global aggregation services for locally trained models on ground IoT devices. Due to the time-varying nature of satellite network topology and the energy constraints of LEO satellites, efficiently aggregating the received local models from ground devices on LEO satellites is highly challenging. By leveraging the predictability of inter-satellite connectivity, modeling the space network as a directed graph, we formulate a network energy minimization problem for model aggregation, which turns out to be a Directed Steiner Tree (DST) problem. We propose a topologyaware energy-efficient routing (TAEER) algorithm to solve the DST problem by finding a minimum spanning arborescence on a substitute directed graph. Extensive simulations under realworld space-ground integrated network settings demonstrate that the proposed TAEER algorithm significantly reduces energy consumption and outperforms benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Reduce Computational Complexity for Continuous Wavelet Transform in Acoustic Recognition Using Hop Size</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14302v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the continuous wavelet transform (CWT) has been employed as a spectral feature extractor for acoustic recognition tasks in conjunction with machine learning and deep learning models. However, applying the CWT to each individual audio sample is computationally intensive. This paper proposes an approach that applies the CWT to a subset of samples, spaced according to a specified hop size. Experimental results demonstrate that this method significantly reduces computational costs while maintaining the robust performance of the trained models.</description>

      <title>IQ-aware precoding for atomic MIMO receivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14366v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Leveraging the strong atom-light interaction, Rydberg atomic receivers significantly enhance the sensitivity of electromagnetic signal measurements, outperforming traditional antennas. Existing research primarily focuses on improving the architecture and signal detection algorithms of atomic receivers, while established signal processing schemes at the transmitter end have remained constant. However, these schemes fail to maximize the throughput of atomic receivers due to the nonlinearity of transmission model. To address this issue, we propose to design transmitter precoding in multiple-input multiple-output systems to achieve the capacity of atomic receivers. Initially, we harness a strong reference approximation to convert the nonlinear magnitude-detection model of atomic receivers into a linear real-part detector. Based on this approximation, we prove that the degree of freedom is min{Nr/2,Nt} for a MIMO system comprising an Nr-antenna atomic receiver and an Nt-antenna classic transmitter. To achieve the system capacity, we propose an IQ-aware fully digital precoding method. Unlike traditional complex-valued digital precoders that jointly manipulate the inphase and quadrature (IQ) symbols, our method employs four real matrices to independently precode the IQ baseband symbols, which is shown to be optimal for atomic receivers. Then, to eliminate the reliance on fully digital precoding architecture, we further explore IQ-aware hybrid precoding techniques. Our design incorporates a low-dimensional IQ-aware digital precoder and a high-dimensional complex analog precoder. Alternating minimization algorithms are proposed to produce IQ-aware hybrid precoders, with the objective of approaching the optimal IQ-aware fully digital precoder. Simulation results validate the superiority of proposed IQ-aware precoding methods over existing techniques in atomic MIMO communications.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing physiological signals from fMRI across the adult lifespan</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interactions between the brain and body are of fundamental importance for human behavior and health. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) captures whole-brain activity noninvasively, and modeling how fMRI signals interact with physiological dynamics of the body can provide new insight into brain function and offer potential biomarkers of disease. However, physiological recordings are not always possible to acquire since they require extra equipment and setup, and even when they are, the recorded physiological signals may contain substantial artifacts. To overcome this limitation, machine learning models have been proposed to directly extract features of respiratory and cardiac activity from resting-state fMRI signals. To date, such work has been carried out only in healthy young adults and in a pediatric population, leaving open questions about the efficacy of these approaches on older adults. Here, we propose a novel framework that leverages Transformer-based architectures for reconstructing two key physiological signals - low-frequency respiratory volume (RV) and heart rate (HR) fluctuations - from fMRI data, and test these models on a dataset of individuals aged 36-89 years old. Our framework outperforms previously proposed approaches (attaining median correlations between predicted and measured signals of r ~ .698 for RV and r ~ .618 for HR), indicating the potential of leveraging attention mechanisms to model fMRI-physiological signal relationships. We also evaluate several model training and fine-tuning strategies, and find that incorporating young-adult data during training improves the performance when predicting physiological signals in the aging cohort. Overall, our approach successfully infers key physiological variables directly from fMRI data from individuals across a wide range of the adult lifespan.</description>

      <title>Interpretable and Robust AI in EEG Systems: A Survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.10755v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The close coupling of artificial intelligence (AI) and electroencephalography (EEG) has substantially advanced human-computer interaction (HCI) technologies in the AI era. Different from traditional EEG systems, the interpretability and robustness of AI-based EEG systems are becoming particularly crucial. The interpretability clarifies the inner working mechanisms of AI models and thus can gain the trust of users. The robustness reflects the AI's reliability against attacks and perturbations, which is essential for sensitive and fragile EEG signals. Thus the interpretability and robustness of AI in EEG systems have attracted increasing attention, and their research has achieved great progress recently. However, there is still no survey covering recent advances in this field. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive survey and summarize the interpretable and robust AI techniques for EEG systems. Specifically, we first propose a taxonomy of interpretability by characterizing it into three types: backpropagation, perturbation, and inherently interpretable methods. Then we classify the robustness mechanisms into four classes: noise and artifacts, human variability, data acquisition instability, and adversarial attacks. Finally, we identify several critical and unresolved challenges for interpretable and robust AI in EEG systems and further discuss their future directions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.09505v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: State estimation of dynamical systems from noisy observations is a fundamental task in many applications. It is commonly addressed using the linear Kalman filter (KF), whose performance can significantly degrade in the presence of outliers in the observations, due to the sensitivity of its convex quadratic objective function. To mitigate such behavior, outlier detection algorithms can be applied. In this work, we propose a parameter-free algorithm which mitigates the harmful effect of outliers while requiring only a short iterative process of the standard update step of the KF. To that end, we model each potential outlier as a normal process with unknown variance and apply online estimation through either expectation maximization or alternating maximization algorithms. Simulations and field experiment evaluations demonstrate competitive performance of our method, showcasing its robustness to outliers in filtering scenarios compared to alternative algorithms.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning-Enabled Text Semantic Communication under Interference: An Empirical Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.19974v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: At the confluence of 6G, deep learning (DL), and natural language processing (NLP), DL-enabled text semantic communication (SemCom) has emerged as a 6G enabler since it minimizes bandwidth consumption, transmission delay, and power usage. Among existing text SemCom techniques, a popular text SemCom scheme -- that can reliably transmit semantic information in the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regimes -- is DeepSC, whose fundamental asymptotic performance limits under radio frequency interference (RFI) were accurately predicted by our recently developed theory [1]. Although our theory was corroborated by simulations, trained deep networks can defy classical statistical wisdom, calling for extensive computer experiments. This empirical work thus follows using the training, validation, and testing sets tokenized and vectorized from the Proceedings of the European Parliament (Europarl) dataset. Specifically, we train the DeepSC architecture in Keras 2.9 with TensorFlow 2.9 as a backend and test it under Gaussian multi-interferer RFI received over Rayleigh fading channels. Our testing results corroborate that DeepSC produces semantically irrelevant sentences under huge Gaussian RFI emitters, validating our theory. Therefore, a fundamental 6G design paradigm for interference-resistant and robust SemCom (IR$^2$ SemCom) is needed.</description>

      <title>Block-Sparse Tensor Recovery</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.02410v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work explores the fundamental problem of the recoverability of a sparse tensor being reconstructed from its compressed embodiment. We present a generalized model of block-sparse tensor recovery as a theoretical foundation, where concepts measuring holistic mutual incoherence property (MIP) of the measurement matrix set are defined. A representative algorithm based on the orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) framework, called tensor generalized block OMP (T-GBOMP), is applied to the theoretical framework elaborated for analyzing both noiseless and noisy recovery conditions. Specifically, we present the exact recovery condition (ERC) and sufficient conditions for establishing it with consideration of different degrees of restriction. Reliable reconstruction conditions, in terms of the residual convergence, the estimated error and the signal-to-noise ratio bound, are established to reveal the computable theoretical interpretability based on the newly defined MIP, which we introduce. The flexibility of tensor recovery is highlighted, i.e., the reliable recovery can be guaranteed by optimizing MIP of the measurement matrix set. Analytical comparisons demonstrate that the theoretical results developed are tighter and less restrictive than the existing ones (if any). Further discussions provide tensor extensions for several classic greedy algorithms, indicating that the sophisticated results derived are universal and applicable to all these tensorized variants.</description>

      <title>Bistatic Doppler Frequency Estimation with Asynchronous Moving Devices for Integrated Sensing and Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14490v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this letter, we present for the first time a method to estimate the bistatic Doppler frequency of a target with clock asynchronous and mobile Integrated Sensing And Communication (ISAC) devices. Existing approaches have separately tackled the presence of phase offsets due to clock asynchrony or the additional Doppler shift due to device movement. However, in real ISAC scenarios, these two sources of phase nuisance are concurrently present, making the estimation of the target's Doppler frequency particularly challenging. Our method solves the problem using the sole wireless signal at the receiver, exploiting the invariance of phase offsets across multipath components and the bistatic geometry in an original way. The proposed method is validated via simulation, exploring the impact of different system parameters. Numerical results show that our approach is a viable way of estimating Doppler frequency in bistatic asynchronous ISAC scenarios with mobile devices.</description>

      <title>A Close Examination of the Multipath Propagation Stochastic Model for Communications over Power Lines</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18129v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper focuses on the parameterization of the multipath propagation model (MPM) for indoor broadband power line communications (PLC), which up to now has been established in an heuristic way. The MPM model was originally proposed for outdoor channels in the band up to 20 MHz, but its number of parameters becomes extremely large when used to model indoor channel frequency responses (CFR), which are much more frequency-selective than outdoor ones, and the band is extended to 80 MHz. This work proposes a fitting procedure that addresses this problem. It allows determining the model parameters that yield the best fit to each channel of a large database of single-input single-output (SISO) experimental measurements acquired in typical home premises of different European countries. Then, the properties of the MPM parameters are analyzed. The study unveils the relation between the model parameters and the main characteristics of the actual CFR like the frequency selectivity and the average attenuation. It also estimates the probability density function (PDF) of each parameter and proposes a fitting distribution for each of them. Moreover, the relationship among the main parameters of the model is also explored. Provided results can be helpful for the development of MPM-based models for indoor broadband PLC.</description>

      <title>Analytic Models for the Capacity Distribution in MDG-impaired Optical SDM Transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12487v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In coupled space-division multiplexing (SDM) transmission systems, imperfections in optical amplifiers and passive devices introduce mode-dependent loss (MDL) and gain (MDG). These effects render the channel capacity stochastic and result in a decrease in average capacity. Several previous studies employ multi-section simulations to model the capacity of these systems. Additionally, relevant works derive analytically the capacity distribution for a single-mode system with polarization-dependent gain and loss (mode count D = 2). However, to the best of our knowledge, analytic expressions of the capacity distribution for systems with D &gt; 2 have not been presented. In this paper, we provide analytic expressions for the capacity of optical systems with arbitrary mode counts. The expressions rely on Gaussian approximations for the per-mode capacity distributions and for the overall capacity distribution, as well as on fitting parameters for the capacity cross-correlation among different modes. Compared to simulations, the derived analytical expressions exhibit a suitable level of accuracy across a wide range of practical scenarios.</description>

      <title>A manifold learning-based CSI feedback framework for FDD massive MIMO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.14598v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Massive multi-input multi-output (MIMO) in Frequency Division Duplex (FDD) mode suffers from heavy feedback overhead for Channel State Information (CSI). In this paper, a novel manifold learning-based CSI feedback framework (MLCF) is proposed to reduce the feedback and improve the spectral efficiency for FDD massive MIMO. Manifold learning (ML) is an effective method for dimensionality reduction. However, most ML algorithms focus only on data compression, and lack the corresponding recovery methods. Moreover, the computational complexity is high when dealing with incremental data. Considering to utilize the intrinsic manifold structure where the CSI samples reside, we propose a landmark selection algorithm to describe the topological skeleton of this manifold. Based on the learned skeleton, the local patch of the incremental CSI on the manifold can be easily determined by its nearest landmarks. This motivates us to propose an incremental CSI compression and reconstruction scheme by keeping the local geometric relationships with landmarks invariant. We theoretically prove the convergence of the proposed landmark selection algorithm. Meanwhile, the upper bound on the error of approximating CSI with landmarks is derived. Simulation results under an industrial channel model of 3GPP demonstrate that the proposed MLCF outperforms existing deep learning based algorithms.</description>

      <title>Compositional nonlinear audio signal processing with Volterra series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.07229v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a compositional theory of nonlinear audio signal processing based on a categorification of the Volterra series. We begin by augmenting the classical definition of the Volterra series so that it is functorial with respect to a base category whose objects are temperate distributions and whose morphisms are certain linear transformations. This motivates the derivation of formulae describing how the outcomes of nonlinear transformations are affected if their input signals are linearly processed--e.g., translated, modulated, sampled, or periodized. We then consider how nonlinear systems, themselves, change, and introduce as a model thereof the notion of morphism of Volterra series, which we exhibit as both a type of lens map and natural transformation. We show how morphisms can be parameterized and used to generate indexed families of Volterra series, which are well-suited to model nonstationary or time-varying nonlinear phenomena. We then describe how Volterra series and their morphisms organize into a category, which we call Volt. We exhibit the operations of sum, product, and series composition of Volterra series as monoidal products on Volt, and identify, for each in turn, its corresponding universal property. In particular, we show that the series composition of Volterra series is associative. We then bridge between our framework and the subject at the heart of audio signal processing: time-frequency analysis. Specifically, we show that a known equivalence, between a class of second-order Volterra series and the bilinear time-frequency distributions, can be extended to one between certain higher-order Volterra series and the so-called polynomial TFDs. We end by outlining potential avenues for future work, including the incorporation of system identification techniques and the potential extension of our theory to the settings of graph and topological audio signal processing.</description>

      <title>Mutual Information Optimization for SIM-Based Holographic MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18307v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the context of emerging stacked intelligent metasurface (SIM)-based holographic MIMO (HMIMO) systems, a fundamental problem is to study the mutual information (MI) between transmitted and received signals to establish their capacity. However, direct optimization or analytical evaluation of the MI, particularly for discrete signaling, is often intractable. To address this challenge, we adopt the channel cutoff rate (CR) as an alternative optimization metric for the MI maximization. In this regard, we propose an alternating projected gradient method (APGM), which optimizes the CR of a SIM-based HMIMO system by adjusting signal precoding and the phase shifts across the transmit and receive SIMs on a layer-by-layer basis. Simulation results indicate that the proposed algorithm significantly enhances the CR, achieving substantial gains, compared to the case with random SIM phase shifts, that are proportional to those observed for the corresponding MI. This justifies the effectiveness of using the channel CR for the MI optimization. Moreover, we demonstrate that the integration of digital precoding, even on a modest scale, has a significant impact on the ultimate performance of SIM-aided systems.</description>

      <title>Robust Continuous-Time Beam Tracking with Liquid Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00365v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Millimeter-wave (mmWave) technology is increasingly recognized as a pivotal technology of the sixth-generation communication networks due to the large amounts of available spectrum at high frequencies. However, the huge overhead associated with beam training imposes a significant challenge in mmWave communications, particularly in urban environments with high background noise. To reduce this high overhead, we propose a novel solution for robust continuous-time beam tracking with liquid neural network, which dynamically adjust the narrow mmWave beams to ensure real-time beam alignment with mobile users. Through extensive simulations, we validate the effectiveness of our proposed method and demonstrate its superiority over existing state-of-the-art deep-learning-based approaches. Specifically, our scheme achieves at most 46.9% higher normalized spectral efficiency than the baselines when the user is moving at 5 m/s, demonstrating the potential of liquid neural networks to enhance mmWave mobile communication performance.</description>

      <title>Coherent amplitude modulation in a laser gas sensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00351v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The article is devoted to a current topic in science and technology -determining the type and concentration of gas using a laser. At close values of green laser radiation intensity and bias voltage, interference patterns of the time series of the photodiode output signal were obtained. The degree of coherence (more than ~0.1) made it possible to distinguish between the types of gases and their concentrations. Signal coherence was controlled by Allan deviation values.The novelty of the research method is the choice of the harmonic of the electrical network asthe main modulation frequency. It is shown that the correlation functions and the corresponding power spectra are sensitive to low-frequency fluctuations of molecules and their clumps. This allows the results and methods of this work to be used in specific cases instead of large-sized and expensive complexes of optical instruments at room pressure and temperature.</description>

      <title>Predictability of Performance in Communication Networks Under Markovian Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13196v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the emergence of time-critical applications in modern communication networks, there is a growing demand for proactive network adaptation and quality of service (QoS) prediction. However, a fundamental question remains largely unexplored: how can we quantify and achieve more predictable communication systems in terms of performance? To address this gap, this paper introduces a theoretical framework for defining and analyzing predictability in communication systems, with a focus on the impact of observations for performance forecasting. We establish a mathematical definition of predictability based on the total variation distance between forecast and marginal performance distributions. A system is deemed unpredictable when the forecast distribution, providing the most comprehensive characterization of future states using all accessible information, is indistinguishable from the marginal distribution, which depicts the system's behavior without any observational input. This framework is applied to multi-hop systems under Markovian conditions, with a detailed analysis of Geo/Geo/1 queuing models in both single-hop and multi-hop scenarios. We derive exact and approximate expressions for predictability in these systems, as well as upper bounds based on spectral analysis of the underlying Markov chains. Our results have implications for the design of efficient monitoring and prediction mechanisms in future communication networks aiming to provide deterministic services.</description>
