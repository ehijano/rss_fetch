      <title>Gate-tunable sign reversal of dissipationless spin-diode effect reaching 100%</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The superconducting version of a diode effect has been the subject of extensive research in the last few years. So far, the focus has almost exclusively been on charge transport, but a natural question is if it is possible to obtain a dissipationless diode effect for spin transport. Here, we demonstrate that it is possible to generate an electrically tunable spin-diode effect with ideal efficiency by using superconductor/ferromagnet multilayers: the system completely forbids spin transport in one direction whereas it transport spins with zero energy loss in the other direction. We identify two mechanisms generating this phenomenon. This result provides a way to integrate the superconducting diode effect with spin-polarized currents.</description>

      <title>Absence of "fractional ac Josephson effect" in superconducting junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a microscopic theory of ac Josephson effect in superconducting junctions described by an arbitrary scattering matrix that may include magnetic effects. In the limit of constant in time bias voltage $V$ applied to the junction we derive a formally exact current-phase relation (CPR) that is manifestly $2\pi$-periodic in the Josephson phase $\varphi$ in full accordance with general principles. This our result unambiguously argues against the idea of the so-called "fractional ac Josephson effect" admitting $4\pi$-periodic in $\varphi$ CPR. We also demonstrate that at any non-zero $V$ quantum dynamics of Andreev bound states becomes non-Hermitian which signals their instability, thus making any 'quasi-equilibrium' description of ac Josephson effect unreliable. We specifically address the limit of highly transparent junctions with magnetic scattering where -- along with super- and excess current terms -- at small $V$ we also recover a non-trivial $2\pi$-periodic dissipative current with the amplitude $\propto |V|^{1/3}$</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic relations for the Cooper pair's momentum in helical superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two thermodynamic relations are proposed for the exact measurement of the center-of-mass (COM) momentum of the Cooper pairs in helical superconductors. The first relation concerns the constraint on the change in the COM momentum in response to the variation in the magnetic field, which is linked to the superconducting Edelstein effect. The second relation is related to a first-order phase transition, showing that the jump of the COM momentum can be measured from the slope of the transition line on the phase diagram, where the supercurrent is used as a control parameter. These relations solve the difficulty of detecting the momentum, enabling broader and more precise exploration of noncentrosymmetric superconductors.</description>

      <title>Numerical analysis of Josephson junction arrays for multi-order quantum voltage steps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamics of overdamped Josephson junctions under varying microwave-driving conditions have been studied through numerical simulations using the resistively-shunted junction (RSJ) model. The aim is to determine the optimal junction characteristics and external microwave (rf) parameters that maximize the width of quantum voltage levels (Shapiro steps) from order n = 0 to n &gt; 1. Both the rf and dc power requirements, along with the junction parameter spread and power attenuation, are analyzed as key factors that need to be optimized for improved performance of the quantum device. This work aims to advance the development of next-generation Programmable Josephson Voltage Standards with logic architectures that surpass the conventional binary and ternary codifications used in present quantum voltage arrays, while significantly reducing the overall number of junctions as well as the number of sub-arrays and bias lines.</description>

      <title>Meissner effect in non-Hermitian superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study theoretically Meissner effect in non-Hermitian systems of BCS type via superfluid stiffness. We show that depending on the values of the mean fields, chemical potential, and temperature, we obtain paramagnetic or diamagnetic Meissner effect. Notably, positive real part of the product of mean fields guarantees diamagnetic Meissner effect in an $s$-wave 3D non-Hermitian superconductor. Once the mean fields are close to being anti-Hermitian, 2D $s$-, $p_x$-, and $d$-wave superconductors exhibit interesting behaviour, including paramagnetic Meissner effect for certain parameters.</description>

      <title>Signature of Superconductivity in Pressurized Trilayer-nickelate Pr$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10-\delta}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ under pressure has drawn extensive attention. Herein, we report systematic investigations on the evolutions of structure, magnetism, and electrical resistance of Pr$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10-\delta}$ polycrystalline samples under various pressures. Pr$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10-\delta}$ exhibits density wave transitions on Ni and Pr sublattices at about 158 K and 4.3 K, respectively, and the density wave can be progressively suppressed by pressure. A structural transformation from the monoclinic $P2_1/a$ space group to the tetragonal $I4/mmm$ occurs at around 20 GPa. An apparent drop in resistance with evident magnetic field dependence is observed as pressure above 20 GPa, indicating the emergence of superconductivity in Pr$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10-\delta}$ polycrystalline samples. The discovery of the signature of superconductivity in Pr$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10-\delta}$ broadens the family of nickelate superconductors and provides a new platform for investigating the mechanisms of superconductivity in the Ruddlesden-Popper phases of nickelates.</description>

      <title>Effect of impurities and disorder on the braiding dynamics of Majorana zero modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Impurities and random disorder are known to affect topological superconducting phases and their Majorana zero modes (MZMs). In particular, it is a common assumption that disorder negatively influences the braiding dynamics of MZMs. Recently, it was shown, however, that random disorder can also stabilize or even increase topological phases. Here, we investigate quantitatively how a single impurity can lead to braiding errors. We show that the impurity increases, in most scenarios, the dynamical hybridization of the MZMs, reducing the braiding performance. In addition, we show how random disorder, i.e., impurities on all lattice sites but with different strengths, affects braiding. As for the static case, we observe a window of opportunity where random disorder decreases the average energy of a braid, and thus improves braiding outcomes. This window of opportunity is, however, limited due to an increase of diabatic effects in the presence of disorder. Nevertheless and contrary to physical intuition, disorder can in certain situations be beneficial and improve braiding outcomes.</description>

      <title>Floquet engineering of effective pairing interactions in a doped band insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07653v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the pairing state in a doped band insulator under a periodic driving field. We employ a correlated fermionic model on a honeycomb lattice, in which a pairing glue is obtainable via repulsive interactions, and derive an effective model under circularly polarized light. We demonstrate that the effective pairing interaction for doped fermions obtained by the second-order perturbation theory is tunable by the frequency and amplitude of the driving field. We find the optimal frequency range to enhance the pairing interaction and show that the modified effective system can strengthen the two-body bound state. Our study suggests that external driving light can reinforce superconducting pair states in strongly correlated electron systems.</description>

      <title>Superconducting-insulating phase transition in pressurized Ba$_{1-x}$K$_x$BiO$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.08406v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the first observation of a pressure-induced transition from a superconducting (SC) to an insulating (I) phase in single-crystal Ba$_{1-x}$K$_x$BiO$_3$ ($x$ = 0.4, 0.43, 0.52, and 0.58) superconductors. X-ray diffraction measurements conducted at 20 K reveal a direct relationship between this SC-I transition and a pressure-induced distortion of crystal structure. With increasing pressure, the lattice parameters a and c of the ambient-pressure superconducting tetragonal (T) phase are compressed continuously below a critical pressure (Pc1), wherein the pressure (P) dependence of superconducting transition temperature (Tc) displays a small variation. However, upon further compression, the lattice of the compressed T phase displays an anisotropic change, and Tc shows a monotonous decrease. When the pressure reaches Pc2 (Pc2 &gt; Pc1), the compressed T phase collapses along the c axis, followed by the disappearance of superconductivity and the appearance of the insulating phase. This SC-I transition is fully reversible, with the critical pressure increasing alongside K doping concentration. These findings are strikingly similar to the SC-I transition observed in hole-doped high-Tc cuprate superconductors under pressure. Identifying their commonalities could deepen our understanding of the mechanisms that underlie high- Tc superconductivity in these two oxide superconductors with a perovskite structure.</description>

      <title>Tuning topological superconductivity within the $t$-$J$-$U$ model of twisted bilayer cuprates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.04379v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We carry out a theoretical study of unconventional superconductivity in twisted bilayer cuprates (TBC) as a function of electron density and layer twist angle. The bilayer $t$-$J$-$U$ model is employed and analyzed within the framework of a generalized variational wave function approach in the statistically-consistent Gutzwiller formulation. The constructed phase diagram encompasses both gapless $d$-wave state (reflecting the pairing symmetry of untwisted copper-oxides) and gapped $d+\mathrm{e}^{i\varphi}d$ phase that breaks spontaneously time-reversal-symmetry (TRS) and is characterized by nontrivial Chern number. We find that $d+\mathrm{e}^{i\varphi}d$ state occupies a non-convex butterfly-shaped region in the doping vs. twist-angle plane, and demonstrate the presence of previously unreported reentrant TRS-breaking phase on the underdoped side of the phase diagram. This circumstance supports the emergence of topological superconductivity for fine-tuned twist angles in TBC away from $45^\circ$. Our analysis of the microscopically derived Landau free energy functional points toward sensitivity of the superconducting order parameter to small perturbations close to the topological state boundary.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.17315v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: What factors fundamentally determine the value of superconducting transition temperature (Tc) in high temperature superconductors has been the subject of intense debate. Following the establishment of an empirical law known as Homes'law, there is a growing consensus in the community that the Tc value of the cuprate superconductors is closely linked to its superfluid density and conductivity. However, all the data supporting this empirical law have been obtained from the ambient-pressure superconductors. In this study, we present the first high-pressure results about the connection of these two quantities with Tc, through the studies on the Bi1.74Pb0.38Sr1.88CuO6+delta and Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+delta, in which the value of their high-pressure resistivity (the reciprocal of conductivity) is achieved by adopting our newly established method, while the value of superfluid density is extracted using the Homes'law. We highlight that the Tc values are strongly linked the two joint response factors of magnetic field and electric field, i.e. superfluid density and conductivity, respectively, implying that the physics governing the determination of Tc is influenced by the intrinsic electromagnetic fields of the system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06272v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The observance of vortex and anti-vortex effects in bulk crystals can prove the existence of phase-disordered superconductivity in the bulk. To gain insights into the mechanisms that govern superconducting transition in copper oxide high-transition temperature ($T_c$) superconductors, this study investigated the transport properties of underdoped Bi$_2$Sr$_2$Ca$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{10+\delta}$ (Bi-2223) bulk single crystals.The $I$-$V$ characteristics results and the typical tailing behavior owing to the temperature dependence of in-plane resistivity ($\rho_{ab}$) were consistent with the Kosterlitz-Thouless (KT) transition characteristics. Thus, with increasing temperature, copper oxide high-$T_c$ superconductors transitioned to their normal state owing to destruction of their phase correlations, although a finite Cooper pair density was prevalent at $T_c$. Further, magnetization measurements were performed to determine the temperature dependence of the irreversible magnetic field $B_{irr}$. Consequently, the mechanism governing the KT transition-like superconducting transition in this bulk system was elucidated. These results support the extreme strong-coupling models for high-$T_c$ superconductivity in cuprates.</description>

      <title>Driving a Josephson Traveling Wave Parametric Amplifier into chaos: effects of a non-sinusoidal current-phase relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01185v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we develop a comprehensive numerical analysis of the dynamic response of a Josephson Traveling Wave Parametric Amplifier (JTWPA) by varying the driving parameters, with a focus on the pathways leading to chaotic behavior. By tuning the working conditions, we capture the broad spectrum of dynamical regimes accessible to JTWPAs, delineating the settings under which transition to chaos occurs. Furthermore, we extend our investigation to device formed by junctions characterized by a non--sinusoidal current phase relation (CPR) and exploring the impact of its shape on the amplifier's performance. Through the study of gain characteristics, Poincar\'e sections, and Fourier spectra, we provide an in-depth understanding of how non-linearity and CPR nonsinusoidality influence the JTWPAs' operational effectiveness and stability. This investigation offers insights into optimizing the device designs for enhanced performance and robustness against chaotic disruptions, in order to establish a framework for predicting and controlling JTWPA behavior in practical applications. This effort will pave the way for the development of devices with tailored dynamic responses and for advancements in quantum computing and precision measurement technologies, where stability and high fidelity are of paramount importance.</description>

      <title>Incommensurate magnetic order: A fingerprint for electronic correlations in hole-doped cuprates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11628v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Intertwined charge and magnetic fluctuations in high-$T_\text{c}$ copper oxide superconductors (cuprates) are hypothesized to be a consequence of their correlated electronic nature. Among other observables, this is apparent in the doping dependence of incommensurate magnetic order, known as the Yamada relation (YR). We analyze the Hubbard model to challenge the universality of YR as a function of interaction strength $U$ through Kotliar-Ruckenstein slave-boson (SB) mean-field theory and truncated unity functional renormalization group (TUFRG). While TUFRG tends to lock in to a doping dependence of the incommensurate magnetic ordering vector obtained for the perturbative weak-coupling limit, SB not only exhibits an enhanced sensitivity upon a variation of $U$ from weak to strong coupling, but also shows good agreement with experimental data. It supports the placement of weakly hole-doped cuprates in the intermediate-to-strong coupling regime.</description>

      <title>Method for reconstructing the self-energy from the spectral function</title>

Abstract: A fundamental question about the nature of quantum materials such as High-T$_c$ systems remain open to date -- it is unclear whether they are (some variety of) Fermi liquids, or (some variety of) non Fermi liquids. A direct avenue to determine their nature is to study the (imaginary part of the) self-energy at low energies. Here we present a novel method to extract this low $\omega$ self-energy from experimentally derived spectral functions. The method seems suited for implementation with high quality angle resolved photoemission data. It is based on a helpful Theorem proposed here, which assures us that the method has minimal (or vanishing) error at the lowest energies. We provide numerical examples showing that a few popular model systems yield distinguishably different low energy self-energies.</description>

      <title>Quantum many-body solver using artificial neural networks and its applications to strongly correlated electron systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02633</link>

Abstract: With the evolution of numerical methods, we are now aiming at not only qualitative understanding but also quantitative prediction and design of quantum many-body phenomena. As a novel numerical approach, machine learning techniques have been introduced in 2017 to analyze quantum many-body problems. Since then, proposed various novel approaches have opened a new era, in which challenging and fundamental problems in physics can be solved by machine learning methods. Especially, quantitative and accurate estimates of material-dependent physical properties of strongly correlated matter have now become realized by combining first-principles calculations with highly accurate quantum many-body solvers developed with the help of machine learning methods. Thus developed quantitative description of electron correlations will constitute a key element of materials science in the next generation.</description>
