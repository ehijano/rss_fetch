      <title>The complete $10$-tetrahedra census of orientable cusped hyperbolic $3$-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the complete census of orientable cusped hyperbolic $3$-manifolds to $10$ tetrahedra, giving the next $150730$ manifolds and their $496638$ minimal ideal triangulations. As applications, we find the precisely $439898$ exceptional Dehn fillings on them, revealing the next $1849$ simplest hyperbolic knot exteriors in $S^3$. We also give the simplest example of an orientable cusped hyperbolic $3$-manifold containing a closed totally geodesic surface.</description>

      <title>On Topology of Three-dimensional Continua with Singular Points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose to model the topology of three-dimensional (3D) continua by Yin sets, regular open semianalytic sets with bounded boundary. Our model differs from manifold-based models in that singular points of a 3D continuum, i.e., boundary points where the tangent plane is not uniquely defined, are treated not as anomalies but as a central subject of our theoretical investigation. We characterize the local and global topology of Yin sets. Then we give a unique boundary representation of Yin sets based on the notion of a glued surface, a quotient space of an orientable compact 2-manifold along a one-dimensional CW complex. Our results apply to 3D continua with arbitrarily complex topology and may be useful in a number of scientific and engineering applications such as solid modeling, computer-aided design, and numerical simulations of multiphase flows with topological changes.</description>

      <title>Stability of knot equivalence at low regularity, and symmetric critical knots for the M\"obius energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present sufficient criteria for the equivalence of tame knots at low regularity. To this end, we introduce a localized version of Gromov's distortion for any closed path-connected subset of $\R^n$. If two such sets have local Gromov distortion below a universal dimension-dependent constant $g_n$ at some scale, and if their Hausdorff-distance is less than one quarter of that scale, we can show that the fundamental groups of their complements are isomorphic. In addition, we construct this isomorphism so that it restricts to the corresponding peripheral subgroups as an isomorphism as well.
  Applied to the images of one-dimensional knots it follows that two knots are equivalent if their Hausdorff-distance is bounded in terms of the scale under which their local Gromov distortion is controlled. From that we deduce novel stability results for knot equivalence in the Lipschitz category, and in the setting of fractional Sobolev regularity below $C^1$. Moreover, we prove a compactness theorem of knot equivalence classes with respect to weak $W^{3/2,2}$-convergence.
  As an application we show that the M\"obius energy introduced by O'Hara~\cite{ohara_1991a} can be minimized within arbitrary prime knot classes under a symmetry constraint, and that these minimizers are in fact critical points and therefore smooth and even real analytic. In particular, in every torus knot class there are at least two distinct critical knots for the M\"obius energy.</description>

      <title>On hyperbolic links associated to Eulerian cycles on ideal right-angled hyperbolic $3$-polytopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider Eulerian cycles without transversal selfintersections in $4$-valent planar graphs. We prove that any cycle of this type in the graph of an ideal right-angled hyperbolic $3$-polytope corresponds to a hyperbolic link such that its complement consists of $4$-copies of this polytope glued according to its checkerboard coloring. Moreover, this link consists of trivially embedded circles bijectively corresponding to the vertices of the polytope. For such cycles we prove that the $3$-antiprism $A(3)$ (octahedron) has exactly $2$ combinatorially different cycles, the $4$-antiprism $A(4)$ has exactly $7$ combinatorially different cycles, and these cycles correspond to $7$ cycles (perhaps combinatorially equivalent) on any polytope different from antiprisms, and any antiprism $A(k)$ has at least $2$ combinatorially different cycles. The $2$-fold branched covering space corresponding to our link is a small cover over some simple $3$-polytope. This small cover is defined by a Hamiltonian cycle on it. We show that any compact hyperbolic $3$-polytope with a Hamiltonian cycle arises in this way.</description>

      <title>A dimer view on Fox's trapezoidal conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02314v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fox's conjecture (1962) states that the sequence of absolute values of the coefficients of the Alexander polynomial of alternating links is trapezoidal. While the conjecture remains open in general, a number of special cases have been settled, some, quite recently: Fox's conjecture was shown to hold for special alternating links by Hafner, M\'esz\'aros, and Vidinas (2023) and for certain diagrammatic Murasugi sums of special alternating links by Azarpendar, Juh\'asz, and K\'alm\'an (2024). Any alternating link can be written as a diagrammatic Murasugi sums of special alternating links; thus, if one could remove the certain adjective in the previous result, it would settle Fox's conjecture. In this paper, we give an alternative proof of Azarpendar, Juh\'asz, and K\'alm\'an's aforementioned result via a dimer model for the Alexander polynomial. In doing so, we not only obtain a significantly shorter proof of Azarpendar, Juh\'asz, and K\'alm\'an's result than the original, but we also obtain several theorems of independent interest regarding the Alexander polynomial, which are readily visible from the dimer point of view. Moreover, we explain, backed with computational evidence, why our result is only for certain diagrammatic Murasugi sums of special alternating links as opposed to all. While the latter does not settle an open question, it strikes us as important to bring to attention, given the interest in finding a solution to Fox's conjecture.</description>

      <title>Embeddings of edge-colored dual graphs of balanced 3- and 4-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06133v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article focuses on a class of properly edge-colored graphs, which arise from topological combinatorics, and investigates their embeddings onto surfaces. Specifically, these graphs are known as the dual graphs of balanced normal pseudomanifolds. We introduce the concept of the balanced genus, which represents the smallest genus of a surface onto which the dual graph of a normal pseudomanifold can embed regularly.
  As a key result, we establish that for any 3-manifold $ M $ that is not a sphere, the balanced genus satisfies the lower bound $ \mathcal{G}_M \geq m+3 $, where $ m $ is the rank of its fundamental group of $M$. Furthermore, we prove that a 3-manifold $ M $ is homeomorphic to the 3-sphere if and only if its balanced genus $ \mathcal{G}_M $ is at most 3. Similarly, for 4-manifolds, we establish that if $ M $ is not homeomorphic to a sphere, then its balanced genus is bounded below by $ \mathcal{G}_M \geq 2\chi(M) + 5m + 11 $. Moreover, a 4-manifold $ M $ is PL homeomorphic to the 4-sphere if and only if its balanced genus satisfies $ \mathcal{G}_M \leq 2\chi(M) + 10 $.
  We believe that the balanced genus offers a new perspective in graph theory and combinatorics and will inspire further developments in the field in connection with algebraic combinatorics. To this end, we outline several directions for future research.</description>

      <title>The Wiegold problem and free products of left-orderable groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26073v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A group has normal rank (or weight) greater than one if no single element normally generates the group. The Wiegold problem from 1976 asks about the existence of a finitely generated perfect group of normal rank greater than one. We show that any free product of nontrivial left-orderable groups has normal rank greater than one. This solves the Wiegold problem by taking free products of finitely generated perfect left-orderable groups, a plethora of which are known to exist. We obtain our estimate of normal rank by a topological argument, proving a type of spectral gap property for an unsigned version of stable commutator length. A key ingredient in the proof is an intricate new construction of a family of left-orders on free products of two left-orderable groups.</description>

      <title>A construction of surface skein TQFTs and their extension to 4-dimensional 2-handlebodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19352v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a commutative Frobenius algebra $A$, we construct a $(2,3,3+\varepsilon)$-dimensional TQFT $\mathsf{AFK}_A$ that assigns to a 3-manifold a skein module of embedded $A$-decorated surfaces. These surface skein modules have been first defined by Asaeda--Frohman and Kaiser using skein relations that generalize the combinatorics of Bar-Natan's dotted cobordisms. For 3-manifolds with boundary, we show that surface skein modules carry an action by a certain surface skein category associated with the boundary, which yields a gluing formalism. Our main result concerns a partial extension of $\mathsf{AFK}_A$ to dimension 4, which uses an inductive state-sum construction following Walker. As an example, the equivariant version of Lee's deformation of dotted cobordisms yields a TQFT that extends to 4-dimensional 2-handlebodies but not 3-handlebodies. Finally, we characterize the attachment of 4-dimensional 2-handles by means of a certain Kirby color and use it to compute the invariants of 4-dimensional 2-handlebodies in examples.</description>
