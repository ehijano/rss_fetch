      <title>Non-Canonical Crosslinks Confound Evolutionary Protein Structure Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evolution-based protein structure prediction models have achieved breakthrough success in recent years. However, they struggle to generalize beyond evolutionary priors and on sequences lacking rich homologous data. Here we present a novel, out-of-domain benchmark based on sactipeptides, a rare class of ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides (RiPPs) characterized by sulfur-to-$\alpha$-carbon thioether bridges creating cross-links between cysteine residues and backbone. We evaluate recent models on predicting conformations compatible with these cross-links bridges for the 10 known sactipeptides with elucidated post-translational modifications. Crucially, the structures of 5 of them have not yet been experimentally resolved. This makes the task a challenging problem for evolution-based models, which we find exhibit limited performance (0.0% to 19.2% GDT-TS on sulfur-to-$\alpha$-carbon distance). Our results point at the need for physics-informed models to sustain progress in biomolecular structure prediction.</description>

      <title>An Energy-Adaptive Elastic Equivariant Transformer Framework for Protein Structure Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16996v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Structure-informed protein representation learning is essential for effective protein function annotation and \textit{de novo} design. However, the presence of inherent noise in both crystal and AlphaFold-predicted structures poses significant challenges for existing methods in learning robust protein representations. To address these issues, we propose a novel equivariant Transformer-State Space Model(SSM) hybrid framework, termed $E^3$former, designed for efficient protein representation. Our approach uses energy function-based receptive fields to construct proximity graphs and incorporates an equivariant high-tensor-elastic selective SSM within the transformer architecture. These components enable the model to adapt to complex atom interactions and extract geometric features with higher signal-to-noise ratios. Empirical results demonstrate that our model outperforms existing methods in structure-intensive tasks, such as inverse folding and binding site prediction, particularly when using predicted structures, owing to its enhanced tolerance to data deviation and noise. Our approach offers a novel perspective for conducting biological function research and drug discovery using noisy protein structure data.</description>

      <title>RiboFlow: Conditional De Novo RNA Sequence-Structure Co-Design via Synergistic Flow Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17007v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ribonucleic acid (RNA) binds to molecules to achieve specific biological functions. While generative models are advancing biomolecule design, existing methods for designing RNA that target specific ligands face limitations in capturing RNA's conformational flexibility, ensuring structural validity, and overcoming data scarcity. To address these challenges, we introduce RiboFlow, a synergistic flow matching model to co-design RNA structures and sequences based on target molecules. By integrating RNA backbone frames, torsion angles, and sequence features in an unified architecture, RiboFlow explicitly models RNA's dynamic conformations while enforcing sequence-structure consistency to improve validity. Additionally, we curate RiboBind, a large-scale dataset of RNA-molecule interactions, to resolve the scarcity of high-quality structural data. Extensive experiments reveal that RiboFlow not only outperforms state-of-the-art RNA design methods by a large margin but also showcases controllable capabilities for achieving high binding affinity to target ligands. Our work bridges critical gaps in controllable RNA design, offering a framework for structure-aware, data-efficient generation.</description>

      <title>FlowDock: Geometric Flow Matching for Generative Protein-Ligand Docking and Affinity Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10966v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Powerful generative AI models of protein-ligand structure have recently been proposed, but few of these methods support both flexible protein-ligand docking and affinity estimation. Of those that do, none can directly model multiple binding ligands concurrently or have been rigorously benchmarked on pharmacologically relevant drug targets, hindering their widespread adoption in drug discovery efforts. In this work, we propose FlowDock, the first deep geometric generative model based on conditional flow matching that learns to directly map unbound (apo) structures to their bound (holo) counterparts for an arbitrary number of binding ligands. Furthermore, FlowDock provides predicted structural confidence scores and binding affinity values with each of its generated protein-ligand complex structures, enabling fast virtual screening of new (multi-ligand) drug targets. For the well-known PoseBusters Benchmark dataset, FlowDock outperforms single-sequence AlphaFold 3 with a 51% blind docking success rate using unbound (apo) protein input structures and without any information derived from multiple sequence alignments, and for the challenging new DockGen-E dataset, FlowDock outperforms single-sequence AlphaFold 3 and matches single-sequence Chai-1 for binding pocket generalization. Additionally, in the ligand category of the 16th community-wide Critical Assessment of Techniques for Structure Prediction (CASP16), FlowDock ranked among the top-5 methods for pharmacological binding affinity estimation across 140 protein-ligand complexes, demonstrating the efficacy of its learned representations in virtual screening. Source code, data, and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/BioinfoMachineLearning/FlowDock.</description>
