      <title>Preserving Information: How does Topological Data Analysis improve Neural Network performance?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) require significant amounts of data and computational resources to achieve high effectiveness in performing the tasks for which they are trained. To reduce resource demands, various techniques, such as Neuron Pruning, are applied. Due to the complex structure of ANNs, interpreting the behavior of hidden layers and the features they recognize in the data is challenging. A lack of comprehensive understanding of which information is utilized during inference can lead to inefficient use of available data, thereby lowering the overall performance of the models. In this paper, we introduce a method for integrating Topological Data Analysis (TDA) with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) in the context of image recognition. This method significantly enhances the performance of neural networks by leveraging a broader range of information present in the data, enabling the model to make more informed and accurate predictions. Our approach, further referred to as Vector Stitching, involves combining raw image data with additional topological information derived through TDA methods. This approach enables the neural network to train on an enriched dataset, incorporating topological features that might otherwise remain unexploited or not captured by the network's inherent mechanisms. The results of our experiments highlight the potential of incorporating results of additional data analysis into the network's inference process, resulting in enhanced performance in pattern recognition tasks in digital images, particularly when using limited datasets. This work contributes to the development of methods for integrating TDA with deep learning and explores how concepts from Information Theory can explain the performance of such hybrid methods in practical implementation environments.</description>

      <title>EQNN: Enhanced Quantum Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17726v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the maturation of quantum computing technology, research has gradually shifted towards exploring its applications. Alongside the rise of artificial intelligence, various machine learning methods have been developed into quantum circuits and algorithms. Among them, Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs) can map inputs to quantum circuits through Feature Maps (FMs) and adjust parameter values via variational models, making them applicable in regression and classification tasks. However, designing a FM that is suitable for a given application problem is a significant challenge. In light of this, this study proposes an Enhanced Quantum Neural Network (EQNN), which includes an Enhanced Feature Map (EFM) designed in this research. This EFM effectively maps input variables to a value range more suitable for quantum computing, serving as the input to the variational model to improve accuracy. In the experimental environment, this study uses mobile data usage prediction as a case study, recommending appropriate rate plans based on users' mobile data usage. The proposed EQNN is compared with current mainstream QNNs, and experimental results show that the EQNN achieves higher accuracy with fewer quantum logic gates and converges to the optimal solution faster under different optimization algorithms.</description>

      <title>An Improved Dung Beetle Optimizer for Random Forest Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17738v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To improve the convergence speed and optimization accuracy of the Dung Beetle Optimizer (DBO), this paper proposes an improved algorithm based on circle mapping and longitudinal-horizontal crossover strategy (CICRDBO). First, the Circle method is used to map the initial population to increase diversity. Second, the longitudinal-horizontal crossover strategy is applied to enhance the global search ability by ensuring the position updates of the dung beetle. Simulations were conducted on 10 benchmark test functions, and the results demonstrate that the improved algorithm performs well in both convergence speed and optimization accuracy. The improved algorithm is further applied to the hyperparameter selection of the Random Forest classification algorithm for binary classification prediction in the retail industry. Various combination comparisons prove the practicality of the improved algorithm, followed by SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis.</description>

      <title>STAR: Synthesis of Tailored Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17800v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Iterative improvement of model architectures is fundamental to deep learning: Transformers first enabled scaling, and recent advances in model hybridization have pushed the quality-efficiency frontier. However, optimizing architectures remains challenging and expensive. Current automated or manual approaches fall short, largely due to limited progress in the design of search spaces and due to the simplicity of resulting patterns and heuristics. In this work, we propose a new approach for the synthesis of tailored architectures (STAR). Our approach combines a novel search space based on the theory of linear input-varying systems, supporting a hierarchical numerical encoding into architecture genomes. STAR genomes are automatically refined and recombined with gradient-free, evolutionary algorithms to optimize for multiple model quality and efficiency metrics. Using STAR, we optimize large populations of new architectures, leveraging diverse computational units and interconnection patterns, improving over highly-optimized Transformers and striped hybrid models on the frontier of quality, parameter size, and inference cache for autoregressive language modeling.</description>

      <title>A Novel Pareto-optimal Ranking Method for Comparing Multi-objective Optimization Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17999v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As the interest in multi- and many-objective optimization algorithms grows, the performance comparison of these algorithms becomes increasingly important. A large number of performance indicators for multi-objective optimization algorithms have been introduced, each of which evaluates these algorithms based on a certain aspect. Therefore, assessing the quality of multi-objective results using multiple indicators is essential to guarantee that the evaluation considers all quality perspectives. This paper proposes a novel multi-metric comparison method to rank the performance of multi-/ many-objective optimization algorithms based on a set of performance indicators. We utilize the Pareto optimality concept (i.e., non-dominated sorting algorithm) to create the rank levels of algorithms by simultaneously considering multiple performance indicators as criteria/objectives. As a result, four different techniques are proposed to rank algorithms based on their contribution at each Pareto level. This method allows researchers to utilize a set of existing/newly developed performance metrics to adequately assess/rank multi-/many-objective algorithms. The proposed methods are scalable and can accommodate in its comprehensive scheme any newly introduced metric. The method was applied to rank 10 competing algorithms in the 2018 CEC competition solving 15 many-objective test problems. The Pareto-optimal ranking was conducted based on 10 well-known multi-objective performance indicators and the results were compared to the final ranks reported by the competition, which were based on the inverted generational distance (IGD) and hypervolume indicator (HV) measures. The techniques suggested in this paper have broad applications in science and engineering, particularly in areas where multiple metrics are used for comparisons. Examples include machine learning and data mining.</description>

      <title>NeoHebbian Synapses to Accelerate Online Training of Neuromorphic Hardware</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neuromorphic systems that employ advanced synaptic learning rules, such as the three-factor learning rule, require synaptic devices of increased complexity. Herein, a novel neoHebbian artificial synapse utilizing ReRAM devices has been proposed and experimentally validated to meet this demand. This synapse features two distinct state variables: a neuron coupling weight and an "eligibility trace" that dictates synaptic weight updates. The coupling weight is encoded in the ReRAM conductance, while the "eligibility trace" is encoded in the local temperature of the ReRAM and is modulated by applying voltage pulses to a physically co-located resistive heating element. The utility of the proposed synapse has been investigated using two representative tasks: first, temporal signal classification using Recurrent Spiking Neural Networks (RSNNs) employing the e-prop algorithm, and second, Reinforcement Learning (RL) for path planning tasks in feedforward networks using a modified version of the same learning rule. System-level simulations, accounting for various device and system-level non-idealities, confirm that these synapses offer a robust solution for the fast, compact, and energy-efficient implementation of advanced learning rules in neuromorphic hardware.</description>

      <title>STOP: Spatiotemporal Orthogonal Propagation for Weight-Threshold-Leakage Synergistic Training of Deep Spiking Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11082v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The prevailing of artificial intelligence-of-things calls for higher energy-efficient edge computing paradigms, such as neuromorphic agents leveraging brain-inspired spiking neural network (SNN) models based on spatiotemporally sparse binary spikes. However, the lack of efficient and high-accuracy deep SNN learning algorithms prevents them from practical edge deployments at a strictly bounded cost. In this paper, we propose the spatiotemporal orthogonal propagation (STOP) algorithm to tackle this challenge. Our algorithm enables fully synergistic learning of synaptic weights as well as firing thresholds and leakage factors in spiking neurons to improve SNN accuracy, in a unified temporally-forward trace-based framework to mitigate the huge memory requirement for storing neural states across all time-steps in the forward pass. Characteristically, the spatially-backward neuronal errors and temporally-forward traces propagate orthogonally to and independently of each other, substantially reducing computational complexity. Our STOP algorithm obtained high recognition accuracies of 94.84%, 74.92%, 98.26% and 77.10% on the CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, DVS-Gesture and DVS-CIFAR10 datasets with adequate deep convolutional SNNs of VGG-11 or ResNet-18 structures. Compared with other deep SNN training algorithms, our method is more plausible for edge intelligent scenarios where resources are limited but high-accuracy in-situ learning is desired.</description>

      <title>BlackDAN: A Black-Box Multi-Objective Approach for Effective and Contextual Jailbreaking of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09804v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable capabilities across various tasks, they encounter potential security risks such as jailbreak attacks, which exploit vulnerabilities to bypass security measures and generate harmful outputs. Existing jailbreak strategies mainly focus on maximizing attack success rate (ASR), frequently neglecting other critical factors, including the relevance of the jailbreak response to the query and the level of stealthiness. This narrow focus on single objectives can result in ineffective attacks that either lack contextual relevance or are easily recognizable. In this work, we introduce BlackDAN, an innovative black-box attack framework with multi-objective optimization, aiming to generate high-quality prompts that effectively facilitate jailbreaking while maintaining contextual relevance and minimizing detectability. BlackDAN leverages Multiobjective Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs), specifically the NSGA-II algorithm, to optimize jailbreaks across multiple objectives including ASR, stealthiness, and semantic relevance. By integrating mechanisms like mutation, crossover, and Pareto-dominance, BlackDAN provides a transparent and interpretable process for generating jailbreaks. Furthermore, the framework allows customization based on user preferences, enabling the selection of prompts that balance harmfulness, relevance, and other factors. Experimental results demonstrate that BlackDAN outperforms traditional single-objective methods, yielding higher success rates and improved robustness across various LLMs and multimodal LLMs, while ensuring jailbreak responses are both relevant and less detectable.</description>

      <title>Agent Skill Acquisition for Large Language Models via CycleQD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14735v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Training large language models to acquire specific skills remains a challenging endeavor. Conventional training approaches often struggle with data distribution imbalances and inadequacies in objective functions that do not align well with task-specific performance. To address these challenges, we introduce CycleQD, a novel approach that leverages the Quality Diversity framework through a cyclic adaptation of the algorithm, along with a model merging based crossover and an SVD-based mutation. In CycleQD, each task's performance metric is alternated as the quality measure while the others serve as the behavioral characteristics. This cyclic focus on individual tasks allows for concentrated effort on one task at a time, eliminating the need for data ratio tuning and simplifying the design of the objective function. Empirical results from AgentBench indicate that applying CycleQD to LLAMA3-8B-INSTRUCT based models not only enables them to surpass traditional fine-tuning methods in coding, operating systems, and database tasks, but also achieves performance on par with GPT-3.5-TURBO, which potentially contains much more parameters, across these domains. Crucially, this enhanced performance is achieved while retaining robust language capabilities, as evidenced by its performance on widely adopted language benchmark tasks. We highlight the key design choices in CycleQD, detailing how these contribute to its effectiveness. Furthermore, our method is general and can be applied to image segmentation models, highlighting its applicability across different domains.</description>

      <title>Identifying the impact of local connectivity patterns on dynamics in excitatory-inhibitory networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06802v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Networks of excitatory and inhibitory (EI) neurons form a canonical circuit in the brain. Seminal theoretical results on dynamics of such networks are based on the assumption that synaptic strengths depend on the type of neurons they connect, but are otherwise statistically independent. Recent synaptic physiology datasets however highlight the prominence of specific connectivity patterns that go well beyond what is expected from independent connections. While decades of influential research have demonstrated the strong role of the basic EI cell type structure, to which extent additional connectivity features influence dynamics remains to be fully determined. Here we examine the effects of pairwise connectivity motifs on the linear dynamics in EI networks using an analytical framework that approximates the connectivity in terms of low-rank structures. This low-rank approximation is based on a mathematical derivation of the dominant eigenvalues of the connectivity matrix and predicts the impact on responses to external inputs of connectivity motifs and their interactions with cell-type structure. Our results reveal that a particular pattern of connectivity, chain motifs, have a much stronger impact on dominant eigenmodes than other pairwise motifs. An overrepresentation of chain motifs induces a strong positive eigenvalue in inhibition-dominated networks and generates a potential instability that requires revisiting the classical excitation-inhibition balance criteria. Examining effects of external inputs, we show that chain motifs can on their own induce paradoxical responses where an increased input to inhibitory neurons leads to a decrease in their activity due to the recurrent feedback. These findings have direct implications for the interpretation of experiments in which responses to optogenetic perturbations are measured and used to infer the dynamical regime of cortical circuits.</description>
