      <title>A Formal Approach to AMM Fee Mechanisms with Lean 4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decentralized Finance (DeFi) has revolutionized financial markets by enabling complex asset-exchange protocols without trusted intermediaries. Automated Market Makers (AMMs) are a central component of DeFi, providing the core functionality of swapping assets of different types at algorithmically computed exchange rates. Several mainstream AMM implementations are based on the constant-product model, which ensures that swaps preserve the product of the token reserves in the AMM -- up to a \emph{trading fee} used to incentivize liquidity provision. Trading fees substantially complicate the economic properties of AMMs, and for this reason some AMM models abstract them away in order to simplify the analysis. However, trading fees have a non-trivial impact on users' trading strategies, making it crucial to develop refined AMM models that precisely account for their effects. We extend a foundational model of AMMs by introducing a new parameter, the trading fee $\phi\in(0,1]$, into the swap rate function. Fee amounts increase inversely proportional to $\phi$. When $\phi = 1$, no fee is applied and the original model is recovered. We analyze the resulting fee-adjusted model from an economic perspective. We show that several key properties of the swap rate function, including output-boundedness and monotonicity, are preserved. At the same time, other properties - most notably additivity - no longer hold. We precisely characterize this deviation by deriving a generalized form of additivity that captures the effect of swaps in the presence of trading fees. We prove that when $\phi &lt; 1$, executing a single large swap yields strictly greater profit than splitting the trade into smaller ones. Finally, we derive a closed-form solution to the arbitrage problem in the presence of trading fees and prove its uniqueness. All results are formalized and machine-checked in the Lean 4 proof assistant.</description>

      <title>Short-Rate-Dependent Volatility Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We price European options in a class of models in which the volatility of the underlying risky asset depends on the short rate of interest. Our study results in an explicit pricing formula that depends on knowledge of a characteristic function. We provide examples of models in which the characteristic function can be computed analytically and, thus, the value of European options is explicit. Numerical implementation to produce the implied volatility is also presented.</description>

      <title>Non-standard analysis for coherent risk estimation: hyperfinite representations, discrete Kusuoka formulae, and plug-in asymptotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a non-standard analysis framework for coherent risk measures and their finite-sample analogues, coherent risk estimators, building on recent work of Aichele, Cialenco, Jelito, and Pitera. Coherent risk measures on $L^\infty$ are realised as standard parts of internal support functionals on Loeb probability spaces, and coherent risk estimators arise as finite-grid restrictions.
  Our main results are: (i) a hyperfinite robust representation theorem that yields, as finite shadows, the robust representation results for coherent risk estimators; (ii) a discrete Kusuoka representation for law-invariant coherent risk estimators as suprema of mixtures of discrete expected shortfalls on $\{k/n:k=1,\ldots,n\}$; (iii) uniform almost sure consistency (with an explicit rate) for canonical spectral plug-in estimators over Lipschitz spectral classes; (iv) a Kusuoka-type plug-in consistency theorem under tightness and uniform estimation assumptions; (v) bootstrap validity for spectral plug-in estimators via an NSA reformulation of the functional delta method (under standard smoothness assumptions on $F_X$); and (vi) asymptotic normality obtained through a hyperfinite central limit theorem.
  The hyperfinite viewpoint provides a transparent probability-to-statistics dictionary: applying a risk measure to a law corresponds to evaluating an internal functional on a hyperfinite empirical measure and taking the standard part. We include a standardd self-contained introduction to the required non-standard tools.</description>

      <title>A Methodology to Measure Impacts of Scenarios Through Expected Credit Losses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a methodology for measuring the impact of scenarios on the expected losses of exposures by leveraging the existing provisioning infrastructure within financial institutions, where scenario effects are captured through changes in probabilities of default. We then describe how to design and implement a scenario test where risk drivers are given for standardized groupings of exposures, and the groupings are defined based on common features of the exposures. The methodology presented served as a theoretical foundation for the standardized climate scenario exercise conducted in 2024 by the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions of Canada and Quebec's Autorite des Marches Financiers.</description>

      <title>A unified theory of order flow, market impact, and volatility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23172v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a microstructural model for the order flow in financial markets that distinguishes between {\it core orders} and {\it reaction flow}, both modeled as Hawkes processes. This model has a natural scaling limit that reconciles a number of salient empirical properties: persistent signed order flow, rough trading volume and volatility, and power-law market impact. In our framework, all these quantities are pinned down by a single statistic $H_0$, which measures the persistence of the core flow. Specifically, the signed flow converges to the sum of a fractional process with Hurst index $H_0$ and a martingale, while the limiting traded volume is a rough process with Hurst index $H_0-1/2$. No-arbitrage constraints imply that volatility is rough, with Hurst parameter $2H_0-3/2$, and that the price impact of trades follows a power law with exponent $2-2H_0$. The analysis of signed order flow data yields an estimate $H_0 \approx 3/4$. This is not only consistent with the square-root law of market impact, but also turns out to match estimates for the roughness of traded volumes and volatilities remarkably well.</description>
