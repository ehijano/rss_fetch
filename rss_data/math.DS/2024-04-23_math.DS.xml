      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathbb{C}_K$ be a complete and algebraic closed non-archimedean field with residual characteristic $2$. In this paper we prove that there exist $a,b\in\mathbb{C}_K$ such that the rational function $R(z)=\frac{z^2-z}{bz-\frac{1}{a}}$ has wandering components in its Fatou set.</description>

      <title>Inverse limit method for generalized Bratteli diagrams and invariant measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generalized Bratteli diagrams with a countable set of vertices in every level are models for aperiodic Borel automorphisms. This paper is devoted to the description of all ergodic probability tail invariant measures on the path spaces of generalized Bratteli diagrams. Such measures can be identified with inverse limits of infinite-dimensional simplices associated with levels in generalized Bratteli diagrams. Though this method is general, we apply it to several classes of reducible generalized Bratteli diagrams. In particular, we explicitly describe all ergodic tail invariant probability measures for (i) the infinite Pascal graph and give the formulas for the values of such measures on cylinder sets, (ii) generalized Bratteli diagrams formed by a countable set of odometers, (iii) reducible generalized Bratteli diagrams with uncountable set of ergodic tail invariant probability measures. We also consider the method of measure extension by tail invariance from subdiagrams. We discuss the properties of the Vershik map defined on reducible generalized Bratteli diagrams.</description>

      <title>FMint: Bridging Human Designed and Data Pretrained Models for Differential Equation Foundation Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14688v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Human-designed algorithms have long been fundamental in solving a variety of scientific and engineering challenges. Recently, data-driven deep learning methods have also risen to prominence, offering innovative solutions across numerous scientific fields. While traditional algorithms excel in capturing the core aspects of specific problems, they often lack the flexibility needed for varying problem conditions due to the absence of specific data. Conversely, while data-driven approaches utilize vast datasets, they frequently fall short in domain-specific knowledge. To bridge these gaps, we introduce \textbf{FMint} (Foundation Model based on Initialization), a generative pre-trained model that synergizes the precision of human-designed algorithms with the adaptability of data-driven methods. This model is specifically engineered for high-accuracy simulation of dynamical systems. Starting from initial trajectories provided by conventional methods, FMint quickly delivers highly accurate solutions. It incorporates in-context learning and has been pre-trained on a diverse corpus of 500,000 dynamical systems, showcasing exceptional generalization across a broad spectrum of real-world applications. By effectively combining algorithmic rigor with data-driven flexibility, FMint sets the stage for the next generation of scientific foundation models, tackling complex problems with both efficiency and high accuracy.</description>

      <title>Invariant sample measures and sample statistical solutions for nonautonomous stochastic lattice Cahn-Hilliard equation with nonlinear noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14798v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a stochastic lattice Cahn-Hilliard equation with nonautonomous nonlinear noise. First, we prove the existence of pullback random attractors in $\ell^2$ for the generated nonautonomous random dynamical system. Then, we construct the time-dependent invariant sample Borel probability measures based on the pullback random attractor. Moreover, we develop a general stochastic Liouville type equation for nonautonomous random dynamical systems and show that the invariant sample measures obtained satisfy the stochastic Liouville type equation. At last, we define a new kind of statistical solution -- sample statistical solution corresponding to the invariant sample measures and show that each family of invariant sample measures is a sample statistical solution.</description>

      <title>Localized Multi-Dimensional Patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14987v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Localized patterns are coherent structures embedded in a quiescent state and occur in both discrete and continuous media across a wide range of applications. While it is well-understood how domain covering patterns (for example stripes and hexagons) emerge from a pattern-forming/Turing instability, analyzing the emergence of their localized counterparts remains a significant challenge. There has been considerable progress in studying localized patterns over the past few decades, often by employing innovative mathematical tools and techniques. In particular, the study of localized pattern formation has benefited greatly from numerical techniques; the continuing advancement in computational power has helped to both identify new types patterns and further our understanding of their behavior. We review recent advances regarding the complex behavior of localized patterns and the mathematical tools that have been developed to understand them, covering various topics from spatial dynamics, exponential asymptotics, and numerical methods. We observe that the mathematical understanding of localized patterns decreases as the spatial dimension increases, thus providing significant open problems that will form the basis for future investigations.</description>

      <title>Ideals of \'etale groupoid algebras with coefficients in a sheaf with applications to topological dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15139v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove the Effros-Hahn conjecture for groupoid algebras with coefficients in a sheaf, obtaining as a consequence a description of the ideals in skew inverse semigroup rings. We also use the description of the ideals to characterize when the groupoid algebras with coefficients in a sheaf are von Neumann regular, primitive, semiprimitive, or simple. We apply our results to the topological dynamics of actions of inverse semigroups, describing the existence of dense orbits and minimality in terms of primitivity and simplicity, respectively, of the associated algebra. Moreover, we apply our results to the usual complex groupoid algebra of continuous functions with compact support, used to build the C*-algebra associated with a groupoid, and describe criteria for its simplicity.</description>

      <title>On the Stabilisation of Rational Surface Maps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2110.00095v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dynamics of a rational surface map $f : X \dashrightarrow X$ are easier to analyse when $f$ is `algebraically stable'. Here we investigate when and how this condition can be achieved by conjugating $f$ with a birational change of coordinates. We show that if this can be done with a birational morphism, then there is a minimal such conjugacy. For birational $f$ we also show that repeatedly lifting $f$ to its graph gives a stable conjugacy. Finally, we give an example in which $f$ can be birationally conjugated to a stable map, but the conjugacy cannot be achieved solely by blowing up.
  La dynamique d'une application rationnelle $f : X \dashrightarrow X$ sur une surface est plus simple \`a analyser lorsque $f$ est `alg\'ebriquement stable'. Dans cet article nous \'etudions comment la stabilit\'e peut \^etre r\'ealis\'ee en conjuguant $f$ par un changement de variable birationnel. Nous montrons que si cela peut \^etre r\'ealis\'ee avec une morphisme birationnelle, il existe une telle conjugaison minimale. Pour $f$ birationnelle, nous montrons aussi que l'on obtient une conjugaison stable par rel\'evement successif au graphe. Nous donnons enfin un exemple dans lequel $f$ peut \^etre conjugu\'ee birationnellement \`a une application stable, mais la conjugu\'ee ne peut pas \^etre obtenue uniquement par \'eclatement.</description>

Abstract: We study the the asymptotic dynamics of elementary cellular automaton 18 through its limit set, generic limit set and $\mu$-limit set. The dynamics of rule 18 are characterized by persistent local patterns known as kinks. We characterize the configurations of the generic limit set containing at most two kinks. As a corollary, we show that the three limit sets of rule 18 are distinct.</description>

      <title>On the equivalence of model-based and data-driven approaches to the design of unknown-input observers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.00673v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate a data-driven approach to the design of an unknown-input observer (UIO). Specifically, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of an unknown-input observer for a discrete-time linear time-invariant (LTI) system, designed based only on some available data, obtained on a finite time window. We also prove that, under weak assumptions on the collected data, the solvability conditions derived by means of the data-driven approach are in fact equivalent to those obtained through the model-based one. In other words, the data-driven conditions do not impose further constraints with respect to the classic model-based ones, expressed in terms of the original system matrices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17387v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct an explicit algebraic example of a subshift of finite type over a group $\Gamma$ with an invariant Markov measure which has completely positive sofic entropy (with respect to `most' sofic approximations) and yet does not have a direct Bernoulli factor, because its model spaces shatter into exponentially many clusters of sub-exponential size. The example and its analysis are related to random low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes.</description>

      <title>The topological structure of isolated points in the space of $\mathbb{Z}^d$-shifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17119v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: R.Pavlov and S.Schmieding provided recently some synthetic results about generic $\mathbb{Z}$-shifts, which rely mainly on an original theorem stating that isolated points form a residual set in the space of $\mathbb{Z}$-shifts such that all other residual set must contain it. As a direction for further research, they pointed towards genericity in the space of $\mathbb{G}$-shifts, where $\mathbb{G}$ is a finitely generated group. In the present text, we approach this for the case of $\mathbb{Z}^d$-shifts, where $d \ge 2$. As it is usual, multidimensional dynamical systems are much more difficult to understand. Provided the result of R.Pavlov and S.Schmieding, it is natural to begin with a better understanding of isolated points. We prove here a characterization of such points in the space of $\mathbb{Z}^d$-shifts, in terms of the natural notion of maximal subsystems which we also introduce in this article. From this characterization we recover the one of R.Pavlov and S.Schmieding's. We also prove a series of results which exploit this notion. In particular some transitivity-like properties can be related to the number of maximal subsystems. Furthermore, on the contrary of dimension one, the set of isolated shifts is not residual. We also prove that the Cantor-Bendixson rank of the space of $\mathbb{Z}^d$-shifts is infinite when $d &gt; 1$, while it is equal to one when $d=1$.</description>

      <title>Dimension of equilibrium measures for complex maps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.07001v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For certain families of complex maps, we give a formula for the Hausdorff dimension of the equilibrium measure. In particular, given an endomorphism $f$ of $\mathbb C\mathbb P^k$ of algebraic degree $d \ge2$, and given the equilibrium measure $\mu$ with Lyapunov exponents $\chi_1\geq \ldots\geq \chi_k$, we show $\dim_\mathrm{H}(\mu) = \log d\sum_{i\leq k}\frac{1}{\chi_i}$ where $\dim_\mathrm{H}(\mu)$ is the Hausdorff dimension of the measure $\mu$. This gives an answer to the question of Forn{\ae}ss and Sibony, and proves the Binder-DeMarco Conjecture.</description>

Abstract: Let $H$ be a subnormal co-compact closed subgroup of a Hausdorff topological group $T$ and $X$ a compact Hausdorff space. We prove the inheritance theorem: A point of $X$ is almost periodic (a.p.) for $T\curvearrowright X$ iff it is a.p. for $H\curvearrowright X$. Moreover, if $T\curvearrowright X$ is minimal with $H\lhd T$, then $\mathscr{O}_H\colon X\rightarrow2^X$, ${x\mapsto\overline{Hx}}$ is a continuous mapping, and, $T\curvearrowright X/H$ is an a.p. nontrivial factor of $T\curvearrowright X$ iff $T\curvearrowright X\times T/H$ is not minimal.</description>

Abstract: We survey Vojta's higher-dimensional generalizations of the $abc$ conjecture and Szpiro's conjecture as well as recent developments that apply them to various problems in arithmetic dynamics. In particular, the "$abcd$ conjecture" implies a dynamical analogue of a conjecture on the uniform boundedness of torsion points and a dynamical analogue of Lang's conjecture on lower bounds for canonical heights.</description>

      <title>The structure of quasi-transitive graphs avoiding a minor with applications to the domino problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.01823v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An infinite graph is quasi-transitive if its vertex set has finitely many orbits under the action of its automorphism group. In this paper we obtain a structure theorem for locally finite quasi-transitive graphs avoiding a minor, which is reminiscent of the Robertson-Seymour Graph Minor Structure Theorem. We prove that every locally finite quasi-transitive graph $G$ avoiding a minor has a tree-decomposition whose torsos are finite or planar; moreover the tree-decomposition is canonical, i.e. invariant under the action of the automorphism group of $G$. As applications of this result, we prove the following.
  * Every locally finite quasi-transitive graph attains its Hadwiger number, that is, if such a graph contains arbitrarily large clique minors, then it contains an infinite clique minor. This extends a result of Thomassen (1992) who proved it in the 4-connected case and suggested that this assumption could be omitted.
  * Locally finite quasi-transitive graphs avoiding a minor are accessible (in the sense of Thomassen and Woess), which extends known results on planar graphs to any proper minor-closed family.
  * Minor-excluded finitely generated groups are accessible (in the group-theoretic sense) and finitely presented, which extends classical results on planar groups.
  * The domino problem is decidable in a minor-excluded finitely generated group if and only if the group is virtually free, which proves the minor-excluded case of a conjecture of Ballier and Stein (2018).</description>
