      <title>Generative AI Enabled Robust Data Augmentation for Wireless Sensing in ISAC Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) uses the same software and hardware resources to achieve both communication and sensing functionalities. Thus, it stands as one of the core technologies of 6G and has garnered significant attention in recent years. In ISAC systems, a variety of machine learning models are trained to analyze and identify signal patterns, thereby ensuring reliable sensing and communications. However, considering factors such as communication rates, costs, and privacy, collecting sufficient training data from various ISAC scenarios for these models is impractical. Hence, this paper introduces a generative AI (GenAI) enabled robust data augmentation scheme. The scheme first employs a conditioned diffusion model trained on a limited amount of collected CSI data to generate new samples, thereby expanding the sample quantity. Building on this, the scheme further utilizes another diffusion model to enhance the sample quality, thereby facilitating the data augmentation in scenarios where the original sensing data is insufficient and unevenly distributed. Moreover, we propose a novel algorithm to estimate the acceleration and jerk of signal propagation path length changes from CSI. We then use the proposed scheme to enhance the estimated parameters and detect the number of targets based on the enhanced data. The evaluation reveals that our scheme improves the detection performance by up to 70%, demonstrating reliability and robustness, which supports the deployment and practical use of the ISAC network.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Frequency Transmission for Upload Latency Minimization of IoT Devices in HSR Scenario Aided by Intelligent Reflecting Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The explosively growing demand for Internet of Things (IoT) in high-speed railway (HSR) scenario has attracted a lot of attention amongst researchers. However, limited IoT device (IoTD) batteries and large information upload latency still remain critical impediments to practical service applications. In this paper, we consider a HSR wireless mobile communication system, where two intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) are deployed to help solve the problems above. Considering the carrier aggregation method, the IRS needs to be optimized globally in hybrid frequency bands. Meanwhile, to ensure information security, the transmission to the mobile communication relay (MCR) on the train is covert to passengers in the carriage by IRS. This problem is challenging to handle since the variables are coupled with each other and some tricky constraints. We firstly transform the original sum-of-ratios problem into the more tractable parametric problem. Then, the block coordinate descent (BCD) algorithm is adopted to decouple the problem into two main sub-problems, and the downlink and uplink settings are alternatively optimized using low-complexity iterative algorithms. Finally, a heuristic algorithm to mitigate the Doppler spread is proposed to further improve the performance. Simulation results corroborate the performance improvement of the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>ComplexBeat: Breathing Rate Estimation from Complex CSI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the use of channel state information (CSI) from a WiFi system to estimate the breathing rate of a person in a room. In order to extract WiFi CSI components that are sensitive to breathing, we propose to consider the delay domain channel impulse response (CIR), while most state-of-the-art methods consider its frequency domain representation. One obstacle while processing the CSI data is that its amplitude and phase are highly distorted by measurement uncertainties. We thus also propose an amplitude calibration method and a phase offset calibration method for CSI measured in orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. Finally, we implement a complete breathing rate estimation system in order to showcase the effectiveness of our proposed calibration and CSI extraction methods.</description>

      <title>RadSplatter: Extending 3D Gaussian Splatting to Radio Frequencies for Wireless Radiomap Extrapolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A radiomap represents the spatial distribution of wireless signal strength, critical for applications like network optimization and autonomous driving. However, constructing radiomap relies on measuring radio signal power across the entire system, which is costly in outdoor environments due to large network scales. We present RadSplatter, a framework that extends 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to radio frequencies for efficient and accurate radiomap extrapolation from sparse measurements. RadSplatter models environmental scatterers and radio paths using 3D Gaussians, capturing key factors of radio wave propagation. It employs a relaxed-mean (RM) scheme to reparameterize the positions of 3D Gaussians from noisy and dense 3D point clouds. A camera-free 3DGS-based projection is proposed to map 3D Gaussians onto 2D radio beam patterns. Furthermore, a regularized loss function and recursive fine-tuning using highly structured sparse measurements in real-world settings are applied to ensure robust generalization. Experiments on synthetic and real-world data show state-of-the-art extrapolation accuracy and execution speed.</description>

      <title>Radar Network for Gait Monitoring: Technology and Validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, radar-based devices have emerged as an alternative approach for gait monitoring. However, the radar configuration and the algorithms used to extract the gait parameters often differ between contributions, lacking a systematic evaluation of the most appropriate setup. Additionally, radar-based studies often exclude motorically impaired subjects, leaving it unclear whether the existing algorithms are applicable to such populations.
  In this paper, a radar network is developed and validated by monitoring the gait of five healthy individuals and three patients with Parkinson's disease. Six configurations and four algorithms were compared using Vicon as ground-truth to determine the most appropriate solution for gait monitoring.
  The best results were obtained using only three nodes: two oriented towards the feet and one towards the torso. The most accurate stride velocity and distance in the state of the art were obtained with this configuration. Moreover, we show that analyzing the feet velocity increases the reliability of the temporal parameters, especially with aged or motorically impaired subjects.
  The contribution is significant for the implementation of radar networks in clinical and domestic environments, as it addresses critical aspects concerning the radar network configuration and algorithms.</description>

      <title>Cross-Domain Continual Learning for Edge Intelligence in Wireless ISAC Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In wireless networks with integrated sensing and communications (ISAC), edge intelligence (EI) is expected to be developed at edge devices (ED) for sensing user activities based on channel state information (CSI). However, due to the CSI being highly specific to users' characteristics, the CSI-activity relationship is notoriously domain dependent, essentially demanding EI to learn sufficient datasets from various domains in order to gain cross-domain sensing capability. This poses a crucial challenge owing to the EDs' limited resources, for which storing datasets across all domains will be a significant burden. In this paper, we propose the EdgeCL framework, enabling the EI to continually learn-then-discard each incoming dataset, while remaining resilient to catastrophic forgetting. We design a transformer-based discriminator for handling sequences of noisy and nonequispaced CSI samples. Besides, we propose a distilled core-set based knowledge retention method with robustness-enhanced optimization to train the discriminator, preserving its performance for previous domains while preventing future forgetting. Experimental evaluations show that EdgeCL achieves 89% of performance compared to cumulative training while consuming only 3% of its memory, mitigating forgetting by 79%.</description>

      <title>Dimension reduction methods, persistent homology and machine learning for EEG signal analysis of Interictal Epileptic Discharges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recognizing specific events in medical data requires trained personnel. To aid the classification, machine learning algorithms can be applied. In this context, medical records are usually high-dimensional, although a lower dimension can also reflect the dynamics of the signal. In this study, electroencephalogram data with Interictal Epileptic Discharges (IEDs) are investigated. First, the dimensions are reduced using Dynamical Component Analysis (DyCA) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA), respectively. The reduced data are examined using topological data analysis (TDA), specifically using a persistent homology algorithm. The persistent homology results are used for targeted feature generation. The features are used to train and evaluate a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to distinguish IEDs from background activities.</description>

      <title>An Attention-Assisted AI Model for Real-Time Underwater Sound Speed Estimation Leveraging Remote Sensing Sea Surface Temperature Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12817v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The estimation of underwater sound velocity distribution serves as a critical basis for facilitating effective underwater communication and precise positioning, given that variations in sound velocity influence the path of signal transmission. Conventional techniques for the direct measurement of sound velocity, as well as methods that involve the inversion of sound velocity utilizing acoustic field data, necessitate on--site data collection. This requirement not only places high demands on device deployment, but also presents challenges in achieving real-time estimation of sound velocity distribution. In order to construct a real-time sound velocity field and eliminate the need for underwater onsite data measurement operations, we propose a self-attention embedded multimodal data fusion convolutional neural network (SA-MDF-CNN) for real-time underwater sound speed profile (SSP) estimation. The proposed model seeks to elucidate the inherent relationship between remote sensing sea surface temperature (SST) data, the primary component characteristics of historical SSPs, and their spatial coordinates. This is achieved by employing CNNs and attention mechanisms to extract local and global correlations from the input data, respectively. The ultimate objective is to facilitate a rapid and precise estimation of sound velocity distribution within a specified task area. Experimental results show that the method proposed in this paper has lower root mean square error (RMSE) and stronger robustness than other state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Exact Sum Distribution of alpha-eta-kappa-mu Fading Channels for Statistical Performance Analysis of RRS-Based Wireless Transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconfigurable refractive surface (RRS) is an efficient alternative to holographic multiple input multiple outputs (HMIMO) systems that can serve as a transmission unit operating in the signal refraction mode. RRS transmissions experience near-field propagation due to the proximity of the transmission feed and far-field propagation for the user located farther from the transmitting unit. There is limited research on the effect of channel fading on far-field users in RRS-based transmissions. In this paper, we conduct an exact statistical analysis of RRS-based transmission considering alpha-eta-kappa-mu fading model for the far-field user and the near-field effect of transmission feed. First, we show the exact statistical analysis for the RRS transmission over alpha-eta-kappa-mu fading model consisting of multiple infinite-series representations with multivariate Fox-H function. Next, we develop a novel approach to derive the density and distribution functions for the resultant fading channel of the RRS system in terms of multivariate Fox-H functions without involving infinite series approximations for tractable performance analysis. We present the exact outage probability and average bit-error-rate (BER) performance of single-element and multiple-element RRS systems to validate the proposed analysis further. We also obtain the diversity order of the system by analyzing the outage probability at a high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Computer simulations demonstrate the relevance of the developed statistical results for RRS-based wireless systems over the generalized fading model for a comprehensive performance evaluation.</description>

      <title>Beyond Diagonal RIS for ISAC Network: Statistical Analysis and Network Parameter Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the use of beyond diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surface (BD-RIS) with $N$ elements to advance integrated sensing and communication (ISAC). We address a key gap in the statistical characterizations of the radar signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the communication signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) by deriving tractable closed-form cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) for these metrics. Our approach maximizes the radar SNR by jointly configuring radar beamforming and BD-RIS phase shifts. Subsequently, zero-forcing is adopted to mitigate user interference, enhancing the communication SINR. To meet ISAC outage requirements, we propose an analytically-driven successive non-inversion sampling (SNIS) algorithm for estimating network parameters satisfying network outage constraints. Numerical results illustrate the accuracy of the derived CDFs and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed SNIS algorithm.</description>

      <title>A Bayesian Perspective on Uncertainty Quantification for Estimated Graph Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a Bayesian perspective on quantifying the uncertainty of graph signals estimated or reconstructed from imperfect observations. We show that many conventional methods of graph signal estimation, reconstruction and imputation, can be reinterpreted as finding the mean of a posterior Gaussian distribution, with a covariance matrix shaped by the graph structure. In this perspective, assumptions of signal smoothness as well as bandlimitedness are naturally expressible as the choice of certain prior distributions; noisy, noise-free or partial observations are expressible in terms of certain likelihood models. In addition to providing a point estimate, as most standard estimation strategies do, our probabilistic framework enables us to characterize the shape of the estimated signal distribution around the estimate in terms of the posterior covariance matrix.</description>

      <title>Artificial Intelligence-derived Vascular Age from Photoplethysmography: A Novel Digital Biomarker for Cardiovascular Health</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12990v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the increasing availability of wearable devices, photoplethysmography (PPG) has emerged as a promising non-invasive tool for monitoring human hemodynamics. We propose a deep learning framework to estimate vascular age (AI-vascular age) from PPG signals, incorporating a distribution-aware loss to address biases caused by imbalanced data. The model was developed using data from the UK Biobank (UKB), with 98,672 participants in the development cohort and 113,559 participants (144,683 data pairs) for clinical evaluation. After adjusting for key confounders, individuals with a vascular age gap (AI-vascular age minus calendar age) exceeding 9 years had a significantly higher risk of major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events (MACCE) (HR = 2.37, p &lt; 0.005) and secondary outcomes, including diabetes (HR = 2.69, p &lt; 0.005), hypertension (HR = 2.88, p &lt; 0.005), coronary heart disease (HR = 2.20, p &lt; 0.005), heart failure (HR = 2.15, p &lt; 0.005), myocardial infarction (HR = 2.51, p &lt; 0.005), stroke (HR = 2.55, p &lt; 0.005), and all-cause mortality (HR = 2.51, p &lt; 0.005). Conversely, participants with a vascular age gap below -9 years exhibited a significantly lower incidence of these outcomes. We further evaluated the longitudinal applicability of AI-vascular age using serial PPG data from the UKB, demonstrating its value in risk stratification by leveraging AI-vascular age at two distinct time points to predict future MACCE incidence. External validation was performed on a MIMIC-III-derived cohort (n = 2,343), where each one-year increase in vascular age gap was significantly associated with elevated in-hospital mortality risk (OR = 1.02, p &lt; 0.005). In conclusion, our study establishes AI-vascular age as a novel, non-invasive digital biomarker for cardiovascular health assessment.</description>

      <title>Efficient UAV Coverage in Large Convex Quadrilateral Areas with Elliptical Footprints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have gained significant attention for improving wireless communication, especially in emergencies or as a complement to existing cellular infrastructure. This letter addresses the problem of efficiently covering a large convex quadrilateral using multiple UAVs, where each UAV generates elliptical coverage footprints based on its altitude and antenna tilt. The challenge is approached using circle-packing techniques within a unit square to arrange UAVs in an optimal configuration. Subsequently, a homography transformation is applied to map the unit square onto the quadrilateral area, ensuring that the UAVs' elliptical footprints cover the entire region. Numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, providing insight into coverage density and optimal altitude configurations for different placement scenarios. The results highlight the scalability and potential for improving UAV-based communication systems, focusing on maximizing coverage efficiency in large areas with irregular shapes.</description>

      <title>Note-Level Singing Melody Transcription for Time-Aligned Musical Score Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12438v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automatic music transcription converts audio recordings into symbolic representations, facilitating music analysis, retrieval, and generation. A musical note is characterized by pitch, onset, and offset in an audio domain, whereas it is defined in terms of pitch and note value in a musical score domain. A time-aligned score, derived from timing information along with pitch and note value, allows matching a part of the score with the corresponding part of the music audio, enabling various applications. In this paper, we consider an extended version of the traditional note-level transcription task that recognizes onset, offset, and pitch, through including extraction of additional note value to generate a time-aligned score from an audio input. To address this new challenge, we propose an end-to-end framework that integrates recognition of the note value, pitch, and temporal information. This approach avoids error accumulation inherent in multi-stage methods and enhances accuracy through mutual reinforcement. Our framework employs tokenized representations specifically targeted for this task, through incorporating note value information. Furthermore, we introduce a pseudo-labeling technique to address a scarcity problem of annotated note value data. This technique produces approximate note value labels from existing datasets for the traditional note-level transcription. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed model in note-level transcription tasks when compared to existing state-of-the-art approaches. We also introduce new evaluation metrics that assess both temporal and note value aspects to demonstrate the robustness of the model. Moreover, qualitative assessments via visualized musical scores confirmed the effectiveness of our model in capturing the note values.</description>

      <title>Local Flaw Detection with Adaptive Pyramid Image Fusion Across Spatial Sampling Resolution for SWRs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12512v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The inspection of local flaws (LFs) in Steel Wire Ropes (SWRs) is crucial for ensuring safety and reliability in various industries. Magnetic Flux Leakage (MFL) imaging is commonly used for non-destructive testing, but its effectiveness is often hindered by the combined effects of inspection speed and sampling rate. To address this issue, the impacts of inspection speed and sampling rate on image quality are studied, as variations in these factors can cause stripe noise, axial compression of defect features, and increased interference, complicating accurate detection. We define the relationship between inspection speed and sampling rate as spatial sampling resolution (SSR) and propose an adaptive SSR target-feature-oriented (AS-TFO) method. This method incorporates adaptive adjustment and pyramid image fusion techniques to enhance defect detection under different SSR scenarios. Experimental results show that under high SSR scenarios, the method achieves a precision of 92.54% and recall of 98.41%. It remains robust under low SSR scenarios with a precision of 94.87% and recall of 97.37%. The overall results show that the proposed method outperforms conventional approaches, achieving state-of-the-art performance. This improvement in detection accuracy and robustness is particularly valuable for handling complex inspection conditions, where inspection speed and sampling rate can vary significantly, making detection more robust and reliable in industrial settings.</description>

      <title>Rate Maximization for Downlink Pinching-Antenna Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12629v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this letter, we consider a new type of flexible-antenna system, termed pinching-antenna, where multiple low-cost pinching antennas, realized by activating small dielectric particles on a dielectric waveguide, are jointly used to serve a single-antenna user. Our goal is to maximize the downlink transmission rate by optimizing the locations of the pinching antennas. However, these locations affect both the path losses and the phase shifts of the user's effective channel gain, making the problem challenging to solve. To address this challenge and solve the problem in a low complexity manner, a relaxed optimization problem is developed that minimizes the impact of path loss while ensuring that the received signals at the user are constructive. This approach leads to a two-stage algorithm: in the first stage, the locations of the pinching antennas are optimized to minimize the large-scale path loss; in the second stage, the antenna locations are refined to maximize the received signal strength. Simulation results show that pinching-antenna systems significantly outperform conventional fixed-location antenna systems, and the proposed algorithm achieves nearly the same performance as the highly complex exhaustive search-based benchmark.</description>

      <title>Task-Oriented Semantic Communication for Stereo-Vision 3D Object Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12735v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the development of computer vision, 3D object detection has become increasingly important in many real-world applications. Limited by the computing power of sensor-side hardware, the detection task is sometimes deployed on remote computing devices or the cloud to execute complex algorithms, which brings massive data transmission overhead. In response, this paper proposes an optical flow-driven semantic communication framework for the stereo-vision 3D object detection task. The proposed framework fully exploits the dependence of stereo-vision 3D detection on semantic information in images and prioritizes the transmission of this semantic information to reduce total transmission data sizes while ensuring the detection accuracy. Specifically, we develop an optical flow-driven module to jointly extract and recover semantics from the left and right images to reduce the loss of the left-right photometric alignment semantic information and improve the accuracy of depth inference. Then, we design a 2D semantic extraction module to identify and extract semantic meaning around the objects to enhance the transmission of semantic information in the key areas. Finally, a fusion network is used to fuse the recovered semantics, and reconstruct the stereo-vision images for 3D detection. Simulation results show that the proposed method improves the detection accuracy by nearly 70% and outperforms the traditional method, especially for the low signal-to-noise ratio regime.</description>

      <title>One-bit Compressed Sensing using Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12762v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the classical problem of one-bit compressed sensing using a deep learning-based reconstruction algorithm that leverages a trained generative model to enhance the signal reconstruction performance. The generator, a pre-trained neural network, learns to map from a low-dimensional latent space to a higher-dimensional set of sparse vectors. This generator is then used to reconstruct sparse vectors from their one-bit measurements by searching over its range. The presented algorithm provides an excellent reconstruction performance because the generative model can learn additional structural information about the signal beyond sparsity. Furthermore, we provide theoretical guarantees on the reconstruction accuracy and sample complexity of the algorithm. Through numerical experiments using three publicly available image datasets, MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and Omniglot, we demonstrate the superior performance of the algorithm compared to other existing algorithms and show that our algorithm can recover both the amplitude and the direction of the signal from one-bit measurements.</description>

      <title>TransfoRhythm: A Transformer Architecture Conductive to Blood Pressure Estimation via Solo PPG Signal Capturing</title>

Abstract: Recent statistics indicate that approximately 1.3 billion individuals worldwide suffer from hypertension, a leading cause of premature death globally. Blood Pressure (BP) serves as a critical health indicator for accurate and timely diagnosis and/or treatment of hypertension. Traditional BP measurement methods rely on cuff-based approaches, which lack real-time, continuous, and reliable BP estimates, crucial for the timely diagnosis/treatment of hypertension. Driven by recent advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), there has been a surge of interest in developing data-driven and cuff-less BP estimation solutions. In this context, current literature predominantly focuses on coupling Electrocardiography (ECG) and Photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors, though this approach is constrained by reliance on multiple sensor types. An alternative, utilizing standalone PPG signals, presents challenges due to the absence of auxiliary sensors (ECG), requiring the use of morphological features while addressing motion artifacts and high-frequency noise. To address these issues, the paper introduces the TransfoRhythm framework, a Transformer-based DNN architecture built upon the recently released physiological database, MIMIC-IV. Leveraging the Multi-Head Attention (MHA) mechanism, TransfoRhythm identifies dependencies and similarities across data segments, forming a robust framework for cuff-less BP estimation solely using PPG signals. To our knowledge, this paper represents the first study to apply the MIMIC IV dataset for cuff-less BP estimation. TransfoRhythm achieves highly accurate results with a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of [2.21, 1.84] and a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of [1.37, 1.06] for systolic and diastolic blood pressures, respectively.</description>

      <title>A Closer Look at Mortality Risk Prediction from Electrocardiograms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17002v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Several recent studies combine large private ECG databases with AI to predict patient mortality. These studies typically use a few, highly variable, modeling approaches. While benchmarking these approaches has historically been limited by a lack of public ECG datasets, this changed with the 2023 release of MIMIC-IV, containing 795,546 ECGs from a U.S. hospital system, and the 2020 release of Code-15, containing 345,779 ECGs collected during routine care in Brazil. We benchmark over 500 AI-ECG survival models predicting all-cause mortality on Code-15 and MIMIC-IV with 2 neural architectures, 4 Deep-Survival-Analysis approaches, and classifiers predicting mortality at 4 time horizons. We extend the highest-performing approach to a dataset from Boston Children's Hospital (BCH, 225,379 ECGs). Models train with and without demographics (age/sex) and evaluate across datasets. The best performing Deep-Survival-Analysis models trained with ECG and demographics yield good median Concordance Indices (Code-15: 0.82, MIMIC-IV: 0.78, BCH: 0.76) and AUPRC scores (median 1-yr/5-yr, Code-15: 0.07/0.15; MIMIC-IV: 0.45/0.55; BCH: 0.04/0.13) considering the percentage of ECGs linked to mortality (1-yr/5-yr, Code-15: 1.2%/3.4%; MIMIC-IV: 14.8%/24.5%; BCH: 0.9%/4.8%). Contrasting with Deep-Survival-Analysis models, classifier-based AI-ECG models exhibit significant, site-dependent sensitivity to the choice of time horizon (median Pearson's R, Code-15: 0.69, p&lt;1E-5; MIMIC-IV: -0.80 p&lt;1E-5). Demographic-only models perform surprisingly well on Code-15. Concordance drops 0.03-0.24 on external validation. We recommend Deep-Survival-Analysis over Classifier-Cox approaches and the inclusion of demographic covariates in ECG survival modeling. Comparisons to demographic-only and baseline models is crucial. External evaluations support fine-tuning models on site-specific data.</description>

      <title>Constant Modulus Waveform Design with Space-Time Sidelobe Reduction for DFRC Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18951v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dual-function radar-communication (DFRC) is a key enabler of location-based services for next-generation communication systems. In this paper, we investigate the problem of designing constant modulus waveforms for DFRC systems. We consider the joint optimization of the spatial beam pattern and space-time correlation levels for better separating multiple targets in different angle and delay bins. In particular, we use the space-time correlation function to quantify the correlations between different angle and delay bins and formulate integrated sidelobe levels (ISLs). To serve communication users, we employ constructive interference (CI)-based precoding to modulate information symbols, which leverages distortion induced by multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) and radar transmission. We propose two solution algorithms based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) and majorization-minimization (MM) principles, which are effective for small and large block sizes, respectively. The proposed ADMM-based solution decomposes the nonconvex formulated problem into multiple tractable subproblems, each of which admits a closed-form solution. To accelerate convergence of the MM-based solution, we propose a novel majorizing function for complex quadratic functions. After majorization, we decompose the approximated problem into independent subproblems for parallelization, mitigating the complexity that increases with block size. We evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms in comparison to the existing DFRC algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed methods can substantially enhance the detection and estimation performance due to reduced space-time correlation levels.</description>

      <title>CRC-Assisted Channel Codes for Integrated Passive Sensing and Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05531v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel coded integrated passive sensing and communication (CIPSAC) system with orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), where a multi-antenna base station (BS) passively senses the parameters of the targets and decodes the information bit sequences transmitted by a user. The transmitted signal is comprised of pilot and data OFDM symbols where the data symbols adopt cyclic redundancy check (CRC)-assisted channel codes to facilitate both the decoding and sensing procedures. In the proposed scheme, CRC not only enhances the reliability of communication but also provides guidance to the parameter sensing procedure at the BS. In particular, a novel iterative parameter sensing and channel decoding (IPSCD) algorithm is proposed, where the correctly decoded codewords that pass CRC are utilized for sensing to improve the parameter estimation accuracy, and in return, more accurate parameter estimates lead to a larger number of correctly decoded data symbols. Conventional sensing algorithms rely only on the received pilot signals, while we utilize both the data and pilot signals for sensing. We provide a detailed analysis of the optimal strategy, in which the wrongly decoded data packets are replaced by zero codewords. To further improve the performance, we introduce learning-based near-orthogonal superposition (NOS) codes, which exhibit superior error correction capability especially in the short block length regime. NOS codes are trained using a weighted loss function, where a hyper parameter is introduced to balance the sensing and the communication losses. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed CIPSAC system and the IPSCD algorithm, where both the sensing and decoding performances are significantly improved with a few iterations. We also carry out extensive ablation studies for a comprehensive understanding of the proposed scheme.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.07202v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a unified dynamic tracking algorithmic framework (PLAY-CS) to reconstruct signal sequences with their intrinsic structured dynamic sparsity. By capitalizing on specific statistical assumptions concerning the dynamic filter of the signal sequences, the proposed framework exhibits versatility by encompassing various existing dynamic compressive sensing (DCS) algorithms. This is achieved through the incorporation of a newly proposed Partial-Laplacian filtering sparsity model, tailored to capture a more sophisticated dynamic sparsity. In practical scenarios such as dynamic channel tracking in wireless communications, the framework demonstrates enhanced performance compared to existing DCS algorithms.</description>

      <title>Performance Analysis of Near-Field Sensing in Wideband MIMO Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05076v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The performance of near-field sensing (NISE) in a legacy wideband multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) communication system is analyzed. The maximum likelihood estimates (MLE) for the target's distance and angle relative to the antenna array are derived. To evaluate the estimation error, closed-form analytical expressions of Cramer-Rao bounds (CRBs) are derived for both uniform linear arrays (ULAs) and uniform circular arrays (UCAs). The asymptotic CRBs are then analyzed to reveal the scaling laws of CRBs with respect to key system parameters, including array size, bandwidth, and target distance. Our results reveal that 1) the mean-squared error achieved by MLEs approaches CRBs in the high signal-to-noise ratio regime; 2) a larger array aperture does not necessarily improve NISE performance, especially with ultra-large bandwidth; 3) large bandwidth sets an estimation error ceiling for NISE as target distance increases; 4) array aperture and bandwidth, rather than the number of antennas and subcarriers, are the key factors affecting wideband NISE performance; and 5) UCAs offer superior, angle-independent wideband NISE performance compared to ULAs with the same aperture.</description>

      <title>Continuous-Aperture Array (CAPA)-Based Wireless Communications: Capacity Characterization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15056v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The capacity limits of continuous-aperture array (CAPA)-based wireless communications are characterized. To this end, an analytically tractable transmission framework is established for both uplink and downlink CAPA systems. Based on this framework, closed-form expressions for the single-user channel capacity are derived. The results are further extended to a multiuser case by characterizing the capacity limits of a two-user channel and proposing the associated capacity-achieving decoding and encoding schemes. In the uplink case, the capacity-achieving detectors and sum-rate capacity are derived, and the capacity region is characterized. In the downlink case, the uplink-downlink duality is established by deriving the uplink-to-downlink and downlink-to-uplink transformations under the same power constraint, based on which the optimal source current distributions and the achieved sum-rate capacity and capacity region are characterized. For comparison, the uplink and downlink sum-rates achieved by the linear zero-forcing scheme are also analyzed. To gain further insights, several case studies are presented by specializing the derived results into various array structures, including the planar CAPA, linear CAPA, and planar spatially discrete array (SPDA). Numerical results are provided to reveal that the channel capacity achieved by CAPAs converges towards a finite upper bound as the aperture size increases; and CAPAs offer superior capacity over the conventional SPDAs.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing physiological signals from fMRI across the adult lifespan</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14453v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Interactions between the brain and body are of fundamental importance for human behavior and health. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) captures whole-brain activity noninvasively, and modeling how fMRI signals interact with physiological dynamics of the body can provide new insight into brain function and offer potential biomarkers of disease. However, physiological recordings are not always possible to acquire since they require extra equipment and setup, and even when they are, the recorded physiological signals may contain substantial artifacts. To overcome this limitation, machine learning models have been proposed to directly extract features of respiratory and cardiac activity from resting-state fMRI signals. To date, such work has been carried out only in healthy young adults and in a pediatric population, leaving open questions about the efficacy of these approaches on older adults. Here, we propose a novel framework that leverages Transformer-based architectures for reconstructing two key physiological signals - low-frequency respiratory volume (RV) and heart rate (HR) fluctuations - from fMRI data, and test these models on a dataset of individuals aged 36-89 years old. Our framework outperforms previously proposed approaches (attaining median correlations between predicted and measured signals of r ~ .698 for RV and r ~ .618 for HR), indicating the potential of leveraging attention mechanisms to model fMRI-physiological signal relationships. We also evaluate several model training and fine-tuning strategies, and find that incorporating young-adult data during training improves the performance when predicting physiological signals in the aging cohort. Overall, our approach successfully infers key physiological variables directly from fMRI data from individuals across a wide range of the adult lifespan.</description>

      <title>Optimal Beamforming for Multi-User Continuous Aperture Array (CAPA) Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14919v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The optimal beamforming design for multi-user continuous aperture array (CAPA) systems is proposed. In contrast to conventional spatially discrete array (SPDA), the beamformer for CAPA is a continuous function rather than a discrete vector or matrix, rendering beamforming optimization a non-convex integral-based functional programming. To address this challenging issue, the closed-form optimal structure of the CAPA beamformer is first derived for maximizing generic system utility functions, by addressing the inversion of continuous functions and using the Lagrangian duality and the calculus of variations. The derived optimal structure is a linear combination of the continuous channel responses for CAPA, with the linear weights determined by the channel correlations. As a further advance, a monotonic optimization method is proposed for obtaining globally optimal CAPA beamforming based on the derived optimal structure. More particularly, a closed-form fixed-point iteration is proposed to obtain the globally optimal solution to the power minimization problem for CAPA beamforming. Furthermore, based on the optimal structure, the low-complexity maximum ratio transmission (MRT), zero-forcing (ZF), and minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) designs for CAPA beamforming are derived. It is theoretically proved that: 1) the MRT and ZF designs are asymptotically optimal in low and high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regimes, respectively, and 2) the MMSE design is optimal for signal-to-leakage-plus-noise ratio (SLNR) maximization. Our numerical results validate the effectiveness of the proposed designs and reveal that: i) CAPA achieves significant communication performance gain over SPDA, and ii) the MMSE design achieves nearly optimal performance in most cases, while the MRT and ZF designs achieve nearly optimal performance in specific cases</description>

Abstract: In diagnosing neurological disorders from electroencephalography (EEG) data, foundation models such as Transformers have been employed to capture temporal dynamics. Additionally, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are critical for representing the spatial relationships among EEG sensors. However, fine-tuning these large-scale models for both temporal and spatial features can be prohibitively large in computational cost, especially under the limited availability of labeled EEG datasets. We propose EEG-GraphAdapter (EGA), a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) approach designed to address these challenges. EGA is integrated into a pre-trained temporal backbone model as a GNN-based module, freezing the backbone and allowing only the adapter to be fine-tuned. This enables the effective acquisition of EEG spatial representations, significantly reducing computational overhead and data requirements. Experimental evaluations on two healthcare-related downstream tasks-Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and Abnormality Detection (TUAB)-show that EGA improves performance by up to 16.1% in F1-score compared with the backbone BENDR model, highlighting its potential for scalable and accurate EEG-based predictions.</description>
