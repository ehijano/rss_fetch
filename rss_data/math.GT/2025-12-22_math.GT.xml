      <title>Geometry for Kleinian Groups Generated by a Parabolic Pair</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a computational framework for studying the hyperbolic geometry of 2-bridge link complements and Kleinian groups generated by two parabolic elements. The framework is built on Sakuma-Weeks triangulations and introduces a family of Farey recursive polynomials.
  For a rational number which determines a hyperbolic 2-bridge link, this paper provides a simple recursive algorithm to determine a Farey recursive polynomial which has a root which determines the geometry of the link complement. This root is the shape parameter for a pair of tetrahedra in the Sakuma-Weeks triangulation. Using the same polynomials, the paper defines rational functions, one function for each edge in the Farey graph. Evaluating these rational functions at the root yields the complete collection of shape parameters for the triangulation.
  The Riley slice and its exterior lie in the complex plane and are traditionally viewed as parameter spaces for two-parabolic generated subgroups of PSL(2,C). This paper's triangulation-based approach provides a more geometric perspective to these parameter spaces. The Farey recursive methods apply throughout the Riley slice and its exterior, enabling computations for quotient orbifolds of Kleinian groups generated by parabolic pairs, incomplete hyperbolic spaces with non-discrete parameter groups, and others. Explicit calculations include the cusp groups in the boundary of the Riley slice and singly augmented 2-bridge link complements.
  Applications include: explicit computation of fundamental domains and holonomies for 2-bridge link complements; a precise correspondence between group elements and crossing circles in tangle diagrams; determination of cusp fields for 2-bridge links; geometric analysis of algebraic and geometric limits arising from Dehn surgery on singly augmented 2-bridge links; and explicit triangulations of Heckoid orbifolds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.17402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Giroux Correspondence states that two open book decompositions supporting the same contact structure are related by a sequence of positive open book stabilisations and destabilisations. In this note we show that any two open book decompositions supporting isotopic contact structures admit a common positive stabilisation.</description>

      <title>FAMED by computer: proving the Andersen-Kashaev volume conjecture for 42,000 knots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The FAMED condition is a combinatorial property for ideal triangulations of $3$-manifolds, which was introduced in 2024 by the first and last authors in order to study the Andersen--Kashaev volume conjecture. They notably proved that this conjecture is true for all FAMED geometric triangulations of one-cusped hyperbolic $3$-manifolds with trivial second homology.
  In this paper, using a straightforward computer implementation in Regina and Snappy, we find FAMED geometric triangulations for more than 42.000 complements of knots in $S^3$, including all knots with $12$ crossings or fewer and all knots whose complement can be triangulated with $23$ tetrahedra or fewer. As a consequence, the Andersen-Kashaev conjecture is now proven to be true for as many new examples.
  Along the way, we find several new insights about the FAMED property, which have great value in the quest of a general proof of the Andersen-Kashaev volume conjecture for every knot complement.</description>

      <title>Structure and Topological Generation of Big Mapping Class Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Big mapping class groups are the mapping class groups of infinite-type surfaces, that is, surfaces whose fundamental groups are not finitely generated. While mapping class groups of finite-type surfaces have been extensively studied, the theory of big mapping class groups is a recent and rapidly developing area of research. This thesis provides a systematic introduction to the structure and topological generation of big mapping class groups, emphasizing the key differences from the classical finite-type case. It presents a clear exposition of foundational results concerning their topological and algebraic structure, including known results on finite topological generation for a certain family of infinite-type surfaces.</description>

      <title>Minimal Sets of Generators for Big Mapping Class Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $S(n)$ be the infinite-type surface with infinite genus and $n \in \mathbb{N}$ ends, all of which are accumulated by genus. The mapping class group of this surface, $\mod(S(n))$, is a Polish group that is not countably generated, but it is countably topologically generated. This paper focuses on finding minimal sets of generators for $\mod(S(n))$. We show that for $n \ge 8$, $\mod(S(n))$ is topologically generated by three elements, and for $n \ge 3$, $\mod(S(n))$ is topologically generated by four elements. We also establish a generating set of two elements for the Loch Ness Monster surface ($n=1$) and a generating set of three elements for the Jacob's Ladder surface ($n=2$).</description>

      <title>Centers and Orderability of Certain Quotients of quasi-isometry groups of Euclidean spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we study the algebraic and dynamical structure of certain normal subgroups of the quasi-isometry group of Euclidean space $QI(\mathbb{R}^n)$. For \[ H = \Big\{ [f] \in QI(\mathbb{R}^n) : \lim_{\|x\|\to\infty} \frac{\|f(x)-x\|}{\|x\|} = 0 \Big\}, \] and for $0&lt;\alpha&lt;1$, \[ H_\alpha = \Big\{ [f] \in QI(\mathbb{R}^n) : \|f(x)-x\| \le K\|x\|^\alpha \text{ for large } \|x\| \Big\}, \] we show that each $H_\alpha$ is a nontrivial normal subgroup of $QI(\mathbb{R}^n)$, satisfying \[ H_\alpha \subset H_\beta \subset H \qquad \text{for } 0&lt;\alpha&lt;\beta&lt;1. \] We prove that the centers of $QI(\mathbb{R}^n)/H$ and $QI(\mathbb{R}^n)/H_\alpha$ are trivial, while these quotients admit nontrivial torsion elements. Consequently, they are neither left-orderable nor locally indicable. Finally, we introduce an asymptotic topology on $QI(\mathbb{R}^n)$ and show that the family $\{H_\alpha\}_{0&lt;\alpha&lt;1}$ is dense in $H$.</description>

      <title>Extending Fibrations of the $3$-Torus and Applications to Torus Surgery in $4$-Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Suppose that $W$ and $W'$ are smooth, compact, and oriented $4$-manifolds that are either diffeomorphic to $S^1$ times the exterior $E_Y(K)$ of a fibered knot $K$ in a closed, connected, orientable $3$-manifold $Y$, or are diffeomorphic to $\Sigma_{g,1}$ bundles over the $2$-torus with monodromy fixing the boundary of the fiber pointwise. If $f: \partial W' \to \partial W$ is an orientation-preserving diffeomorphism of the $3$-torus boundaries, we have that $X = W \cup_f W'$ is a closed, oriented $4$-manifold that fibers over $S^1$. In particular, if $W' = T^2 \times D^2$ and $W = S^1 \times E_Y(K)$, then our result shows that the result of doing torus surgery in $S^1\times Y$ along $S^1 \times K$ is a $4$-manifold that fibers over $S^1$. Furthermore, we extend work of Zentner by showing that the result of torus surgery along $S^1$ times the unknot $\mathcal{U}$ in $S^1 \times S^3$ is diffeomorphic to $S^1$ times a lens space.</description>

      <title>A bound on the equivariant unknotting number</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.17700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study how the equivariant signature of strongly invertible knots changes under each type of equivariant unknotting move. We prove that the absolute value of the equivariant signature is bounded above by three times the type A equivariant unknotting number, by twice the type C equivariant unknotting number for some $(1,2)$-knots, and, for admissible diagrams, by twice the type B equivariant unknotting number. These results provide analogues in the equivariant setting of the classical bound relating the knot signature to the unknotting number.</description>

      <title>The 3D index and Dehn filling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09886v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a rigorous proof of the Gang-Yonekura formula describing the transformation of the 3D index under Dehn filling a cusp in an orientable 3-manifold. The 3D index, originally introduced by Dimofte, Gaiotto and Gukov, is a physically inspired q-series that encodes deep topological and geometric information about cusped 3-manifolds. Building on the interpretation of the 3D index as a generating function over Q-normal surfaces, we introduce a relative version of the index for ideal triangulations with exposed boundary. This notion allows us to formulate a relative Gang-Yonekura formula, which we prove by developing a gluing principle for relative indices and establishing an inductive framework in the case of layered solid tori. Our approach makes use of Garoufalidis-Kashaev's meromorphic extension of the index, along with new identities involving q-hypergeometric functions. As an application, we study the limiting behaviour of the index for large fillings. We also develop code to perform certified computations of the index, guaranteeing correctness up to a specified accuracy. Our extensive computations support the topological invariance of the 3D index and suggest a well-defined extension to closed manifolds.</description>

      <title>Non-semisimple Crane-Yetter theory varying over the character stack</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19667v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a relative version of the Crane-Yetter topological quantum field theory in four dimensions, from non-semisimple data. Our theory is defined relative to the classical $G$-gauge theory in five dimensions -- this latter theory assigns to each manifold $M$ the appropriate linearization of the moduli stack of $G$-local systems, called the character stack. Our main result is to establish a relative invertibility property for our construction. This invertibility generalizes the key invertibility property of the original Crane-Yetter theory which allowed it to capture the framing anomaly of the celebrated Witten-Reshetikhin-Turaev theory. In particular our invertibilty statement at the level of surfaces implies a categorical, stacky version of the unicity theorem for skein algebras; at the level of 3-manifolds it equips the character stack with a canonical line bundle. Regarded as a topological symmetry defect of classical gauge theory, our work establishes invertibility of this defect by a gauging procedure.</description>

      <title>Tykhyy's Conjecture on finite mapping class group orbits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04379v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We classify the finite orbits of the mapping class group action on the character variety of Deroin--Tholozan representations of punctured spheres. In particular, we prove that the action has no finite orbits if the underlying sphere has 7 punctures or more. When the sphere has six punctures, we show that there is a unique 1-parameter family of finite orbits. Our methods also recover Tykhyy's classification of finite orbits for 5-punctured spheres. The proof is inductive and uses Lisovyy--Tykhyy's classification of finite mapping class group orbits for 4-punctured spheres as the base case for the induction.
  Our results on Deroin--Tholozan representations cover the last missing cases to complete the proof of Tykhyy's Conjecture on finite mapping class group orbits for $\mathrm{SL}_2\mathbb{C}$ representations of punctured spheres, after the recent work by Lam--Landesman--Litt.</description>

      <title>Les Houches lectures on non-perturbative Seiberg-Witten geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21742v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In these lectures we detail the interplay between the low-energy dynamics of quantum field theories with four supercharges and the exact WKB analysis. This exposition may be the first comprehensive account of this connection and includes new arguments and results.
  The lectures start with the introduction of massive two-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=(2,2)$ theories and their spectra of BPS solitons. We place these theories in a two-dimensional cigar background with supersymmetric boundary conditions labelled by a phase $\zeta = e^{i \vartheta}$, while turning on the two-dimensional $\Omega$-background with parameter~$\epsilon$. We show that the resulting partition function $\mathcal{Z}_{\mathrm{2d}}^\vartheta(\epsilon)$ can be characterized as the Borel-summed solution, in the direction $\vartheta$, to an associated Schr\"odinger equation. The partition function $\mathcal{Z}_{\mathrm{2d}}^\vartheta(\epsilon)$ is locally constant in the phase $\vartheta$ and jumps across phases $\vartheta_\textrm{BPS}$ associated with the BPS solitons. Since these jumps are non-perturbative in the parameter~$\epsilon$, we refer to $Z^\vartheta_\mathrm{2d}(\epsilon)$ as the non-perturbative partition function for the original two-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=(2,2)$ theory. We completely determine this partition function $\mathcal{Z}^\vartheta_\mathrm{2d}(\epsilon)$ in two classes of examples, Landau-Ginzburg models and gauged linear sigma models, and show that $\mathcal{Z}^\vartheta_\mathrm{2d}(\epsilon)$ encodes the well-known vortex partition function at a special phase $\vartheta_\textrm{FN}$ associated with the presence of self-solitons. This analysis generalizes to four-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=2$ theories in the $\frac{1}{2} \Omega$-background.</description>
