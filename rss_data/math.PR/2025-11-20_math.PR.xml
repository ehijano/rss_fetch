      <title>Scaling Limit of a Stochastic Clustering Model on $\mathbb{R}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider an infinite-dimensional stochastic clustering model on $\mathbb{R}$. In discrete time, each point of a unit-intensity simple point process moves halfway toward either of its left or right neighbors, chosen uniformly at random. Co-located points are merged into a single point, and the resulting simple point process is rescaled to unit intensity. We show that, when the point processes are shifted so that there is a point at the origin, there is a unique weak limit of these dynamics when the initial point process is renewal. We also conjecture that for the time-reversed process and with an appropriate scaling in space, there is a limiting (random) distribution function on $\mathbb{R}$, whose corresponding measure assigns to $\mathbb{R}$ a measure corresponding to the gap between consecutive points. Finally, we discuss some relevant research directions.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Forced 3D Navier-Stokes Equations in $\mathbb{H}^{1/2}$-Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the classical work [FK], Fujita and Kato established the local existence of solutions to the 3D Navier-Stokes equations in the critical $\mathbb{H}^{1/2}$-space. In this paper, we are concerned with the global well-posedness of the stochastic forced 3D Navier-Stokes equations in the $\mathbb{H}^{1/2}$-space under general initial conditions, where the stochastic forcing comprises a transport forcing and a nonlocal turbulent forcing. In this setting, the random noise is shown to provide a regularization effect on the energy estimates, which we obtain by constructing suitable Lyapunov functions. However, its nonlocality also brings analytical challenges. We develop a bootstrap type estimate based on the kinematic viscosity together with a delicate stopping time argument to prove the global existence and uniqueness of solutions, as well as continuous dependence on the initial value. Furthermore, we also investigated the long-time behavior of the stochastic forced 3D Navier-Stokes equations.</description>

      <title>Chung's LIL for the linear stochastic fractional heat equation at origin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider the linear stochastic fractional heat equation with vanishing initial condition: $$
  \frac{\partial u (t,x)}{\partial t}=-(-\Delta)^{\frac{\alpha}2}u (t,x) + \dot{W}(t,x),\quad t&gt; 0,\,
  x\in \mathbb R, $$
  where $-(-\Delta)^{\frac{\alpha}{2}}$ denotes the fractional Laplacian with power $\alpha\in (1,2]$, and the driving noise $\dot W$ is a centered Gaussian field which is white in time and has the covariance of a fractional Brownian motion with Hurst parameter $H\in\left(\frac {2-\alpha}2,1\right)$. We establish Chung's law of the iterated logarithm for the solution at $t=0$.</description>

      <title>Fluctuating Hydrodynamics of the Ising-Kac-Kawasaki Model and Nonlinear Fluctuations Near Criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the scaling limit behavior of a family of conservative SPDEs as the fluctuating Ising-Kac-Kawasaki dynamics. Precisely, we show that there exists a sequence of the one-dimensional rescaled fluctuating Ising-Kac-Kawasaki equation converges to the solution of the stochastic Cahn-Hilliard equation. This solves a simple version of the conjecture concerning the nonlinear fluctuation phenomenon, proposed by [Giacomin, Lebowitz, Presutti; Math. Surveys Monogr., 1999]. Furthermore, we prove a multi-scale dynamical large deviations in a small noise regime. Finally, we show the $\Gamma$-convergence of the rate function for the rescaled fluctuating Ising-Kac-Kawasaki equation to the rate function of the Cahn-Hilliard equation.</description>

      <title>A Critical Drift-Diffusion Equation: Intermittent Behavior via Geometric Brownian Motion on $ \textbf{SL}(n)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper concerns the so-called diffusion in the curl of the 2d Gaussian free field, and its generalization to higher dimensions $n \geq 2$, building on the scale-by-scale homogenization approach developed recently by Chatzigeorgiou, Morfe, Otto, and Wang [13]. It begins by reformulating the approximation scheme of that work in terms of SDEs in the length scale $L$. This exposes an unexpected connection with a certain geometric Brownian motion on the special linear group $\textbf{SL}(n)$. The analysis of this process sheds light on the original problem, particularly as it pertains to intermittent behavior exhibited by the (averaged) Lagrangian coordinate.</description>

      <title>Infinite Anticipation Backward Stochastic Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a new type of backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs) with infinite anticipation, where the generator depends on the entire future values of the solution in infinite horizon. We show that the new BSDEs has a unique solution and admits a comparison result. In the end, we solve a stochastic control problem via a duality between BSDEs with infinite anticipation and stochastic differential equations (SDEs) with infinite delay.</description>

      <title>A simpler path to Ergodic Theorems for the Frontier of Branching Brownian Motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the ergodic theorem for the frontier of branching Brownian motion (BBM). Motivated by the proof of Arguin, Bovier, and Kistler \cite{arguin2012ergodic}, we provide a shorter and more direct argument. It relies on two observations: pairs of extremal particles observed at distinct times far apart must have branched early, and pairs of early-branching extremal particles have negatively correlated positions. This yields the ergodic theorem for BBM. We also address a gap in the path localization argument of \cite{arguin2012ergodic}.</description>

      <title>Optimal graph joining with applications to isomorphism detection and identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14862v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce an optimal transport based approach for comparing undirected graphs with non-negative edge weights and general vertex labels, and we study connections between the resulting linear program and the graph isomorphism problem. Our approach is based on the notion of a joining of two graphs $G$ and $H$, which is a product graph that preserves their marginal structure. Given $G$ and $H$ and a vertex-based cost function $c$, the optimal graph joining (OGJ) problem finds a joining of $G$ and $H$ minimizing degree weighted cost. The OGJ problem can be written as a linear program with a convex polyhedral solution set. We establish several basic properties of the OGJ problem, and present theoretical results connecting the OGJ problem to the graph isomorphism problem. In particular, we examine a variety of conditions on graph families that are sufficient to ensure that for every pair of graphs $G$ and $H$ in the family (i) $G$ and $H$ are isomorphic if and only if their optimal joining cost is zero, and (ii) if $G$ and $H$ are isomorphic, the the extreme points of the solution set of the OGJ problem are deterministic joinings corresponding to the isomorphisms from $G$ to $H$.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Kinetics of Protein Molecules in a Gene Expression Model under Burst Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14913v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The burst approximation is a widely-used technique to simplify stochastic gene expression models. However, both analytical results and efficient algorithms are currently unavailable for general models under the burst approximation. In this article, we systematically analyze surrogate models with multiple gene states. Analytical solution to the chemical master equation is provided, which is further exploited from two perspectives. Theoretically, several inequalities are established using functional analysis. We conclude that the steady-state distribution of protein copy number is bounded from above by a constant multiple of some negative binomial distribution if the burst size is geometrically distributed. Computationally, efficient algorithms are developed under three circumstances based on the standard binomial moment method.</description>

      <title>An Information-Theoretic Route to Isoperimetric Inequalities via Heat Flow and Entropy Dissipation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15356v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop an information-theoretic approach to isoperimetric inequalities based on entropy dissipation under heat flow. By viewing diffusion as a noisy information channel, we measure how mutual information about set membership decays over time. This decay rate is shown to be determined by the boundary measure of the set, leading to a new proof of the Euclidean isoperimetric inequality with its sharp constant. The method extends to Riemannian manifolds satisfying curvature-dimension conditions, yielding Levy-Gromov and Gaussian isoperimetric results within a single analytic principle. Quantitative and stability bounds follow from refined entropy inequalities linking information loss to geometric rigidity. The approach connects geometric analysis and information theory, revealing how entropy dissipation encodes the geometry of diffusion and boundary.</description>

      <title>A sharp threshold for arithmetic effects on the tail probabilities of lacunary sums</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A classical observation in analysis asserts that lacunary systems of dilated functions show many properties which are also typical for systems of independent random variables. For example, if $(n_k)_{k \ge 1}$ is a sequence of integers satisfying the Hadamard gap condition $n_{k+1}/n_k\ge q &gt; 1,~k \ge 1$, then the normalized sums $\sum_{n=1}^N \cos(2\pi n_k x)$, considered on the probability space $[0,1]$ with Borel $\sigma$-field and Lebesgue measure, satisfy the central limit theorem (CLT) and the law of the iterated logarithm (LIL). Remarkably, the situation becomes much more deliacate when the trigonometric function $\cos(2 \pi x)$ is replaced by a more general 1-periodic function $f$, and fine arithmetic properties of the sequence $(n_k)_{k \ge 1}$ come into play. The most relevant arithmetic property can be phrased in terms of the number of solutions of certain 2-variable Diophantine equations. Recently, the authors proved that the validity of the LIL requires a strictly stronger Diophantine criterion than the CLT. In the present paper we show that this is only a special case of a wide-ranging general principle: there is a sharp cutoff, which can be expressed in form of a Diophantine criterion on the sequence $(n_k)_{k \ge 1}$, at which the tail probabilities of $\sum_{k=1}^N f(n_k x)$ change from Gaussian to potentially erratic behavior. More precisely, let $L(N,a,b,c)$ be the number of solutions $(k,\ell)$ of the equation $a n_k - b n_\ell= c$, where $1\leq k,\ell \leq N$. Roughly speaking, we prove: if $L(N,a,b,c) \le N / g_N$ for some $g_N$, then $\mathbb{P} \left[\sum_{k=1}^N f(n_k x) &gt; t \|f\|_2 \sqrt{N} \right]$ is asymptotically is accordance with standard normal behavior for all $t$ up to $\sqrt{2 \log g_N}$. We also show that this criterion is optimal in the sense that under the same premises, the conclusion can fail to be true for values of $t$ beyond this threshold.</description>

      <title>A covariance formula for topological events of smooth Gaussian fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:1811.08169v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive a covariance formula for the class of `topological events' of smooth Gaussian fields on manifolds; these are events that depend only on the topology of the level sets of the field, for example (i) crossing events for level or excursion sets, (ii) events measurable with respect to the number of connected components of level or excursion sets of a given diffeomorphism class, and (iii) persistence events. As an application of the covariance formula, we derive strong mixing bounds for topological events, as well as lower concentration inequalities for additive topological functionals (e.g. the number of connected components) of the level sets that satisfy a law of large numbers. The covariance formula also gives an alternate justification of the Harris criterion, which conjecturally describes the boundary of the percolation university class for level sets of stationary Gaussian fields. Our work is inspired by a recent paper by Rivera and Vanneuville, in which a correlation inequality was derived for certain topological events on the plane, as well as by an old result of Piterbarg, in which a similar covariance formula was established for finite-dimensional Gaussian vectors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2111.09059v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the connectivity of the excursion sets of additive Gaussian fields, i.e.\ stationary centred Gaussian fields whose covariance function decomposes into a sum of terms that depend separately on the coordinates. Our main result is that, under mild smoothness and correlation decay assumptions, the excursion sets $\{f \le \ell\}$ of additive planar Gaussian fields are bounded almost surely at the critical level $\ell_c = 0$. Since we do not assume positive correlations, this provides the first examples of continuous non-positively-correlated stationary planar Gaussian fields for which the boundedness of the nodal domains has been confirmed. By contrast, in dimension $d \ge 3$ the excursion sets have unbounded components at all levels.</description>

      <title>Universality of the Wigner-Gurau limit for random tensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14144v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we develop a combinatorial approach for studying moments of the resolvent trace for random tensors proposed by Razvan Gurau. Our work is based on the study of hypergraphs and extends the combinatorial proof of moments convergence for Wigner's theorem. This also opens up paths for research akin to free probability for random tensors.
  \par Specifically, trace invariants form a complete family of tensor invariants and constitute the moments of the resolvent trace. For a random tensor with entries independent, centered, with the right variance and bounded moments, we prove the convergence of the expectation and bound the variance of the balanced single trace invariant. This is the universality of the convergence of the moments of the tensor towards the limiting moments given by the Fuss-Catalan numbers, which are the moments of the law obtained by Gurau in the Gaussian case. This generalizes Wigner's theorem for random tensors.
  \par Additionally, in the Gaussian case, we show that the limiting distribution of the moments of the $k$-times contracted $p$-order random tensor by a deterministic vector is always the one of a dilated Wigner-Gurau law at order $p-k$. This establishes a connection with the approach of random tensors through study of the matrix given by the $p-2$ contractions of the tensor.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study well-posedness of McKean-Vlasov stochastic differential equations (SDE) whose drift depends pointwisely on marginal density and satisfies a local integrability condition in time-space variables. The drift and noise coefficients are assumed to be Lipschitz continuous in distribution variable with respect to Wasserstein metric $W_p$. Our approach is by approximation with mollifiers. We prove strong existence of a solution. Weak and strong uniqueness are obtained when $p=1$, the drift coefficient is bounded, and the diffusion coefficient is distribution free.</description>

      <title>Concentration and moment inequalities for sums of independent heavy-tailed random matrices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12948v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove Fuk-Nagaev and Rosenthal-type inequalities for sums of independent random matrices, focusing on the situation when the norms of the matrices possess finite moments of only low orders. Our bounds depend on the ``intrinsic'' dimensional characteristics such as the effective rank, as opposed to the dimension of the ambient space. We illustrate the advantages of such results through several applications, including new moment inequalities for sample covariance matrices and their eigenvectors when the underlying distribution is heavy-tailed. Moreover, we demonstrate that our techniques yield sharpened versions of moment inequalities for empirical processes.</description>

      <title>A connection between the random pinning model and random walks in sparse random environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14229v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The purpose of this short note is to establish a connection between a one-dimensional random walk in a random sparse environment and the random pinning model. We show that the grand canonical partition function of the pinning model coincides with the mean number of returns to the origin for a random walk in a random sparse environment averaged on the randomness location. We obtain thereof some information on the integrability of the number of return times in the annealed and partially annealed setups.</description>

      <title>Infinite-dimensional diffusions and depletion interaction for a model of colloids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15628v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider infinite-dimensional random diffusion dynamics for the Asakura--Oosawa model of interacting hard spheres of two different sizes. We construct a solution to the corresponding SDE with collision local times, analyse its reversible measures, and observe the emergence of an attractive short-range depletion interaction between the large spheres. We study the Gibbs measures associated to this new interaction, exploring connections to percolation and optimal packing.</description>

      <title>Limit Theorems For Non-Hermitian Ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04828v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The distribution of the modulus of the extreme eigenvalues is investigated for the complex Ginibre and complex induced Ginibre ensembles in the limit of large dimensions of random matrices. The limiting distribution of the scaled spectral radius and the scaled minimum modulus for the complex induced Ginibre ensemble, with a proportional rectangularity index, is the Gumbel distribution. The independence of these extrema is established, at appropriate scaling, for large matrices from the complex Ginibre ensemble as well as from the complex induced Ginibre ensemble for fixed and proportional rectangularity indexes. In the limit of a large size of the complex Ginibre matrices, the left and right tail distributions of the minimum modulus are the Rayleigh and Weibull distributions, respectively. The limiting left tail distribution of the minimum modulus is the same for these non-Hermitian ensembles when the rectangularity index of the complex induced Ginibre ensemble is equal to zero. This phenomenon is also verified for the right tail distribution of this minimum.</description>

      <title>Precompactness of sequences of random variables and random curves revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17976v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies when a sequence of probability measures on a metric space admit subsequential weak limits. A sufficient condition called sequential tightness is formulated, which relaxes some assumptions for asymptotic tightness used in the Prokhorov -- Le Cam theorem. The proof only uses elementary tools from probability theory.
  Sequential tightness gives means to characterize the precompact collections of random curves on a compact geodesic metric space in terms of an annulus crossing condition, which generalizes the one by Aizenman and Burchard by allowing estimates for annulus crossing probabilities to be non-uniform over the modulus of annuli.</description>

      <title>Local pathwise solutions and regularization by noises for the stochastic hyperbolic Keller-Segel equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17673v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the Cauchy problem associated with the stochastic hyperbolic Keller-Segel (SHKS) equation featuring multiplicative noises on the torus $\mathbb{T}^d$. First, we establish the local existence and uniqueness of pathwise solutions to the SHKS equation within Sobolev spaces $H^s(\mathbb{T}^d)$ for $s&gt;\frac{d}{2}+1$, under appropriate regularity conditions imposed on the nonlinear multiplicative noises. Subsequently, we explore two global results pertaining to noise-induced regularization: (1) The first result demonstrates that for polynomial-type nonlinear noises, when the noise intensity parameters meet specific threshold conditions, the SHKS equation possesses a unique pathwise solution for large initial data with probability one. This finding provides a partial answer to a question that has remained unresolved in the deterministic setting; (2) The second result reveals that, for small initial data, or equivalently when dealing with linear multiplicative noises with sufficiently large intensity (allowed to be negative), the SHKS equation admits a unique pathwise solution with high probability.</description>

      <title>Dyson Equation for Correlated Linearizations and Test Error of Random Features Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.09194v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper develops some theory of the Dyson equation for correlated linearizations and uses it to solve a problem on asymptotic deterministic equivalent for the test error in random features regression. The theory developed for the correlated Dyson equation includes existence-uniqueness, spectral support bounds, and stability properties. This theory is new for constructing deterministic equivalents for pseudo-resolvents of a class of linearizations with correlated entries. In the application, this theory is used to give a deterministic equivalent of the test error in random features ridge regression, in a proportional scaling regime, wherein we have conditioned on both training and test datasets.</description>

      <title>On the randomized Euler scheme for SDEs with integral-form drift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20481v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the problem of strong approximation of the solutions of stochastic differential equations (SDEs) when the drift coefficient is given in integral form. We investigate its upper error bounds, in terms of the discretization parameter $n$ and the size $M$ of the random sample drawn at each step of the algorithm, in different subclasses of coefficients of the underlying SDE presenting various rates of convergence. Integral-form drift often appears when analyzing stochastic dynamics of optimization procedures in machine learning (ML) problems. Hence, we additionally discuss connections of the defined randomized Euler approximation scheme with the perturbed version of the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm. Finally, the results of numerical experiments performed using GPU architecture are also reported, including a comparison with other popular optimizers used in ML.</description>

Abstract: In the present paper, Probability weighted moments (PWMs) method for parameter estimation of the median based unit weibull (MBUW) distribution is discussed. The most widely used first order PWMs is compared with the higher order PWMs for parameter estimation of (MBUW) distribution. Asymptotic distribution of this PWM estimator is derived. This comparison is illustrated using real data analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19121v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study weak well-posedness of a McKean-Vlasov stochastic differential equations (SDEs) whose drift is density-dependent and whose diffusion is constant. The existence part is due to H\"older stability estimates of the associated Euler-Maruyama scheme. The uniqueness part is due to that of the associated Fokker-Planck equation. We also obtain convergence rate in weighted $L^1$ norm for the Euler-Maruyama scheme.</description>

      <title>Entropic additive energy and entropy inequalities for sums and products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20813v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Following a growing number of studies that, over the past 15 years, have established entropy inequalities via ideas and tools from additive combinatorics, in this work we obtain a number of new bounds for the differential entropy of sums, products, and sum-product combinations of continuous random variables. Partly motivated by recent work by Goh on the discrete entropic version of the notion of "additive energy", we introduce the additive energy of pairs of continuous random variables and prove various versions of the statement that "the additive energy is large if and only if the entropy of the sum is small", along with a version of the Balog-Szemer\'edi-Gowers theorem for differential entropy. Then, motivated in part by recent work by M\'ath\'e and O'Regan, we establish a series of new differential entropy inequalities for products and sum-product combinations of continuous random variables. In particular, we prove a new, general, ring Pl\"unnecke-Ruzsa entropy inequality. We briefly return to the case of discrete entropy and provide a characterization of discrete random variables with "large doubling", analogous to Tao's Freiman-type inverse sumset theory for the case of small doubling. Finally, we consider the natural entropic analog of the Erd\"os-Szemer\'edi sum-product phenomenon for integer-valued random variables. We show that, if it does hold, then the range of parameters for which it does would necessarily be significantly more restricted than its anticipated combinatorial counterpart.</description>

      <title>Analytic and numerical toolkit for the Anderson model in one dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06903v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Anderson model in one dimension is a quantum particle on a discrete chain of sites with nearest-neighbor hopping and random on-site potentials. It is a progenitor of many further models of disordered systems, and it has spurred numerous developments in various branches of physics. The literature does not readily provide, however, practical analytic tools for computing the density-of-states of this model when the distribution of the on-site potentials is arbitrary. Here, supersymmetry-based techniques are employed to give an explicit linear integral equation whose solutions control the density-of-states. The output of this analytic procedure is in perfect agreement with numerical sampling. By Thouless formula, these results immediately provide analytic control over the localization length.</description>
