      <title>A New Deep-learning-Based Approach For mRNA Optimization: High Fidelity, Computation Efficiency, and Multiple Optimization Factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mRNA optimization is critical for therapeutic and biotechnological applications, since sequence features directly govern protein expression levels and efficacy. However, current methods face significant challenges in simultaneously achieving three key objectives: (1) fidelity (preventing unintended amino acid changes), (2) computational efficiency (speed and scalability), and (3) the scope of optimization variables considered (multi-objective capability). Furthermore, existing methods often fall short of comprehensively incorporating the factors related to the mRNA lifecycle and translation process, including intrinsic mRNA sequence properties, secondary structure, translation elongation kinetics, and tRNA availability. To address these limitations, we introduce \textbf{RNop}, a novel deep learning-based method for mRNA optimization. We collect a large-scale dataset containing over 3 million sequences and design four specialized loss functions, the GPLoss, CAILoss, tAILoss, and MFELoss, which simultaneously enable explicit control over sequence fidelity while optimizing species-specific codon adaptation, tRNA availability, and desirable mRNA secondary structure features. Then, we demonstrate RNop's effectiveness through extensive in silico and in vivo experiments. RNop ensures high sequence fidelity, achieves significant computational throughput up to 47.32 sequences/s, and yields optimized mRNA sequences resulting in a significant increase in protein expression for functional proteins compared to controls. RNop surpasses current methodologies in both quantitative metrics and experimental validation, enlightening a new dawn for efficient and effective mRNA design.

      <title>Unsupervised Evolutionary Cell Type Matching via Entropy-Minimized Optimal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying evolutionary correspondences between cell types across species is a fundamental challenge in comparative genomics and evolutionary biology. Existing approaches often rely on either reference-based matching, which imposes asymmetry by designating one species as the reference, or projection-based matching, which may increase computational complexity and obscure biological interpretability at the cell-type level. Here, we present OT-MESH, an unsupervised computational framework leveraging entropy-regularized optimal transport (OT) to systematically determine cross-species cell type homologies. Our method uniquely integrates the Minimize Entropy of Sinkhorn (MESH) technique to refine the OT plan. It begins by selecting genes with high Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) to capture the most informative features, from which a cost matrix is constructed using cosine distances between cell-type centroids. Importantly, the MESH procedure iteratively refines the cost matrix, leading to a transport plan with significantly enhanced sparsity and interpretability of the resulting correspondence matrices. Applied to retinal bipolar cells (BCs) and retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) from mouse and macaque, OT-MESH accurately recovers known evolutionary relationships and uncovers novel correspondences, one of which was independently validated experimentally. Thus, our framework offers a principled, scalable, symmetric, and interpretable solution for evolutionary cell type mapping, facilitating deeper insights into cellular specialization and conservation across species.</description>

      <title>Estimating dynamic transmission rates with a Black-Karasinski process in stochastic SIHR models using particle MCMC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24127v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Compartmental models are effective in modeling the spread of infectious pathogens, but have remaining weaknesses in fitting to real datasets exhibiting stochastic effects. We propose a stochastic SIHR model with a dynamic transmission rate, where the rate is modeled by the Black-Karasinski (BK) process - a mean-reverting stochastic process with a stable equilibrium distribution, making it well-suited for modeling long-term epidemic dynamics. To generate sample paths of the BK process and estimate static parameters of the system, we employ particle Markov Chain Monte Carlo (pMCMC) methods due to their effectiveness in handling complex state-space models and jointly estimating parameters. We designed experiments on synthetic data to assess estimation accuracy and its impact on inferred transmission rates; all BK-process parameters were estimated accurately except the mean-reverting rate. We also assess the sensitivity of pMCMC to misspecification of the mean-reversion rate. Our results show that estimation accuracy remains stable across different mean-reversion rates, though smaller values increase error variance and complicate inference results. Finally, we apply our model to Arizona flu hospitalization data, finding that parameter estimates are consistent with published survey data.</description>

      <title>Investigating the effectiveness of multimodal data in forecasting SARS-COV-2 case surges</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22688v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic response relied heavily on statistical and machine learning models to predict key outcomes such as case prevalence and fatality rates. These predictions were instrumental in enabling timely public health interventions that helped break transmission cycles. While most existing models are grounded in traditional epidemiological data, the potential of alternative datasets, such as those derived from genomic information and human behavior, remains underexplored. In the current study, we investigated the usefulness of diverse modalities of feature sets in predicting case surges. Our results highlight the relative effectiveness of biological (e.g., mutations), public health (e.g., case counts, policy interventions) and human behavioral features (e.g., mobility and social media conversations) in predicting country-level case surges. Importantly, we uncover considerable heterogeneity in predictive performance across countries and feature modalities, suggesting that surge prediction models may need to be tailored to specific national contexts and pandemic phases. Overall, our work highlights the value of integrating alternative data sources into existing disease surveillance frameworks to enhance the prediction of pandemic dynamics.</description>

      <title>Identifying biological perturbation targets through causal differential networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03380v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Identifying variables responsible for changes to a biological system enables applications in drug target discovery and cell engineering. Given a pair of observational and interventional datasets, the goal is to isolate the subset of observed variables that were the targets of the intervention. Directly applying causal discovery algorithms is challenging: the data may contain thousands of variables with as few as tens of samples per intervention, and biological systems do not adhere to classical causality assumptions. We propose a causality-inspired approach to address this practical setting. First, we infer noisy causal graphs from the observational and interventional data. Then, we learn to map the differences between these graphs, along with additional statistical features, to sets of variables that were intervened upon. Both modules are jointly trained in a supervised framework, on simulated and real data that reflect the nature of biological interventions. This approach consistently outperforms baselines for perturbation modeling on seven single-cell transcriptomics datasets. We also demonstrate significant improvements over current causal discovery methods for predicting soft and hard intervention targets across a variety of synthetic data.</description>

      <title>Graphical Models and Efficient Inference Methods for Multivariate Phase Probability Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00459v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multivariate phase relationships are important to characterize and understand numerous physical, biological, and chemical systems, from electromagnetic waves to neural oscillations. These systems exhibit complex spatiotemporal dynamics and intricate interdependencies among their constituent elements. While classical models of multivariate phase relationships, such as the wave equation and Kuramoto model, give theoretical models to describe phenomena, the development of statistical tools for hypothesis testing and inference for multivariate phase relationships in complex systems remains limited. This paper introduces a novel probabilistic modeling framework to characterize multivariate phase relationships, with wave-like phenomena serving as a key example. This approach describes spatial patterns and interactions between oscillators through a pairwise exponential family distribution. Building upon the literature of graphical model inference, including methods like Ising models, graphical lasso, and interaction screening, this work bridges the gap between classical wave dynamics and modern statistical approaches. Efficient inference methods are introduced, leveraging the Chow-Liu algorithm for directed tree approximations and interaction screening for general graphical models. Simulated experiments demonstrate the utility of these methods for uncovering wave properties and sparse interaction structures, highlighting their applicability to diverse scientific domains. This framework establishes a new paradigm for statistical modeling of multivariate phase relationships, providing a powerful toolset for exploring the complexity of these systems.</description>

      <title>Multi-Modal Spectral Parametrization Method (MMSPM) for analyzing EEG activity with distinct scaling regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18117v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Aperiodic neural activity has been the subject of intense research interest lately as it could reflect on the cortical excitation/inhibition ratio, which is suspected to be affected in numerous clinical conditions. This phenomenon is characterized via the aperiodic scaling exponent $\beta$, equal to the spectral slope following log-log transformation of power spectra. Despite recent progress, however, most current methods do not take into consideration the plausible multimodal nature in the power spectra of neurophysiological recordings - i.e., $\beta$ might be different in low- ($\beta_{lo}$) and high-frequency ($\beta_{hi}$) regimes -, especially in case of $|\beta_{lo}|&gt;|\beta_{hi}|$. Here we propose an algorithm, the multi-modal spectral parametrization method (MMSPM) that aims to account for this issue. MMSPM estimates $\beta_{lo}$ and $\beta_{hi}$ separately using a constrained, piece-wise regression technique, and also assesses if they are significantly different or instead the spectrum is indeed unimodal and can be characterized simply with broadband $\beta$. Here we present the MMSPM algorithm and evaluate its performance in silico on simulated power spectra. Then, we use MMSPM on resting-state electroencephalography (EEG) data collected from 19 young, healthy volunteers, as well as on a separate dataset of EEG recordings from 30 schizophrenia patients and 31 healthy controls, and demonstrate that broadband (0.1-100 Hz and 0.5-45 Hz) EEG spectra can indeed present a bimodality pattern with significantly steeper low-range ($&lt;\sim2$ Hz) and flatter high-range scaling regimes (i.e., $|\beta_{lo}|&gt;|\beta_{hi}|$).
  Clinical relevance: The MMSPM method characterizes aperiodic neural activity in distinct scaling regimes, which can be relevant in numerous pathological conditions such as dementia or schizophrenia.</description>
