      <title>Anonymous monitoring enables turn-taking and sustainablity in collective resource governance: Multi-player evolutionary dynamical-systems game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sustainable resource use in large societies requires social institutions that specify acceptable behavior and punish violators. Because mutual monitoring becomes prohibitively costly as populations grow, we examine whether sustainability can be maintained when only anonymized information is available. Using the evolutionary dynamical-systems game framework, we model the common-pool resource management game. In the model, each player's harvesting decisions shape the resource dynamics and depend on the resource's state, the player's wealth, and the group average wealth. Strategies are encoded as two-parameter decision-making functions that mutate across generations. Evolutionary simulations reveal that players self-organize into clusters that alternate harvesting turns: individuals within a cluster harvest synchronously, while the clusters themselves take turns. The emergent institutional rule is strikingly simple: "wait when rich, harvest when below average." While the majority cluster tends to exploit the minority, moderate diversity in decision parameters of strategies allows "turn-taking of turns" between the majority and minority roles, improving efficiency, equity, and resistance to selfish mutants. We quantify the difficulty of managing institutions as population size increases. When group size is fixed, the minimum number of groups required for cooperation grows exponentially with group size. If, however, groups enlarge gradually, the scaling transitions to a power law, indicating that institutions remain stable when they are first built in small populations and subsequently adapted to larger ones. Our findings provide a theoretical basis for the self-organization of institutions in large societies, illuminating how anonymized information can coordinate behavior and how institutional success depends on its developmental trajectory.</description>

      <title>The role of media memorability in facilitating startups' access to venture capital funding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Media reputation plays an important role in attracting venture capital investment. However, prior research has focused too narrowly on general media exposure, limiting our understanding of how media truly influences funding decisions. As informed decision-makers, venture capitalists respond to more nuanced aspects of media content. We introduce the concept of media memorability - the media's ability to imprint a startup's name in the memory of relevant investors. Using data from 197 UK startups in the micro and nanotechnology sector (funded between 1995 and 2004), we show that media memorability significantly influences investment outcomes. Our findings suggest that venture capitalists rely on detailed cues such as a startup's distinctiveness and connectivity within news semantic networks. This contributes to research on entrepreneurial finance and media legitimation. In practice, startups should go beyond frequent media mentions to strengthen brand memorability through more targeted, meaningful coverage highlighting their uniqueness and relevance within the broader industry conversation.</description>

      <title>Opinion formation in Wikipedia Ising networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study properties of opinion formation
  on Wikipedia Ising Networks. Each Wikipedia article
  is represented as a node and links are formed by citations of
  one article to another generating a directed network
  of a given language edition with millions of nodes.
  Ising spins are placed at each node
  and their orientation up or down is determined by a majority vote
  of connected neighbors. At the initial stage there are only
  a few nodes from two groups with fixed competing opinions up and down
  while other nodes are assumed to have no initial opinion with no
  effect on the vote. The competition of two opinions is modeled by
  an asynchronous Monte Carlo process converging to a spin polarized
  steady-state phase.
  This phase remains stable with respect to small fluctuations
  induced by an effective temperature of the Monte Carlo process.
  The opinion polarization at the steady-state provides
  opinion (spin) preferences for each node. In the framework of
  this Ising Network
  Opinion Formation model we analyze the influence and competition between
  political leaders, world countries and social concepts.
  This approach is also generalized to the competition between
  three groups of
  different opinions described by three colors, for example
  Donald Trump, Vladimir Putin, Xi Jinping or USA, Russia, China
  within English, Russian and Chinese editions of Wikipedia of March 2025.
  We argue that this approach provides a generic description of
  opinion formation in various complex networks.</description>

      <title>Human Mobility in Epidemic Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Human mobility forms the backbone of contact patterns through which infectious diseases propagate, fundamentally shaping the spatio-temporal dynamics of epidemics and pandemics. While traditional models are often based on the assumption that all individuals have the same probability of infecting every other individual in the population, a so-called random homogeneous mixing, they struggle to capture the complex and heterogeneous nature of real-world human interactions. Recent advancements in data-driven methodologies and computational capabilities have unlocked the potential of integrating high-resolution human mobility data into epidemic modeling, significantly improving the accuracy, timeliness, and applicability of epidemic risk assessment, contact tracing, and intervention strategies. This review provides a comprehensive synthesis of the current landscape in human mobility-informed epidemic modeling. We explore diverse sources and representations of human mobility data, and then examine the behavioral and structural roles of mobility and contact in shaping disease transmission dynamics. Furthermore, the review spans a wide range of epidemic modeling approaches, ranging from classical compartmental models to network-based, agent-based, and machine learning models. And we also discuss how mobility integration enhances risk management and response strategies during epidemics. By synthesizing these insights, the review can serve as a foundational resource for researchers and practitioners, bridging the gap between epidemiological theory and the dynamic complexities of human interaction while charting clear directions for future research.</description>

      <title>A Weighted-Median Model of Opinion Dynamics on Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17552v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Social interactions influence people's opinions. In some situations, these interactions result in a consensus opinion; in others, they result in opinion fragmentation and the formation of different opinion groups in the form of "echo chambers". Consider a social network of individuals, who hold continuous-valued scalar opinions and change their opinions when they interact with each other. In such an opinion model, it is common for an opinion-update rule to depend on the mean opinion of interacting individuals. However, we consider an alternative update rule - which may be more realistic in some situations - that instead depends on a weighted median opinion of interacting individuals. Through numerical simulations of our opinion model, we investigate how the limit opinion distribution depends on network structure. For configuration-model networks, we also derive a mean-field approximation for the asymptotic dynamics of the opinion distribution when there are infinitely many individuals in a network.</description>

      <title>From News Source Sharers to Post Viewers: How Topic Diversity and Conspiracy Theories Shape Engagement With Misinformation During a Health Crisis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08832v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Online engagement with misinformation threatens societal well-being, particularly during health crises when susceptibility to misinformation is heightened in a multi-topic context. Here, we focus on the COVID-19 pandemic and address a critical gap in understanding engagement with multi-topic misinformation on social media at two user levels: news source sharers (who post news items) and post viewers (who engage with news posts). To this end, we analyze 7273 fact-checked source news items and their associated posts on X through the lens of topic diversity and conspiracy theories. We find that false news, especially those containing conspiracy theories, exhibits higher topic diversity than true news. At news source sharer level, false news has a longer lifetime and receives more posts on X than true news, with conspiracy theories further extending its longevity. However, topic diversity does not significantly influence news source sharers' engagement. At post viewer level, contrary to news source sharer level, posts characterized by heightened topic diversity receive more reposts, likes, and replies. Notably, post viewers tend to engage more with misinformation containing conspiracy narratives: false news posts that contain conspiracy theories, on average, receive 40.8% more reposts, 45.2% more likes, and 44.1% more replies compared to those without conspiracy theories. Our findings suggest that news source sharers and post viewers exhibit distinct engagement patterns on X, offering valuable insights into refining misinformation interventions at these two user levels.</description>
