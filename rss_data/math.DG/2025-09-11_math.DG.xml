      <description>arXiv:2509.09405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce for any exponent $p&gt;1$ the $p$-curvature functional for rectifiable curves in the two-dimensional sphere. We prove that this functional is finite and agrees with the integral of the geodesic curvature raised to the power $p$ on curves whose arc length parameterization is in the Sobolev class $W^{2,p}$.</description>

      <title>Transgressive Harmonic Maps and SU(1,1) Self-Duality Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a duality between harmonic maps from Riemann surfaces to hyperbolic 3-space $\mathbb{H}^3$ and harmonic maps from Riemann surfaces to de Sitter three-space $\operatorname{dS}_3$, best viewed as a generalized Gauss map. On the gauge theoretic side, it matches SU(2) and SU(1,1) solutions of Hitchin's self-duality equations via a signature flip along an eigenline of the Higgs field. Reversing this operation typically produces singular solutions, occurring where the eigenline becomes lightlike. Motivated by explicit model examples and this singular behavior, we extend this duality to a class of transgressive harmonic maps $f:M\to \mathbb{S}^3$: these are harmonic on the hemispheres equipped with the hyperbolic metric, intersect the equator orthogonally, and have vanishing Hopf differential along the crossing set. We construct large families by gluing and analyze their regularity, and as an application obtain $\tau$-real negative sections of the Deligne--Hitchin moduli space of arbitrarily large energy that are not twistor lines.</description>

      <title>On some special symmetries of a biwarped product-type 3-manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate special Killing vector fields on 3-dimensional Riemannian manifolds of biwarped product-type. Starting from a diagonal metric on $\mathbb R^3$ determined by two nontrivial warping functions and a constant scaling factor, we derive the system of equations characterizing Killing fields and provide a description of their structure. Families of solutions are obtained, depending on the expressions and on the relations between the warping functions, including explicit examples of both warped and biwarped product cases. These results continue recent work on symmetries of manifolds with diagonal metrics.</description>

      <title>Symbolic dynamics for non-uniformly hyperbolic flows in high dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09050v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct symbolic dynamics for flows with positive speed in any dimension: for each $\chi&gt;0$, we code a set that has full measure for every invariant probability measure which is $\chi$--hyperbolic. In particular, the coded set contains all hyperbolic periodic orbits with Lyapunov exponents outside of $[-\chi,\chi]$. This extends the recent work of Buzzi, Crovisier, and Lima for three dimensional flows with positive speed. As an application, we code homoclinic classes of measures by suspensions of irreducible countable Markov shifts, and prove that each such class has at most one probability measure that maximizes the entropy.</description>

      <title>An entropy formula for the Deep Linear Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the Riemannian geometry of the Deep Linear Network (DLN) as a foundation for a thermodynamic description of the learning process. The main tools are the use of group actions to analyze overparametrization and the use of Riemannian submersion from the space of parameters to the space of observables. The foliation of the balanced manifold in the parameter space by group orbits is used to define and compute a Boltzmann entropy. We also show that the Riemannian geometry on the space of observables defined in [2] is obtained by Riemannian submersion of the balanced manifold. The main technical step is an explicit construction of an orthonormal basis for the tangent space of the balanced manifold using the theory of Jacobi matrices.</description>

      <title>Mountain Pass Critical Points of the Liquid Drop Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider Gamow's liquid drop functional, $\mathcal{E}$, on $\mathbb{R}^3$ and construct non-minimizing, volume constrained, critical points for volumes $3.512 \cong \alpha_0 &lt; V &lt; 10$. In this range, we establish a mountain pass set up between a ball of volume $V$ and two balls of volume $V/2$ infinitely far apart. Intuitively, our critical point corresponds to the maximal energy configuration of an atom of volume $V$ as it undergoes fission into two atoms of volume $V/2$. Our proof relies on geometric measure theoretical methods from the min-max construction of minimal surfaces, and along the way, we address issues of non-compactness, ``pull tight" with a volume constraint, and multiplicity.</description>

      <title>New Homogeneous Solutions for the One-Phase Free Boundary Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For each sufficiently large integer $k$, we construct a domain in the round $2$-sphere with $k$ boundary components which is the link of a cone in $\mathbb{R}^3$ admitting a homogeneous solution to the one-phase free boundary problem. This answers a question of Jerison-Kamburov, and also disproves a conjecture of Souam left open in earlier work. The method exploits a new connection with minimal surfaces, which we also use to construct an infinite family of homogeneous solutions in dimension four.</description>

      <title>A transcendental non-Archimedean Calabi--Yau Theorem with applications to the cscK problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09442v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a compact K\"ahler manifold and $\alpha$ a K\"ahler class on $X$. We prove that if $(X,\alpha)$ is uniformly K-stable for models, then there is a unique cscK metric in $\alpha$. This was first proved in the algebraic case by Chi Li, and it strengthens a related result in an article of Mesquita-Piccione. K-stability for models is defined in terms of big test configurations, but we also give a valuative criterion as in the work of Boucksom--Jonsson together with an explicit formula for the associated $\beta$-invariant. To accomplish this we further develop the non-Archimedean pluripotential theory in the transcendental setting, as initiated in the works of Darvas--Xia--Zhang and Mesquita-Piccione. In particular we prove the continuity of envelopes and orthogonality properties, and using that, we are able to extend the non-Archimedean Calabi-Yau Theorem found in an article of Boucksom--Jonsson to the general K\"ahler setting.</description>

      <title>On Kanai's conjecture for frame flows over negatively curved manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09500v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $M$ be a closed, negatively curved Riemannian manifold of dimension $n \neq 4, 8$ with strictly $1/4$-pinched sectional curvature. We prove, that if the frame flow is ergodic and the sum of its unstable and stable bundles together with its flow direction is $\mathcal{C}^2$, then $M$ is homothetic to a real hyperbolic manifold. This extends to higher dimensions a previous result of Kanai in dimension 3. The proof generalises to isometric extensions of geodesic flows to a principal bundle $P$ with compact structure group and yields the following alternative : either $P$ is flat, or $M$ is hyperbolic.</description>

      <title>A geometric formulation of GENERIC stochastic differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a coordinate-invariant geometric formulation of the GENERIC stochastic differential equation, unifying reversible Hamiltonian and irreversible dissipative dynamics within a differential-geometric framework. Our construction builds on the classical GENERIC formalism, extending it to manifolds by introducing a degenerate Poisson structure, a degenerate co-metric, and a volume form satisfying a unimodularity condition. The resulting equation preserves a particular Boltzmann-type measure, ensures almost-sure conservation of energy, and reduces to the deterministic metriplectic formulation in the zero-noise limit. This geometrization separates system-specific quantities from the ambient space, clarifies the roles of the underlying structures, and provides a foundation for analytic and numerical methods, as well as future extensions to quantum and coarse-grained systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19266v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by Nirenberg's problem on isometric rigidity of tight surfaces, we study closed asymptotic curves $\Gamma$ on negatively curved surfaces $M$ in Euclidean $3$-space. In particular, using C\u{a}lug\u{a}reanu's theorem, we obtain a formula for the linking number $Lk(\Gamma,n)$ of $\Gamma$ with the normal $n$ of $M$. It follows that when $Lk(\Gamma, n)=0$, $\Gamma$ cannot have any locally star-shaped planar projections with vanishing crossing number, which extends observations of Kovaleva, Panov and Arnold. These results hold also for curves with nonvanishing torsion and their binormal vector field. Furthermore we construct an example where $n$ is injective but $Lk(\Gamma, n)\neq 0$, and discuss various restrictions on $\Gamma$ when $n$ is injective.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18503v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of a $\theta$-almost twisted Poisson structure on manifolds, which involves incorporating a closed $1$-form $\theta$ into twisted Poisson structures under specific conditions. We provide a characterization of this structure on low-dimensional manifolds and construct the Lie-Rinehart algebra on the module of $1$-forms on manifolds equipped with this structure. This construction leads to a cochain complex and its associated cohomology, which we refer to as $\theta$-almost twisted Poisson cohomology. An example illustrating this cohomology is also presented on $\mathbb{R}^5$.</description>

      <title>Dolbeault-Morse-Novikov Cohomology on Complex manifolds and its applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04071v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we investigate the topological properties of complex manifolds by studying Dolbeault-Morse-Novikov cohomology. By establishing an integral inequality, we obtain two main results: (1) When a closed complex manifold admits a nonzero parallel $(0,1)$-form, the Dolbeault-Morse-Novikov cohomology must be trivial, which implies that the Hirzebruch $\chi_{y}$-genus vanishes. (2) When a closed complex manifold admits a nowhere vanishing $(0,1)$-form, we establish a vanishing theorem for a certain class of twisted Dirac operators, which also forces the Hirzebruch $\chi_{y}$-genus to be zero. In particular, we prove that the Hirzebruch $\chi_{y}$-genus of a closed complex manifold vanishes if and only if the manifold admits a nowhere vanishing real vector field. These results generalize some classical theorems from Riemannian manifolds to the complex setting. As a culminating application, we prove that the Hirzebruch $\chi_{y}$-genus must vanish on closed Gauduchon manifolds admitting positive holomorphic scalar curvature.</description>

      <title>Null Distance and Temporal Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07158v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The notion of null distance was introduced by Sormani and Vega as part of a broader program to develop a theory of metric convergence adapted to Lorentzian geometry. Given a time function $\tau$ on a spacetime $(M,g)$, the associated null distance $\hat{d}_\tau$ is constructed from and closely related to the causal structure of $M$. While generally only a semi-metric, $\hat{d}_\tau$ becomes a metric when $\tau$ satisfies the local anti-Lipschitz condition.
  In this work, we focus on temporal functions, that is, differentiable functions whose gradient is everywhere past-directed timelike. Sormani and Vega showed that the class of $C^1$ temporal functions coincides with that of $C^1$ locally anti-Lipschitz time functions. When a temporal function $f$ is smooth, its level sets $M_t = f^{-1}(t)$ are spacelike hypersurfaces and thus Riemannian manifolds endowed with the induced metric $h_t$. Our main result establishes that, on any level set $M_t$ where the gradient $\nabla f$ has constant norm, the null distance $\hat{d}_f$ is bounded above by a constant multiple of the Riemannian distance $d_{h_t}$.
  Applying this result to a smooth regular cosmological time function $\tau_g$ -- as introduced by Andersson, Galloway, and Howard -- we prove a theorem confirming a conjecture of Sakovich and Sormani (arXiv:2410.16800, 2025): if the diameters of the level sets $M_t = \tau_g^{-1}(t)$ shrink to zero as $t \to 0$, then the spacetime exhibits a Big Bang singularity, as defined in their work.</description>

Abstract: In the paper "The second cohomology of nilpotent orbits in classical Lie algebras, Kyoto J. Math. 60 (2020), no. 2, 717-799" by I. Biswas, P. Chatterjee, and C. Maity, explicit descriptions of the second and first real de Rham cohomology groups of a general homogeneous space of a Lie group are given, extending an earlier result in "On the exactness of Kostant-Kirillov form and the second cohomology of nilpotent orbits, Internat. J. Math. 23 (2012), no. 8, 1250086" by I. Biswas and P. Chatterjee. From the computational viewpoint, they turned out to be new and very useful, and in fact played a crucial role in determining the second cohomology of nilpotent orbits as done in the above two papers. In this paper, we give computable and explicit descriptions of the third and fourth real de Rham cohomologies of a general homogeneous space, in terms of the associated Lie-theoretic data, along the lines mentioned above. We also draw numerous corollaries of our main results in important special settings. Moreover, as a consequence, we obtain a new and interesting invariant by showing that for a large class of homogeneous spaces, the difference between the third and fourth Betti numbers coincides with the difference between the numbers of simple factors of the ambient group and the associated closed subgroup.</description>

      <title>A topological quantum field theory for $\mathrm{Spin}(7)$-instantons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19403v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a topological quantum field theory based on the moduli space of $\mathrm{Spin}(7)$-instantons on 8-dimensional manifolds. Using the Mathai-Quillen formalism, we derive the action of the theory in purely geometric terms, which coincides with prior results in the literature. We then reformulate the theory within the AKSZ formalism, obtaining a Batalin-Vilkovisky action that, after gauge fixing, matches our Mathai-Quillen construction while making the BRST symmetry explicit and providing a natural framework for classical observables. We also show that the Batalin-Vilkovisky action can be elegantly recast as a Chern-Simons type theory.</description>

      <title>Spaces with Riemannian curvature bounds are universally infinitesimally Hilbertian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05483v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that a metric space $X$ that, at every point, has a Gromov-Hausdorff tangent with the splitting property (i.e. every geodesic line splits off a factor $\mathbb{R}$), is universally infinitesimally Hilbertian (i.e. $W^{1,2}(X,\mu)$ is a Hilbert space for every measure $\mu$). This connects the infinitesimal geometry of $X$ to its analytic properties and is, to our knowledge, the first general criterion guaranteeing universal infinitesimal Hilbertianity. Using it we establish universal infinitesimal Hilbertianity of finite dimensional RCD-spaces. We moreover show that (possibly infinite dimensional) Alexandrov spaces are universally infinitesimally Hilbertian and construct an isometric embedding of tangent modules.</description>

      <title>Mixed Christoffel-Minkowski problems for bodies of revolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09794v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The mixed Christoffel-Minkowski problem asks for necessary and sufficient conditions for a Borel measure on the Euclidean unit sphere to be the mixed area measure of some convex bodies, one of which, appearing multiple times, is free and the rest are fixed. In the case where all bodies involved are symmetric around a common axis, we provide a complete solution to this problem, without assuming any regularity. In particular, we refine Firey's classification of area measures of figures of revolution.
  In our argument, we introduce an easy way to transform mixed area measures and mixed volumes involving axially symmetric bodies, and we significantly improve Firey's estimate on the local behavior of area measures. As a secondary result, we obtain a family of Hadwiger type theorems for convex valuations that are invariant under rotations around an axis.</description>

      <title>The Christoffel problem for the disk area measure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09800v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The mixed Christoffel problem asks for necessary and sufficient conditions for a Borel measure on the Euclidean unit sphere to be the mixed area measure of some convex bodies, all but one of them are fixed. We provide a solution in the case where the fixed reference bodies are (n-1)-dimensional disks with parallel axes and the measure has no mass at the poles of the sphere determined by this axis.</description>
