      <title>Lattice QCD calculations of hadron spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This chapter provides a pedagogical introduction to theoretical studies of hadrons based on the fundamental theory of strong interactions - Quantum ChromoDynamics. A perturbative expansion in the strong coupling is not applicable at hadronic energy scales. Lattice Quantum Chromodynamics is the formulation of the fundamental theory on a discrete space-time grid, which enables first-principles, systematically improvable, numerical simulations of strong interaction physics. This chapter explains how the masses of strongly stable and strongly decaying hadrons are determined. The strongly decaying hadrons have to be inferred from the corresponding scattering processes. Therefore, one of the main aims is to describe how the scattering amplitudes are extracted from a lattice simulation. The examples of spectra, widths, and scattering amplitudes are shown for conventional as well as exotic hadrons.</description>

      <title>Probing how bright the quark-gluon plasma glows in lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Determining the spectrum of photons emitted by the quark-gluon plasma non-perturbatively remains an open computational challenge. In this letter we calculate two moments of that spectrum at a temperature $T\approx 254\,$MeV, employing lattice QCD with two flavors of $\mathrm{O}(a)$-improved Wilson fermions, without facing an inverse problem. Our central value for the difference of these two moments, which is sensitive to photon energies $\omega\gtrsim \pi T$, is lower than, but compatible with that obtained by integrating the leading-order weak-coupling photon spectrum. This study informs the $\textit{direct photon puzzle}$ in heavy-ion collision phenomenology, where it has proved difficult to simultaneously explain the yield and azimuthal anisotropy of photons not originating from final-state hadronic decays.</description>

      <title>A $T_2 \times R^2$ roadmap to Confinement in SU(2) Yang-Mills theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the behaviour of \SU{2} Yang-Mills fields on a $T_2\times R^2$ geometry where the two-torus is equipped with twisted boundary conditions. We monitor the evolution of the dynamics of the system as a function of the torus size $l_s$. For small sizes the behaviour of the system is well understood in terms of semiclassical predictions. In our case, the long distance structure is that of a two-dimensional gas of vortex-like fractional instantons with size and density growing with $l_s$. Our lattice Monte Carlo simulations confirm the semiclassical predictions and allow the determination of the relevant scale signalling the transition to the non-dilute situation. At low densities the string tension takes the standard value of a 2D center-vortex gas, growing with the density and approaching the value measured at infinite volume. Our work includes preliminary studies of the extension to \SU{N} and to the region of large sizes in which boundary conditions are irrelevant, and all physical scales are determined by the $\Lambda$ parameter.</description>

      <title>Scale Factorized-Quantum Field Theory (SF-QFT): An innovative framework for yielding scale and scheme invariant observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce Scale Factorized-Quantum Field Theory (SF-QFT), a framework that performs path-integral factorization of ultraviolet (UV) and infrared (IR) momentum modes at a physical scale $Q^*$ before perturbative expansion. This approach yields a UV-finite effective action whose Wilson coefficients $C_i(Q)$ and coupling $a_{\mathrm{eff}}(Q)$ are fixed by matching to experiment. Because the two-loop $\beta$-function is universal in massless QCD, $a_{\mathrm{eff}}(Q)$ evolves with a scheme-independent equation, with higher-order $\beta$-coefficients absorbed into the $C_i$. Applying SF-QFT to the inclusive ratio $R_{e^{+}e^{-}}$ gives $R^{\mathrm{SF-QFT}}(31.6\,\mathrm{GeV}) = 1.04911 \pm 0.00084$, in excellent agreement with experiment ($R^{\mathrm{exp}}(31.6\,\mathrm{GeV})= 1.0527 \pm 0.005$) while requiring orders of magnitude fewer calculations than a conventional four-loop $\overline{\mathrm{MS}}$ approach. We find universal algebraic recursion relations that generate all higher-order contributions without additional Feynman diagrams, yielding scheme-invariant predictions with remarkable convergence. SF-QFT provides a rigorous proof for the existence of a positive mass gap in Yang-Mills theory, resolving one of the Millennium Prize Problems by demonstrating how non-perturbative effects emerge naturally from the path-integral factorization. For QED, the same formalism integrates out high-energy modes above $Q^*$, producing scheme-independent predictions for the electron anomalous magnetic moment with unprecedented precision ($a_e^{\text{theory}} = 0.001~159~652~183~56(76)$). SF-QFT heralds a paradigm shift in quantum field theory, replacing the pursuit of ever-higher loop orders with a unified framework that handles both perturbative and non-perturbative physics while maintaining manifest gauge invariance and eliminating renormalization ambiguities.</description>

      <title>Window quantities for the hadronic vacuum polarization contributions to the muon anomalous magnetic moment in spacelike and timelike domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The relations between the window quantities for the hadronic vacuum polarization contributions to the muon anomalous magnetic moment $a^{\text{HVP}}_{\mu}$ in spacelike and timelike domains are studied. Two types of window functions (abrupt and smooth) as well as two kinds of kinematic intervals (symmetric and asymmetric with respect to the spacelike/timelike flip) are addressed. It is shown that the evaluations of the window quantities for $a^{\text{HVP}}_{\mu}$ represented in terms of the hadronic vacuum polarization function, the Adler function, and the $R$-ratio of electron-positron annihilation into hadrons are mutually equivalent only if the additional contributions due to the window edge effects are properly taken into account and the explicit expressions for such contributions are derived. The obtained results enable one to accurately compare the window quantities for $a^{\text{HVP}}_{\mu}$ based, e.g., on MUonE or lattice data with the ones based on $R$-ratio data, even if the window function covers different kinematic ranges in spacelike and timelike domains.</description>

      <title>Flowing Through Hilbert Space: Quantum-Enhanced Generative Models for Lattice Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sampling from high-dimensional and structured probability distributions is a fundamental challenge in computational physics, particularly in the context of lattice field theory (LFT), where generating field configurations efficiently is critical, yet computationally intensive. In this work, we apply a previously developed hybrid quantum-classical normalizing flow model to explore quantum-enhanced sampling in such regimes. Our approach embeds parameterized quantum circuits within a classical normalizing flow architecture, leveraging amplitude encoding and quantum entanglement to enhance expressivity in the generative process. The quantum circuit serves as a trainable transformation within the flow, while classical networks provide adaptive coupling and compensate for quantum hardware imperfections. This design enables efficient density estimation and sample generation, potentially reducing the resources required compared to purely classical methods. While LFT provides a representative and physically meaningful application for benchmarking, our focus is on improving the sampling efficiency of generative models through quantum components. This work contributes toward the development of quantum-enhanced generative modeling frameworks that address the sampling bottlenecks encountered in physics and beyond.</description>

      <title>Hadronic vacuum polarization for the muon $g-2$ from lattice QCD: Complete short and intermediate windows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09656v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present complete results for the hadronic vacuum polarization (HVP) contribution to the muon anomalous magnetic moment $a_\mu$ in the short- and intermediate-distance window regions, which account for roughly 10% and 35% of the total HVP contribution to $a_\mu$, respectively. In particular, we perform lattice-QCD calculations for the isospin-symmetric connected and disconnected contributions, as well as corrections due to strong isospin-breaking. For the short-distance window observables, we investigate the so-called log-enhancement effects as well as the significant oscillations associated with staggered quarks in this region. For the dominant, isospin-symmetric light-quark connected contribution, we obtain $a^{ll,\,{\mathrm{SD}}}_{\mu}(\mathrm{conn.}) = 48.139(11)_{\mathrm{stat}}(91)_{\mathrm{syst}}[92]_{\mathrm{total}} \times 10^{-10}$ and $a^{ll,\,{\mathrm{W}}}_{\mu}(\mathrm{conn.}) = 206.90(14)_{\mathrm{stat}}(61)_{\mathrm{syst}}[63]_{\mathrm{total}} \times 10^{-10}$. We use Bayesian model averaging to fully estimate the covariance matrix between the individual contributions. Our determinations of the complete window contributions are $a^{{\mathrm{SD}}}_{\mu} = 69.05(1)_{\mathrm{stat}}(21)_{\mathrm{syst}}[21]_{\mathrm{total}} \times 10^{-10}$ and $a^{{\mathrm{W}}}_{\mu} = 236.45(17)_{\mathrm{stat}}(83)_{\mathrm{syst}}[85]_{\mathrm{total}} \times 10^{-10}$. This work is part of our ongoing effort to compute all contributions to HVP with an overall uncertainty at the few permille level.</description>

      <title>Gluon Unpolarized, Polarized, and Transversity GPDs from Lattice QCD: Lorentz-Covariant Parametrization (Part I)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14110v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We identify the matrix elements necessary to determine the leading-twist gluon generalized parton distributions (GPDs) $H_g,~E_g,~\wt{H}_g,~\wt{E}_g,~H^T_g,~E^T_g, \wt{H}^T_g ,~\wt{E}^T_g$ in lattice QCD calculations. We present a method to achieve a Lorentz-covariant parameterization of the matrix elements in terms of a linearly independent basis of tensor structures. This parameterization is crucial for projecting lattice QCD matrix elements onto light cone distributions. For the first time, we determine the corresponding components that project onto the linear combinations of invariant amplitudes, which reduce to the different gluon GPDs in the light cone limit and enable their separation in a lattice QCD calculation for spin-$0$ and spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ hadrons. Hence, this work lays the foundation for the numerical determination of the gluon GPDs from first-principle lattice QCD calculations, directly advancing our understanding of the mass and spin structures and mechanical properties of the nucleon, as well as the physics underlying deeply virtual Compton scattering and deeply virtual meson production in a range of experimental processes.</description>

      <title>Realization of all-to-all fermion propagator for the first principle high accuracy strong interaction prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01719v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a ``blending" algorithm that projects the all-to-all fermion propagator onto spatial low-frequency modes (LFM) combined with a stochastic estimate of spatial high-frequency modes (SHFM) at each time slice. This approach enables the calculation of arbitrary-point correlation functions for arbitrary hadron states in strongly interacting quantum field theories (QFT) with fermions, such as quantum chromodynamics (QCD). Specifically, LFM allows the construction of spatially extended hadron states below a certain energy threshold by diagonalizing multi-fermion interpolation fields. Meanwhile, the local interactions required for N-point correlation functions in QFT can be approximated in an unbiased manner through a reweighted summation of both LFM and SHFM contributions. To demonstrate the efficiency of this algorithm, we obtained {\color{black} $g_A^u=0.895(15)$, $g_A^d=-0.338(15)$, $g_A^s=-0.0245(72)$, $g_A^{u+d+s}=0.533(28)$ and $g_A^{u-d}=1.2339(43)$ } for nucleon at $m_{\pi}=300$ MeV and $a=0.077$ fm using 40 configurations. The consistency check of the pion electric form factor and charge radius derived from 3-point and 4-point correlation functions is also provided.</description>

      <title>Insight into the nature of the $P_{c}(4457)$ and related pentaquarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09449v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We systematically study the electromagnetic properties of pentaquark states from different perspectives to better understand their nature, internal structure, and quantum numbers, determine their hadronization processes, and shed light on their true nature. The present study examines the magnetic moments of the $P_{c}(4457)$ and related hidden-charm pentaquark states with and without strangeness ($[d d][u c] \bar c$, $[u u][s c] \bar c$, $[dd ][s c] \bar c$, $[s s][u c] \bar c$ and $[s s][d c] \bar c$), employing a comprehensive analysis that encompasses both the compact pentaquark configuration and $J^P = \frac{3}{2}^-$ quantum numbers. The present study compares the results regarding the magnetic moment of the $P_{c}(4457)$ pentaquark state with those reported in the existing literature. The numerical results obtained in this study, when considered alongside existing literature, indicate that the magnetic moments of hidden-charm pentaquark states may offer insights into their underlying structures, which in turn can inform the distinction between their spin-parity quantum numbers. It seems that for the future experimental search of the family of hidden-charm pentaquark states, studying the electromagnetic properties of the hidden-charm pentaquark states can provide valuable information.</description>

      <title>The nature of $\chi_{c1}\left(3872\right)$ and $T_{cc}^+\left(3875\right)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14306v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two decades ago the $\chi_{c1}\left(3872\right)$ was discovered in the hadron spectrum with two heavy quarks. The discovery fueled a surge in experimental research, uncovering dozens of so called XYZ exotics states lying outside the conventional quark model, as well as theoretical investigations into new forms of matter, such as quark-gluon hybrids, tetraquarks, pentaquarks, with the potential of disclosing new information about the fundamental strong force. Among the XYZs, the $\chi_{c1}\left(3872\right)$ and $T_{cc}^+\left(3875\right)$ stand out for their striking characteristics and unlashed many discussions about their nature. Here, we address this question using the Born--Oppenheimer Effective Field Theory (BOEFT) and show how QCD settles the issue of their composition. Not only we describe well the main features of the $\chi_{c1}\left(3872\right)$ and $T_{cc}^+\left(3875\right)$ but obtain also predictions in the bottomonium sector. This opens the way to systematic applications of BOEFT to all XYZs.</description>

      <title>Constraining the $DDD^*$ three-body bound state via the $Z_c(3900)$ pole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12816v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we propose using the $Z_c(3900)$ pole position to constrain the existence of the $DDD^*$ three-body bound state within the one-boson-exchange (OBE) model. The existence of the $DDD^*$ bound state remains uncertain due to significant variations in the OBE interaction, particularly in the strength of scalar-meson-exchange interactions, which can differ by a factor about 20 between two commonly used OBE models. This discrepancy renders the $DDD^*$ system highly model-dependent. To address this issue, we constrain the scalar-meson-exchange interaction using the $Z_c(3900)$ pole position, where the pseudoscalar-meson coupling is well-determined, and the $\rho$- and $\omega$-exchange interactions nearly cancel each other out, leaving the coupling constant of the $\sigma$-exchange as the only unknown parameter. Our results indicate that the isospin-$\frac{1}{2}$ $DDD^*$ bound states exist when $Z_c(3900)$ is a virtual state of $D\bar{D}^*/\bar{D}D^*$ located within approximately $-15$ MeV of the threshold. However, the three-body bound state is gone when the $Z_c(3900)$ virtual state pole is more than $20$ MeV away from the threshold. Each experimental progress, either on the $DDD^*$ state or the $Z_c(3900)$, can shed light on the nature of the other state. Another significant outcome is a refined set of OBE model parameters calibrated using the pole positions of $X(3872)$, $T_{cc}(3875)$, and $Z_c(3900)$, rigorously addressing the cutoff dependence. These parameters provide a valuable resource for more accurate calculations of systems involving few-body $D$, $D^*$ and their antiparticles. Additionally, we find no evidence of the $DDD^*$ three-body resonances after extensive search using a combination of the Gaussian expansion method and the complex scaling method.</description>
