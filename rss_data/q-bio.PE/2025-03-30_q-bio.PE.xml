      <title>Selection of the fittest or selection of the luckiest: the emergence of Goodhart's law in evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biological evolution depends on the passing down to subsequent generations of genetic information encoding beneficial traits, and on the removal of unfit individuals by a selection mechanism. However, selection acts on phenotypes, and is affected by random contingencies. Thus, a combination of fitness and luck determines which individuals will successfully reproduce and give rise to the next generation. To understand how randomness in the selection mechanism affects the long-term patterns of evolution, we studied an idealized evolution model. We show through simulations and mathematical analysis, that the speed of adaptation increases with increasing selection pressure only up to a threshold. Beyond the threshold, any increase of the selection pressure results in more weight given to random effects rather than on genetic fitness in determining which individuals will successfully reproduce. This severely reduces the speed of adaptation and the diversity in the gene pool. Our findings may be considered as a biological instance of Goodhart's law: "When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure". Finally, we show that this intricate response of evolution to natural selection can be mathematically explained by a novel phase transition for pulled traveling waves.</description>

      <title>Coupling plankton and cholera dynamics: insights into outbreak prediction and practical disease management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite extensive control efforts over the centuries, cholera remains a globally significant health issue. Seasonal emergence of cholera cases has been reported, particularly in the Bengal delta region, which is often synchronized with plankton blooms. This phenomenon has been widely attributed to the commensal interaction between Vibrio cholerae and zooplankton in aquatic environments. Understanding the role of plankton dynamics in cholera epidemiology is therefore crucial for effective policy-making. To this end, we propose and analyze a novel compartment-based transmission model that integrates phytoplankton-zooplankton interactions into a human-bacteria cholera model. We show that zooplankton-mediated transmission can lead to counterintuitive outcomes, such as an outbreak with a delayed and lower peak still resulting in a larger overall outbreak size. Such outbreaks are prolonged by maintaining infections at lower levels during the post-peak phase, thereby intensifying epidemic overshoot and promoting the inter-epidemic persistence of pathogens. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that the timing of filtration-like interventions can be strategically guided by ecological indicators, such as phytoplankton blooms. Our study underscores the importance of incorporating ecological aspects in epidemiological research to gain a deeper understanding of disease dynamics.</description>

      <title>Describing the Persistence Landscape for Introducing Microbes into Complex Communities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The introduction of non-native organisms into complex microbiome communities holds enormous potential to benefit society. However, microbiome engineering faces several challenges including successful establishment of the organism into the community, its persistence in the microbiome to serve a specified purpose, and constraint of the organism and its activity to the intended environment. A theoretical framework is needed to represent the complex interactions that drive these dynamics. Building on the concept of the community functional landscape, we define the persistence landscape as the metabolic, genetic, and broader functional composition and ecological context of the target microbiome that can be used to predict the environmental fitness of an introduced organism. Here, we discuss critical aspects of persistence landscapes that impact interactions between an introduced organism and the target microbiome, including the communitys genetic and metabolic complementation potential, cellular defense strategies, spatial and temporal dynamics, and the introduced organisms ability to compete for resources to survive. Finally, we highlight important knowledge gaps in the fields of microbial ecology and microbiome engineering that limit characterization and engineering of persistence landscapes. As a model for understanding microbiome structure and interaction in the context of microbiome engineering, the persistence landscape model should enable development of novel containment approaches while improving controlled colonization of a complex microbiome community to address pressing challenges in human health, agronomy, and biomanufacturing.</description>

      <title>Arboreal networks and their underlying trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) is an important process in bacterial evolution. Current phylogeny-based approaches to capture it cannot however appropriately account for the fact that HGT can occur between bacteria living in different ecological niches. Due to the fact that arboreal networks are a type of multiple-rooted phylogenetic network that can be thought of as a forest of rooted phylogenetic trees along with a set of additional arcs each joining two different trees in the forest, understanding the combinatorial structure of such networks might therefore pave the way to extending current phylogeny-based HGT-inference methods in this direction. A central question in this context is, how can we construct an arboreal network? Answering this question is strongly informed by finding ways to \textit{encode} an arboreal network, that is, breaking up the network into simpler combinatorial structures that, in a well defined sense uniquely determine the network. In the form of triplets, trinets and quarnets such encodings are known for certain types of single-rooted phylogenetic networks. By studying the underlying tree of an arboreal network, we compliment them here with an answer for arboreal networks.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of respiratory disease hospitalisation forecasts using synthetic outbreak data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Forecasts of hospitalisations of infectious diseases play an important role for allocating healthcare resources during epidemics and pandemics. Large-scale analysis of model forecasts during the COVID-19 pandemic has shown that the model rank distribution with respect to accuracy is heterogeneous and that ensemble forecasts have the highest average accuracy. Building on that work we generated a maximally diverse synthetic dataset of 324 different hospitalisation time-series that correspond to different disease characteristics and public health responses. We evaluated forecasts from 14 component models and 6 different ensembles. Our results show that component model accuracy was heterogeneous and varied depending on the current rate of disease transmission. Going from 7 day to 14 day forecasts mechanistic models improved in relative accuracy compared to statistical models. A novel adaptive ensemble method outperforms all other ensembles, but is closely followed by a median ensemble. We also investigated the relationship between ensemble error and variability of component forecasts and show that the coefficient of variation is predictive of future error. Lastly, we validated the results on data from the COVID-19 pandemic in Sweden. Our findings have the potential to improve epidemic forecasting, in particular the ability to assign confidence to ensemble forecasts at the time of prediction based on component forecast variability.</description>

      <title>Archean Methane Cycling and Life's Co-Evolution: Intertwining Early Biogeochemical Processes and Ancient Microbial Metabolism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21919v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This chapter explores the key carbon compounds that shaped the Archean biogeochemical cycle, delineating their substantial impact on Earth's primordial atmospheric and biospheric evolution. At the heart of the Archean carbon cycle were carbon dioxide and methane, which served as key regulators of Earth's early climate. Particular emphasis is placed on methane cycling, encompassing both abiotic methane production and consumption, as well as their biotic counterparts-methanogenesis and methanotrophy. These ancient microbial pathways not only shaped methane fluxes but were also tightly interwoven with Earth's evolving redox state. We provide a comprehensive exploration of the intertwined evolution of Earth's geochemical environment and microbial life. The interdisciplinary approach of this chapter not only sheds light on the complex dynamics of Earth's early methane cycling but also offers critical insights that could inform the search for life beyond our planet, thereby marking a contribution to Earth sciences, astrobiology, and related fields.</description>

      <title>Fluctuations of blowup time in a simple model of a super-Malthusian catastrophe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07083v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the paradigm of a super-Maltusian population catastrophe, we study a simple stochastic population model which exhibits a finite-time blowup of the population size and is strongly affected by intrinsic noise. We focus on the fluctuations of the blowup time $T$ in the asexual binary reproduction model $2A \to 3A$, where two identical individuals give birth to a third one. We determine exactly the average blowup time as well as the probability distribution $\mathcal{P}(T)$ of the blowup time and its moments. In particular, we show that the long-time tail $\mathcal{P}(T\to \infty)$ is purely exponential. The short-time tail $\mathcal{P}(T\to 0)$ exhibits an essential singularity at $T=0$, and it is dominated by a single (the most likely) population trajectory which we determine analytically.</description>
