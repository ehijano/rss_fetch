      <title>Utilitarian or Quantile-Welfare Evaluation of Health Policy?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers quantile-welfare evaluation of health policy as an alternative to utilitarian evaluation. Manski (1988) originally proposed and studied maximization of quantile utility as a model of individual decision making under uncertainty, juxtaposing it with maximization of expected utility. That paper's primary motivation was to exploit the fact that maximization of quantile utility requires only an ordinal formalization of utility, not a cardinal one. This paper transfers these ideas from analysis of individual decision making to analysis of social planning. We begin by summarizing basic theoretical properties of quantile welfare in general terms rather than related specifically to health policy. We then propose a procedure to nonparametrically bound the quantile welfare of health states using data from binary-choice time-tradeoff (TTO) experiments of the type regularly performed by health economists. After this we assess related econometric considerations concerning measurement, using the EQ-5D framework to structure our discussion.</description>

      <title>Largevars: An R Package for Testing Large VARs for the Presence of Cointegration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cointegration is a property of multivariate time series that determines whether its non-stationary, growing components have a stationary linear combination. Largevars R package conducts a cointegration test for high-dimensional vector autoregressions of order k based on the large N, T asymptotics of Bykhovskaya and Gorin (2022, 2025). The implemented test is a modification of the Johansen likelihood ratio test. In the absence of cointegration the test converges to the partial sum of the Airy_1 point process, an object arising in random matrix theory.
  The package and this article contain simulated quantiles of the first ten partial sums of the Airy_1 point process that are precise up to the first 3 digits. We also include two examples using Largevars: an empirical example on S&amp;P100 stocks and a simulated VAR(2) example.</description>

      <title>Neural ARFIMA model for forecasting BRIC exchange rates with long memory under oil shocks and policy uncertainties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate forecasting of exchange rates remains a persistent challenge, particularly for emerging economies such as Brazil, Russia, India, and China (BRIC). These series exhibit long memory, nonlinearity, and non-stationarity properties that conventional time series models struggle to capture. Additionally, there exist several key drivers of exchange rate dynamics, including global economic policy uncertainty, US equity market volatility, US monetary policy uncertainty, oil price growth rates, and country-specific short-term interest rate differentials. These empirical complexities underscore the need for a flexible modeling framework that can jointly accommodate long memory, nonlinearity, and the influence of external drivers. To address these challenges, we propose a Neural AutoRegressive Fractionally Integrated Moving Average (NARFIMA) model that combines the long-memory representation of ARFIMA with the nonlinear learning capacity of neural networks, while flexibly incorporating exogenous causal variables. We establish theoretical properties of the model, including asymptotic stationarity of the NARFIMA process using Markov chains and nonlinear time series techniques. We quantify forecast uncertainty using conformal prediction intervals within the NARFIMA framework. Empirical results across six forecast horizons show that NARFIMA consistently outperforms various state-of-the-art statistical and machine learning models in forecasting BRIC exchange rates. These findings provide new insights for policymakers and market participants navigating volatile financial conditions. The \texttt{narfima} \textbf{R} package provides an implementation of our approach.</description>

      <title>Optimal Policy Learning for Multi-Action Treatment with Risk Preference using Stata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the Stata community-distributed command "opl_ma_fb" (and the companion command "opl_ma_vf"), for implementing the first-best Optimal Policy Learning (OPL) algorithm to estimate the best treatment assignment given the observation of an outcome, a multi-action (or multi-arm) treatment, and a set of observed covariates (features). It allows for different risk preferences in decision-making (i.e., risk-neutral, linear risk-averse, and quadratic risk-averse), and provides a graphical representation of the optimal policy, along with an estimate of the maximal welfare (i.e., the value-function estimated at optimal policy) using regression adjustment (RA), inverse-probability weighting (IPW), and doubly robust (DR) formulas.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Inference for Confounding Variables and Limited Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A central challenge in statistical inference is the presence of confounding variables that may distort observed associations between treatment and outcome. Conventional "causal" methods, grounded in assumptions such as ignorability, exclude the possibility of unobserved confounders, leading to posterior inferences that overstate certainty. We develop a Bayesian framework that relaxes these assumptions by introducing entropy-favoring priors over hypothesis spaces that explicitly allow for latent confounding variables and partial information. Using the case of Simpson's paradox, we demonstrate how this approach produces logically consistent posterior distributions that widen credibly intervals in the presence of potential confounding. Our method provides a generalizable, information-theoretic foundation for more robust predictive inference in observational sciences.</description>

      <title>Polynomial Log-Marginals and Tweedie's Formula : When Is Bayes Possible?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05823v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by Tweedie's formula for the Compound Decision problem, we examine the theoretical foundations of empirical Bayes estimators that directly model the marginal density $m(y)$. Our main result shows that polynomial log-marginals of degree $k \ge 3 $ cannot arise from any valid prior distribution in exponential family models, while quadratic forms correspond exactly to Gaussian priors. This provides theoretical justification for why certain empirical Bayes decision rules, while practically useful, do not correspond to any formal Bayes procedures. We also strengthen the diagnostic by showing that a marginal is a Gaussian convolution only if it extends to a bounded solution of the heat equation in a neighborhood of the smoothing parameter, beyond the convexity of $c(y)=\tfrac12 y^2+\log m(y)$.</description>

      <title>Predicting Market Troughs: A Machine Learning Approach with Causal Interpretation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper provides robust, new evidence on the causal drivers of market troughs. We demonstrate that conclusions about these triggers are critically sensitive to model specification, moving beyond restrictive linear models with a flexible DML average partial effect causal machine learning framework. Our robust estimates identify the volatility of options-implied risk appetite and market liquidity as key causal drivers, relationships misrepresented or obscured by simpler models. These findings provide high-frequency empirical support for intermediary asset pricing theories. This causal analysis is enabled by a high-performance nowcasting model that accurately identifies capitulation events in real-time.</description>

      <title>Nickell Bias in Panel Local Projection: Financial Crises Are Worse Than You Think</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.13455v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Panel local projection (LP) with fixed-effects (FE) estimation is widely adopted for evaluating the economic consequences of financial crises across countries. This paper highlights a fundamental methodological issue: the presence of the Nickell bias in the panel FE estimator due to inherent dynamic structures of panel predictive specifications, even if the regressors have no lagged dependent variables. The Nickell bias invalidates the standard inferential procedure based on the $t$-statistic. We propose the split-panel jackknife (SPJ) estimator as a simple, easy-to-implement, and yet effective solution to eliminate the bias and restore valid statistical inference. We revisit four influential empirical studies on the impact of financial crises, and find that the FE method underestimates the economic losses of financial crises relative to the SPJ estimates.</description>

Abstract: Model misspecification in multivariate econometric models can strongly influence estimates of quantities of interest such as structural parameters, forecast distributions or responses to structural shocks, even more so if higher-order forecasts or responses are considered, due to parameter Model misspecification in multivariate econometric models can strongly influence estimates of quantities of interest such as structural parameters, forecast distributions or responses to structural shocks, even more so if higher-order forecasts or responses are considered, due to parameter convolution. We propose a simple method for addressing these specification issues in the context of Bayesian VARs. Our method, called coarsened Bayesian VARs (cBVARs), replaces the exact likelihood with a coarsened likelihood that takes into account that the model might be misspecified along important but unknown dimensions. Since endogenous variables in a VAR can feature different degrees of misspecification, our model allows for this and automatically detects the degree of misspecification. The resulting cBVARs perform well in simulations for several types of misspecification. Applied to US data, cBVARs improve point and density forecasts compared to standard BVARs.</description>

      <title>Optimal Shrinkage Estimation of Fixed Effects in Linear Panel Data Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.12485v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Shrinkage methods are frequently used to improve the precision of least squares estimators of fixed effects. However, widely used shrinkage estimators guarantee improved precision only under strong distributional assumptions. I develop an estimator for the fixed effects that obtains the best possible mean squared error within a class of shrinkage estimators. This class includes conventional shrinkage estimators and the optimality does not require distributional assumptions. The estimator has an intuitive form and is easy to implement. Moreover, the fixed effects are allowed to vary with time and to be serially correlated, in which case the shrinkage optimally incorporates the underlying correlation structure. I also provide a method to forecast fixed effects one period ahead in this setting.</description>

      <title>Estimation of Integrated Volatility Functionals with Kernel Spot Volatility Estimators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09759v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a multidimensional It\^o semimartingale, we consider the problem of estimating integrated volatility functionals. Jacod and Rosenbaum (2013) studied a plug-in type of estimator based on a Riemann sum approximation of the integrated functional and a spot volatility estimator with a forward uniform kernel. Motivated by recent results that show that spot volatility estimators with general two-side kernels of unbounded support are more accurate, in this paper, an estimator using a general kernel spot volatility estimator as the plug-in is considered. A biased central limit theorem for estimating the integrated functional is established with an optimal convergence rate. Unbiased central limit theorems for estimators with proper de-biasing terms are also obtained both at the optimal convergence regime for the bandwidth and when applying undersmoothing. Our results show that one can significantly reduce the estimator's bias by adopting a general kernel instead of the standard uniform kernel. Our proposed bias-corrected estimators are found to maintain remarkable robustness against bandwidth selection in a variety of sampling frequencies and functions.</description>

      <title>Heterogeneous Treatment Effects via Linear Dynamic Panel Data Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19060v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the identification of heterogeneous, intertemporal treatment effects (TE) when potential outcomes depend on past treatments. First, applying a dynamic panel data model to observed outcomes, we show that an instrumental variable (IV) version of the estimand in Arellano and Bond (1991) recovers a non-convex (negatively weighted) aggregate of TE plus non-vanishing trends. We then provide conditions on sequential exchangeability (SE) of treatment and on TE heterogeneity that reduce such an IV estimand to a convex (positively weighted) aggregate of TE. Second, even when SE is generically violated, such estimands identify causal parameters when potential outcomes are generated by dynamic panel data models with some homogeneity or mild selection assumptions. Finally, we motivate SE and compare it with parallel trends (PT) in various settings with experimental data (when treatments are sequentially randomized) and observational data (when treatments are dynamic, rational choices under learning).</description>

Abstract: This paper proposes a scalable framework to estimate monthly GDP using machine learning methods. We apply Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTM), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and Elastic Net regression to map monthly indicators to quarterly GDP growth, and reconcile the outputs with actual aggregates. Using data from China, Germany, the UK, and the US, our method delivers robust performance across varied data environments. Benchmark comparisons with prior US studies and UK official statistics validate its accuracy. We also explore nighttime light as a proxy, finding its usefulness varies by economic structure. The approach offers a flexible and data-driven tool for high-frequency macroeconomic monitoring and policy analysis.</description>

Abstract: Ordinary least squares (OLS) estimators are widely used in network experiments to estimate spillover effects. We study the causal interpretation of, and inference for the OLS estimator under both design-based uncertainty from random treatment assignment and sampling-based uncertainty in network links. We show that correlations among regressors that capture the exposure to neighbors' treatments can induce contamination bias, preventing OLS from aggregating heterogeneous spillover effects for a clear causal interpretation. We derive the OLS estimator's asymptotic distribution and propose a network-robust variance estimator. Simulations and an empirical application demonstrate that contamination bias can be substantial, leading to inflated spillover estimates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.04144v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive the exact asymptotic distribution of the conditional likelihood-ratio test in instrumental variables regression under weak instrument asymptotics and for multiple endogenous variables. The distribution is conditional on all eigenvalues of the concentration matrix, rather than only the smallest eigenvalue as in an existing asymptotic upper bound. This exact characterization leads to a substantially more powerful test if there are differently identified endogenous variables. We provide computational methods implementing the test and demonstrate the power gains through numerical analysis.</description>
