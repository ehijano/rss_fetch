      <title>Symmetric Schur-class functions on the bidisk and Schur-class functions on the symmetrized bidisk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present some thoughts on the relation between symmetric Schur-class functions on the bidisk and Schur-class functions on the symmetrized bidisk. Among other things, use of this relation leads to a finite dimensional realization result for rational matrix functions in the Schur-class on the symmetrized bidisk and also to a determinantal representation result for polynomials without zeros on the symmetrized bidisk.</description>

      <title>A proof for the conjecture on superlinear problems with Ambrosetti-Rabinowitz condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to exploring a new minimax approach by introducing a characteristic mapping family which is invariant under the smooth descending flow for initial value. The minimax approach is self-contained, and its features are markedly different from standard ones, as it identifies the existence of critical points and intrinsically presents a lower-bound estimate for the generalized Morse index at the corresponding critical point. This quantity can be effectively viewed as an alternative to the group action. As applications, under the Ambrosetti-Rabinowitz condition we offer a positive answer to the long-standing open problem on the existence of infinitely many distinct solutions for superlinear elliptic equations without symmetric hypothesis.</description>

      <title>Banach algebra crossed products by inverse semigroup actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a self-contained and simplified presentation of the theory of covariant representations for inverse semigroup actions on Banach algebras, which was recently introduced in the authors and A. Mckee in the twisted case. The main result of this note is a general universal description of the associated Banach algebra crossed product, that allows disintegration of all representations of the crossed product. Such a disintegration was studied so far only for actions on spaces.</description>

      <title>Embeddings of $L^p$-operator algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study embeddings of $L^p$-operator algebras arising from (twisted) \'etale groupoids, with particular emphasis on rigidity phenomena for $p\neq 2$. Our methods rely on a detailed analysis of core normalizers and their functorial behavior under algebra homomorphisms. Using the notion of actors between groupoids, we show that under natural hypotheses, embeddings between reduced $L^p$-groupoid algebras can be described entirely in terms of morphisms of the underlying groupoids. We further show that embeddings of $L^p$-groupoid algebras induce embeddings of the associated topological full groups. Our results provide new tools for studying embeddability questions in the $L^p$-setting, and are particularly helpful when ruling out the existence of embeddings.
  As applications, we obtain strong rigidity results for (spatial) $L^p$-AF-embeddability, showing that, for $p\neq 2$, an $L^p$-groupoid algebra embeds into a spatial $L^p$-AF-algebra if and only if the underlying groupoid is AF. In particular, irrational rotation $L^p$-operator algebras do not embed into spatial $L^p$-AF-algebras. We apply these results to tensor products of $L^p$-Cuntz algebras and prove that, for $p\neq 2$, there is no unital contractive homomorphism from $\mathcal{O}_2^p \otimes_p \mathcal{O}_2^p$ into $\mathcal{O}_2^p$, showing that there is no $L^p$-analog of Kirchberg's $\mathcal{O}_2$-embedding theorem.</description>

      <title>Boundary Disintegration for Weighted Residual Energy Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14646v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study iterated weighted residual (WR) splittings generated by a positive operator $R_{0}\in B\left(H\right)_{+}$ and a finite family of contractions $C_{1},\dots,C_{m}$ in $B\left(H\right)$. The associated residual update $R\mapsto R^{1/2}(I-C^{*}_{j}C_{j})R^{1/2}$ produces an $m$-ary energy tree of residuals $\left\{ R_{w}\right\} $ and dissipated pieces $\left\{ D_{w,j}\right\} $ indexed by finite words. From this tree we construct intrinsic path measures on the path space by biasing transitions either by a fixed quadratic form $x\mapsto\left\langle x,D_{w,j}x\right\rangle $ (defining the measures $\nu_{x}$) or, in the trace-class setting, by ${\rm tr}\left(D_{w,j}\right)$ (yielding a reference measure $\nu_{\mathrm{tr}}$). When $R_{0}\in S_{1}\left(H\right)_{+}$, we show that $\nu_{\mathrm{tr}}$ dominates the family $\left\{ \nu_{x}\right\} $ and identify $d\nu_{x}/d\nu_{\mathrm{tr}}$ as a canonical martingale limit of cylinder likelihood ratios. Along $\nu_{\mathrm{tr}}$-almost every branch the residuals decrease to a terminal trace-class random variable $R_{\infty}$, which we interpret as the WR boundary variable. We then disintegrate $\nu_{\mathrm{tr}}$ over $\sigma\left(R_{\infty}\right)$, obtaining a boundary law $\mu_{\mathrm{tr}}=\left(R_{\infty}\right)_{\#}\nu_{\mathrm{tr}}$ and conditional path measures $\left\{ \nu^{T}_{\mathrm{tr}}\right\} $. Finally, we show that each $\nu_{x}$ admits a boundary representation as a mixture of $\left\{ \nu^{T}_{\mathrm{tr}}\right\} $ with an explicit boundary density $h_{x}=d\mu_{x}/d\mu_{\mathrm{tr}}$, thereby organizing the family of intrinsic WR path measures by a single trace-biased boundary disintegration.</description>

      <title>Helmholtz transmission problem and intrinsic impedance scattering problem on extension domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a transmission problem for the Helmholtz equation across the boundary of an extension domain. A such boundary can be Lipschitz, fractal, or of varying Hausdorff dimension for instance. We generalise the notions of layer potential and Neumann-Poincar{\'e} operators, and of Calder{\'o}n projectors in that context. Those boundary operators allow to connect the transmission problem (on the whole space) to one-sided problems -- notably, scattering problems -- with Dirichlet, Neumann and Robin boundary conditions. Since an extension domain needs no specific boundary measure, the Robin (impedance) condition is not understood in a boundary L^2-type space, rather by duality on the trace space itself. We discuss the well-posedness of the impedance scattering problem in that framework and compare to the classical L^2 setting. Our analysis allows to generalise optimisation results for acoustic scattering when the obstacle is an extension domain in any dimension.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.14873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a complete description of the order isomorphisms between the self-adjoint parts of $C^*$-algebras. Furthermore, we characterize such isomorphisms between general operator intervals in $AW^*$-algebras. For the description, we use Jordan $^*$-isomorphisms and closed operators in the regular rings of $AW^{*}$-algebras. This work generalizes previous results on von Neumann algebras.</description>

      <title>Banach algebras associated to twisted \'{e}tale groupoids: simplicity and pure infiniteness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05717v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define reduced and essential Banach algebras associated to a twisted \'{e}tale (not necessarily Hausdorff) groupoid $(\mathcal{G},\mathcal{L})$ and extend some fundamental results from $C^*$-algebras to this context. We prove that for topologically free groupoids the associated essential Banach algebras have the ideal interesection property, and thus such an algebra is simple if and only if the groupoid is minimal. We give conditions under which reduced algebras are essential (for example Hausdorffness of $\mathcal{G}$ is sufficient). This in particular solves the simplicity problem posed recently by Gardella-Lupini for $L^p$-operator algebras associated to $\mathcal{G}$. In addition, using either the $n$-filling or locally contracting condition we give pure infiniteness criteria for essential simple Banach algebras associated to $(\mathcal{G},\mathcal{L})$. This extends the corresponding $C^*$-algebraic results that were previously known to hold in the untwisted Hausdorff case. The results work nicely, and allow for characterisation of the generalized intersection property, in the realm of $L^P$-operator algebras where $P \subseteq [1,\infty]$ is a non-empty set of parameters. Such algebras cover in particular $L^p$-operator algebras, for $p\in [1,\infty]$, and their Banach $*$-algebra versions.
  We apply our results to Banach algebra crossed products by twisted partial group actions, Roe-type Banach algebras with coefficients in finite-rank operators on a Banach space, twisted tight $L^P$-operator algebras of inverse semigroups, graph $L^P$-operator algebras, and algebras associated to self-similar group actions on graphs. We also interpret our results in terms of twisted inverse semigroup actions and their crossed products.</description>

      <title>Quantifying (non-)weak compactness of operators on $AL$- and $C(K)$-spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21543v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the representation of non-weakly compact operators between $AL$-spaces. In this setting, we show that every operator admits a best approximant in the ideal of weakly compact operators. Using duality arguments, we extend this result to operators between $C(L)$-spaces where $L$ is extremally disconnected. We also characterize the weak essential norm for operators between $AL$-spaces in terms of factorizations of the identity on $\ell_1$. As a consequence, we deduce that the weak Calkin algebra $\mathscr{B}(E)/\mathscr{W}(E)$ admits a unique algebra norm for every $AL$-space $E$. By duality, similar results are obtained for $C(K)$-spaces. In particular, we prove that for operators $T: L_{\infty}[0,1] \to L_{\infty}[0,1]$ the weak essential norm, the residuum norm, and the De Blasi measure of weak compactness coincide, answering a question of Gonz\'alez, Saksman and Tylli.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.06991v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The analytic Langlands correspondence proposed by Etingof, Frenkel and Kazhdan describes the solution to the spectral problems naturally arising in the quantisation of the Hitchin integrable systems in terms of real opers, certain second order differential operators on a Riemann surface having real monodromy. We prove this correspondence in the cases associated to the group $\mathrm{PSL}(2,\mathbb{C})$, and Riemann surfaces of genus zero with a number of punctures larger than three. A crucial ingredient is a unitary integral transformation mapping products of solutions to the ordinary differential equation associated to a real oper to eigenfunctions of the quantised Hitchin Hamiltonians. This allows us to construct joint eigenfunctions of Hecke operators and Hitchin Hamiltonians from real opers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00191v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the ordinary or fractional Laplacian plus a homogeneous, scaling-critical drift term. This operator is non-symmetric but homogeneous, and generates scales of $L^p$-Sobolev spaces which we compare with the ordinary homogeneous Sobolev spaces. Unlike in previous studies concerning Hardy operators, i.e., ordinary or fractional Laplacians plus scaling-critical scalar perturbations, handling the drift term requires an additional, possibly technical, restriction on the range of comparable Sobolev spaces, which is related to the unavailability of gradient bounds for the associated semigroup.</description>

Abstract: We prove a noncommutative analogue of Minkowski's integral inequality for commuting squares of tracial von Neumann algebras. The inequality implies a necessary condition for a quadruple of graphs to be realized as inclusion graphs of a commuting square of multi-matrix algebras. As a corollary, we obtain a unitary categorification criterion for based rings, in particular, fusion rings.</description>
