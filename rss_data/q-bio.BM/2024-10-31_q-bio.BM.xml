      <title>CARE: a Benchmark Suite for the Classification and Retrieval of Enzymes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15669</link>

Abstract: Enzymes are important proteins that catalyze chemical reactions. In recent years, machine learning methods have emerged to predict enzyme function from sequence; however, there are no standardized benchmarks to evaluate these methods. We introduce CARE, a benchmark and dataset suite for the Classification And Retrieval of Enzymes (CARE). CARE centers on two tasks: (1) classification of a protein sequence by its enzyme commission (EC) number and (2) retrieval of an EC number given a chemical reaction. For each task, we design train-test splits to evaluate different kinds of out-of-distribution generalization that are relevant to real use cases. For the classification task, we provide baselines for state-of-the-art methods. Because the retrieval task has not been previously formalized, we propose a method called Contrastive Reaction-EnzymE Pretraining (CREEP) as one of the first baselines for this task and compare it to the recent method, CLIPZyme. CARE is available at https://github.com/jsunn-y/CARE/.</description>

      <title>Kermut: Composite kernel regression for protein variant effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00002v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reliable prediction of protein variant effects is crucial for both protein optimization and for advancing biological understanding. For practical use in protein engineering, it is important that we can also provide reliable uncertainty estimates for our predictions, and while prediction accuracy has seen much progress in recent years, uncertainty metrics are rarely reported. We here provide a Gaussian process regression model, Kermut, with a novel composite kernel for modeling mutation similarity, which obtains state-of-the-art performance for supervised protein variant effect prediction while also offering estimates of uncertainty through its posterior. An analysis of the quality of the uncertainty estimates demonstrates that our model provides meaningful levels of overall calibration, but that instance-specific uncertainty calibration remains more challenging.</description>

      <title>Efficient high-resolution refinement in cryo-EM with stochastic gradient descent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16100v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM) is an imaging technique widely used in structural biology to determine the three-dimensional structure of biological molecules from noisy two-dimensional projections with unknown orientations. As the typical pipeline involves processing large amounts of data, efficient algorithms are crucial for fast and reliable results. The stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm has been used to improve the speed of ab initio reconstruction, which results in a first, low-resolution estimation of the volume representing the molecule of interest, but has yet to be applied successfully in the high-resolution regime, where expectation-maximization algorithms achieve state-of-the-art results, at a high computational cost. In this article, we investigate the conditioning of the optimization problem and show that the large condition number prevents the successful application of gradient descent-based methods at high resolution. Our results include a theoretical analysis of the condition number of the optimization problem in a simplified setting where the individual projection directions are known, an algorithm based on computing a diagonal preconditioner using Hutchinson's diagonal estimator, and numerical experiments showing the improvement in the convergence speed when using the estimated preconditioner with SGD. The preconditioned SGD approach can potentially enable a simple and unified approach to ab initio reconstruction and high-resolution refinement with faster convergence speed and higher flexibility, and our results are a promising step in this direction.</description>

      <title>Molecule Design by Latent Prompt Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17179v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work explores the challenging problem of molecule design by framing it as a conditional generative modeling task, where target biological properties or desired chemical constraints serve as conditioning variables. We propose the Latent Prompt Transformer (LPT), a novel generative model comprising three components: (1) a latent vector with a learnable prior distribution modeled by a neural transformation of Gaussian white noise; (2) a molecule generation model based on a causal Transformer, which uses the latent vector as a prompt; and (3) a property prediction model that predicts a molecule's target properties and/or constraint values using the latent prompt. LPT can be learned by maximum likelihood estimation on molecule-property pairs. During property optimization, the latent prompt is inferred from target properties and constraints through posterior sampling and then used to guide the autoregressive molecule generation. After initial training on existing molecules and their properties, we adopt an online learning algorithm to progressively shift the model distribution towards regions that support desired target properties. Experiments demonstrate that LPT not only effectively discovers useful molecules across single-objective, multi-objective, and structure-constrained optimization tasks, but also exhibits strong sample efficiency.</description>

      <title>Statistical Mechanics of Multiplectoneme Phases in DNA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23145v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A stretched DNA molecule which is also under- or overwound, undergoes a buckling transition forming intertwined looped domains called plectonemes. Here we develop a simple theory that extends the two-phase model of stretched supercoiled DNA, allowing for the coexistence of multiple plectonemic domains by including positional and length distribution entropies. Such a multiplectoneme phase is favored in long DNA molecules in which the gain of positional entropy compensates for the cost of nucleating a plectoneme along a stretched DNA segment. Despite its simplicity, the developed theory is shown to be in excellent agreement with Monte Carlo simulations of the twistable wormlike chain model. The theory predicts more plectonemes than experimentally observed, which we attribute to the limited resolution of experimental data. Since plectonemes are detected through fluorescence signals, those shorter than the observable threshold are likely missed.</description>
