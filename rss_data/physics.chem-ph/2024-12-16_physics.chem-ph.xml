      <title>Enhanced photoisomerization with hybrid metallodielectric cavities based on mode interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to control chemical reactions by coupling organic molecules to confined light in a cavity has recently attracted much attention. While most previous studies have focused on single-mode photonic or plasmonic cavities, here we investigate the effect of hybrid metallodielectric cavities on photoisomerization reactions. Hybrid cavities, which support both photonic and plasmonic modes, offer unique opportunities that arise from the interplay between these two distinct types of modes. Specifically, we demonstrate that interference in the spectral density due to a narrow photonic mode and a broad plasmonic mode that are coupled to each other enables hybrid cavities to provide an energy-selective Purcell effect. This effect enhances electronic relaxation only to the desired molecular geometry, providing the ability to increase the yield of photoisomerization reactions. As a test case, we study the asymmetric proton transfer reaction in the electronic excited state of 3-aminoacrolein. Our results, which are robust for a range of realistic cavity parameters, highlight the advantages of hybrid cavities in cavity-induced photochemical processes.</description>

      <title>Learning Radical Excited States from Sparse Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emissive organic radicals are currently of great interest for their potential use in the next generation of highly efficient organic light emitting diode (OLED) devices and as molecular qubits. However, simulating their optoelectronic properties is challenging, largely due to spin-contamination and the multireference character of their excited states. Here we present a data-driven approach where, for the first time, the excited electronic states of organic radicals are learned directly from experimental excited state data, using a much smaller amount of data than required by typical Machine Learning. We adopt ExROPPP, a fast and spin-pure semiempirical method for calculation of excited states of radicals, as a surrogate physical model for which we learn the optimal set of parameters. We train the model on 81 previously published radicals and find that the trained model is a huge improvement over ExROPPP with literature parameters, giving RMS and mean absolute errors of 0.24 and 0.16 eV respectively with R$^2$ and SRCC of 0.86 and 0.88 respectively. We synthesise four new radicals and validate the model on their spectra, finding even lower errors and similar correlation as for the testing set. This model paves the way for high throughput discovery of next-generation radical based optoelectronics.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Nuclear Polarization Mechanisms using TEMPOL and trityl OX063 radicals at 1 T and 77 K</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A sensitivity increase of two orders of magnitude in proton (1H) and carbon (13C) spins via dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) has been accomplished recently using a compact benchtop DNP polarizer operating at 1 T and 77 K. However the DNP mechanisms at play at such low magnetic field and high operating temperature are still not elucidated. A deeper understanding of the dominant polarization transfer mechanisms between electrons and 1H and 13C spins at these unconventional benchtop conditions is therefore required if one wants to devise strategies to boost sensitivity further. In this study, we found that DNP is generally dominated by solid effect for narrow electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) line radicals (15 mM trityl OX063) and cross effect for broad EPR line radicals (50 mM TEMPOL). For both radicals, the dominant DNP mechanisms were investigated varying the microwave frequency and measuring the 1H and 13C DNP enhancement factors to obtain 1H and 13C DNP spectra. The impact of varying the microwave power on the 1H DNP buildup times and the 1H nuclear spin relaxation times were important as well to distinguish between solid effect and cross effect DNP. Finally, time-resolved electron saturation simulations under continuous microwave irradiation could replicate the experimental 1H and 13C DNP spectra at 1 T and 77 K for both radicals considering their electron relaxation properties. Only for trityl OX063, the 13C DNP spectra showed additional DNP maxima compared to the simulations. This has been attributed to methyl rotor induced 1H-13C heteronuclear cross relaxation in [1-13C] acetate present at 1 T and 77 K.</description>

      <title>MADWAVE3: a quantum time dependent wave packet code for nonadiabatic state-to-state reaction dynamics of triatomic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present MADWAVE3, a FORTRAN90 code designed for quantum time dependent wave packet propagation in triatomic systems. This program allows the calculation of state-to-state probabilities for inelastic and reactive collisions, as well as photodissociation processes, over one or multiple coupled diabatic electronic states. The code is highly parallelized using MPI and OpenMP. The execution requires the potential energy surfaces of the different electronic states involved, as well as the transition dipole moments for photodissociation processes. The formalism underlying the code is presented in section 2, together with the modular structure of the code. This is followed by the installation procedures and a comprehensive list and explanation of the parameters that control the code, organized within their respective namelists. Finally, a case study is presented, focusing on the prototypical reactive collision H+DH(v,j) -&gt; H2(v',j') + D. Both the potential energy surface and the input files required to reproduce the calculation are provided and are available on the repository main page. This example is used to study the parallelization speedup of the code.</description>

      <title>Quadratic unconstrained binary optimization and constraint programming approaches for lattice-based cyclic peptide docking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The peptide-protein docking problem is an important problem in structural biology that facilitates rational and efficient drug design. In this work, we explore modeling and solving this problem with the quantum-amenable quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) formalism. Our work extends recent efforts by incorporating the objectives and constraints associated with peptide cyclization and peptide-protein docking in the two-particle model on a tetrahedral lattice. We propose a ``resource efficient'' QUBO encoding for this problem, and baseline its performance with a novel constraint programming (CP) approach. We implement an end-to-end framework that enables the evaluation of our methods on instances from the Protein Data Bank (PDB). Our results show that the QUBO approach, using a classical simulated annealing solver, is able to find feasible conformations for problems with up to 6 peptide residues and 34 target protein residues, but has trouble scaling beyond this problem size. In contrast, the CP approach can solve problems with up to 13 peptide residues and 34 target protein residues. We conclude that while QUBO can be used to successfully tackle this problem, its scaling limitations and the strong performance of the CP method suggest that it may not be the best choice.</description>

      <title>How quickly can sodium-ion learn? Assessing scenarios for techno-economic competitiveness against lithium-ion batteries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13759v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sodium-ion batteries have garnered significant attention as a potentially low-cost alternative to lithium-ion batteries, which have experienced supply shortages and pricing volatility of key minerals. Here we assess their techno-economic competitiveness against incumbent lithium-ion batteries using a modeling framework incorporating componential learning curves constrained by minerals prices and engineering design floors. We compare projected sodium-ion and lithium-ion price trends across over 6,000 scenarios while varying Na-ion technology development roadmaps, supply chain scenarios, market penetration, and learning rates. Assuming substantial progress can be made along technology roadmaps via targeted R&amp;D, we identify many sodium-ion pathways that might reach cost-competitiveness with low-cost lithium-ion variants in the early 2030s. Additionally, we show timelines are highly sensitive to movements in critical minerals supply chains -- namely that of lithium, graphite, and nickel. Modeled outcomes suggest increasing sodium-ion energy densities to decrease materials intensity to be among the most impactful ways to improve competitiveness.</description>

      <title>$\nabla^2$DFT: A Universal Quantum Chemistry Dataset of Drug-Like Molecules and a Benchmark for Neural Network Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14347v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Methods of computational quantum chemistry provide accurate approximations of molecular properties crucial for computer-aided drug discovery and other areas of chemical science. However, high computational complexity limits the scalability of their applications. Neural network potentials (NNPs) are a promising alternative to quantum chemistry methods, but they require large and diverse datasets for training. This work presents a new dataset and benchmark called $\nabla^2$DFT that is based on the nablaDFT. It contains twice as much molecular structures, three times more conformations, new data types and tasks, and state-of-the-art models. The dataset includes energies, forces, 17 molecular properties, Hamiltonian and overlap matrices, and a wavefunction object. All calculations were performed at the DFT level ($\omega$B97X-D/def2-SVP) for each conformation. Moreover, $\nabla^2$DFT is the first dataset that contains relaxation trajectories for a substantial number of drug-like molecules. We also introduce a novel benchmark for evaluating NNPs in molecular property prediction, Hamiltonian prediction, and conformational optimization tasks. Finally, we propose an extendable framework for training NNPs and implement 10 models within it.</description>

      <title>Double Configuration Interaction Singles: Scalable and size-intensive approach for orbital relaxation in excited states and bond-dissociation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09912v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel theoretical scheme for orbital relaxation in configuration interaction singles (CIS) based on a perturbative treatment of its electronic Hessian, whose analytical derivation is also established in this work. The proposed method, which can be interpreted as a "CIS-then-CIS" scheme, variationally accounts for orbital relaxation in excited states, thus significantly reducing the overestimation of charge-transfer excitation energies commonly associated with standard CIS. Additionally, by incorporating de-excitation effects from CIS, we demonstrate that our approach effectively describes single bond dissociation. Notably, all these improvements are achieved at a mean-field cost, with the pre-factor further reduced with the efficient algorithm introduced here, while preserving the size-intensive property of CIS.</description>

      <title>Relevant, hidden, and frustrated information in high-dimensional analyses of complex dynamical systems with internal noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09412v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extracting from trajectory data meaningful information to understand complex systems might be non-trivial. High-dimensional analyses are typically assumed to be desirable, if not required, to prevent losing important information. However, to what extent such high-dimensionality is really needed/beneficial often remains not clear. Here we challenge such a fundamental general problem. As first representative cases of a system with internal dynamical complexity, we study atomistic molecular dynamics trajectories of liquid water and ice coexisting in dynamical equilibrium in correspondence of the solid/liquid transition temperature. To attain an intrinsically high-dimensional analysis, we use the Smooth Overlap of Atomic Positions (SOAP) descriptor, obtaining a large dataset containing 2.56e6 576-dimensional SOAP vectors that we analyze in various ways. Surprisingly, our results demonstrate how the time-series data contained in one single SOAP dimension accounting only for &lt;0.001% of the total variance (thus considered negligible and discarded in typical variance-based dimensionality reduction approaches) is as much, and even more descriptive than the entire high-dimensional dataset. Adding more dimensions to the analysis is found detrimental due to "frustrated information" phenomena that are proven general, and are observed also in the analysis of, e.g., experimental trajectories of collective convolutions of active microparticles (used as a second case study). This work explicitly demonstrates how high-dimensional analyses are not necessarily better than low-dimensional ones. These results also demonstrate the importance of considering the quality (relevance) over the quantity of information, especially when dealing with noisy high-dimensional datasets, where the noise of one dimension may have higher statistical weight than the relevant information contained into another.</description>

      <title>Measuring the molecular Migdal effect with neutron scattering on diatomic gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08866v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Migdal effect is a key inelastic signal channel which could be used to detect low-mass dark matter, but it has never been observed experimentally using Standard Model probes. Here we propose a conceptual design for an experiment which could detect the Migdal effect in diatomic molecules through low-energy neutron scattering, and we provide the requirements on the beam spectrum and reducible backgrounds such that a detection may be achieved. The enhancement of the Migdal rate through non-adiabatic couplings, which are absent in isolated atoms, combined with the distinctive photon energies of electronic transitions in CO, suggest that a positive detection of the molecular Migdal effect may be possible with modest beam times at existing neutron facilities.</description>
