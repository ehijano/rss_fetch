      <title>Revealing Structure and Symmetry of Nonlinearity in Natural and Engineering Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Energy transfer across scales is fundamental in fluid dynamics, linking large-scale flow motions to small-scale turbulent structures in engineering and natural environments. Triadic interactions among three wave components form complex networks across scales, challenging understanding and model reduction. We introduce Triadic Orthogonal Decomposition (TOD), a method that identifies coherent flow structures optimally capturing spectral momentum transfer, quantifies their coupling and energy exchange in an energy budget bispectrum, and reveals the regions where they interact. TOD distinguishes three components--a momentum recipient, donor, and catalyst--and recovers laws governing pairwise, six-triad, and global triad conservation. Applied to unsteady cylinder wake and wind turbine wake data, TOD reveals networks of triadic interactions with forward and backward energy transfer across frequencies and scales.</description>

      <title>From lab to landscape-scale experiments for the morphodynamics of sand dunes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review the main processes that drive the morphodynamics of dunes, i.e. their growth in height, migration and elongation, and emphasise the contribution of experiments to the understanding of these mechanisms. The main control parameters are the sediment flux $Q$ and the saturation length $L_{\rm sat}$ associated with the spatial relaxation of the flux towards the transport capacity. The other relevant quantities are essentially dimensionless: fluid response to a bed perturbation, dune geometry (orientation, aspect ratio), transport ratios under multi-directional wind regimes. We argue that laboratory experiments dealing with sedimentary bedforms in water flows are good analogues to study the morphodynamics of aeolian dunes at reduced length and time scales, as $L_{\rm sat}$ and $L_{\rm sat}^2/Q$ are expected to be smaller for subaqueous bedload. Besides, dune shape and dynamics are mainly governed by flow and boundary conditions, independent of the transport mode. We discuss different experimental set-ups and results, especially concerning dune pattern orientation and dune interaction. Under natural wind regimes in terrestrial deserts, we show the potential of field experiments in which the control of initial and boundary conditions allows for the quantification of all the relevant mechanisms involved in dune growth. We emphasise the general agreement between observations, measurements and theoretical predictions, which indicates a robust comprehension of the underlying processes. This understanding can serve as a foundation for further investigations, including the interpretation of dune landscapes and the resolution of inverse problems.</description>

      <title>Large Eddy Simulation using Nonlinearly Stable Flux Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The performance of the nonlinearly stable flux reconstruction (NSFR) schemes for resolving subsonic viscous turbulent free-shear flows is investigated. The schemes are extensively verified for the direct numerical simulation (DNS) of the Taylor-Green Vortex (TGV) problem. Several under-resolved simulations of the TGV problem are conducted to assess the performance of NSFR for large eddy simulation that is implicitly filtered and fully implicit (ILES). Increasing the flux reconstruction correction parameter ensures that NSFR is stable and accurate for ILES while allowing for larger explicit time-steps. The entropy-stable schemes implemented with sum-factorization for tensor and Hadamard products are shown to be more cost-effective than classical DG with over-integration. The choice of the two-point (TP) numerical flux does not impact the solution and the use of standard eddy-viscosity-based sub-grid scale models does not yield improvements for the problem considered. From the DNS results, the pressure dilatation-based dissipation rate for the nonlinearly stable schemes is consistent with literature when computed from the kinetic energy (KE) budget terms, while spurious oscillations are seen when the term is directly computed. The magnitude of these oscillations is significantly lower for a collocated scheme and are effectively eliminated with the addition of Roe upwind dissipation to the TP numerical flux. Therefore, these oscillations are believed to be associated with the treatment of the face terms in nonlinearly stable schemes. It is shown that oversampling the velocity field is necessary for obtaining accurate turbulent KE (TKE) spectra and eliminates an apparent pile-up of TKE at the smallest resolved scales. Lastly, the TKE spectra for a decaying homogeneous isotropic turbulence case are in good agreement with experiment measurements and computational results in the literature.</description>

      <title>Convectons in unbalanced natural doubly diffusive convection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fluids subject to both thermal and compositional variations can undergo doubly diffusive convection when these properties both affect the fluid density and diffuse at different rates. In natural doubly diffusive convection, the gradients of temperature and salinity are aligned with each other and orthogonal to gravity. The resulting buoyancy-driven flows are known to lead to the formation of a variety of patterns, including spatially localized states of convection surrounded by quiescent fluid, which are known as convectons. Localized pattern formation in natural doubly diffusive convection has been studied under a specific balance where the effects of temperature and salinity changes are opposite but of equal intensity on the fluid density. In this case, a steady conduction state exists and convectons bifurcate from it. The aforementioned buoyancy balance underpins our knowledge of this pattern formation but it is an ideal case that can hardly be met experimentally or in nature. This article addresses how localized pattern formation in natural doubly diffusive convection is affected by departures from the balanced case. In particular, the absence of a conduction state leads to the unfolding of the bifurcations to convectons. In thermally dominated regimes, the background flow promotes localized states with convection rolls attached to the end-walls, known as anticonvectons, and the existence of these states is found to be related to the emergence of convectons. The results presented here shed light on the convecton robustness against changes in the buoyancy ratio and extend the scope of our understanding of localized pattern formation in fluid systems.</description>

      <title>A universal integral scaling of the mean velocity profiles in turbulent wall-bounded flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scaling of the mean velocity profiles has been studied by many researchers, since it provides a template of universal dynamical patterns across a range of Reynolds numbers. Various normalization schemes have been shown in the past, some with a good degree of success. An alternative, universal scaling is presented, where an integrated velocity serves as a universal template for incompressible, adverse pressure-gradient and compressible flows.</description>

      <title>Effect of Gaussian wake amplitude on wake-induced transition for a T106A low pressure turbine cascade</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The wake-induced transition on the suction surface of a T106A low-pressure turbine (LPT) blade is investigated through a series of implicit large eddy simulations, solving the two-dimensional (2D) compressible Navier-Stokes equations (NSE). The impact of the incoming Gaussian wake amplitude on the blade's profile loss and associated boundary layer parameters is examined, revealing a 50\% reduction in skin friction drag at the highest amplitude. The results indicate that increasing wake amplitude leads to delayed separation and earlier reattachment, resulting in reduced separated flow. The vorticity and enstrophy dynamics during the transition process under varying wake amplitudes reveal characteristic features of wake-induced transition, such as puffs, streaks, and turbulent spots. The periodic passing of wakes induces intermittent "calmed regions", which suppress flow separation and improve profile loss at low Reynolds numbers (Re), typically found in LPTs. The energy budget, accounting for both translational and rotational energy via the turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) and compressible enstrophy transport equation (CETE), respectively, shows trends with increasing wake amplitude. The relative contribution to TKE production and the roles of baroclinicity, compressibility, and viscous terms are explained.</description>

      <title>Chiral swimmer with a regular arbitrary active patch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the low Reynolds number hydrodynamics of a spherical swimmer with a predominantly hydrophobic surface, except for a hydrophilic active patch. This active patch covers a portion of the surface and exhibits chiral activity that varies as a function of $\theta$ and $\phi$. Our study considers two types of active patches: (i) a symmetric active patch (independent of $\phi$) and (ii) an arbitrary active patch (depends on both $\theta$ and $\phi$). The swimming velocity, rotation rate, and flow field of the swimmer are calculated analytically. The objective of this work is to find the optimal configurations for both patch models to maximize the swimmer's velocity and efficiency. Interestingly, the maximum velocity can be controlled by adjusting the hydrophobicity, patch configuration, and strength of the surface activity. We find that for the symmetric patch model, the swimmer's velocity is $U_{SP} = 1.414 U_s$, where $U_s$ is the velocity of a swimmer whose surface is fully covered with chiral activity as a reference. For the arbitrary patch model, the velocity is $U_{AP} = 1.45 U_s$, which is higher than that of the symmetric patch model. Our results indicate that swimmers with low hydrophobicity exhibit efficient swimming characteristics. Additionally, due to the incomplete coverage of the active patch, the Stokeslet and Rotlet terms appear in the flow field generated by the swimmer, which is a deviation compared to the case of a swimmer whose surface is fully covered with chiral activity. This study provides insights useful for designing synthetic active particles, which can be applied, for example, in targeted drug delivery, chemotaxis, and phototaxis.</description>

      <title>Comparing design and off-design aerodynamic performance of a natural laminar airfoil</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Natural laminar flow airfoils are essential technologies designed to reduce drag and significantly enhance aerodynamic performance. A notable example is the SHM1 airfoil, created to meet the requirements of the small-business Honda jet. This airfoil has undergone extensive testing across various operational conditions, including low-speed wind tunnel tests and flight tests across a range of Reynolds numbers and free-stream Mach numbers, as detailed in "Natural-laminar-flow airfoil development for a lightweight business jet" by Fujino et al., J. Aircraft, 40(4), 2003. Additionally, investigations into drag-divergence behavior have been conducted using a transonic wind tunnel, with subsequent studies focusing on transonic shock boundary layer interactions through both experimental and numerical approaches. This study employs a series of numerical simulations to analyze the flow physics and aerodynamic performance across different free-stream Mach numbers in the subsonic and transonic regimes. This is achieved by examining computed instantaneous numerical Schlieren for various design conditions (such as low speed, climb, and cruise) and off-design scenarios (including transonic shock emergence, drag-divergence, and shock-induced separation). The dominant time scales, the time-averaged load distributions and boundary layer parameters are compared to provide a comprehensive overview of the SHM1's aerodynamics, establishing benchmark results for optimization of various flow separation and shock control techniques.</description>

      <title>Shape modes and jet formation on ultrasound-driven wall-attached bubbles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding bubble behaviour under ultrasound excitation is key for applications like industrial cleaning and biomedical treatments. Our previous work demonstrated that ultrasound-induced shape instabilities in microbubbles generate periodic jets capable of puncturing cells and enabling targeted drug delivery (Cattaneo et al., 2024). This study investigates the physics of these instabilities in a controlled setup involving individual micrometric air bubbles on rigid substrates. Using a dual-view imaging system combining visible light and phase-contrast x-ray radiation, we capture high-speed, high-resolution recordings on bubble shape dynamics. Four distinct response regimes are identified: spherical oscillations, harmonic meniscus waves, half-harmonic axisymmetric shape mode, and mixed shape mode. The half-harmonic modes arise from Faraday instability, with pressure thresholds aligning well with classical interface stability theory adapted for rigid substrates. Simulations using a 3D boundary element method closely match experimental observations, validating this approach for predicting bubble dynamics. The shape mode spectrum shows degeneracy and a continuous range of mode degrees, consistent with our theoretical predictions. Shape modes achieve higher amplitudes than volumetric modes, making them more effective at converting acoustic energy into kinetic energy. These modes generate substrate-directed jets when a lobe folds inward with sufficient acceleration. This process recurs with each cycle of the shape mode and has the potential to damage the substrate. These jets represent a new class of bubble jets, distinct from classical single inertial jets that form under high-pressure gradients during bubble collapse, as they are cyclic, driven by an interfacial instability, and occur at much lower acoustic intensities.</description>

      <title>Extended Buoyancy-Drag Model for Ablative Rayleigh-Taylor Instability Seeded by Various Perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In inertial confinement fusion (ICF), affected by non-steady ablation and various physical mechanisms, we extend the classical buoyancy-drag (BD) model into an ablative version for evaluating and controlling nonlinear ablative Rayleigh-Taylor instability (ARTI) in real space. The application of our ablative BD model in the nonlinear phase lies in a single adjustable coefficient influenced by initial perturbations, linear growth rate and terminal velocity. After validating the effectiveness and sensitivity of this model through simulations, we propose a strategy to shift the dominant mode away from the "most dangerous mode", which depends on initial perturbations. Our findings suggest that the "most dangerous mode" may clarify gain differences among targets of similar qualities and provide guidance for target manufacturing and pulse optimization in proximity to the ignition cliff.</description>

      <title>A total-shear-stress-conserved wall model for large-eddy simulation of high-Reynolds number wall turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wall-modeled large-eddy simulation (WMLES) is widely recognized as a useful method for simulation of turbulent flows at high Reynolds numbers. Nevertheless, a continual issue in different wall models is the shift of the mean velocity profile from the wall-model/RANS (Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes) region to the LES region. This phenomenon, referred to as logarithmic layer mismatch (LLM), occurs in both wall shear stress models and hybrid RANS/LES models. Many efforts have been made to explain and resolve this mismatch, including decreasing the high correlation between the wall shear stress and the velocity at the matching layer, modifying the subgrid-scale (SGS) eddy viscosity, and adding a stochastic forcing. It is widely believed that the inclusion of the resolved Reynolds shear stress (or the convection term) is essential to elliminate the LLM, as it prevents the overseimation of the modeled Reynolds shear stress and promotes the generation of the small-scale flow structures in the near-wall region. In this work, by comparing three different SGS eddy viscosity models, we demonstrate that ensuring the total shear stress conservation (TSSC) conservation is key to resolving the LLM. Under the TSSC framework, the effect of the convection term on LLM can be quantitatively assessed. Furthermore, a modified SGS eddy viscosity modfication model that adheres to the TSSC constraint is tested at different Reynolds numbers ($Re_\tau=1000, 2000, 4200$). Our results demonstrate the robust performance of the present model in predicting skin friction and low-order turbulence statistics, even under a relatively low grid resolution ($\Delta x^+, \Delta z^+ \lesssim 500$, $2\leq \Delta_x/\Delta_{y,mat} \leq 4$, where $\Delta_{y,mat}$ is the wall-normal grid spacing in the wall-model region).</description>

      <title>Water wave interactions with a horizontal submerged elastic plate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article explores how a submerged elastic plate, clamped at one edge, interacts with water waves. Submerged elastic plates have been considered as potentially effective design elements in the development of wave energy harvesters but their behavior in a wave field remains largely unexplored, especially experimentally. Positioned at a fixed depth in a wave tank, the flexible plate demonstrates significant wave reflection capabilities, a characteristic absent in rigid plates of identical dimensions. The experiments thus reveal that plate motion is crucial for wave reflection. Sufficiently steep waves are shown to induce a change in the mean position of the plate, with the trailing edge reaching the free surface in some cases. This configuration change is found to be particularly efficient to break water waves. These findings contribute to understanding the potential of elastic plates for wave energy harvesting and wave attenuation scenarios.</description>

      <title>Internal shear layers generated by a vertically oscillating cylinder in unbounded and bounded rotating fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In previous works, we analysed the internal shear layers excited by a viscous forcing (longitudinal libration) in a spherical shell geometry (He et al., J. Fluid Mech. 939, A3, 2022; 974, A3, 2023). We now consider the stronger inviscid forcing corresponding to the vertical oscillation of the inner core. We limit our analysis to two-dimensional geometries but examine three different configurations: freely-propagating wave beams in an unbounded domain and two wave patterns (a periodic orbit and an attractor) in a cylindrical shell geometry. The asymptotic structures of the internal shear layers are assumed to follow the similarity solution of Moore &amp; Saffman (Phil. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. A, 264 (1156), 1969, 597-634) in the small viscous limit. The two undefined parameters of the similarity solution (singularity strength and amplitude) are derived by asymptotically matching the similarity solution with the inviscid solution. For each case, the derivation of the latter is achieved either through separation of variables combined with analytical continuation or the method of characteristics. Global inviscid solutions, when obtained, closely match numerical solutions for small Ekman numbers far from the critical lines, while viscous asymptotic solutions show excellent performance near those lines. The amplitude scalings of the internal shear layers excited by an inviscid forcing are found to be divergent as the Ekman number E decreases, specifically O(E-1/6) for the critical point singularity and O(E-1/3) for attractors, in contrast to the convergent scalings found for a viscous forcing.</description>

      <title>Drop-drop coalescence: a simple crossover function between inertial and viscous dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The coalescence of liquid drops is a fundamental process that remains incompletely understood, particularly in the intermediate regimes where capillary, viscous, and inertial forces are comparable. Here, we experimentally investigate the dynamics of drop-to-drop coalescence during the transition between viscous and inertial regimes using high-speed imaging. Our results reveal that the liquid bridge between droplets shows power-law growth with exponents between 1/2 and 1 during drop coalescence. We propose a novel scaling approach using a dimensionless crossover function that smoothly transitions between viscous and inertial limits. This simple approach, inspired by previous work on drop impact, successfully collapses the experimental data for a wide range of liquid viscosities and coalescence times onto a single master curve. We further compare our results with recent theoretical models and demonstrate how our approach complements and extends current understanding in the crossover of drop coalescence. This study contributes to both the fundamental physics of drop coalescence and its practical applications in various industrial processes.</description>

      <title>Fault gouge failure induced by fluid injection: Hysteresis, delay and shear-strengthening</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Natural faults often contain a fluid-saturated, granular fault-gouge layer, whose failure and sliding processes play a central role in earthquake dynamics. Using a two-dimensional discrete element model coupled with fluid dynamics, we simulate a fluid-saturated granular layer, where fluid pressure is incrementally raised. At a critical fluid pressure level, the layer fails and begins to accelerate. When we gradually reduce fluid pressure, a distinct behavior emerges: slip-rate decreases linearly until the layer halts at a fluid pressure level below that required to initiate failure. During this pressure cycle the system exhibits (1) velocity-strengthening friction and (2) frictional hysteresis. These behaviors, well established in dry granular media, are shown to extend here to shear of dense fluid-saturated granular layers. Additionally, we observe a delay between fluid pressure increase and failure, associated with pre-failure dilative strain and "dilational-hardening". During the delay period, small, arrested slip events dilate the layer in preparation for full-scale failure. Our findings may explain (i) fault motion that continues even after fluid pressure returns to pre-injection levels, and (ii) delayed failure in fluid-injection experiments, and (iii) pre-failure arrested slip events observed prior to earthquakes.</description>

      <title>Reexamination of evaporation from horizontal surfaces with implications for solar interfacial evaporation experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12186v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To explain reported solar interfacial-evaporation rates from porous materials beyond an apparent 100% efficiency using the thermal evaporation mechanism, many publications hypothesize that intermediate water inside porous materials have a reduced latent heat. Key supporting evidence is that water-only surfaces have lower dark evaporation rates than porous evaporators, with the ratio of the two rates taken as the latent heat reduction. Through simulations and experiments, we present benchmark evaporation rates of water and show that reported differences in natural evaporation are likely due to experimental error from recessed evaporating surfaces rather than from reduced latent heat. A few millimeters recession of the evaporating surface can drop evaporation rates over 50% due to a stagnant air layer, suggesting that the comparative experiments are prone to error and the latent heat reduction hypothesis cannot be substantiated. Our results indicate that new mechanistic directions need to be pursued to understand superthermal evaporation.</description>

      <title>Developing a Non-Newtonian Fluid Model for Dust, for Application to Astrophysical Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12462v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the astrophysics community it is common practice to model collisionless dust, entrained in a gas flow, as a pressureless fluid. However a pressureless fluid is fundamentally different from a collisionless fluid - the latter of which generically possess a non-zero anisotropic pressure or stress tensor. In this paper we derive a fluid model for collisionless dust, entrained in a turbulent gas, starting from the equations describing the motion of individual dust grains. We adopt a covariant formulation of our model to allow for the geometry and coordinate systems prevalent in astrophysics, and provide a closure valid for the accretion disc context. We show that the continuum mechanics properties of a dust fluid corresponds to a higher-dimensional anisotropic Maxwell fluid, after the extra dimensions are averaged out, with a dynamically important rheological stress tensor. This higher-dimensional treatment has the advantage of keeping the dust velocity and velocity of the fluid seen, and their respective moments, on the same footing. This results in a simplification of the constitutive relation describing the evolution of the dust Rheological stress.</description>

      <title>The synchronization of convective lifecycles in an idealized microscopic model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12506v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How a cloud ensemble responds to external forcing is a puzzle in tropical convection research. Convectively coupled gravity waves (CCGWs) in a finite domain have controllable wavelengths, providing a convenient simulation setup for studying the cloud ensemble. A multiscale analysis shows that the growth of CCGWs in a finite-domain involves not only the amplitude growth of individual clouds but also the synchronization of convective lifecycles. To understand the synchronization mechanism, we build a microscopic model with many clouds. For each cloud, the microscopic model simulates the evolution of equivalent potential temperature $\theta_e$ in the boundary layer, which is reduced by convective transport and radiative cooling and increased by surface heating. At the shallow convection stage, the $\theta_e$ grows until reaching an upper threshold where the convective inhibition energy is eliminated, and the system transitions to the deep convection stage. At the deep convection stage, the $\theta_e$ drops until reaching a lower threshold where the convective available potential energy is exhausted, and the system transitions to the shallow convection stage. The wave influences $\theta_e$ with the boundary layer convergent flow and adjusts the phase of the convective lifecycle. Numerical simulations of the microscopic model show that when the period of convection and wave equals, the wave gradually synchronizes convection. Theoretical analysis shows that the microscopic synchronization appears as the macroscopic resonant growth of the cloud ensemble. In the resonant state, the averaged $\theta_e$ and vertical velocity in the boundary layer are in phase, agreeing with the cloud-permitting simulation.</description>

      <title>A fully observer-covariant formulation of the fluid dynamics of simple fluids: derivation, simple examples and a generalized Orr-Sommerfeld equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13767v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a formalism to describe the motion of a fluid that is fully covariant with respect to arbitrary observers. To achieve full covariance, we write prognostic equations for quantities that belong to the graded exterior algebra of the cotangent bundle of the manifold occupied by the fluid. In particular, equations are that are fully covariant can be written for a purely Lagrangian observer, for which the fluid velocity (qua section of the tangent bundle) is not a meaningful concept. With the new formalism, we consider problems of stability, and we derive a generalization of the Orr-Sommerfeld equation that describes the evolution of perturbations relative to an arbitrary observer. The latter is applied to cases where the observer is the Lagrangian observer comoving with the background flow.</description>

      <title>Separation of a Laminar Boundary Layer Subjected to Pressure Gradients with Spanwise Variations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06495v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The characteristics of three-dimensional laminar separation bubbles (LSBs), compared with their quasi-two-dimensional counterparts, are studied using direct numerical simulation. A three-dimensional suction-blowing distribution is applied on the top boundary to induce flow separation. Three levels of suction strength (i.e., adverse pressure gradient (APG) strength) are tested. For each suction level, the spanwise extent of the suction is varied. Two non-uniform suction distributions are compared with uniformly-applied suction across the full span (implying a two-dimensional LSB), totaling nine cases. All cases are performed at $Re_\delta = U_{\infty}\delta/\nu = 1000$ based on the inflow boundary layer thickness ($\delta$) and free-stream velocity ($U_{\infty}$). Initial results indicate stark contrast between three-dimensional and two-dimensional LSBs. Most notably, the role of suction width is determining the topology of the LSB and its reattachment mechanism. Meanwhile, APG is responsible for determining the size of the LSB and level of turbulence at reattachment. Streamwise-oriented vortices are identified along the crest of the three-dimensional LSBs.</description>

      <title>Evaporation-driven coalescence of two droplets undergoing freezing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09827v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine the evaporation-induced coalescence of two droplets undergoing freezing by conducting numerical simulations employing the lubrication approximation. When two sessile drops undergo freezing in close vicinity over a substrate, they interact with each other through the gaseous phase and the simultaneous presence of evaporation/condensation. In an unsaturated environment, the evaporation flux over the two volatile sessile drops is asymmetric, with lower evaporation in the region between the two drops. This asymmetry in the evaporation flux generates an asymmetric curvature in each drop, which results in a capillary flow that drives the drops closer to each other, eventually leading to their coalescence. This capillary flow, driven by evaporation, competes with the upward movement of the freezing front, depending on the relative humidity in the surrounding environment. We found that higher relative humidity reduces the evaporative flux, delaying capillary flow and impeding coalescence by restricting contact line motion. For a constant relative humidity, the substrate temperature governs the coalescence phenomenon, and resulting condensation can accelerate this process. Interestingly, lower substrate temperatures are observed to facilitate faster propagation of the freezing front, which, in turn, restricts coalescence.</description>

      <title>A method for evaluating relations of turbulent normal-stresses by experimental data over a wide range of Reynolds numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23669v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, Nagib et al (2024} utilized indicator functions of profiles of the streamwise normal stress to reveal the ranges of validity, in wall distance and Reynolds number, for each of two proposed models in DNS of channel and pipe flows. A method more suited to experimental data is proposed here, as establishing accurate indicator functions is a challenge. The new method is outlined and used with the two leading models that propose either a logarithmic or power trend, for the normal stresses of turbulence in a fitting region of wall-bounded flows. The method, which is simple and robust, is used to evaluate each model over a wide range of Reynolds numbers by applying it to two of the prominent experimental data sets in zero-pressure-gradient boundary layers (ZPG) and pipe flows. A somewhat larger exponent for the power trend equal to 0.28, instead of 0.25, is found to slightly extend its range of validity. Correcting for outer intermittency in ZPG data also extends validity of the power trend to around half the boundary layer thickness. Projecting near-wall peak normal-stress values using both models based on data from locations in the fitting region, yields nearly identical results up to the highest Re available from these two experiments.Neither model directly represents the inner peak values and differ by as much as 30%. However, the two relations provide projected values at Re=10M with a relative difference of approximately 6.2%; distinguishing between these values would require measurement accuracy well beyond our capabilities. Current results and those of Monkewitz and Nagib (2023) on the mean flow, suggest that considerations of nonlinear growth of eddies from the wall and accounting for some viscous effects, are important for modeling wall-bounded flows. Such effects also apply to potential refinements of the logarithmic trend along ideas advanced by Deshpande et al. (2021).</description>

      <title>Features of the Contact Angle Hysteresis at the Nanoscale: A Molecular Dynamics Insight</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.14986v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the physics of a three-phase contact line between gas, liquid, and solid is important for numerous applications. At the macroscale, the three-phase contact line response to an external force action is often characterized by a contact angle hysteresis, and several models are presented in the literature for its description. Yet, there is still a need for more information about such model applications at the nanoscale. In this study, a molecular dynamics approach was used to investigate the shape of a liquid droplet under an external force for different wetting regimes. In addition, an analytic model for describing the droplet shape was developed. It gives us the possibility to evaluate the receding and advancing wetting angle accurately. With our modeling, we found that the interplay between capillary forces and viscous forces is crucial to characterize the droplet shape at the nanoscale. In this frame, the importance of the rolling movement of the interface between liquid and vapor was pointed out. We also demonstrate that in the range of the external forces when capillary forces are most significant compared to others, hysteresis is well described by the macroscale Cox-Voinov model.</description>

Abstract: The dip-coating geometry, where a solid plate is withdrawn from or plunged into a liquid pool, offers a prototypical example of wetting flows involving contact-line motion. Such flows are commonly studied using the lubrication approximation approach which is intrinsically limited to small interface slopes and thus small contact angles. Flows for arbitrary contact angles, however, can be studied using a generalized lubrication theory that builds upon viscous corner flow solutions. Here we derive this generalized lubrication theory for viscoelastic liquids that exhibit normal stress effects and are modelled using the second-order fluid model. We apply our theory to advancing and receding contact lines in the dip-coating geometry, highlighting the influence of viscoelastic normal stresses for contact line motion at arbitrary contact angle.</description>

      <title>Unstable gas flow in a flat channel under the influence of a transverse force field: self-oscillations of the jet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09272v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A subsonic flow of an ideal gas through a flat channel in the presence of a mass force field is considered. The forces acting on the gas are reduced to the attraction to the channel axis in a certain region of the channel. It has been shown that the occurrence of a zone of increased pressure along the axis of a channel leads to the formation of a pressure gradient, which acts as an effective force which opposes the flow. As a result, the flow becomes unstable. For a weak field, this instability is symmetric, while for strong fields it is asymmetric. The characteristics of this instability have been studied numerically in the present work. Possible astrophysical implications of this phenomenon are also discussed.</description>
