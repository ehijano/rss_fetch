      <title>Could SBND-PRISM probe Lepton Flavor Violation?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the possibility of using the Short-Baseline Near Detector (SBND) at Fermilab to constrain lepton flavor violating decays of pions and kaons. We study how to leverage SBND-PRISM, the use of the neutrino beam angular spread to mitigate systematic uncertainties, to enhance this analysis. We show that SBND-PRISM can put stringent limits on the flavor violating branching ratios $\rm{BR}(\pi^+ \to \mu^+ \nu_e) = 8.9 \times 10^{-4}$, $\rm{BR}(K^+ \to \mu^+ \nu_e) = 3.2 \times 10^{-3}$, improving previous constraints by factors 9 and 1.25, respectively. We also estimate the SBND-PRISM sensitivity to lepton number violating decays, $\rm{BR}(\pi^+ \to \mu^+ \overline{\nu}_e)= 2.1 \times 10^{-3}$ and $\rm{BR}(K^+ \to \mu^+ \overline{\nu}_e) = 7.4 \times 10^{-3}$, though not reaching previous BEBC limits. Last, we identify several ways how the SBND collaboration could improve this analysis.</description>

      <title>Astrophysical constraints from synchrotron emission on very massive decaying dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: If the cosmological dark matter (DM) couples to Standard Model (SM) fields, it can decay promptly to SM states in a highly energetic hard process, which subsequently showers and hadronizes to give stable particles including $e^\pm$, $\gamma$, $p^{\pm}$ and $\nu\bar{\nu}$ at lower energy. If the DM particle is very heavy, the high-energy $e^\pm$, due to the Klein-Nishina cross section suppression, preferentially lose energy via synchrotron emission which, in turn, can be of unusually high energies. Here, we present novel bounds on heavy decaying DM up to the Planck scale, by studying the synchrotron emission from the $e^\pm$ produced in the ambient Galactic magnetic field. In particular, we explore the sensitivity of the resulting constraints on the DM decay width to (i) different SM decay channels, to (ii) the Galactic magnetic field configurations, and (iii) to various different DM density profiles proposed in the literature. We find that constraints from the synchrotron component complement and improve on constraints from very high-energy cosmic-ray and gamma-ray observatories targeting the prompt emission when the DM is sufficiently massive, most significantly for masses in excess of $10^{12}\text{ GeV}$.</description>

      <title>Production of dileptonic bound states in the Higgs boson decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The production of single and paired lepton bound states in the decay of the Higgs boson has been studied. We explore different decay mechanisms that contribute significantly to the decay width. The decay widths are calculated taking into account relativistic corrections in the decay amplitude and in the wave function of the bound state of leptons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modular flavor symmetries refers to scenarios in which fermion masses respect modular symmetries. Such scenarios have been studied in the bottom-up approach and have an explicit realization in string theory. They rely on the remarkable properties of vector-valued modular forms.</description>

      <title>Beyond the Standard Model: An overview</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At present, the Standard Model (SM) agrees with almost all collider data. Yet, three finetuning issues -- the Higgs mass problem, the strong CP problem and the cosmological constant problem -- all call for new physics. The most plausible solutions at present are weak scale SUSY, the PQWW axion and the string landscape. A re-evaluation of EW finetuning in SUSY allows for a higgsino-like LSP and naturalness upper bounds well beyond LHC limits. Rather general arguments from string theory allow for statistical predictions that m_h~ 125 GeV with sparticles beyond present LHC limits. The most lucrative LHC search channel may be for light higgsino pair production. Dark matter turns out to be a SUSY DFSZ axion along with a diminished abundance of higgsino-like WIMPs.</description>

      <title>$U_A(1)$ symmetry breaking quark interactions from vacuum polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By considering the one loop background field method for a quark-antiquark interaction mediated by one (non perturbative) gluon exchange, sixth order quark effective interactions are derived and investigated in the limit of zero momentum transfer. They extend fourth order quark interactions worked out in previous works of the author. These interactions break $U_A(1)$ symmetry and may be either momentum independent or dependent. Part of these $U_A(1)$ breaking interactions vanish in the limit of massless quarks and several other - involving vector and/or axial quark currents - survive even in the absence of Dynamical Symmetry Breaking. By means of the auxiliary field method, these interactions give rise to three meson interactions whose values are compared to phenomenological values found in the literature. By restricting to the up and down quark sector, some three-meson couplings correspond to the strong decay of specific light axial-vector mesons. These (strong) decays are shown to yield an asymmetry in the production rate of positive and negative pions by means of interference effects that arise due to neutral meson mixings.</description>

      <title>Confronting MSSM flat direction inflation with Planck/BICEP data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the scenario of inflection point inflation where a flat direction of the minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM) is identified with the inflaton. Specifically, we consider in full generality the cases where a MSSM flat direction is lifted by a higher-dimensional superpotential whose dimension is n = 4, 5, 6, 7, 9. We confront the inflection point inflation scenarios with various n with the Planck and BICEP data, and thereby constrain the soft SUSY breaking mass and the coefficient of the higher-dimensional operator that lifts the flat direction.</description>

      <title>Right-handed neutrino dark matter in $U(1)_X$SSM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is strong evidence for the existence of dark matter in a number of current experiments. We study dark matter using the $U(1)_X$SSM obtained from the $U(1)_X$ extension of the minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM). In the $U(1)_X$SSM, we use the right-handed neutrino as a dark matter candidate, whose lightest mass eigenstate has cold dark matter features. In this paper, the relic density of right-handed neutrino as dark matter is investigated. For dark matter scattering, both spin-independent and spin-dependent cross sections are studied. In the final numerical results obtained, some parameter spaces can satisfy the constraints of the relic density and dark matter direct detection experiments.</description>

      <title>Mass generation via nonlinear massive solution in Higgs potential and particle creations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nonlinear massive plane wave solution of the classical scalar field in the Higgs potential is revisited to study the mass generation and particle creation. In particular, by assuming that the Higgs system is in the slightly excited state in early universe and it is described by the nonlinear solution, we study the mass generation mechanism for massive vector bosons and a heavy fermion in the quantum field theory around the nonlinear massive classical field. The nonlinear massive classical solution gives the transition from the vacuum to a pair of vector bosons and fermions. We present the new formulae of the probability density of the production process for particles in the standard model of elementary particle physics. The probability densities of the particle productions vanish when the nonlinear massive solution reduces to the constant solution (the classical vacuum expectation value); while the probability densities are expressed as the function of the free parameter in the classical solution in general case. We discuss the behavior of the probability densities for the three oscillating modes in the classical solution.</description>

      <title>Assignment of charmed-strange $D_{s0}(2590)^+$ and $D_{sJ}(3040)^+$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on analyses of the mass and the strong decay features, $D_{s0}(2590)^+$ observed by LHCb collaboration is identified as a radial excitation of the pseudoscalar $D_s$, and $D_{sJ}(3040)^+$ observed by BaBar collaboration is identified as a radial excitation of $D_{s1}(2536)^\pm$. $D_{s0}(2590)^+$ is possibly a pure $D_{s}(2~^1S_0)$ meson, both basic $D_{s1}(2536)^\pm$ and radially excited $D_{sJ}(3040)^+$ are possibly the mixtures $D_s(nP_1)$ between spin triplet $D_s(n~^3P_1)$ and spin singlet $D_s(n~^1P_1)$. In this arrangement, their masses meet the linear behavior of the radial Regge trajectory very well. In the $^3P_0$ strong decay model, the decay channels of $D_{s0}(2590)^+$ are $D^{*0}K^+$ and $D^{*+}K^0$, the total decay width is predicted with $\Gamma=76.12$ MeV. The main decay channels of $D_{sJ}(3040)^+$ are $D^{*0}K^+$/$D^{*+}K^0$ and $D^{*0}K^{*+}$/$D^{*+}K^{*0}$, the total decay width is predicted with $\Gamma=283.46$ MeV. These numerical strong decay results are consistent with the experiment data and support our arrangement. The dimensionless strength creation parameter $\gamma$ plays an important role in the calculation, and $\gamma=9.57$ is fixed through a comparison of the predicted strong decay widths of $D^*_{s2}(2573)$ and $D^*_{s3}(2860)^{\pm}$ with experimental data.</description>

      <title>Approaching the conformal limit of quark matter with different chemical potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study in detail the influence of different chemical potentials (baryon, charged, strange, and neutrino) on how and how fast a free gas of quarks in the zero-temperature limit reaches the conformal limit. We discuss the influence of non-zero masses, the inclusion of leptons, and different constraints, such as charge neutrality, zero-net strangeness, and fixed lepton fraction. We also investigate for the first time how the symmetry energy of the system under some of these conditions approaches the conformal limit. Finally, we briefly discuss what kind of corrections are expected from perturbative QCD as one goes away from the conformal limit.</description>

      <title>Probing the structure of $X(3872)$ in photoproduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the production of $X(3872)$ mesons in photon-induced nuclear reactions near the threshold within the collision model based on the nuclear spectral function. The model accounts for direct photon-nucleon $X(3872)$ production processes as well as five different scenarios for their internal structure. We calculate the absolute and relative excitation functions for $X(3872)$ production off $^{12}$C and $^{184}$W target nuclei at near-threshold incident photon energies of 8--16 GeV, the absolute differential cross sections for their production off these target nuclei at laboratory angles of 0$^{\circ}$--10$^{\circ}$ and for incident photon energy of 13 GeV as well as the A dependences of the relative (transparency ratios) cross sections for $X(3872)$ production from ${\gamma}A$ collisions at photon energies around 13 GeV within the adopted scenarios for the $X(3872)$ meson internal structure. We show that the absolute and relative observables considered reveal distinct sensitivity to these scenarios. Therefore, the measurement of such observables in a dedicated experiment at the CEBAF facility in the near-threshold energy range will allow us to get valuable information on the $X(3872)$ inner structure.</description>

      <title>The Vector Dark Matter, LHC Constraints Including a 95 GeV Light Higgs Boson</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study LHC searches for an extension of the Standard Model (SM) by exploiting an additional Abelian $U_D(1)$ gauge symmetry and a complex scalar Higgs portal. As the scalar is charged under this gauge symmetry, a vector dark matter (VDM) candidate can satisfy the observed relic abundance and limits from direct dark matter (DM) searches. The ATLAS and CMS experiments have developed a broad search program for the DM candidates, including associate production of Higgs boson, Z boson and top quark which couple to DM. In this paper, we perform an extensive analysis to constrain the model by using these experiments at LHC. It can be seen that the LHC results can exclude some parts of the parameter space which are still allowed by relic density and the direct detection searches. Furthermore, exclusion limits on the parameter space of the model by using the new results of CMS and ATLAS collaborations for new light Higgs boson with mass $\sim95~\rm GeV$ are provided.</description>

      <title>Particle-theory input for neutron-star physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the properties and physical phase of the dense strongly interacting matter present in the cores of neutron stars or created in their binary mergers remains one of the most prominent open problems in nuclear astrophysics. While most microscopic analyses have historically relied on solvable phenomenological models of nuclear and quark matter, in recent years a model-independent approach utilizing only controlled ab-initio calculations and astrophysical observations has emerged as a viable alternative.
  In these lecture notes, I review recent progress in first-principles weak-coupling calculations within high-density quark matter, shedding light on its thermodynamic and transport properties. I cover the most important technical tools used in such calculations, introduce selected highlight results, and explain how this information can be used in phenomenological studies of neutron-star physics. The notes do not offer a self-consistent treatment of the topics covered, but rather aim at filling gaps in existing textbooks on thermal field theory and at connecting the dots in a story developed in several recent research articles, to which the interested reader is directed for further technical details.</description>

      <title>Numerical implementation of evolution equations for twist-3 collinear PDFs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Twist-3 collinear parton distribution functions (PDFs) are matrix elements of quark-gluon-quark or three-gluons light-cone operators. They depend on three momentum fraction variables, which are restricted to a hexagon region, and the evolution kernels are defined via two-dimensional convolution in these variables. We present the numerical realisation of the twist-3 evolution equations at leading order in the strong coupling for all kinds of twist-3 PDF (quark, gluon, chiral-even/odd, etc). We provide two independent codes (in C and Fortran) that have been extensively cross-checked, and are ready-to-use. We supplement the paper with a review of known properties of twist-3 PDFs.</description>

      <title>Signature decay modes of the compact doubly-heavy tetraquarks $T_{bb\bar{u} \bar{d}}$ and $T_{bc\bar{u} \bar{d}}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on the expectations that the lowest-lying double-bottom tetraquark $T_{bb\bar u \bar d}$ ($J^P=1^+$) and the bottom-charm tetraquark $T_{bc\bar u \bar d}$ ($J^P=0^+$) are stable against strong and electromagnetic decays, we work out a number of semileptonic and non-leptonic weak decays of these hadrons, making use of the heavy quark symmetry. In doing this, we concentrate on the exclusive decays involving also tetraquarks in the final states, i.e., transitions such as $T_{bb\bar u \bar d} \to T_{bc\bar u \bar d} (\ell^- \nu_\ell, h^-)$ and $T_{bc\bar u \bar d} \to T_{cc\bar u \bar d} (\ell^- \nu_\ell, h^-)$, where $h^-=\pi^-,\rho^-,a_1^-$. So far, only the $J^P=1^+$ tetraquark $T_{cc\bar u \bar d}$ has been discovered, which we identify with the $I=0$ $T_{cc}^{+}$ object, compatible with $J^P=1^+$ and having the mass and decay widths $\delta m =M(T_{cc}^+) -(M(D^{*+}) - M(D^0))= -360 \pm 40 ^{+4}_{-0}$ keV and $\Gamma(T_{cc}^+)=48^{+2}_{-14}$ keV. Experimental discoveries of the transitions worked out here will go a long way in establishing the nature of these tetraquarks as (mainly) compact four-quark objects.</description>

      <title>Nonperturbative study of the electroweak phase transition in the real scalar singlet extended Standard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform a nonperturbative lattice study of the electroweak phase transition in the real singlet scalar extension of the Standard Model.We consider both the heavy and light singlet-like scalar regimes at non-zero singlet-doublet mixing angle. After reviewing features of the lattice method relevant for phase transition studies, we analyze the dependence of phase transition thermodynamics on phenomenologically relevant parameters. In the heavy singlet-like scalar regime, we find that the transition is crossover for small doublet-singlet mixing angles, despite the presence of an energy barrier in the tree-level potential. The transition becomes first order for sufficiently large mixing angles. We find two-loop perturbation theory to agree closely with the lattice results for all thermodynamical quantities considered here (critical temperature, order parameter discontinuity, latent heat) when the transition is strongly first order. For the light singlet-like scalar regime relevant to exotic Higgs decays, we update previous one-loop perturbative results using the two-loop loop dimensionally reduced effective field theory and assess the nature of the transition with lattice simulations at set of benchmark parameter points. For fixed singlet-like scalar mass the transition becomes crossover when the magnitude of the Higgs-singlet portal coupling is small. We perform our simulations in the high-temperature effective theory, which we briefly review, and present analytic expressions for the relevant lattice-continuum relations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nontopological fermionic solitons exist across a diverse range of particle physics models and have rich cosmological implications. This study establishes a general framework for calculating fermionic soliton profiles under arbitrary scalar potentials, utilizing relativistic mean field theory to accurately depict the interaction between the fermion condensate and the background scalar field. Within this framework, the conventional fermion bound states are revealed as a subset of fermionic solitons. In addition, we demonstrate how the analytical formulae in previous studies are derived as special cases of our algorithm, discussing the validity of such approximations. Furthermore, we explore the phenomenology of fermionic solitons, highlighting new formation mechanisms and evolution paths, and reconsidering the possibility of collapse into primordial black holes.</description>

      <title>Automatic generation of helicity amplitudes in Feynman-Diagram gauge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a method to calculate helicity amplitudes of an arbitrary tree-level process in Feynman-Diagram (FD) gauge for an arbitrary gauge model with MadGraph5_aMC@NLO. We start from the 't Hooft-Feynman gauge Lagrangian in FeynRules and generate scattering amplitudes by identifying the Goldstone boson as the $5^{\rm th}$ component of each weak boson. All the vertices of the 5-component weak bosons are then created automatically by assembling the relevant weak boson and Goldstone boson vertices in the Feynman gauge. The 5-component weak boson vertices are then connected by the $5\times5$ matrix propagator in the FD gauge. As a demonstration of the method we calculate the cross section for the process $\mu^-\mu^+\to\nu_\mu\bar{\nu}_\mu t\bar{t}H$ with complex top Yukawa coupling, which can be obtained by adding a gauge invariant dimension-6 operator to the Standard Model (SM) Lagrangian. The FD gauge and the unitary (U) gauge amplitudes give exactly the same cross section, and subtle gauge theory cancellation among diagrams in the U gauge at high energies is absent in the FD gauge, as has been observed for various SM processes. In addition, we find that the total cross sections at high energies are dominated by a single, or a set of non-vanishing Feynman amplitudes with the higher dimensional vertices in the FD gauge.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Comparisons of higher-order predictions within the Standard Model of Particle Physics (SM) to data are central to high-energy collider experiments like the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Processes with multiple kinematic scales, such as multi-jet and prompt photon production, provide a unique possibility for probing Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). These processes directly test perturbative QCD and can be used to extract fundamental parameters like the strong coupling constant and to search for BSM physics. Recent developments enabled lifting three-jet, photon plus two-jet, photon-pair plus jet, and three-photon cross-sections to QCD's next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO). This contribution presents phenomenological results at NNLO QCD for three-jet and photon plus two-jet production.</description>

      <title>New upper bound of muon neutrino mass in a short-baseline experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the paper Int.J.Mod.Phys.E 23 (2014) 1450004, the potential of short-baseline experiments was proposed to measure the mass (and parameters of Lorentz-violating effects) of the muon neutrino, where a roughly estimated upper bound of 420 eV was given as a possibility with large unknown uncertainties. In the present work, we improve upon this study by focusing on a feasible and improved experimental setup with today's technology, eliminating most large uncertainties, with the use of the Geant4 simulation toolkit. High-energy protons collide with a tungsten target, producing a variety of particles, most importantly pions that decay into muon neutrinos. The detector records the time of flight for both muon and anti-muon neutrinos, utilizing light as a reference signal. Additionally, it captures the energy deposited by neutrinos. By applying the dispersion relation, we determine the muon and/or anti-muon neutrino mass. Our improved results reveal a less optimistic but more accurate and realistic estimated upper bound of the muon neutrino mass, providing a new limit of about 150 keV. Notably, this finding is a factor of three lower than the best upper bound previously established in the literature originating from pion decay in flight.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10998v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: During the past few decades, abundant evidence for physics beyond the two standard models of particle physics and cosmology was found. Yet, we are tapping into the dark regarding our understanding of the dark sector. For more than a century, open problems related to the nature of the vacuum remain unresolved. Besides the traditional high-energy frontier and cosmology, technological advancement provides complementary access to new physics via high-precision experiments. Among the latter, the Casimir And Non-Newtonian force EXperiment (\cannex{}) has successfully completed its proof-of-principle phase and will soon commence operation. Benefiting from its plane parallel plate geometry, both interfacial and gravity-like forces are maximized, leading to increased sensitivity. A wide range of dark sector forces, Casimir forces in and out of thermal equilibrium, and gravity will be tested. This article describes the final experimental design, its sensitivity, and expected results.</description>

      <title>Simple fits for the neutrino luminosities from protoneutron star cooling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00769v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a simple fit function, $L_{\nu_i}(t) = C\, t^{-\alpha}\, e^{-(t/\tau)^{n}}$, to parametrize the luminosities of neutrinos and antineutrinos of all flavors during the protoneutron star (PNS) cooling phase at post-bounce times $t \gtrsim 1$ s. This fit is based on results from a set of neutrino-hydrodynamics simulations of core-collapse supernovae in spherical symmetry. The simulations were performed with an energy-dependent transport for six neutrino species and took into account the effects of convection and muons in the dense and hot PNS interior. We provide values of the fit parameters $C$, $\alpha$, $\tau$, and $n$ for different neutron star masses and equations of state as well as correlations between these fit parameters. Our functional description is useful for analytic supernova modeling, for characterizing the neutrino light curves in large underground neutrino detectors, and as a tool to extract information from measured signals on the mass and equation of state of the PNS and on secondary signal components on top of the PNS's neutrino emission.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00836v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) analysis from the first year of data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), when combined with data from the cosmic microwave background (CMB), has placed an upper-limit on the sum of neutrino masses, $\sum m_\nu &lt; 70$ meV (95%). In addition to excluding the minimum sum associated with the inverted hierarchy, the posterior is peaked at $\sum m_\nu = 0$ and is close to excluding even the minumum sum, 58 meV at 2$\sigma$. In this paper, we explore the implications of this data for cosmology and particle physics. The sum of neutrino mass is determined in cosmology from the suppression of clustering in the late universe. Allowing the clustering to be enhanced, we extended the DESI analysis to $\sum m_\nu &lt; 0$ and find $\sum m_\nu = - 160 \pm 90$ meV (68%), and that the suppression of power from the minimum sum of neutrino masses is excluded at 99% confidence. We show this preference for negative masses makes it challenging to explain the result by a shift of cosmic parameters, such as the optical depth or matter density. We then show how a result of $\sum m_\nu =0$ could arise from new physics in the neutrino sector, including decay, cooling, and/or time-dependent masses. These models are consistent with current observations but imply new physics that is accessible in a wide range of experiments. In addition, we discuss how an apparent signal with $\sum m_\nu &lt; 0$ can arise from new long range forces in the dark sector or from a primordial trispectrum that resembles the signal of CMB lensing.</description>

      <title>Echo-free quality factor of a multilayer axion haloscope</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report a methodology to determine the quality factor ($Q$) in implementations of the so-called dielectric haloscope, a new concept of wavy dark matter detector equipped with a multilayered resonator. An anechoic chamber enables the observation of the resonance frequency and its amplitude for an unlimited series of layers for the first time, which is conveniently filtered. The frequency-normalized power enhancement measured in a Dark-photons \&amp; Axion-Like particles Interferometer (DALI) prototype is a few hundred per layer over a sweep bandwidth of half a hundred MHz. In light of this result, this scaled-down prototype is sensitive to axions saturating the local dark matter density with a coupling to photons between $g_{a\gamma\gamma}\gtrsim10^{-12}$ GeV$^{-1}$ and $g_{a\gamma\gamma}\gtrsim$ few $\times 10^{-14}$ GeV$^{-1}$ at frequencies of several dozens of GHz once cooled down to the different working temperatures of the experiment and immersed in magnetic fields ranging from 1 T to 10 T; while the sensitivity of the full-scale DALI is projected at $g_{a\gamma\gamma}\gtrsim\mathrm{few}\times10^{-15}$ GeV$^{-1}$ over the entire 25--250 {\mu}eV range since $Q\gtrsim10^4$ is expected.</description>

      <title>Supersymmetric Expansion Algorithm and complete analytical solution for the Hulth\'en and anharmonic potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An algorithm for providing analytical solutions to Schr\"{o}dinger's equation with non-exactly solvable potentials is elaborated. It represents a symbiosis between the logarithmic expansion method and the techniques of the superymmetric quantum mechanics as extended toward non shape invariant potentials. The complete solution to a given Hamiltonian $H_{0}$ is obtained from the nodeless states of the Hamiltonian $H_{0}$ and of a set of supersymmetric partners $H_{1}, H_{2},..., H_{r}$. The nodeless states (dubbed "edge" states) are unique and in general can be ground or excited states. They are solved using the logarithmic expansion which yields an infinite systems of coupled first order hierarchical differential equations, converted later into algebraic equations with recurrence relations which can be solved order by order. We formulate the aforementioned scheme, termed to as "Supersymmetric Expansion Algorithm'' step by step and apply it to obtain for the first time the complete analytical solutions of the three dimensional Hulth\'en--, and the one-dimensional anharmonic oscillator potentials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spectral densities encode non-perturbative information that enters the calculation of a plethora of physical observables in strongly coupled field theories. Phenomenological applications encompass aspects of standard-model hadronic physics, observable at current colliders, as well as correlation functions characterizing new physics proposals, testable in future experiments. By making use of numerical data produced with lattice gauge theories, we perform a systematic study to demonstrate the effectiveness of recent technological progress in the reconstruction of spectral densities. To this purpose, we write and test new software packages that use energy-smeared spectral densities to analyze the mass spectrum of mesons. We assess the effectiveness of different smearing kernels and optimize the smearing parameters to the characteristics of available lattice ensembles. For concreteness, we analyze the Sp(4) lattice gauge theory with matter transforming in an admixture of fundamental and 2-index antisymmetric representations of the gauge group. We generate new ensembles for this theory, with lattices that have a longer extent in the time direction with respect to the spatial ones. We run our tests on these ensembles, obtaining new results about the spectrum of light mesons and their excitations. We make available our algorithm and software for the extraction of spectral densities, that can be applied to theories with other gauge groups, including the theory of strong interactions (QCD) governing hadronic physics in the standard model.</description>

      <title>Cutting corners: Hypersphere sampling as a new standard for cosmological emulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmological emulators of observables such as the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) spectra and matter power spectra commonly use training data sampled from a Latin hypercube. This method often incurs high computational costs by covering less relevant parts of the parameter space, especially in high dimensions where only a small fraction of the parameter space yields a significant likelihood.
  In this paper, we introduce hypersphere sampling, which instead concentrates sample points in regions with higher likelihoods, significantly enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of emulators. A novel algorithm for sampling within a high-dimensional hyperellipsoid aligned with axes of correlation in the cosmological parameters is presented. This method focuses the distribution of training data points on areas of the parameter space that are most relevant to the models being tested, thereby avoiding the computational redundancies common in Latin hypercube approaches.
  Comparative analysis using the \textsc{connect} emulation tool demonstrates that hypersphere sampling can achieve similar or improved emulation precision with more than an order of magnitude fewer data points and thus less computational effort than traditional methods. This was tested for both the $\Lambda$CDM model and a 5-parameter extension including Early Dark Energy, massive neutrinos, and additional ultra-relativistic degrees of freedom. Our results suggest that hypersphere sampling holds potential as a more efficient approach for cosmological emulation, particularly suitable for complex, high-dimensional models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we systematically investigate the inflationary complexity of the two-mode squeezed state with thermal effect for the single field inflation, modified dispersion relation, and non-trivial sound speed with the method of closed system and open system, respectively, which our analysis is valid for most inflationary models. First, the numeric of Krylov complexity in the method of the closed system indicates that the evolution of Krylov complexity highly depends on the squeezed angle parameter once taking the thermal effect into account, which will decay into some very tiny values, but the Krylov complexity will always enhance without thermal effect. For comparison, the numeric of circuit complexity shows that the evolution is always increasing no matter whether there are thermal effects or not which is independent of the evolution of squeezed angle parameter. By utilizing the method of open system, we first construct the wave function. As for the Krylov complexity with the method of open system, our investigations show the evolution of Krylov complexity will enhance upon some peaks factoring in the thermal effects. For completeness, we also calculate the Krylov entropy in the method of closed system and open system, which indicates that the hotter universe, the more chaotic the universe. Furthermore, our derivation for the Krylov complexity and Krylov entropy could nicely recover into the case of closed system under weak dissipative approximation, which confirms the validity of construction for the wave function. Finally, our numeric of Lanczos coefficient shows that the non-trivial sound speed has minimal chaos compared to the other two cases.</description>

      <title>The Effect of a Dark Matter Core on the Structure of a Rotating Neutron Star</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01487v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutron stars represent unique laboratories, offering insights into the physics of supranuclear-density matter and serving as potential hosts for dark matter. This study explores the impact of dark matter cores on rapidly rotating neutron stars through the two-fluid approximation, assuming minimal interaction between baryonic matter and dark matter. The investigation employs phenomenological models for fermionic and bosonic dark matter, revealing that universal relations governing mass and radius changes due to rotation remain largely unaffected in the presence of a dark matter core. Specifically, for a 5 % dark matter mass fraction, the percent deviations in total mass ($M_{tot}$), the baryonic equatorial radius ($R_{Be}$), and polar-to-equatorial baryonic radius ratio ($R_{ratioB}$) are within 3.9 %, 1.8 %, and 1.4 %, respectively. These findings suggest that the universal relations governing neutron star shape can be utilized to infer constraints on the properties of dark matter cores even in cases where the dark matter significantly softens the neutron star's equation of state.</description>

Abstract: We get the dual gravity metric of the rotating nuclear matter by performing a standard Lorentz transformation on the static metric in the D-instanton background. Then, we study the effects of the angular velocity, the instanton density and the temperature on the heavy quark potential. It is shown that the angular velocity and the temperature promote dissociation of the quark-antiquark pair, and the instanton density suppresses dissociation. Similarly, according to the result of the jet quenching parameter, we found that the jet quenching parameter increases with the increase of angular velocity, instanton density and temperature, and the jet quenching parameter in the rotating D-instanton background is larger than that of N = 4 SYM theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2204.09916v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new solution to the hierarchy (naturalness) problem, concerning quantum corrections of the Higgs mass. Assuming the Higgs boson as a system with a self-similar internal structure, we calculate its two-point function and find that the quadratic divergence is replaced by a logarithmic one in the mass corrections. It is shown that the partonic-like distribution follows the Tsallis statistics and also high energy physics experimental data for the Higgs transverse momentum distribution can be described by a self-similar statistical model.</description>

      <title>Searching for Afterglow: Light Dark Matter Boosted by Supernova Neutrinos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2206.06864v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A novel analysis is performed, incorporating time-of-flight (TOF) information to study the interactions of dark matter (DM) with standard model particles. After supernova (SN) explosions, DM with mass $m_\chi\lesssim\mathcal{O}({\rm MeV})$ in the halo can be boosted by SN neutrinos (SN$\nu$) to relativistic speed. The SN$\nu$ boosted DM (BDM) arrives on Earth with TOF which depends only on $m_\chi$ and is independent of the cross section. These BDMs can interact with detector targets in low-background experiments and manifest as afterglow events after the arrival of SN$\nu$. The characteristic TOF spectra of the BDM events can lead to large background suppression and unique determination of $m_\chi$. New cross section constraints on $\sqrt{\sigma_{\chi e} \sigma_{\chi\nu}}$ are derived from SN1987a in the Large Magellanic Cloud with data from the Kamiokande and Super-Kamiokande experiments. Potential sensitivities for the next galactic SN with Hyper-Kamiokande are projected. This analysis extends the existing bounds on $\sqrt{\sigma_{\chi e}\sigma_{\chi \nu}}$ over a broad range of $r_\chi=\sigma_{\chi \nu}/\sigma_{\chi e}$. In particular, the improvement is by 1-3 orders of magnitude for $m_\chi&lt;\mathcal{O}(100\,{\rm keV})$ for $\sigma_{\chi e}\sim\sigma_{\chi \nu}$. Prospects of exploiting TOF information in other astrophysical systems to probe exotic physics with other DM candidates are discussed.</description>

Abstract: We compute the complete set of two-loop master integrals for the scattering of four massless particles and a massive one. Our results are ready for phenomenological applications, removing a major obstacle to the computation of complete next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) QCD corrections to processes such as the production of a $H/Z/W$ boson in association with two jets at the LHC. Furthermore, they open the door to new investigations into the structure of quantum-field theories and provide precious analytic data for studying the mathematical properties of Feynman integrals.</description>

      <title>Foliation, topology and nucleon charge profiles in hypersphere soliton model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.15697v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the hypersphere soliton model (HSM), we study the geometrical inner structures and the ensuing charge distributions of the nucleons by exploiting the aspect of the HSM where the hypersphere soliton is described by an extended object possessing the parameter $\lambda$ $(0\le\lambda&lt;\infty)$ which corresponds to the radial distance from the center of $S^{3}$ to the foliation leaves of the hypersphere soliton. To do this, we investigate the foliation and topology related with geometry on a hypersphere described by $(\mu,\theta,\phi)$. Exploiting the so-called scanning algorithm we study geometrical relations between spherical shell foliation leave on a northern hemi-hypersphere $S^{3}_{+}$ and that on a flat equatorial solid sphere $E^{3}$ which contains the center of $S^{3}$. We then elucidate the physical meaning of $\mu$ in $S^{3}$ of radius $\lambda$ by showing that $\mu$ plays the role of an auxiliary angle to fix the radius $\lambda\sin\mu$ of the $S^{2}$ spherical shell sharing the center of $S^{3}(=S^{2}\times S^{1})$, at a given angle $\mu$. Next, using the charge density profiles of nucleons with $\mu$ dependence, we construct the nucleon fractional charges of spherically symmetric and nontrivial distributions. In the HSM we note that the proton and neutron charges do not leak out from the hypersphere soliton, and the positive and negative charges in the neutron are confined inside and outside its core, respectively. Explicitly we predict the fractional volumes and charges of the neutron. The proton and neutron are shown to be described by a topological structure of two Hopf-linked M\"obius strip type twist circles in $S^{3}$. We also note that the characteristic ratio of the hypersphere volume to the corresponding solid sphere one is given by a geometrical invariant related with hyper-compactness.</description>

      <title>Signatures of afterglows from light dark matter boosted by supernova neutrinos in current and future large underground detectors</title>

Abstract: Supernova neutrino boosted dark matter (SN$\nu$ BDM) and its afterglow effect have been shown to be a promising signature for beyond Standard Model (bSM) physics. The time-evolution feature of SN$\nu$ BDM allows for %the possibly direct inference of DM mass $m_\chi$, and results in significant background suppression with improving sensitivity. This paper extends the earlier study and provides a general framework for computing the SN$\nu$ BDM fluxes for a supernova that occurs at any location in our galaxy. A bSM $U(1)_{L_\mu-L_\tau}$ model with its gauge boson coupling to both DM and the second and third generation of leptons is considered, which allows for both DM-$\nu$ and DM-$e$ interactions. Detailed analysis of the temporal profile, angular distribution, and energy spectrum of the SN$\nu$ BDM are performed. Unique signatures in SN$\nu$ BDM allowing extraction of $m_\chi$ and detail features that contain information of the underlying interaction type are discussed. Expected sensitivities on the above new physics model from Super-Kamiokande, Hyper-Kamiokande, and DUNE detections of BDM events induced by the next galactic SN are derived and compared with the existing bounds.</description>

Abstract: Kaon physics is at a turning point -- while the rare-kaon experiments NA62 and KOTO are in full swing, the end of their lifetime is approaching and the future experimental landscape needs to be defined. With HIKE, KOTO-II and LHCb-Phase-II on the table and under scrutiny, it is a very good moment in time to take stock and contemplate about the opportunities these experiments and theoretical developments provide for particle physics in the coming decade and beyond. This paper provides a compact summary of talks and discussions from the Kaons@CERN 2023 workshop.</description>

Abstract: The strongly-coupled system like the quark-hadron transition (if it is of first order) is becoming an active play-yard for the physics of cosmological first-order phase transitions. However, the traditional field theoretic approach to strongly-coupled first-order phase transitions is of great challenge, driving recent efforts from holographic dual theories with explicit numerical simulations. These holographic numerical simulations have revealed an intriguing linear correlation between the phase pressure difference (pressure difference away from the wall) to the non-relativistic terminal velocity of an expanding planar wall, which has been reproduced analytically alongside both cylindrical and spherical walls from perfect-fluid hydrodynamics in our previous study but only for a bag equation of state. We have also found in our previous study a universal quadratic correlation between the wall pressure difference (pressure difference near the bubble wall) to the non-relativistic terminal wall velocity regardless of wall geometries. In this paper, we will generalize these analytic relations between the phase/wall pressure difference and terminal wall velocity into a more realistic equation of state beyond the simple bag model, providing the most general predictions so far for future tests from holographic numerical simulations of strongly-coupled first-order phase transitions</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.18794v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Axion-like particles are predicted in many physics scenarios beyond the Standard Model (SM). Their interactions with SM particles may arise from the triangle anomaly of the associated global symmetry, along with other SM global and gauge symmetries, including anomalies with the global baryon number and electromagnetic gauge symmetries. We initiate the phenomenological study of the corresponding ``electrobaryonic axion", a particle that couples with both the baryon chemical potential and the electromagnetic field. Neutron stars, particularly magnetars, possessing high baryon density and strong magnetic fields, can naturally develop a thin axion hair around their surface. In this study, we calculate this phenomenon, considering the effects of neutron star rotation and general relativity. For axion particles lighter than the neutron star rotation frequency, the anomalous interaction can also induce the emission of axion particles from the neutron star. This emission, in the light axion regime, can have a significant contribution to the neutron star cooling rate.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Metastable Cosmic String Breaking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.15662v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Metastable cosmic strings appear in models of new physics with a two-step symmetry breaking $G\to H\to 1$, where $\pi_1(H)\neq 0$ and $\pi_1(G)=0$. They decay via the monopole-antimonopole pair creation inside. Conventionally, the breaking rate has been estimated by an infinitely thin string approximation, which requires a large hierarchy between the symmetry breaking scales. In this paper, we reexamine it by taking into account the finite sizes of both the cosmic string and the monopole. We obtain a robust lower limit on the tunneling factor $e^{-S_B}$ even for regimes the conventional estimate is unreliable. In particular, it is relevant to the cosmic string interpretation of the gravitational wave signals recently reported by pulsar timing array experiments.</description>

Abstract: Thermal dark matter, which, after chemical decoupling from the Standard Model thermal plasma rises its yield before it freezes-out, is a new feature of thermal DM scenarios dubbed as "Bouncing Dark Matter". In the following short note, we introduce the topic, exemplifying the mechanism with a simple model that extends the SM with two dark matter particles, a fermion, and a pNGB, plus a second Higgs. We explore the features of the thermal freeze-out of this scenario, with particular emphasis on the exponential growth of the yield of the pNGB. We test the model under collider bounds, relic abundance, direct detection, and we study prospects for indirect detection observables.</description>

      <title>The role of electromagnetic interaction in the $X(3872)$ and its analogs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.05989v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the role of the electromagnetic interaction in the formation and decay of the $X(3872)$. The binding properties of the $X(3872)$ are studied by assuming the molecular nature and considering the $S$-$D$ wave mixing, isospin breaking, and coupled channel effects, and in particular the correction from the electromagnetic interaction. The radiative decays can better reflect the difference between the charged and neutral $D\bar D^*$ components, since the electromagnetic interaction explicitly breaks the isospin symmetry. We further study the radiative decay widths with the obtained wave functions for different $D\bar D^*$ channels. We also explore other similar hidden-charm molecular states. The electromagnetic interaction can make the molecule tighter. Our result of the radiative decay width for $X(3872)\rightarrow \gamma J/\psi$ is in agreement with the experiment. The branching ratio $R_{\gamma\psi}$ is less than 1 in our framework, which supports the Belle and BESIII measurements.</description>

Abstract: We systematically study the electromagnetic properties of controversial states whose internal structure is not elucidated and we try to offer a different point of view to unravel the internal structure of these states. Inspired by the $\Omega_c$ states observed by the LHCb Collaboration, we study the electromagnetic properties of the $\Omega_c$-like states as the compact diquark-diquark-antiquark pentaquarks with both $J^P = \frac{1}{2}^-$ and $J^P = \frac{3}{2}^-$ in the context of the QCD light-cone sum rule model. From the obtained numerical results, we conclude that the magnetic dipole moments of the $\Omega_c$-like states can reflect their inner structures, which can be used to distinguish their spin-parity quantum numbers. Measuring the magnetic moment of the $\Omega_c$-like states in future experimental facilities can be very helpful for understanding the internal organization and identifying the quantum numbers of these states.</description>

      <title>MeV gamma rays from Q-ball decay</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01675v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the supersymmetric Q balls which decay at present and find that they create a distinctive spectrum of gamma rays at around O(10) MeV. The charge of the Q ball is lepton numbers in order for the lifetime to be as long as the present age of the universe, and the main decay products are light leptons. However, as the charge of the Q ball decreases, the decay channel into pions becomes kinematically allowed towards the end of the decay, and the pions are produced at rest. Immediately, $\pi^0$ decays into two photons with the energy of 67.5 MeV, half the pion mass, which exhibits a unique emission line. In addition, $\pi^\pm$ decay into $\mu^\pm$, which further decay with emitting internal bremsstrahlung, whose spectrum has a sharp cutoff at $\sim$50 MeV. If the observations would find these peculiar features of the gamma-ray spectrum in the future, it could be a smoking gun of the supersymmetric Q-ball decay at present.</description>

      <title>Model-independent predictions for decays of hidden-heavy hadrons into pairs of heavy hadrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12868v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hidden-heavy hadrons can decay into pairs of heavy hadrons through transitions from confining Born-Oppenheimer potentials to hadron-pair potentials with the same Born-Oppenheimer quantum numbers. The transitions are also constrained by conservation of angular momentum and parity. From these constraints, we derive model-independent selection rules for decays of hidden-heavy hadrons into pairs of heavy hadrons. The coupling potentials are expressed as sums of products of Born-Oppenheimer transition amplitudes and angular-momentum coefficients. If there is a single dominant Born-Oppenheimer transition amplitude, it factors out of the coupling potentials between hidden-heavy hadrons in the same Born-Oppenheimer multiplet and pairs of heavy hadrons in specific heavy-quark-spin-symmetry doublets. If furthermore the kinetic energies of the heavy hadrons are much larger than their spin splittings, we obtain analytic expressions for the relative partial decay rates in terms of Wigner 6-j and 9-j symbols. We consider in detail the decays of quarkonia and quarkonium hybrids into the lightest heavy-meson pairs. For quarkonia, our model-independent selection rules and relative partial decay rates agree with previous results from quark-pair-creation models in simple cases and give stronger results in other cases. For quarkonium hybrids, we find disagreement even in simple cases.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the underlying structure of axial-vector bottom-charm tetraquarks in the light of their magnetic moments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16191v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The magnetic moment yields an excellent framework to explore the inner structure of particles determined by the quark-gluon dynamics of QCD, as it is the leading-order response of a bound system to a weak external magnetic field. Motivated by this, in this study, the magnetic moments of possible axial-vector $T_{bc\bar u \bar u}$, $T_{bc\bar d \bar d}$, and $T_{bc\bar u \bar d}$ tetraquarks are obtained with the help of light-cone QCD sum rules. For this purpose, we assume that these states are represented as a diquark-antidiquark picture with different structures and interpolating currents. The magnetic moment results derived using different diquark-antidiquark configurations differ substantially from each other. This can be translated into more than one tetraquark state with the same quantum number and quark content yet possessing different magnetic moments. From the numerical results obtained, we have concluded that the magnetic moments of the $T_{bc}$ states can project their inner structure, which can be used for their quantum numbers and quark-gluon organization. The contribution of individual quarks to the magnetic moments is also analyzed for completeness. We hope that our predictions of the magnetic moments of the $T_{bc}$ tetraquarks, together with the results of other theoretical investigations of the spectroscopic parameters and decay widths of these interesting tetraquarks, may be valuable in the search for these states in future experiments and in unraveling the internal structure of these tetraquarks.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16884v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate whether it is possible within the NMSSM to describe simultaneously a correct dark matter relic density complying with the latest null results from the LZ experiment, an extra Higgs boson with a mass of ~95 GeV visible in the bb channel at LEP and the diphoton channel at the LHC, and the deviation of the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon from its value within the Standard Model. We find that this is still possible for a variety of dark matter annihilation mechanisms, for singlino-like but also bino-like lightest supersymmetric particles. We show the signal rates of the extra Higgs boson and the dark matter detection rates as function of the dark matter mass and annihilation mechanism. The dark matter direct detection cross section may well fall below the neutrino floor. The masses of the lightest electroweakly interacting supersymmetric particles are typically not far above 100 GeV, but not excluded due to unconventional decays.</description>

      <title>Parameters of the tensor tetraquark $bb\overline{c}\overline{c}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04354v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The mass and width of the tensor tetraquark $T=bb\overline{c}\overline{c}$ with spin-parity $J^{\mathrm{P}}=2^{+}$ are calculated in the context of the QCD sum rule method. The tetraquark $T$ is modeled as a diquark-antidiquark state built of components $b^{T}C\gamma _{\mu }b$ and $\overline{c}\gamma _{\nu }C\overline{c}^{T}$ with $C$ being the charge conjugation matrix. The mass $m=(12795\pm 90)~\mathrm{MeV}$ of the exotic tensor meson $T$ is found by means of the two-point sum rule approach. Its full width $\Gamma$ is evaluated by considering processes $T \to B_{c}^{-}B_{c}^{-}$, $ B_{c}^{-}B_{c}^{\ast -}$, and $B_{c}^{\ast -}B_{c}^{\ast -}$. Partial widths of these decays are computed by means of the three-point sum rule approach which is used to determine the strong couplings at relevant tetraquark-meson-meson vertices. Predictions obtained for the width $ \Gamma=(55.5 \pm 8.7)~\mathrm{MeV}$, as well as the mass of the tetraquark $ T $ can be useful in investigations of fully heavy four-quark mesons.</description>

Abstract: A global interpretation of several significant indications of scalar resonances observed at LHC is achieved using the Georgi Machacek model. Among many other consequences, one predicts large cross sections for the processes ggFH(320)-&gt;h(125)h(125) and A(151)A(151) and ggF-&gt;A(420)-&gt;H(320)Z, where H(320) has been observed in A(420)-&gt;H(320)Z-&gt;bbbbl+l- and where A(151) is observed into two photons accompanied by a b jet, a lepton or missing transverse energy. We predict that ggF-&gt;H(320) has a cross section of about 2000 fb with a BR into h(125)(125) of 17% and into A(151)A(151) of 45%. Henceforth we predict that ggF-&gt;H(320)-&gt;hh will dominate over the SM process h*-&gt;hh, where h is the SM h(125) scalar. One expects that H(320)-&gt;A(151)A(151) can be observed into bbbb, becoming one of the most significant BSM phenomena identified so far. Arguments in favor of a SUSY version of GM are provided.</description>

      <title>Illuminating Black Hole Shadow with Dark Matter Annihilation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16673v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) has revolutionized our ability to study black holes by providing unprecedented spatial resolution and unveiling horizon-scale details. With advancements leading to the next-generation EHT, there is potential to probe even deeper into the black hole's dark region, especially the inner shadow characterized by low-intensity foreground emissions from the jet, thanks to a significant enhancement in dynamic range by two orders of magnitude. We demonstrate how such enhanced observations could transform supermassive black holes into powerful probes for detecting annihilating dark matter, which can form a dense profile in the vicinity of supermassive black holes, by examining the morphology of the black hole image.</description>

      <title>The effects of Lorentz violation on unitarity in $e^{+}e^{-} \rightarrow \mu^{+}\mu^{-}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18157v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigated two models incorporating LIV with nonminimal coupling in the ( e^+e^- \rightarrow \mu^+\mu^- ) scattering process, employing cross-section calculations. We found that utilizing the dual electromagnetic tensor led to violations of unitarity in both vector and axial scenarios. However, in the other model the preservation of unitarity by the electromagnetic tensor in both scenarios implies its potential superiority, this implies promising prospects for this CPT and Lorentz symmetry-breaking model.</description>

      <title>Scrutinizing the Primordial Black Holes Interpretation of PTA Gravitational Waves and JWST Early Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.01457v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent observations have granted to us two unique insights into the early universe: the presence of a low-frequency stochastic gravitational wave background detected by the NANOGrav and Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) experiments and the emergence of unusually massive galaxy candidates at high redshifts reported by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). In this letter, we consider the possibility that both observations have a common origin, namely primordial black holes (PBHs) in the mass range between $10^{6}~M_{\odot}$ and $10^{13}~M_{\odot}$. While superheavy PBHs act as seeds for accelerated galaxy formation capable of explaining the JWST extreme galaxies, they can also form binary mergers that source gravitational waves which can be potentially identified as the PTA signal. The analysis is performed taking into account the constraints on the relevant region of the PBH parameter space including the novel bound imposed by the Ultraviolet Luminosity Function of galaxies observed by the Hubble Space Telescope. We conclude that PTA's and JWST's interpretations in terms of PBH binary mergers and Poissonian gas of PBHs, respectively, are strongly excluded.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Measurement in the Mid-Band with Atom Interferometers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.07952v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational Waves (GWs) have been detected in the $\sim$100 Hz and nHz bands, but most of the gravitational spectrum remains unobserved. A variety of detector concepts have been proposed to expand the range of observable frequencies. In this work, we study the capability of GW detectors in the ``mid-band'', the $\sim$30 mHz -- 10 Hz range between LISA and LIGO, to measure the signals from and constrain the properties of ${\sim}$1 -- 100 $M_\odot$ compact binaries. We focus on atom-interferometer-based detectors. We describe a Fisher matrix code, AIMforGW, which we created to evaluate their capabilities, and present numerical results for two benchmarks: terrestrial km-scale detectors, and satellite-borne detectors in medium Earth orbit. Mid-band GW detectors are particularly well-suited to pinpointing the location of GW sources on the sky. We demonstrate that a satellite-borne detector could achieve sub-degree sky localization for any detectable source with chirp mass $\mathcal{M}_c \lesssim 50 M_\odot$. We also compare different detector configurations, including different locations of terrestrial detectors and various choices of the orbit of a satellite-borne detector. As we show, a network of only two terrestrial single-baseline detectors or one single-baseline satellite-borne detector would each provide close-to-uniform sky-coverage, with signal-to-noise ratios varying by less than a factor of two across the entire sky. We hope that this work contributes to the efforts of the GW community to assess the merits of different detector proposals.</description>

      <title>Hidden zeros for particle/string amplitudes and the unity of colored scalars, pions and gluons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16282v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent years have seen the emergence of a new understanding of scattering amplitudes in the simplest theory of colored scalar particles - the Tr$(\phi^3)$ theory - based on combinatorial and geometric ideas in the kinematic space of scattering data. In this paper we report a surprise: far from the toy model it appears to be, the ''stringy'' Tr$(\phi^3)$ amplitudes secretly contain the scattering amplitudes for pions, as well as non-supersymmetric gluons, in any number of dimensions. The amplitudes for the different theories are given by one and the same function, related by a simple shift of the kinematics. This discovery was spurred by another fundamental observation: the tree-level Tr$(\phi^3)$ field theory amplitudes have a hidden pattern of zeros when a special set of non-planar Mandelstam invariants is set to zero. Furthermore, near these zeros, the amplitudes simplify, by factoring into a non-trivial product of smaller amplitudes. Remarkably the amplitudes for pions and gluons are observed to also vanish in the same kinematical locus. These properties further generalize to the ''stringy'' Tr$(\phi^3)$ amplitudes. There is a unique shift of the kinematic data that preserves the zeros, and this shift is precisely the one that unifies colored scalars, pions, and gluons into a single object. We will focus in this paper on explaining the hidden zeros and factorization properties and the connection between all the colored theories, working for simplicity at tree-level. Subsequent works will describe this new formulation for the Non-linear Sigma Model and non-supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory, at all loop orders.</description>

      <title>Black holes surrounded by generic matter distributions: polar perturbations and energy flux</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00932v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a numerical approach to compute polar parity perturbations within fully relativistic models of black hole systems embedded in generic, spherically symmetric, anisotropic fluids. We apply this framework to study gravitational wave generation and propagation from extreme mass-ratio inspirals in the presence of several astrophysically relevant dark matter models, namely the Hernquist, Navarro-Frenk-White, and Einasto profiles. We also study dark matter spike profiles obtained from a fully relativistic calculation of the adiabatic growth of a BH within the Hernquist profile, and provide a closed-form analytic fit of these profiles. Our analysis completes prior numerical work in the axial sector, yielding a fully numerical pipeline to study black hole environmental effects. We study the dependence of the fluxes on the DM halo mass and compactness. We find that, unlike the axial case, polar fluxes are not adequately described by simple gravitational-redshift effects, thus offering an exciting avenue for the study of black hole environments with gravitational waves.</description>
