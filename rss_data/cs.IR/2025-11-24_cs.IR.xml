      <title>{\delta}-EMG: A Monotonic Graph Index for Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search in high-dimensional spaces is a foundational component of many modern retrieval and recommendation systems. Currently, almost all algorithms follow an $\epsilon$-Recall-Bounded principle when comparing performance: they require the ANN search results to achieve a recall of more than $1-\epsilon$ and then compare query-per-second (QPS) performance. However, this approach only accounts for the recall of true positive results and does not provide guarantees on the deviation of incorrect results. To address this limitation, we focus on an Error-Bounded ANN method, which ensures that the returned results are a $(1/\delta)$-approximation of the true values. Our approach adopts a graph-based framework. To enable Error-Bounded ANN search, we propose a $\delta$-EMG (Error-bounded Monotonic Graph), which, for the first time, provides a provable approximation for arbitrary queries. By enforcing a $\delta$-monotonic geometric constraint during graph construction, $\delta$-EMG ensures that any greedy search converges to a $(1/\delta)$-approximate neighbor without backtracking. Building on this foundation, we design an error-bounded top-$k$ ANN search algorithm that adaptively controls approximation accuracy during query time. To make the framework practical at scale, we introduce $\delta$-EMQG (Error-bounded Monotonic Quantized Graph), a localized and degree-balanced variant with near-linear construction complexity. We further integrate vector quantization to accelerate distance computation while preserving theoretical guarantees. Extensive experiments on the ANN-Benchmarks dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Under a recall requirement of 0.99, our algorithm achieves 19,000 QPS on the SIFT1M dataset, outperforming other methods by more than 40\%.</description>

      <title>RASTP: Representation-Aware Semantic Token Pruning for Generative Recommendation with Semantic Identifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative recommendation systems typically leverage Semantic Identifiers (SIDs), which represent each item as a sequence of tokens that encode semantic information. However, representing item ID with multiple SIDs significantly increases input sequence length, which is a major determinant of computational complexity and memory consumption. While existing efforts primarily focus on optimizing attention computation and KV cache, we propose RASTP (Representation-Aware Semantic Token Pruning), which directly prunes less informative tokens in the input sequence. Specifically, RASTP evaluates token importance by combining semantic saliency, measured via representation magnitude, and attention centrality, derived from cumulative attention weights. Since RASTP dynamically prunes low-information or irrelevant semantic tokens, experiments on three real-world Amazon datasets show that RASTP reduces training time by 26.7\%, while maintaining or slightly improving recommendation performance. The code has been open-sourced at https://github.com/Yuzt-zju/RASTP.</description>

      <title>CLLMRec: LLM-powered Cognitive-Aware Concept Recommendation via Semantic Alignment and Prerequisite Knowledge Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growth of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) presents significant challenges for personalized learning, where concept recommendation is crucial. Existing approaches typically rely on heterogeneous information networks or knowledge graphs to capture conceptual relationships, combined with knowledge tracing models to assess learners' cognitive states. However, these methods face significant limitations due to their dependence on high-quality structured knowledge graphs, which are often scarce in real-world educational scenarios. To address this fundamental challenge, this paper proposes CLLMRec, a novel framework that leverages Large Language Models through two synergistic technical pillars: Semantic Alignment and Prerequisite Knowledge Distillation. The Semantic Alignment component constructs a unified representation space by encoding unstructured textual descriptions of learners and concepts. The Prerequisite Knowledge Distillation paradigm employs a teacher-student architecture, where a large teacher LLM (implemented as the Prior Knowledge Aware Component) extracts conceptual prerequisite relationships from its internalized world knowledge and distills them into soft labels to train an efficient student ranker. Building upon these foundations, our framework incorporates a fine-ranking mechanism that explicitly models learners' real-time cognitive states through deep knowledge tracing, ensuring recommendations are both structurally sound and cognitively appropriate. Extensive experiments on two real-world MOOC datasets demonstrate that CLLMRec significantly outperforms existing baseline methods across multiple evaluation metrics, validating its effectiveness in generating truly cognitive-aware and personalized concept recommendations without relying on explicit structural priors.</description>

      <title>Parametric Retrieval-Augmented Generation using Latent Routing of LoRA Adapters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parametric Retrieval-Augmented Generation (PRAG) is a novel RAG paradigm that integrates external knowledge directly into a Large Language Model (LLM) by parameterizing documents using LoRA adapters, demonstrating reduced inference costs compared to traditional RAG approaches. However, current PRAG approaches adopt a \textbf{one-to-one} document encoding scheme, using a dedicated LoRA adapter for each individual document. This scheme introduces two major limitations: First, it leads to data scarcity, as the training datasets for individual LoRA adapters are limited. Second, it incurs high overhead during inference, requiring the merging of LLM weights with a new LoRA adapter for every candidate passage, which is computationally inefficient. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel paradigm for encoding passages in PRAG that utilizes a latent routing encoding process (Poly-PRAG). During offline encoding, we treat the encoding of a set of documents as a multi-task learning process, where each passage is assigned a unique task identifier. By employing a routing function, we use a small set of latent LoRA adapters to encode the entire passage space. During online inference, this routing function selectively activates a subset of latent experts based on the input query. We conduct comprehensive evaluations of Poly-PRAG across multiple knowledge-intensive NLP tasks. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, achieving state-of-the-art results on four distinct datasets.</description>

      <title>A Little More Like This: Text-to-Image Retrieval with Vision-Language Models Using Relevance Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) enable intuitive visual search using natural language queries. However, improving their performance often requires fine-tuning and scaling to larger model variants. In this work, we propose a mechanism inspired by traditional text-based search to improve retrieval performance at inference time: relevance feedback. While relevance feedback can serve as an alternative to fine-tuning, its model-agnostic design also enables use with fine-tuned VLMs. Specifically, we introduce and evaluate four feedback strategies for VLM-based retrieval. First, we revise classical pseudo-relevance feedback (PRF), which refines query embeddings based on top-ranked results. To address its limitations, we propose generative relevance feedback (GRF), which uses synthetic captions for query refinement. Furthermore, we introduce an attentive feedback summarizer (AFS), a custom transformer-based model that integrates multimodal fine-grained features from relevant items. Finally, we simulate explicit feedback using ground-truth captions as an upper-bound baseline. Experiments on Flickr30k and COCO with the VLM backbones show that GRF, AFS, and explicit feedback improve retrieval performance by 3-5% in MRR@5 for smaller VLMs, and 1-3% for larger ones, compared to retrieval with no feedback. Moreover, AFS, similarly to explicit feedback, mitigates query drift and is more robust than GRF in iterative, multi-turn retrieval settings. Our findings demonstrate that relevance feedback can consistently enhance retrieval across VLMs and open up opportunities for interactive and adaptive visual search.</description>

      <title>Breaking the Curse of Knowledge: Towards Effective Multimodal Recommendation using Knowledge Soft Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.07419v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A critical challenge in contemporary recommendation systems lies in effectively leveraging multimodal content to enhance recommendation personalization. Although various solutions have been proposed, most fail to account for discrepancies between knowledge extracted through isolated feature extraction and its application in recommendation tasks. Specifically, multimodal feature extraction does not incorporate task-specific prior knowledge, while downstream recommendation tasks typically use these features as auxiliary information. This misalignment often introduces biases in model fitting and degrades performance, a phenomenon we refer to as the curse of knowledge. To address this challenge, we propose a knowledge soft integration framework designed to balance the utilization of multimodal features with the biases they may introduce. The framework, named Knowledge Soft Integration (KSI), comprises two key components: the Structure Efficient Injection (SEI) module and the Semantic Soft Integration (SSI) module. The SEI module employs a Refined Graph Neural Network (RGNN) to model inter-modal correlations among items while introducing a regularization term to minimize redundancy in user and item representations. In parallel, the SSI module utilizes a self-supervised retrieval task to implicitly integrate multimodal semantic knowledge, thereby enhancing the semantic distinctiveness of item representations. We conduct comprehensive experiments on three benchmark datasets, demonstrating KSI's effectiveness. Furthermore, these results underscore the ability of the SEI and SSI modules to reduce representation redundancy and mitigate the curse of knowledge in multimodal recommendation systems.</description>

      <title>LLM-CoT Enhanced Graph Neural Recommendation with Harmonized Group Policy Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12396v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have advanced recommender systems by modeling interaction relationships. However, existing graph-based recommenders rely on sparse ID features and do not fully exploit textual information, resulting in low information density within representations. Furthermore, graph contrastive learning faces challenges. Random negative sampling can introduce false negative samples, while fixed temperature coefficients cannot adapt to the heterogeneity of different nodes. In addition, current efforts to enhance recommendations with large language models (LLMs) have not fully utilized their Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities to guide representation learning. To address these limitations, we introduces LGHRec (LLM-CoT Enhanced Graph Neural Recommendation with Harmonized Group Policy Optimization). This framework leverages the CoT reasoning ability of LLMs to generate semantic IDs, enriching reasoning processes and improving information density and semantic quality of representations. Moreover, we design a reinforcement learning algorithm, Harmonized Group Policy Optimization (HGPO), to optimize negative sampling strategies and temperature coefficients in contrastive learning. This approach enhances long-tail recommendation performance and ensures optimization consistency across different groups. Experimental results on three datasets demonstrate that LGHRec improves representation quality through semantic IDs generated by LLM's CoT reasoning and effectively boosts contrastive learning with HGPO. Our method outperforms several baseline models. The code is available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/LLM-Rec.</description>

      <title>GPR: Towards a Generative Pre-trained One-Model Paradigm for Large-Scale Advertising Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10138v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As an intelligent infrastructure connecting users with commercial content, advertising recommendation systems play a central role in information flow and value creation within the digital economy. However, existing multi-stage advertising recommendation systems suffer from objective misalignment and error propagation, making it difficult to achieve global optimality, while unified generative recommendation models still struggle to meet the demands of practical industrial applications. To address these issues, we propose GPR (Generative Pre-trained Recommender), the first one-model framework that redefines advertising recommendation as an end-to-end generative task, replacing the traditional cascading paradigm with a unified generative approach. To realize GPR, we introduce three key innovations spanning unified representation, network architecture, and training strategy. First, we design a unified input schema and tokenization method tailored to advertising scenarios, mapping both ads and organic content into a shared multi-level semantic ID space, thereby enhancing semantic alignment and modeling consistency across heterogeneous data. Second, we develop the Heterogeneous Hierarchical Decoder (HHD), a dual-decoder architecture that decouples user intent modeling from ad generation, achieving a balance between training efficiency and inference flexibility while maintaining strong modeling capacity. Finally, we propose a multi-stage joint training strategy that integrates Multi-Token Prediction (MTP), Value-Aware Fine-Tuning and the Hierarchy Enhanced Policy Optimization (HEPO) algorithm, forming a complete generative recommendation pipeline that unifies interest modeling, value alignment, and policy optimization. GPR has been fully deployed in the Tencent Weixin Channels advertising system, delivering significant improvements in key business metrics including GMV and CTCVR.</description>
