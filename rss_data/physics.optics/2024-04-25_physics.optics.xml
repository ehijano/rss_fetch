      <title>Can Large Language Models Learn the Physics of Metamaterials? An Empirical Study with ChatGPT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT, Gemini, LlaMa, and Claude are trained on massive quantities of text parsed from the internet and have shown a remarkable ability to respond to complex prompts in a manner often indistinguishable from humans. We present a LLM fine-tuned on up to 40,000 data that can predict electromagnetic spectra over a range of frequencies given a text prompt that only specifies the metasurface geometry. Results are compared to conventional machine learning approaches including feed-forward neural networks, random forest, linear regression, and K-nearest neighbor (KNN). Remarkably, the fine-tuned LLM (FT-LLM) achieves a lower error across all dataset sizes explored compared to all machine learning approaches including a deep neural network. We also demonstrate the LLM's ability to solve inverse problems by providing the geometry necessary to achieve a desired spectrum. LLMs possess some advantages over humans that may give them benefits for research, including the ability to process enormous amounts of data, find hidden patterns in data, and operate in higher-dimensional spaces. We propose that fine-tuning LLMs on large datasets specific to a field allows them to grasp the nuances of that domain, making them valuable tools for research and analysis.</description>

      <title>Environmental permittivity-asymmetric BIC metasurfaces with electrical reconfigurability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the rapidly evolving field of nanophotonics, achieving precise spectral and temporal light manipulation at the nanoscale remains a critical challenge. While photonic bound states in the continuum (BICs) have emerged as a powerful means of controlling light, their common reliance on geometrical symmetry breaking for obtaining tailored resonances makes them highly susceptible to fabrication imperfections and fundamentally limits their maximum resonance quality factor. Here, we introduce the concept of environmental symmetry breaking by embedding identical resonators into a surrounding medium with carefully placed regions of contrasting refractive indexes, activating permittivity-driven quasi-BIC resonances without any alterations of the underlying resonator geometry and unlocking an additional degree of freedom for light manipulation through actively tuning the surrounding refractive index contrast. We demonstrate this concept by integrating polyaniline (PANI), an electro-optically active polymer, to achieve electrically reconfigurable qBICs. This integration not only demonstrates rapid switching speeds, and exceptional durability but also significantly boosts the system's optical response to environmental perturbations. Our strategy significantly expands the capabilities of resonant light manipulation through permittivity modulation, opening avenues for on-chip optical devices, advanced sensing, and beyond.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the diffraction of a particular class of beams, composed only by a combination of azimuthally invariant guided modes of an optical fiber. We demonstrate that such beams can be obtained by injecting a Gaussian beam in a small piece of silica graded-index multimode fiber. This minimalistic low-cost method is applied for improving the axial resolution of a two-photon microscope.</description>

      <title>Neuromorphic Shack-Hartmann wave normal sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor is widely employed in adaptive optics systems to measure optical aberrations. However, simultaneously achieving high sensitivity and large dynamic range is still challenging, limiting the performance of diagnosing fast-changing turbulence. To overcome this limitation, we propose neuromorphic Shack-Hartmann wave normal sensing (NeuroSH). NeuroSH is a unifying framework that harnesses the computational neuromorphic imaging paradigm to extract the high-dimensional wave normal from temporal diversity measurements. Both numerical analysis and experimental verification demonstrate the feasibility of NeuroSH. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed NeuroSH is the first scheme to surpass the optical dynamic range limitation under challenging dynamic scenarios, thereby advancing ultra-fast turbulence mitigation technology for cutting-edge imagers.</description>

      <title>Super-resolution imaging based on active optical intensity interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long baseline diffraction-limited optical aperture synthesis technology by interferometry plays an important role in scientific study and practical application. In contrast to amplitude (phase) interferometry, intensity interferometry -- which exploits the quantum nature of light to measure the photon bunching effect in thermal light -- is robust against atmospheric turbulence and optical defects. However, a thermal light source typically has a significant divergence angle and a low average photon number per mode, forestalling the applicability over long ranges. Here, we propose and demonstrate active intensity interferometry for super-resolution imaging over the kilometer range. Our scheme exploits phase-independent multiple laser emitters to produce the thermal illumination and uses an elaborate computational algorithm to reconstruct the image. In outdoor environments, we image two-dimension millimeter-level targets over 1.36 kilometers at a resolution of 14 times the diffraction limit of a single telescope. High-resolution optical imaging and sensing are anticipated by applying long-baseline active intensity interferometry in general branches of physics and metrology.</description>

      <title>Supercontinua from integrated gallium nitride waveguides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supercontinua are broadband spectra that are essential to optical spectroscopy, sensing, imaging, and metrology. They are generated from ultrashort laser pulses through nonlinear frequency conversion in fibers, bulk media and chip-integrated waveguides. For any generating platform, balancing the oppositional criteria of strong nonlinearity, transparency, and absence of multiphoton absorption is a key challenge. Here, we explore supercontinuum generation in integrated gallium nitride (GaN) waveguides, which combine a high Kerr-nonlinearity, mid-infrared transparency and a large bandgap that prevents two- and three-photon absorption in the technologically important telecom C-band where compact erbium-based pump lasers exist. With such a laser, we demonstrate tunable dispersive waves and gap-free spectra extending to almost 4 micron in wavelength, relevant to functional group chemical sensing. In addition, also leveraging the material's second-order nonlinearity, we implement on-chip f-2f interferometry to detect the pump laser's carrier-envelope offset frequency, which enables precision metrology. These results demonstrate the versatility of GaN-on-sapphire as a new platform for broadband nonlinear photonics.</description>

      <title>Selective linewidth control in a micro-resonator with a resonant interferometric coupler</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical microresonators are characterized by a comb of resonances that preserve similar characteristics over a broad spectral interval. However, for many applications it is beneficial to selectively control of the quality factor (Q) of one or only some resonances. In this work we propose and experimentally validate the use of a resonant interferometric coupler to selectively change the Q-factor of a target resonance in an integrated silicon nitride microresonator. We show that its Q-factor can be continuously tuned from 65000 to 3 milions, leaving the untargeted resonances uperturbed. Our design can be scaled to independently control several resonances.</description>

      <title>Ultracompact, dynamically controllable circularly polarized laser enabled by chiral metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate a simple, low-cost and ultracompact chiral resonant metasurface design, which, by strong local coupling to a quantum gain medium (quantum emitters), allows to implement an ultra-thin metasurface laser, capable of generating tunable circularly polarized coherent lasing output. According to our detailed numerical investigations the lasing emission can be transformed from linear to circular and switch from right- to left-handed circularly polarized (CP) not only by changing the metasurface chiral response but also by changing the polarization of a linearly polarized pump wave, providing thus dynamic lasing-polarization control. Given the increasing interest for CP laser emission, our chiral metasurface laser design proves to be a versatile yet straightforward strategy to generate strong and tailored CP emission laser, promising great potential for future applications in both photonics and materials science.</description>

      <title>Hybrid plasmonic Bound State in the Continuum entering the zeptomolar biodetection range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical Bound States in the Continuum are peculiar localized states within the continuous spectrum that are unaffected by any far-field radiation and intrinsic absorption, therefore possessing infinite mode lifetime and Q-factor. To date they have been widely studied in dielectric structures whereas their exploitation in lossy media, i.e. plasmonic nanostructures, still remains a challenge. Here, we show the emergence of a hybrid BIC state in a 2D system of silver-filled dimers, quasi-embedded in a high-index dielectric waveguide. The hybrid BIC onset is found to be highly dependent on the bare modes' spectral and spatial overlap, but particularly on the plasmonic field's intensity. By tailoring the hybridizing plasmonic/photonic fractions we select an ideal coupling regime for which the mode exhibits both, high Q-factor values and strong near-field enhancement tightly confined in the nanogap and a consequently extremely small modal volume. We demonstrate that this optical layout can be exploited in a proof-of-concept experiment for the detection of TAR DNA-binding protein 43, which outperforms the sensitivity of current label-free biosensing platforms, reaching the zeptomolar range of concentration.</description>

      <title>Broad Angle Resolver for THz Band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Terahertz (THz) communication systems hold immense potential for high-speed data transfer across various domains yet face challenges due to directionality constraints because of free space path loss. To address this, directional beams are commonly employed in THz technology. With the usage directional beams, it is important to track the transmitting device to keep the link connectivity. Leaky Parallel Plate Waveguides (LPPWs) were introduced to tackle this challenge. But traditional LPPW uses unique angle-frequency relationship which requires broad range of frequencies. This study proposes a novel approach to mitigate these constraints, balancing directionality with reduced directional gain to enhance LPPW adaptability. The proposed device can accurately determine the receiving angle of a beam by analyzing unique features extracted from the dual peak outputs. Experimentation and simulations reveal that the device allows for a broader angle of acceptance and calculation of the received angle.</description>

      <title>High-Linearity PAM-4 Silicon Micro-ring Transmitter Architecture with Electronic-Photonic Hybrid DAC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a high linearity PAM-4 transmitter (TX) architecture, consisting of a three-segment micro-ring modulator (MRM) and a matched CMOS driver. This architecture can drive a high-linearity 4-level pulse amplitude (PAM-4) modulation signal, thereby extending the tunable operating wavelength range for achieving linear PAM-4 output. We use the three-segment MRM to increase design flexibility so that the linearity of PAM-4 output can be optimized with another degree of freedom. Each phase shift region is directly driven by the independently amplitude-tunable Non-Return-to-Zero (NRZ) signal. The three-segment modulator can achieve an adjustable wavelength range of approximately 0.037 nm within the high linearity PAM-4 output limit when the driving voltage varies from 1.5 V to 3 V, simultaneously achieving an adjustable insertion loss (IL) range of approximately 2 dB, roughly four times that of the two-segment MRM with a similar design. The driver circuit with adjustable driving voltage is co-designed to adjust the eye height to improve PAM-4 linearity. In this article, the high linearity PAM-4 silicon micro-ring architecture can be employed in optical transmitters to adjust PAM-4 eye-opening size and maximize the PAM-4 output linearity, thus offering the potential for high-performance and low-power overhead transmitters.</description>

      <title>Parametric decay instability of circularly polarized Alfv\'en wave in magnetically dominated plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15689v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate parametric decay instability (PDI) of circularly polarized Alfv\'en wave into daughter acoustic wave and backward Alfv\'en wave in magnetically-dominated plasma, in which the magnetization parameter $\sigma$ (energy density ratio of background magnetic field to matter) exceeds unity. We analyze relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), focusing on wave frequencies sufficiently lower than the plasma and cyclotron frequencies. We derive analytical formulae for the dispersion relation and growth rate of the instability as a function of the magnetization $\sigma$, wave amplitude $\eta$, and plasma temperature $\theta$. We find that PDI persists even in high magnetization $\sigma$, albeit with a decreased growth rate up to $\sigma\to\infty$. Our formulae are useful for estimating the decay of Alfv\'en wave into acoustic wave and heat in high magnetization $\sigma$ plasma, which is a ubiquitous phenomenon such as in pulsars, magnetars, and fast radio bursts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a scheme for quantum-light generation in a nonlinear cavity hybridized with a 2-level system. We theoretically show that, when excited by a series of controlled pump pulses, the hybrid source can generate various Fock states with high probabilities, such as near-on-demand generation of 1- and 2-photon states, and above 50% probability for generation of Fock states with up to 7 photons. More importantly, the tailorable nature of the nonlinear cavity and its pumping allows for generating Fock states with arbitrary frequencies, even with a fixed 2-level system, creating fundamentally new opportunities in all areas of quantum technologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A spin-photon interface based on the luminescence of a singly charged quantum dot in a micropillar cavity allows for the creation of photonic entangled states. Current devices suffer from cavity birefringence, which limits the generation of spin-photon entanglement. In this paper, we theoretically study the light absorption and emission by the interface with an anisotropic cavity and derive the maximal excitation and spin-photon entanglement conditions. We show that the concurrence of the spin-photon state equal to one and complete quantum dot population inversion can be reached for a micropillar cavity with any degree of birefringence by tuning the quantum dot resonance strictly between the cavity modes. This sweet spot is also valid for generating a multiphoton cluster state, as we demonstrate by calculating the three-tangle and fidelity with the maximally entangled state.</description>

      <title>Near-field radiative heat transfer between shifted graphene gratings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14357v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine the near-field radiative heat transfer between finite-thickness planar fused silica slabs covered with graphene gratings, through the utilization of the Fourier modal method augmented with local basis functions (FMM-LBF), with focus on the lateral shift effect. To do so, we propose and validate a minor modification of the FMM-LBF theory to account for the lateral shift. This approach goes far beyond the effective medium approximation because this latter cannot account for the lateral shift. We show that the heat flux can exhibit significant oscillations with the lateral shift and, at short separation, it can experience up to a 60%-70% reduction compared to the aligned case. Such a lateral shift effect is found to be sensitive to the geometric factor $d/D$ (separation distance to grating period ratio). When $d/D&gt;1$ (realized through large separation or small grating period), the two graphene gratings see each other as an effective whole rather than in detail, and thus the lateral shift effect on heat transfer becomes less important. Therefore, we can clearly distinguish two asymptotic regimes for radiative heat transfer: the LSE (Lateral Shift Effect) regime, where a significant lateral shift effect is observed, and the non-LSE regime, where this effect is negligible. Furthermore, regardless of the lateral shift, the radiative heat flux shows a non-monotonic dependence on the graphene chemical potential. That is, we can get an optimal radiative heat flux (peaking at about 0.3eV chemical potential) by $\textit{in situ}$ modulating the chemical potential. This work has the potential to unveil new avenues for harnessing the lateral shift effect on radiative heat transfer in graphene-based nanodevices.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we establish the theoretical framework for understanding the sensing capabilities of optical fibers. We show the distinct advantage of polarization over phase in detecting subhertz environmental processes. Subsequently, we propose a scheme capable of extracting the spectrum of perturbations affecting a specific section at any position along an optical fiber by detecting the state of polarization of the backreflected light. We discuss two examples of earthquake detection and the detection of sea swells and ocean tides through the analysis of the state of polarization of an optical signal reconstructed by the receiver of a transoceanic cable, obtained from an online database.\cite{zhongwenzhan_2020} Finally, we provide the analytical expression for the cross-correlation of the polarization perturbations of two wavelength division multiplexed channels, and show that the analysis of the polarization correlations between adjacent channels can provide valuable insights into the localization of earthquakes.</description>

Abstract: The Wigner distribution function and the its spatial-angular moments (intensity-moments) are known as efficient instruments for characterization of complex quasimonochromatic light beams and their transformations. In this paper, the generalization of the WF-based approach to spatio-temporal (ST) light fields (wave packets, short pulses) is considered. It is shown that the ST intensity moments are related with the important characteristics of the wave-packet structure, especially, with the transverse orbital angular momentum (OAM) being a specific feature of the ST optical vortices (STOV). The ST moments' transformations in a paraxial optical system obey simple and unified rules involving the ray-transfer ABCD-matrix of the system. On this base, and with simple examples of the OAM-carrying optical pulses, the schemes and mechanisms of the STOV generation and transformation are presented. Examples of non-vortex ST wave packets with the transverse OAM, their possible realizations are discussed as well as the relations between the OAM and the visible pulse rotations. The regular and unified formalism, developed in this paper, can be generalized and applied to more complex situations where the ST field propagates through inhomogeneous and random (scattering) media.</description>

      <title>Ultralow-loss integrated photonics enables bright, narrow-band, photon-pair sources</title>

Abstract: Photon-pair sources are critical building blocks for photonic quantum systems. Leveraging Kerr nonlinearity and cavity-enhanced spontaneous four-wave mixing, chip-scale photon-pair sources can be created using microresonators built on photonic integrated circuit. For practical applications, a high microresonator quality factor $Q$ is mandatory to magnify photon-pair sources' brightness and reduce their linewidth. The former is proportional to $Q^4$, while the latter is inversely proportional to $Q$. Here, we demonstrate an integrated, microresonator-based, narrow-band photon-pair source. The integrated microresonator, made of silicon nitride and fabricated using a standard CMOS foundry process, features ultralow loss down to $3$ dB/m and intrinsic $Q$ factor exceeding $10^7$. The photon-pair source has brightness of $1.17\times10^9$ Hz/mW$^2$/GHz and linewidth of $25.9$ MHz, both of which are record values for silicon-photonics-based quantum light source. It further enables a heralded single-photon source with heralded second-order correlation $g^{(2)}_\mathrm{h}(0)=0.0037(5)$, as well as a time-bin entanglement source with a raw visibility of $0.973(9)$. Our work evidences the global potential of ultralow-loss integrated photonics to create novel quantum light sources and circuits, catalyzing efficient, compact and robust interfaces to quantum communication and networks.</description>

      <title>Direct Zernike Coefficient Prediction from Point Spread Functions and Extended Images using Deep Learning</title>

Abstract: Optical imaging quality can be severely degraded by system and sample induced aberrations. Existing adaptive optics systems typically rely on iterative search algorithm to correct for aberrations and improve images. This study demonstrates the application of convolutional neural networks to characterise the optical aberration by directly predicting the Zernike coefficients from two to three phase-diverse optical images. We evaluated our network on 600,000 simulated Point Spread Function (PSF) datasets randomly generated within the range of -1 to 1 radians using the first 25 Zernike coefficients. The results show that using only three phase-diverse images captured above, below and at the focal plane with an amplitude of 1 achieves a low RMSE of 0.10 radians on the simulated PSF dataset. Furthermore, this approach directly predicts Zernike modes simulated extended 2D samples, while maintaining a comparable RMSE of 0.15 radians. We demonstrate that this approach is effective using only a single prediction step, or can be iterated a small number of times. This simple and straightforward technique provides rapid and accurate method for predicting the aberration correction using three or less phase-diverse images, paving the way for evaluation on real-world dataset.</description>

      <title>Nanoradian-Scale Precision in Light Rotation Measurement via Indefinite Quantum Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07125</link>

Abstract: The manipulation and metrology of light beams are pivotal for optical science and applications. In particular, achieving ultra-high precision in the measurement of light beam rotations has been a long-standing challenge. Instead of utilizing quantum probes like entangled photons, we address this challenge by incorporating a quantum strategy called "indefinite time direction" into the parameterizing process of quantum parameter estimation. Leveraging this quantum property of the parameterizing dynamics allows us to maximize the utilization of OAM resources for measuring ultra-small angular rotations of beam profile. Notably, a nanoradian-scale precision of light rotation measurement is finally achieved in the experiment, which is the highest precision by far to our best knowledge. Furthermore, this scheme holds promise in various optical applications due to the diverse range of manipulable resources offered by photons.</description>

      <title>Spin Wave Optics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13882v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Similarity between Walker and Helmholtz equations encouraged many to search for analogies between optical and spin wave phenomena. In the present article we demonstrate that one to one relationship can be established by formalizing the concept of magnetic refractive index and deriving on its basis Eikonal equations for magnetic media, formally proving that a very substantial portion of optical devices: lenses, mirrors, waveguides and so on, can be implemented as magnetic devices operating on spin waves instead of optical radiation. Controlling the refractive index is accomplished by changing the environmental variables such as magnetic bias field or temperature. Functionality of the above mentioned devices is confirmed with micromagnetic simulations, which also demonstrate a substantial agreement with the analytical model introduced in the present manuscript.</description>
