      <title>Regret Minimization in Population Network Games: Vanishing Heterogeneity and Convergence to Equilibria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding and predicting the behavior of large-scale multi-agents in games remains a fundamental challenge in multi-agent systems. This paper examines the role of heterogeneity in equilibrium formation by analyzing how smooth regret-matching drives a large number of heterogeneous agents with diverse initial policies toward unified behavior. By modeling the system state as a probability distribution of regrets and analyzing its evolution through the continuity equation, we uncover a key phenomenon in diverse multi-agent settings: the variance of the regret distribution diminishes over time, leading to the disappearance of heterogeneity and the emergence of consensus among agents. This universal result enables us to prove convergence to quantal response equilibria in both competitive and cooperative multi-agent settings. Our work advances the theoretical understanding of multi-agent learning and offers a novel perspective on equilibrium selection in diverse game-theoretic scenarios.</description>

      <title>TSO Games -- On the decidability of safety games under the total store order semantics (extended LMCS version with appendix)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.02862v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider an extension of the classical Total Store Order (TSO) semantics by expanding it to turn-based 2-player safety games. During her turn, a player can select any of the communicating processes and perform its next transition. We consider different formulations of the safety game problem depending on whether one player or both of them transfer messages from the process buffers to the shared memory. We give the complete decidability picture for all the possible alternatives.</description>

      <title>Learning in Conjectural Stackelberg Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13686v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend the formalism of Conjectural Variations games to Stackelberg games involving multiple leaders and a single follower. To solve these nonconvex games, a common assumption is that the leaders compute their strategies having perfect knowledge of the follower's best response. However, in practice, the leaders may have little to no knowledge about the other players' reactions. To deal with this lack of knowledge, we assume that each leader can form conjectures about the other players' best responses, and update its strategy relying on these conjectures. Our contributions are twofold: (i) On the theoretical side, we introduce the concept of Conjectural Stackelberg Equilibrium -- keeping our formalism conjecture agnostic -- with Stackelberg Equilibrium being a refinement of it. (ii) On the algorithmic side, we introduce a two-stage algorithm with guarantees of convergence, which allows the leaders to first learn conjectures on a training data set, and then update their strategies. Theoretical results are illustrated numerically.</description>

      <title>The Learning Approach to Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00227v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work introduces a unified framework for a more detailed exploration of games. In existing literature, strategies of players are typically assigned scalar values, and the concept of Nash equilibrium is used to identify compatible strategies. However, this approach lacks the internal structure of a player, thereby failing to accurately model observed behaviors.
  To address this limitation, we propose an abstract definition of a player. This allows for a more nuanced understanding of players and brings the focus to the challenge of learning that players face. Unlike Markov decision processes, which formalize control problems but not agent design, our framework subsumes standard reinforcement learning structures. It thus offers a language that enables a deeper connection between games and learning. To illustrate the need for such generality, we study a simple two-player game and show that even in the most basic settings, a sophisticated player may adopt dynamic strategies that cannot be captured by simpler designs or compatibility analysis alone.
  In the discrete setting, we consider a player whose structure incorporates standard estimates from the literature. We explore connections to correlated equilibrium and highlight that dynamic programming naturally applies to all estimates. In the mean-field setting, we exploit symmetry to construct explicit examples of equilibria. Finally, we examine connections to reinforcement learning and bandit problems, demonstrating the broad applicability of the framework.</description>

      <title>Recommendation and Temptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10595v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Traditional recommender systems based on revealed preferences often fail to capture the fundamental duality in user behavior, where consumption choices are driven by both inherent value (enrichment) and instant appeal (temptation). Consequently, these systems may generate recommendations that prioritize short-term engagement over long-lasting user satisfaction. We propose a novel recommender design that explicitly models the tension between enrichment and temptation. We introduce a behavioral model that accounts for how both enrichment and temptation influence user choices, while incorporating the reality of off-platform alternatives. Building on this model, we formulate a novel recommendation objective aligned with maximizing consumed enrichment and prove the optimality of a locally greedy recommendation strategy. Finally, we present an estimation framework that leverages the distinction between explicit user feedback and implicit choice data while making minimal assumptions about off-platform options. Through comprehensive evaluation using both synthetic simulations and real-world data from the MovieLens dataset, we demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms competitive baselines that ignore temptation dynamics either by assuming revealed preferences or recommending solely based on enrichment. Our work represents a paradigm shift toward more nuanced and user-centric recommender design, with significant implications for developing responsible AI systems that genuinely serve users' long-term interests rather than merely maximizing engagement.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous All-Pay Auctions with Budget Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03291v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The all-pay auction, a classic competitive model, is widely applied in scenarios such as political elections, sports competitions, and research and development, where all participants pay their bids regardless of winning or losing. However, in the traditional all-pay auction, players have no budget constraints, whereas in real-world scenarios, players typically face budget constraints. This paper studies the Nash equilibrium of two players with budget constraints across multiple heterogeneous items in a complete-information framework. The main contributions are as follows: (1) a comprehensive characterization of the Nash equilibrium in single-item auctions with asymmetric budgets and valuations; (2) the construction of a joint distribution Nash equilibrium for the two-item scenario; and (3) the construction of a joint distribution Nash equilibrium for the three-item scenario. Unlike the unconstrained all-pay auction, which always has a Nash equilibrium, a Nash equilibrium may not exist when players have budget constraints. Our findings highlight the intricate effects of budget constraints on bidding strategies, providing new perspectives and methodologies for theoretical analysis and practical applications of all-pay auctions.</description>
