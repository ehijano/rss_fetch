      <title>Structure theorems for Gorenstein ideals of codimension four with small number of generators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we study minimal free resolutions of Gorenstein ideals of codimension four, using methods coming from representation theory. We introduce families of higher structure maps associated with such resolution, defined similarly to the codimension three case. As our main application, we prove that every Gorenstein ideal of codimension four minimally generated by six elements is a hyperplane section of a Gorenstein ideal of codimension three, strengthening a result by Herzog-Miller and Vasconcelos-Villarreal. We state analogous conjectural results for ideals minimally generated by seven and eight elements.</description>

      <title>Valuation rings in simple algebraic extensions of valued fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider a simple algebraic valued field extension $(L/K,v)$ and denote by $\mathcal O_L$ and $\mathcal O_K$ the corresponding valuation rings. The main goal of this paper is to present, under certain assumptions, a description of $\mathcal O_L$ in terms of generators and relations over $\mathcal O_K$. The main tool used here are complete sequences of key polynomials. It is known that if the ramification index of $(L/K,v)$ is one, then every complete set gives rise to a set of generators of $\mathcal O_L$ over $\mathcal O_K$. We show that we can find a sequence of key polynomials for $(L/K,v)$ which satisfies good properties (called neat). Then we present explicit ``neat" relations that generate all the relations between the corresponding generators of $\mathcal O_L$ over $\mathcal O_K$.</description>

      <title>The Gr\"obnerWalk.jl package for OSCAR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computing Gr\"obner bases is known to have a very high upper bound on computation time with respect to input length. Due to the connection between polyhedral geometry and Gr\"obner bases through the Gr\"obner fan, one can attempt an incremental approach to compute Gr\"obner bases. First computing a Gr\"obner basis with respect to an `easy' term order and transforming that result to a Gr\"obner basis with respect to the desired term order by using information about this polyhedral fan is done by a family of algorithms termed as Gr\"obner walk. We implemented two variants of the Gr\"obner walk in the computer algebra system OSCAR and compared their performance with classical Gr\"obner basis methods already found in OSCAR.</description>

      <title>$h$-function, Hilbert-Kunz density function and Frobenius-Poincar\'e function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.10270v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given ideals $I,J$ of a noetherian local ring $(R, \mathfrak m)$ such that $I+J$ is $\mathfrak m$-primary and a finitely generated $R$-module $M$, we associate an invariant of $(M,R,I,J)$ called the $h$-function. Our results on $h$-functions allow extensions of the theories of Frobenius-Poincar\'e functions and Hilbert-Kunz density functions from the known graded case to the local case, answering a question of V.Trivedi. When $J$ is $\mathfrak m$-primary, we describe the support of the corresponding density function in terms of other invariants of $(R, I,J)$. We show that the support captures the $F$-threshold: $c^J(I)$, under mild assumptions, extending results of V. Trivedi and Watanabe. The $h$-function encodes Hilbert-Samuel, Hilbert-Kunz multiplicity and $F$-threshold of the ideal pair involved. Using this feature of $h$-functions, we provide an equivalent formulation of a conjecture of Huneke, Musta\c{t}\u{a}, Takagi, Watanabe; recover a result of Smirnov and Betancourt; give a new proof of a result answering Watanabe-Yoshida's question comparing Hilbert-Kunz and Hilbert-Samuel multiplicity and establish lower bounds on $F$-thresholds. We also point out that a conjecture of Smirnov-Betancourt as stated is false and suggest a correction which we relate to the conjecture of Huneke et al.
  We develop the theory of $h$-functions in a more general setting which yields a density function for $F$-signature. A key to many results on $h$-functions is a `convexity technique' that we introduce, which in particular proves differentiability of Hilbert-Kunz density functions almost everywhere on $(0,\infty)$, thus contributing to another question of Trivedi.</description>

      <title>Non-existence of Ulrich modules over Cohen-Macaulay local rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15566v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Over a Cohen-Macaulay local ring, the minimal number of generators of a maximal Cohen-Macaulay module is bounded above by its multiplicity. In 1984 Ulrich asked whether there always exist modules for which equality holds; such modules are known nowadays as Ulrich modules. We answer this question in the negative by constructing families of two dimensional Cohen-Macaulay local rings that have no Ulrich modules. Some of these examples are Gorenstein normal domains; others are even complete intersection domains, though not normal.</description>

      <title>Linear algebra over T-pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.05257v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper treats linear algebra over a (not necessarily distributive) semiring pair, with a range of applications to tropical algebra as well as related areas such as hyperrings and fuzzy rings. First we present pairs with their morphisms, called ``weak morphisms;'' we generalize earlier results about triples to pairs in the first three sections. We pay special attention to supertropical pairs, hyperpairs, and the doubling functor.
  Then we turn to matrices and the question of whether the row rank, column rank, and submatrix rank of a matrix are equal. The submatrix rank is less than or equal to the row rank and the column rank in many cases, including ``metatangible pairs'' with unique negation, but there is a counterexample to equality, discovered some time ago by the second author, which we provide in a more general setting (``pairs of the second kind'') that includes the hyperfield of signs. We do find situations when equality holds, encompassing results by Akian, Gaubert, Guterman, Izhakian, Knebusch, and Rowen, including versions of Cramer's rule. We pay special attention to the question of Baker and Zhang whether $n+1$ vectors of length $n$ need be dependent.
  At the conclusion of the main part, we consider surpassing relations, which permit us to tighten our results. The categorical setting is given in the appendix.</description>

      <title>The Hessian of elliptic curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17042v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that the Hessian transformation of elliptic curves, both as an action on $j$-invariants and on the Hesse pencil, is a Latt\`es map, namely it ascends to a degree-3 endomorphism $\psi$ of a prescribed elliptic curve $E$. This result provides a powerful tool to investigate the dynamics of the Hessian transformation, which inherits its symmetries from $\psi$. In particular, we show that, over arbitrary fields of characteristic different from 2 and 3, the Hessian functional graphs can be completely determined in terms of the action of $\psi$ on the twists of $E$. When the underlying field is finite, we specialize our results to provide a complete classification of Hessian functional graphs. In such a case, we also present a practical way to compute iterated Hessians.</description>
