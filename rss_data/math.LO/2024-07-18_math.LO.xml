      <title>A two-sorted theory of nilpotent Lie algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the existence of a model companion of the two-sorted theory of $c$-nilpotent Lie algebras over a field satisfying a given theory of fields. We describe a language in which it admits relative quantifier elimination up to the field sort. Using a new criterion which does not rely on a stationary independence relation, we prove that if the field is NSOP$_1$, then the model companion is NSOP$_4$. We also prove that if the field is algebraically closed, then the model companion is $c$-NIP.</description>

      <title>Application of Hohle's Square Roots on Hoop Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12460v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Square root is a useful tool to study the properties of (ordered) algebraic structures. In this article, we are going to employ this tool to study hoop algebras. To do so, we define square root and make the first attempt to explore the significance properties of this concept in this setting. Then, due to the key role of square roots in obtaining new hoop algebras, we apply them on the filters of hoop algebras, and show that the formation of square roots on quotient structures of hoop algebras by their filters is well-behaved. In addition, a new class of hoop algebras having square roots, so called good hoop algebras, is introduced and its relationships with other classes of ordered algebras such as Boolean algebras and Godel algebras are explored. Several examples are provided as well. Ultimately, it is shown that the class of all bounded hoop algebras with square roots is a variety.</description>

      <title>Around definable types in $p$-adically closed fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.05815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.05815v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove some technical results on definable types in $p$-adically closed fields, with consequences for definable groups and definable topological spaces. First, the code of a definable $n$-type (in the field sort) can be taken to be a real tuple (in the field sort) rather than an imaginary tuple (in the geometric sorts). Second, any definable type in the real or imaginary sorts is generated by a countable union of chains parameterized by the value group. Third, if $X$ is an interpretable set, then the space of global definable types on $X$ is strictly pro-interpretable, building off work of Cubides Kovacsics, Hils, and Ye. Fourth, global definable types can be lifted (in a non-canonical way) along interpretable surjections. Fifth, if $G$ is a definable group with definable f-generics ($dfg$), and $G$ acts on a definable set $X$, then the quotient space $X/G$ is definable, not just interpretable. This explains some phenomena observed by Pillay and Yao. Lastly, we show that interpretable topological spaces satisfy analogues of first-countability and curve selection. Using this, we show that all reasonable notions of definable compactness agree on interpretable topological spaces, and that definable compactness is definable in families.</description>

      <title>Generic differentiability and $P$-minimal groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17234v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove generic differentiability in $P$-minimal theories, strengthening an earlier result of Kuijpers and Leenknegt. Using this, we prove Onshuus and Pillay's $P$-minimal analogue of Pillay's conjectures on o-minimal groups. Specifically, let $G$ be an $n$-dimensional definable group in a highly saturated model $M$ of a $P$-minimal theory. Then there is an open definable subgroup $H \subseteq G$ such that $H$ is compactly dominated by $H/H^{00}$, and $H/H^{00}$ is a $p$-adic Lie group of the expected dimension. Additionally, the generic differentiability theorem immediately implies a classification of interpretable fields in $P$-minimal theories, by work of Halevi, Hasson, and Peterzil.</description>

      <title>Boundedly finite-to-one functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10183v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A function is boundedly finite-to-one if there is a natural number $k$ such that each point has at most $k$ inverse images. In this paper, we prove in $\mathsf{ZF}$ (without the axiom of choice) several results concerning this notion, among which are the following:
  (1) For each infinite set $A$ and natural number $n$, there is no boundedly finite-to-one function from $\mathcal{S}(A)$ to $\mathcal{S}_{\leq n}(A)$, where $\mathcal{S}(A)$ is the set of all permutations of $A$ and $\mathcal{S}_{\leq n}(A)$ is the set of all permutations of $A$ moving at most $n$ points.
  (2) For each infinite set $A$, there is no boundedly finite-to-one function from $\mathcal{B}(A)$ to $\mathrm{fin}(A)$, where $\mathcal{B}(A)$ is the set of all partitions of $A$ whose blocks are finite and $\mathrm{fin}(A)$ is the set of all finite subsets of $A$.</description>

      <title>Adding a constant and an axiom to a doctrine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.08324v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the meaning of "adding a constant to a language" for any doctrine, and "adding an axiom to a theory" for a primary doctrine, by showing how these are actually two instances of the same construction. We prove their universal properties, and how these constructions are compatible with additional structure on the doctrine. Existence of Kleisli object for comonads in the 2-category of indexed poset is proved in order to build these constructions.</description>
