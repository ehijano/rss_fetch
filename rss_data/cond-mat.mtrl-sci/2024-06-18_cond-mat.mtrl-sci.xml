      <title>Quantum Confined Luminescence in Two dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving localized light emission from monolayer two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) embedded in the matrix of another TMD has been theoretically proposed but not experimentally proven. In this study, we used cathodoluminescence performed in a scanning transmission electron microscope to unambiguously resolve localized light emission from 2D monolayer MoSe2 nanodots of varying sizes embedded in monolayer WSe2 matrix. We observed that the light emission strongly depends on the nanodot size wherein the emission is dominated by MoSe2 excitons in dots larger than 85 nm, and by MoSe2/WSe2 interface excitons below 50 nm. Interestingly, at extremely small dot sizes (&lt; 10 nm), the electron energy levels in the nanodot become quantized, as demonstrated by a striking blue-shift in interface exciton emission, thus inducing quantum confined luminescence. These results establish controllable light emission from spatially confined 2D nanodots, which holds potential to be generalized to other 2D systems towards future nanophotonic applications.</description>

      <title>Topological Hall effect in a non-magnetic metal interfaced to a canted antiferromagnetic insulator in perovskite oxide heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report interfacial transport properties in in-situ grown orthorhombic perovskite oxide heterostructures consisting of an antiferromagnetic insulator DyFeO$_3$ and a paramagnetic conductor CaRuO$_3$. We observe Hall effect with a step-like increase amounting to an effective magnetic field of 30 T at 20 K. We provide a plausible explanation in the context of topological Hall effect originating from a non-coplanar spin texture and resultant emergent field in DyFeO$_3$ associated with the scalar spin chirality. Our results demonstrate that the proximity effect of the emergent field at heterointerfaces is a universal physical phenomenon, while it has been reported originally in a heterointerface composed of pyrochlore oxides. This will greatly expand the choice of materials to the heterointerfaces for the research in emergent transport phenomena, which has been limited to single compounds with both metallic properties and special spin textures. Additionally, this will pave the way for possible device application of the emergent field by designing and combining perovskite oxides with versatile functionalities such as multiferroicity.</description>

      <title>A neural-network-backed effective harmonic potential study of the ambient pressure phases of hafnia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phonon-based approaches and molecular dynamics are widely established methods for gaining access to a temperature-dependent description of material properties. However, when a compound's phase space is vast, density-functional-theory-backed studies quickly reach prohibitive levels of computational expense. Here, we explore the complex phase structure of HfO2 using effective harmonic potentials based on a neural-network force field (NNFF) as a surrogate model. We detail the data acquisition and training strategy that enable the NNFF to provide almost ab-initio accuracy at a significantly reduced cost and present a recipe for automation. We demonstrate how the NNFF can generalize beyond its training data and that it is transferable between several phases of hafnia. We find that the thermal expansion of the low-symmetry phases agrees well with experimental results and we determine the P-43m phase to be the favorable (stoichiometric) cubic phase over the established Fm-3m. In contrast, the experimental lattice constants of the cubic phases are substantially larger than what is calculated for the corresponding stoichiometric phases. Furthermore, we show that the stoichiometric cubic phases are unlikely to be thermodynamically stable compared to the tetragonal and monoclinic phases, and hypothesize that they only exist in defect-stabilized forms.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Magnetic Behavior of Ferrites: From Diamagnetism to Superparamagnetism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ferrites, magnetic materials primarily composed of iron oxides, exhibit diverse magnetic behaviors, including diamagnetism, paramagnetism, ferromagnetism, antiferromagnetism, ferrimagnetism, and superparamagnetism. This paper explores the fundamental principles governing these magnetic phenomena, with a focus on the relationship between magnetic field strength ($H$), magnetic induction ($B$), and magnetic susceptibility ($\chi$). The study delves into the structural and electronic origins of magnetism in ferrites, highlighting the contributions of electron spin and orbital motions. The technological significance of ferrites, particularly in high-frequency applications, is examined through their classification based on crystal structures, including spinel, garnet, hexagonal, and orthoferrites. Special attention is given to the manufacturing processes and applications of ferrites in modern technology, such as their use in magnetic cores, sensors, and memory devices. The paper concludes with a discussion on the future directions in ferrite research and potential innovations in their applications.</description>

      <title>Optical Cooling of Dot-in-crystal Halide Perovskites: Challenges of Nonlinear Exciton Recombination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Highly efficient anti-Stokes (AS) photoluminescence (PL) is observed from halide perovskite quantum dots (QDs) due to their strong electron-phonon interactions. The AS PL is particularly intriguing as it suggests the potential for semiconductor optical cooling if the external quantum efficiency approaches 100%. However, the PL quantum efficiency in QDs is primarily dominated by multiparticle nonradiative Auger recombination processes under intense photoexcitation, which impose limits on the optical cooling gain. Here, we investigate the Auger recombination of dot-in-crystal perovskites. We quantitatively estimate the maximum optical cooling gain and the corresponding excitation intensity. We further conducted optical cooling experiments and demonstrate a maximum photo-cooling of approximately 9 K from room temperature. Additionally, we confirmed that increasing the excitation intensity leads to a transition from photo-cooling to photo-heating. These observations are consistent with our time-resolved measurements, offering insights into the potential and limitations of optical cooling in semiconductor QDs.</description>

      <title>Optical lineshapes for orbital singlet to doublet transitions in a dynamical Jahn-Teller system: the NiV$^{-}$ center in diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply density functional theory to investigate interactions between electronic and vibrational states in crystal defects with multi-mode dynamical Jahn-Teller (JT) systems. Our focus is on transitions between orbital singlet and degenerate orbital doublet characterized by $E \otimes (e \oplus e \oplus \cdots)$ JT coupling, which frequently occurs in crystal defects that are investigated for applications in quantum information science. We utilize a recently developed methodology to model the photoluminescence (PL) spectrum of the negatively charged split nickel-vacancy center (NiV$^{-}$) in diamond, where JT-active modes significantly influence electron-phonon interactions. Our results validate the effectiveness of the methodology in accurately reproducing the observed 1.4 eV PL lineshape. The strong agreement between our theoretical predictions and experimental observations reinforces the identification of the 1.4 eV PL center with the NiV$^{-}$ complex. This study highlights the critical role of JT-active modes in affecting optical lineshapes and demonstrates the power of advanced techniques for modeling optical properties in complex systems with multiple JT-active frequencies.</description>

      <title>Diffusion in a two Phases System: Application to Ion Exchange in Silicate Glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion in a two-phase system is a classical problem discussed in the literature. The general solution of the one-dimensional case to this problem is revisited and a detailed derivation is proposed. The solution is discussed in relationship with ion exchange in silicate glasses. The general solution is compared with the complementary error function solution and they have identified the assumptions under which the general solution reduces to the erfc one. Interface or glass surface issues related to ion exchange are discussed in terms of the ratio between the diffusion coefficients of the diffusing alkali ions in the glass and the ion reservoir phases respectively. Another relevant issue can be identified in the assumption of instantaneous equilibrium at the two-phase interface once the contact is established. Even though this last assumption is somehow unphysical it is the common approach used in the technological application of ion exchange in silicate glass which is justified when the contact time that is immersion time of glass with an ion reservoir is much larger than the time to achieve thermodynamic equilibrium at the surface.</description>

      <title>Unrevealing the structure and properties of {$\alpha$}-sheet-based bilayer borophenes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent experimental realizations of bilayer boron materials motivated us to study the structure and properties of $\alpha$-sheet-based bilayer borophenes with interlayer covalent bonds. As shown here, at least three stacking variations are possible: AA, AB, and AB$'$. The on-top AA-stacking has been obtained experimentally. The AB-stacking is the most stable among neutral freestanding structures, whereas the AA and AB$'$ stacking sequences are very close in energy, both for neutral and negatively charged cases. The studied bilayer borophenes exhibit extraordinarily high electric conductivity with values as high as ${\sim} 10^7\mathrm{~S}/\mathrm{m}$ for the experimentally observed AA-stacking. The highly stable AB-stacking bilayer, reported here for the first time, exhibits an anisotropic conductivity with an average value of $6.0 \times 10^6~\mathrm{S/m}$.</description>

      <title>Data-driven study of the enthalpy of mixing in the liquid phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The enthalpy of mixing in the liquid phase is a thermodynamic property reflecting interactions between elements that is key to predict phase transformations. Widely used models exist to predict it, but they have never been systematically evaluated. To address this, we collect a large amount of enthalpy of mixing data in binary liquids from a review of about 1000 thermodynamic evaluations. This allows us to clarify the prediction accuracy of Miedema's model which is state-of-the-art. We show that more accurate predictions can be obtained from a machine learning model based on LightGBM, and we provide them in 2415 binary systems. The data we collect also allows us to evaluate another empirical model to predict the excess heat capacity that we apply to 2211 binary liquids. We then extend the data collection to ternary metallic liquids and find that, when mixing is exothermic, extrapolations from the binary systems by Muggianu's model systematically lead to slight overestimations of roughly 10% close to the equimolar composition. Therefore, our LightGBM model can provide reasonable estimates for ternary alloys and, by extension, for multicomponent alloys. Our findings extracted from rich datasets can be used to feed thermodynamic, empirical and machine learning models for material development.</description>

      <title>Atomistic theory of twist-angle dependent intralayer and interlayer exciton properties in twisted bilayer materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Twisted bilayers of two-dimensional (2D) materials have emerged as a highly tunable platform to study and engineer properties of excitons. However, the atomistic description of these properties has remained a significant challenge as a consequence of the large unit cells of the emergent moir\'e superlattices. To address this problem, we introduce an efficient approach to solve the Bethe-Salpeter equation that exploits the localization of atomic Wannier functions. We then use this approach to study intra- and interlayer excitons in twisted WS$_{2}$/WSe$_{2}$ at a range of twist angles. In agreement with experiment, we find that the optical spectrum exhibits three low-energy peaks for twist angles small than $2^\circ$. The energy splitting between the peaks is described accurately. We also find two low-energy interlayer excitons with weak oscillator strengths. Our approach opens up new opportunities for the design of light-matter interactions in ultrathin materials.</description>

      <title>Gateway to all-optical spin switching in Heusler ferrimagnets: Pancharatnam-Berry tensor and magnetic moment ratio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: All-optical spin switching (AOS) is a new phenomenon found in a small group of magnetic media, where a single laser pulse can switch spins from one direction to another, without assistance of a magnetic field, on a time scale much shorter than existing magnetic technology. However, despite intensive efforts over a decade, its underlying working principle remains elusive. Here through manganese-based Heusler ferrimagnets, we show that a group of flat bands around the Fermi level act as gateway states to form efficient channels or spin switching, where their noncentrosymmetry allows us to correlate the spin dynamics to the second-order optical response. To quantify their efficacy, we introduce the third-rank Pancharatnam-Berry tensor (PB tensor), $\boldsymbol{\eta}^{(3)}=\langle i |{\bf p} |m\rangle \langle m|{\bf p} |f\rangle \langle f|{\bf p} |i\rangle,$ where $|i\rangle$, $|m\rangle$ and $|f\rangle$ are initial, intermediate and final band states, respectively, and ${\bf p}$ is the momentum operator. A picture emerges: Those which show AOS, such as the recently discovered Mn$_2$RuGa, always have a large PB tensor element} but have a small sublattice spin moment ratio, consistent with the prior experimental small remanence criterion. This does not only reveal that the delicate balance between the large PB tensor element and the small sublattice spin ratio plays a decisive role in AOS, but also, conceptually, connects the $n$th-order nonlinear optics to $(n+1)$th-rank PB tensors in general.</description>

      <title>Doping-tunable Fermi surface with persistent topological Hall effect in axion candidate EuIn$_2$As$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rare-earth Zintl compound EuIn$_2$As$_2$ has been theoretically recognized as a candidate for realizing an intrinsic antiferromagnetic (AFM) bulk axion insulator and a higher-order topological state, which provides a fertile platform to explore novel topological transport phenomena. However, the axion state has yet to be realized because EuIn$_2$As$_2$ is highly hole-doped. Here, we synthesized a series of high-quality Ca-doped EuIn2As2 (Ca$_x$Eu$_{1-x}$In$_2$As$_2$, x = 0 ~ 0.25) single crystals to tune the Fermi energy above the hole pocket. Our Hall measurements reveal that the isovalent Ca substitution decreases the hole carrier density by shrinking the lattice spacing, which is also confirmed by our first-principles calculations. We further find that both the temperature dependence of the magnetic susceptibility with a local maximum at the N\'eel temperature and the topological Hall effect originating from the finite real-space spin chirality persist in the Ca-doped samples as observed in the pristine EuIn$_2$As$_2$, despite that the nonmagnetic Ca substitution decreases the effective moment and the N\'eel temperature. These results show that the Ca substitution tunes the Fermi energy while keeping the AFM magnetic structure, suggesting that the axion insulating state may be realized by further Ca substitution.</description>

      <title>Negative thermal expansion in transition-metal dicyanides: the hidden role of the underlying diamondoid framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transition-metal dicyanides M(CN)$_2$ (M = Zn, Cd) are amongst the most important negative thermal expansion (NTE) materials known, favoured for the magnitude, isotropy, and thermal persistence of the NTE behaviour they show. The conventional picture of the NTE mechanism in this family is one of correlated rotations and translations of M(C/N)$_4$ polyhedra acting to draw the diamondoid network of M--CN--M linkages in on itself. An implication of this mechanism is increased transverse vibrational motion of C and N atoms relative to the isotropic displacements of M atoms, which act as anchors. Here, we use a combination of neutron total scattering measurements and \emph{ab initio} calculations to reassess the vibrational behaviour of the M(CN)$_2$ family. We find that M, C, and N atoms all exhibit similar degrees of local thermal motion, such that the cyanide linkages behave as pseudo-springs connecting M$\ldots$M pairs. This interpretation leads us to uncover a `hidden' dispersion in the M(CN)$_2$ phonon dispersions, closely related to that of diamond and silicon themselves. By virtue of this mapping, a simple geometric model based on the competing energy scales of network stretching and flexing -- long applied to interpret NTE modes in C and Si -- turns out to capture the key NTE physics of M(CN)$_2$, especially at low temperatures. Our study highlights the potential insight gained by coarse-graining the complex lattice dynamics of framework materials in terms of what we call `framework modes' -- the correlated distortions of the underlying network structure itself.</description>

      <title>Enabling Ab-Initio Molecular Dynamics under Bias: The CP2K+SMEAGOL Interface for Integrating Density Functional Theory and Non-Equilibrium Green Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Density functional theory (DFT) combined with non-equilibrium Greens functions (NEGF) is a powerful approach to model quantum transport under external bias potentials, at reasonable computational cost. In this work we present a new interface between the popular mixed Gaussian/plane wave electronic structure package CP2K and the NEGF code SMEAGOL, the most feature-rich implementation of DFT-NEGF available for CP2K to-date. The CP2K+SMEAGOL interface includes the implementation of current induced forces. We verify this implementation for a variety of systems: an infinite 1D Au wire, a parallel-plate capacitor and a Au-H2-Au junction. We find good agreement with SMEAGOL calculations performed with SIESTA for the same systems, and with the example of a solvated Au wire demonstrate for the first time that DFT-NEGF can be used to perform molecular dynamics simulations under bias of large-scale condensed phase systems under realistic operating conditions.</description>

      <title>Femtosecond laser upscaling strategy and biological validation for dental screws with improved osteogenic performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Osseointegration is one of the key conditions for long term successful dental implantation. To this end, titanium alloys undergo plethora of surface treatments able to sustain osteogenic differentiation. For these surface treatments, femtosecond laser (FSL) can generate precise and reproducible surface patterns on titanium, avoiding thermal damage and chemical pollution. We recently identify that laser-induced periodic surface structure (LIPSS) with radial orientation, generated on model (flat) titanium surface, has a high osteogenic potential. However, nano-texturing is time consuming. In the present study, we aimed to reduce the texturing time of radial LIPSS, as well as processing of large commercially available dental screws by ways of laser beam engineering. Our objectives were to maintain at least osteogenic properties demonstrated on model surfaces by adjusting laser beam diameters and to demonstrate maintenance of performance with a dental screw texturing process not exceeding 1 minute.We first textured model surfaces with radial LIPSS by laser beams of different diameters, with surface impacts of 24$\mu$m, 80$\mu$m or 180$\mu$m, named as R24, R80 or R180 respectively. Osteogenic performance of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) were compared; seeded on polished control surfaces and textured surfaces and subjected to osteogenic evaluation by cell/matrix imaging, qRT-PCR and mineral deposition quantification. All textured surfaces showed greater osteogenic potential than the control surfaces, with significantly higher efficacy on R180 surface. Therefore, R180 pattern with large beam impacts was chosen for texturing on a dental screw and its osteogenic activity was compared to that of a non-textured screw. Interestingly, R180 required only 40 seconds to be textured on whole screws, on which it preserved a high osteogenic potential. Thus, by using FSL technology, we have improved the osteogenic potential of a topographic pattern while optimizing and scaling up its processing time on a medical device.</description>

      <title>Size effect on the structural and magnetic phase transformations of iron nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Iron nanoparticles are among the most promising low-dimensional materials in terms of applications. This particularity is attributable to the magnetic properties of these nanoparticles, which exhibit different allotropes as a function of temperature. In this work, we sought to characterise at the atomic scale how their structural and magnetic transformations can be affected by the size. To achieve this objective, we developed a tight-binding model incorporating a magnetic contribution via a Stoner term implemented in a Monte Carlo code to relax the structure and the magnetic state. Using our approach, we show that magnetism is strongly reinforced by the surface, which leads to increase the Curie temperature as the size of the particle decreases contrary to the solid-solid transition temperature. Our work thus provides a deep understanding at the atomic scale of the key factors that determines the structural and magnetic properties of Fe nanoparticles, shedding more light on their unique character which is crucial for further applications.</description>

      <title>Dissecting van der Waals interactions with Density Functional Theory -- Wannier-basis approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new scheme for the computation of dispersive interactions from first principles is presented. This cost-effective approach relies on a Wannier function representation compatible with density function theory descriptions. This is an electronic-based many-body method that captures the full electronic and optical response properties of the materials. It provides the foundation to discern van der Waals and induction energies as well as the role of anisotropy and different stacking patterns when computing dispersive interactions in systems. Calculated results for binding energies in layered materials, such as graphite, hBN, and MoS$_2$ give encouraging comparisons with available experimental data. Strategies for broadened computational descriptions of dispersive interactions are also discussed. Our investigation aims at stimulating new experimental studies to measure van der Waals energies in a wider range of materials, especially in layered systems.</description>

      <title>Mapping Interfacial Energetic Landscape in Organic Solar Cells Reveals Pathways to Reducing Nonradiative Losses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells have made remarkable inroads towards 20% efficiency, yet nonradiative recombination losses ({\Delta}Vnr) remain high compared to silicon and perovskite photovoltaics. Interfaces buried within BHJ blends hold the key to recombination losses but access to their energetic landscape underpinning charge transfer (CT) states and their disorder remain elusive. Here, we reveal the energetic landscape and CT state manifold of modern BHJs with both spatial and energetic resolutions and link the offset between singlet (ES1) and CT energy (ES1-CT) and interfacial energetic disorder with {\Delta}Vnr. We do so by locally mapping the energy distributions of modern PM6-based BHJs with IT4F, Y6 and PC71BM acceptors and combine it, for the first time, with sensitive EQE measurements, to visualize and quantify donor (D) and acceptor (A) energetics at interfaces and associated them with CT states within a modified Marcus framework. A key new ability is the identification of the specific BHJ interfaces associated with the CT manifold, including where the lowest energy CT states reside. Moreover, we quantify energy levels and electronic disorders directly at these and other interfaces and connect these contributions to the energy losses. We delineate the influences of S1-CT offset and interfacial energetic disorder on {\Delta}Vnr across morphologically varied BHJs. Our results show both factors influencing energy losses in different ways. We demonstrate that PM6:Y6 can achieve low {\Delta}Vnr by forming a nominally sharp D/A interface with exceptionally low interfacial disorder via judicious processing combined with a low S1 to CT offset. This provides a design rule to minimize {\Delta}Vnr for modern NFAs: sharp D/A interfaces with low S1 to CT offset exhibiting minimal interfacial disorder.</description>

      <title>Photoinduced Patterning of Oxygen Vacancies to Promote the Ferroelectric Phase of $\mathrm{Hf_{0.5}Zr_{0.5}O_2}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photoinduced reductions in the oxygen vacancy concentration were leveraged to increase the ferroelectric phase fraction of $\mathrm{Hf_{0.5}Zr_{0.5}O_2}$ (HZO) thin-films. Modest ($\sim 0.02-0.77~\mathrm{mJ/\mu m^2}$) laser doses of visible light (488 nm, 2.54 eV) spatially patterned the concentration of oxygen vacancies as monitored by photoluminescence imaging. Local, tip-based, near-field, nanoFTIR measurements showed that the photoinduced oxygen vacancy concentration reduction promoted formation of the ferroelectric phase (space group $Pca2_1$) resulting in an increase in the piezoelectric response measured by piezoresponse force microscopy. Photoinduced vacancy tailoring provides, therefore, a spatially prescriptive, post-synthesis, and low-entry method to modify phase in \hfo-based materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a time-resolved optical measurement scheme for sampling transient charge and spin currents in a bulk centrosymmetric semiconductor. The technique relies on emission of second harmonic light triggered by a pulsed below-gap optical excitation and a spontaneous intraband polarization arising from spin or charge motion, mediated by a $\chi^(3)$-based nonlinear optical process. Our proposal uses homodyne amplification to boost the weak second harmonic signal, making it detectable with conventional electronics, calculated for charge current in a room temperature GaAs semiconductor. This all-optical technique requires neither electrical contact nor bias fields and the signal is estimated at a few percent relative to the shot noise of the probe. This proposal motivates a novel method for exploring thermal and quantum fluctuations in the solid state in a non-invasive manner.</description>

Abstract: Quantum thermodynamics aims to explore quantum features to enhance energy conversion beyond classical limits. While significant progress has been made, the understanding of caloric potentials in quantum systems remains incomplete. In this context, this study focuses on deriving general expressions for these caloric potentials by developing a quantum Maxwell relationship obtained from a thermal average form of the Ehrenfest theorem. Our results recover the classical cases and also reveal that the isothermal entropy change can be related to genuine quantum correlations in the system. Thus, this work provides a comprehensive framework for understanding the caloric behavior of quantum systems and their potential applications in caloric devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Realizing large materials models has emerged as a critical endeavor for materials research in the new era of artificial intelligence, but how to achieve this fantastic and challenging objective remains elusive. Here, we propose a feasible pathway to address this paramount pursuit by developing universal materials models of deep-learning density functional theory Hamiltonian (DeepH), enabling computational modeling of the complicated structure-property relationship of materials in general. By constructing a large materials database and substantially improving the DeepH method, we obtain a universal materials model of DeepH capable of handling diverse elemental compositions and material structures, achieving remarkable accuracy in predicting material properties. We further showcase a promising application of fine-tuning universal materials models for enhancing specific materials models. This work not only demonstrates the concept of DeepH's universal materials model but also lays the groundwork for developing large materials models, opening up significant opportunities for advancing artificial intelligence-driven materials discovery.</description>

Abstract: Shape-morphing structures have the capability to transform from one state to another, making them highly valuable in engineering applications. In this study, it is propose a two-stage shape-morphing framework inspired by kirigami structures to design structures that can deploy from a compacted state to a prescribed state under certain mechanical stimuli -- although the framework may also be extended to accommodate various physical fields, such as magnetic, thermal, and electric fields. The framework establishes a connection between the geometry and mechanics of kirigami structures. The proposed approach combines the finite element analysis (FEA), genetic algorithm (GA), and an analytical energy-based model to obtain kirigami designs with robustness and efficiency.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10588v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metastable nanostructures are kinetically trapped in local energy minima featuring intriguing surface and material properties. To unleash their potential, there is a need for non-equilibrium processes capable of stabilizing a large range of crystal phases outside thermodynamic equilibrium conditions by closely and flexibly controlling atomic reactant composition, spatial temperature distribution and residence time. Here, we demonstrate the capture of metastable pseudo-binary metal oxides at room temperature with scalable combustion-aerosol processes. By a combination of X-ray diffraction, electron microscopy and online flame characterization, we investigate the occurrence of metastable CoCu$_2$O$_3$ with controlled crystal size (4-16 nm) over thermodynamically stable CuO and Co$_3$O$_4$. Immediate practical impact is demonstrated by exceptional sensing and catalytic performance for air pollutant detection (e.g., 15 parts-per-billion benzene). This approach can be extended to various binary, ternary and high entropy oxides with even more components to access novel materials also promising for actuators, energy storage or solar cells.</description>

      <title>Trapping of isotropic droplets by disclinations in nematic liquid crystals controlled by surface anchoring and elastic constant disparity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Linear defects such as dislocations and disclinations in ordered materials attract foreign particles since they replace strong elastic distortions at the defect cores. In this work, we explore the behavior of isotropic droplets nucleating at singular disclinations in a nematic liquid crystal, predesigned by surface photopatterning. Experiments show that in the biphasic nematic-isotropic region, although the droplets are attracted to the disclination cores, their centers of mass shift away from the core centers as the temperature increases. The shift is not random, being deterministically defined by the surrounding director field. The effect is explained by the balance of interfacial anchoring and bulk elasticity. An agreement with the experiment can be achieved only if the model accounts for the disparity of the nematic elastic constants; the so-called one-constant approximation, often used in the theoretical analysis of liquid crystals, produces qualitatively wrong predictions. In particular, the experimentally observed shift towards the bend region around a +1/2 disclination core can be explained only when the bend constant is larger than the splay constant. The described dependence of the precise location of a foreign inclusion at defect cores on the elastic and surface anchoring properties can be used in the rational design of microscale architectures.</description>

Abstract: A ubiquitous approach to obtain transferable machine learning-based models of potential energy surfaces for atomistic systems is to decompose the total energy into a sum of local atom-centred contributions. However, in many systems non-negligible long-range electrostatic effects must be taken into account as well. We introduce a general mathematical framework to study how such long-range effects can be included in a way that (i) allows charge equilibration and (ii) retains the locality of the learnable atom-centred contributions to ensure transferability. Our results give partial explanations for the success of existing machine learned potentials that include equilibriation and provide perspectives how to design such schemes in a systematic way. To complement the rigorous theoretical results, we describe a practical scheme for fitting the energy and electron density of water clusters.</description>

Abstract: Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM) coupled with Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy (EELS) presents a powerful platform for detailed material characterization via rich imaging and spectroscopic data. Modern electron microscopes can access multiple length scales and sampling rates far beyond human perception and reaction time. Recent advancements in machine learning (ML) offer a promising avenue to enhance these capabilities by integrating ML algorithms into the STEM-EELS framework, fostering an environment of active learning. This work enables the seamless integration of STEM with High-Performance Computing (HPC) systems. We present several implemented workflows that exemplify this integration. These workflows include sophisticated techniques such as object finding and Deep Kernel Learning (DKL). Through these developments, we demonstrate how the fusion of STEM-EELS with ML and HPC enhances the efficiency and scope of material characterization for 70% STEM available globally. The codes are available at GitHub link.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11180v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the three commonly employed approaches that define the same intrinsic linear anomalous Hall response actually lead to different results for intrinsic nonlinear transport. The difference arises from an intrinsic anomalous distribution. It originates from scattering, but its value is completely independent of scattering, because it represents the local equilibration of electron wave packets with field corrected energy. As a manifestation, we find that under ac driving, the intrinsic contributions in rectified component and in double-frequency component exhibit distinct frequency dependence, which can be probed in experiment. Using first-principles calculations, we estimate the signals that can be probed in antiferromagnetic CuMnAs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Clean one-dimensional electron systems can exhibit quantized conductance. The plateau conductance doubles if the transport is dominated by Andreev reflection. Here, we report quantized conductance observed in both Andreev and normal-state transports in PbTe-Pb and PbTe-In hybrid nanowires. The Andreev plateau is observed at $4e^2/h$, twice of the normal plateau value of $2e^2/h$. In comparison, Andreev conductance in the best-optimized III-V nanowires is non-quantized due to mode-mixing induced dips (a disorder effect), despite the quantization of normal-state transport. The negligible mode mixing in PbTe hybrids indicates an unprecedented low-disorder transport regime for nanowire devices, beneficial for Majorana researches.</description>

      <title>Planar Hall Plateau in Magnetic Weyl Semimetals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11273v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the rapid progress in the study of planar Hall effect (PHE) in recent years, all the previous works only showed that the PHE is connected to local geometric quantities, such as Berry curvature. Here, for the first time, we point out that the PHE in magnetic Weyl semimetals is directly related to a global quantity, namely, the Chern number of the Weyl point. This leads to a remarkable consequence that the PHE observation predicted here is robust against many system details, including the Fermi energy. The main difference between non-magnetic and magnetic Weyl points is that the latter breaks time-reversal symmetry T, thus generally possessing an energy tilt. Via semiclassical Boltzmann theory, we investigate the PHE in generic magnetic Weyl models with energy tilt and arbitrary Chern number. We find that by aligning the magnetic and electric fields in the same direction, the trace of the PHE conductivity contributed from Berry curvature and orbital moment is proportional to the Chern number and the energy tilt of the Weyl points, resulting in previously undiscovered quantized PHE plateau by varying Fermi energy. We further confirm the existence of PHE plateaus in a more realistic lattice model without T symmetry. By proposing a new quantized physical quantity, our work not only provides a new tool for extracting the topological character of the Weyl points but also suggests that the interplay between topology and magnetism can give rise to intriguing physics.</description>

      <title>Quantized orbital angular momentums of dipolar magnons and magnetoelectric cavity polaritons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnons are viewed as local deviations from the ordered state. Usually, the spin magnetic moment of magnons is considered. In a 3D-confined structure of a magnetic insulator with magnetodipolar mode (MDM) oscillations, an orbital angular momentum (OAM) as well as a spin angular momentum (SAM) can be observed along a static magnetic field. In such a confined structure as quasi-2D ferrite disk, energy levels of MDM oscillations are quantized. Quantum confinement is characterized by a half-integer internal OAM, which is also associated with a circulating energy flow. The observation of MDM resonances in the 3D-confined structure of a magnetic insulator is due to the interaction of two subsystems: ferromagnetic and electric polarization orders. The coupling states of these two concurrent orders, caused by OAMs, are considered as magnetoelectric (ME) states. The fields in the vicinity of MDM resonators are characterized by simultaneous violation of time reversal and inversion symmetry. This plays a significant role in the problems of strong light-matter interaction regime and quantum atmosphere. The analysis of SAM and OAM in 3D-confined magnetic insulators becomes very important for the realization of ME meta-atomic structures. Current interest lies in considering such artificial systems as subwavelength ME quantum emitters of electromagnetic radiation.</description>

      <title>Layer-dependent electromechanical response in twisted graphene moir\'e superlattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11442v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The coupling of mechanical deformation and electrical stimuli at the nanoscale has been a subject of intense investigation in the realm of materials science. Recently, twisted van der Waals (vdW) materials have emerged as a platform to explore exotic quantum states. These states are intimately tied to the formation of moir\'e superlattices, which can be visualized directly exploiting the electromechanical response. However, the origin of the response, even in twisted bilayer graphene (tBLG), remains unsettled. Here, employing lateral piezoresponse force microscopy (LPFM), we investigate the electromechanical responses of marginally twisted graphene moir\'e superlattices with different layer thicknesses. We observe distinct LPFM amplitudes and spatial profiles in tBLG and twisted monolayer-bilayer graphene (tMBG), exhibiting effective in-plane piezoelectric coefficients of 0.05 pm/V and 0.35 pm/V, respectively. Force tuning experiments further underscore a marked divergence in their responses. The contrasting behaviors suggest different electromechanical couplings in tBLG and tMBG. In tBLG, the response near the domain walls is attributed to the flexoelectric effect, while in tMBG, the behaviors can be comprehended within the context of piezoelectric effect. Our results not only provide insights to electromechanical and corporative effects in twisted vdW materials with different stacking symmetries, but may also show their potential for engineering them at the nanoscale.</description>

      <title>Bloch sphere representation for Rabi oscillation driven by Rashba field in the two-dimensional harmonic confinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We studied the dynamical properties of Rabi oscillations driven by an alternating Rashba field applied to a two-dimensional (2D) harmonic confinement system. We solve the time-dependent (TD) Schr\"{o}dinger equation numerically and rewrite the resulting TD wavefunction onto the Bloch sphere (BS) using two BS parameters of the zenith ($\theta_B$) and azimuthal ($\phi_B$) angles, extracting the phase information $\phi_B$ as well as the mixing ratio $\theta_B$ between the two BS-pole states.
  We employed a two-state rotating wave (TSRW) approach and studied the fundamental features of $\theta_B$ and $\phi_B$ over time. The TSRW approach reveals a triangular wave formation in $\theta_B$. Moreover, at each apex of the triangular wave, the TD wavefunction passes through the BS pole, and the state is completely replaced by the opposite spin state. The TSRW approach also elucidates a linear change in $\phi_B$. The slope of $\phi_B$ vs. time is equal to the difference between the dynamical terms, leading to a confinement potential in the harmonic system. The TSRW approach further demonstrates a jump in the phase difference by $\pi$ when the wavefunction passes through the BS pole.
  The alternating Rashba field causes multiple successive Rabi transitions in the 2D harmonic system. We then introduce the effective BS (EBS) and transform these complicated transitions into an equivalent "single" Rabi one. Consequently, the EBS parameters $\theta_B^{\mathrm{eff}}$ and $\phi_B^{\mathrm{eff}}$ exhibit mixing and phase difference between two spin states $\alpha$ and $\beta$, leading to a deep understanding of the TD features of multi-Rabi oscillations. Furthermore, the combination of the BS representation with the TSRW approach successfully reveals the dynamical properties of the Rabi oscillation, even beyond the TSRW approximation.</description>

      <title>Non-equillibrium ultrafast optical excitation as a stimulus for ultra-small field-free magnetic skyrmions in ferrimagnetic GdFeCo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11615v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generating and manipulating magnetic skyrmions at ultrafast time scales is essential for future skyrmionbased racetrack memory and logic gate applications. Using the atomistic spin dynamics simulations, we demonstrate the nucleation of ultra-small field-free magnetic skyrmions in amorphous GdFeCo at picosecond timescales by femtosecond laser heating. The ultrafast nature of laser heating and subsequent cooling from a high-temperature state is crucial for forming magnetic skyrmion. The magnon localization and magnon coalescence are the key driving mechanisms responsible for stabilizing the magnetic skyrmions at zero field conditions. The polarization and, hence, the topological charge can be switched by exploiting the all-optical switching observed in GdFeCo. The skyrmion sizes and numbers can be controlled by varying pulse width and fluence of incident laser pulses. Applying an external magnetic field provides an additional degree of freedom to tune the skyrmion radius during the ultrafast optical creation of magnetic skyrmions. Our results provide a detailed understanding of the ultrafast creation of magnetic skyrmions using femtosecond laser pulses, a vital step in advancing next-generation skyrmion-based memory technologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11679v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metal-insulator transitions (MITs) in resistive switching materials can be triggered by an electric stimulus that produces significant changes in the electrical response. When these phases have distinct magnetic characteristics, dramatic changes in spin excitations are also expected. The transition metal oxide La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 (LSMO) is a ferromagnetic metal at low temperatures and a paramagnetic insulator above room temperature. When LSMO is in its metallic phase a critical electrical bias has been shown to lead to an MIT that results in the formation of a paramagnetic resistive barrier transverse to the applied electric field. Using spin-transfer ferromagnetic resonance spectroscopy, we show that even for electrical biases less than the critical value that triggers the MIT, there is magnetic phase separation with the spin-excitation resonances varying systematically with applied bias. Thus, applied voltages provide a means to alter spin resonance characteristics of interest for neuromorphic circuits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a theoretical framework for understanding diffuse multiple scattering (DMS) in single crystals, focusing on diffuse scattering-Bragg (DS-Bragg) channels. These channels, when probed with high-flux, low-divergent monochromatic synchrotron X-rays, provide well-defined visualizations of Kossel lines. Our main contribution lies in modeling the intensity distribution along these lines by considering DS around individual reciprocal lattice nodes. The model incorporates contributions from both general DS and mosaicity, elucidating their connection to second-order scattering events. This comprehensive approach advances our understanding of DMS phenomena, enabling their use as probes for complex material behavior, particularly under extreme conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08490v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By constructing germanene (silicene, stanene)/$M$Bi$_2$Te$_4$ ($M$ = 3d-transition elements) heterostructures, we discovered and designed multimechanism quantum-anomalous-Hall (QAH) systems, including $\Gamma$-based QAH, $K$-$K'$-connected QAH, and valley-polarized $K$- or $K'$-based QAH states via first-principle computations. The unique systems possess a global gap and tunable Chern number. The coexisting conventional $\Gamma$-based QAH state of $M$Bi$_2$Te$_4$ and valley-polarized $K$($K'$)-based QAH state of germanene (silicene, stanene), with opposite chirality, can interact with each other. Adjusting magnetic configurations of $M$Bi$_2$Te$_4$-layers not only switch on (off) the QAH conductance, but also modulate Chern numbers exactly. For example, the germanene/bilayer-NiBi$_2$Te$_4$ possesses the Chern number $C = +1$ in ferromagnetic couplings and $C = +2$ in antiferromagnetic couplings. The novel multimechanism QAH insulators, which are achievable in experiments, provide a new approach to spintronics and valleytronics based on topological states of matter.</description>

      <title>Thermal conductivity of Li$_3$PS$_4$ solid electrolytes with ab initio accuracy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.12936v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The vast amount of computational studies on electrical conduction in solid-state electrolytes is not mirrored by comparable efforts addressing thermal conduction, which has been scarcely investigated despite its relevance to thermal management and (over)heating of batteries. The reason for this lies in the complexity of the calculations: on one hand, the diffusion of ionic charge carriers makes lattice methods formally unsuitable, due to the lack of equilibrium atomic positions needed for normal-mode expansion. On the other hand, the prohibitive cost of large-scale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of heat transport in large systems at ab initio levels has hindered the use of MD-based methods. In this paper, we leverage recently developed machine-learning potentials targeting different ab initio functionals (PBEsol, r$^2$SCAN, PBE0) and a state-of-the-art formulation of the Green-Kubo theory of heat transport in multicomponent systems to compute the thermal conductivity of a promising solid-state electrolyte, Li$_3$PS$_4$, in all its polymorphs ($\alpha$, $\beta$, and $\gamma$). By comparing MD estimates with lattice methods on the low-temperature, nondiffusive $\gamma$-Li$_3$PS$_4$, we highlight strong anharmonicities and negligible nuclear quantum effects, hence further justifying MD-based methods even for nondiffusive phases. Finally, for the ion-conducting $\alpha$ and $\beta$ phases, where the multicomponent Green-Kubo MD approach is mandatory, our simulations indicate a weak temperature dependence of the thermal conductivity, a glass-like behavior due to the effective local disorder characterizing these Li-diffusing phases.</description>

Abstract: We perform extensive density functional theory (DFT) calculations to determine the stability and elementary properties of 4249 previously unexplored monolayer crystals. The monolayers comprise the most stable subset (energy within 0.1 eV/atom of the convex hull) of a larger portfolio of two-dimensional (2D) materials recently discovered using a deep generative model and systematic lattice decoration schemes. The relaxed 2D structures are run through the basic property workflow of the Computational 2D Materials Database (C2DB) to evaluate the dynamical stability and obtain the stiffness tensor, piezoelectric tensor, deformation potentials, Born and Bader charges, electronic band structure, effective masses, plasma frequency, Fermi surface, projected density of states, magnetic moments, magnetic exchange couplings, magnetic anisotropy, topological indices, optical- and infrared polarisability. We provide statistical overviews of the property data and highlight a few specific examples of interesting materials. Our work exposes previously unknown parts of the 2D chemical space and provides a basis for the discovery of 2D materials with specific properties. All data is available in the C2DB.</description>

      <title>Exploring Li-ion Transport Properties of Li$_3$TiCl$_6$: A Machine Learning Molecular Dynamics Study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01077v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We performed large-scale molecular dynamics simulations based on a machine-learning force field (MLFF) to investigate the Li-ion transport mechanism in cation-disordered Li$_3$TiCl$_6$ cathode at six different temperatures, ranging from 25$^\mathrm{o}$C to 100$^\mathrm{o}$C. In this work, deep neural network method and data generated by $ab-initio$ molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations were deployed to build a high-fidelity MLFF. Radial distribution functions, Li-ion mean square displacements (MSD), diffusion coefficients, ionic conductivity, activation energy, and crystallographic direction-dependent migration barriers were calculated and compared with corresponding AIMD and experimental data to benchmark the accuracy of the MLFF. From MSD analysis, we captured both the self and distinct parts of Li-ion dynamics. The latter reveals that the Li-ions are involved in anti-correlation motion that was rarely reported for solid-state materials. Similarly, the self and distinct parts of Li-ion dynamics were used to determine Haven's ratio to describe the Li-ion transport mechanism in Li$_3$TiCl$_6$. Obtained trajectory from molecular dynamics infers that the Li-ion transportation is mainly through interstitial hopping which was confirmed by intra- and inter-layer Li-ion displacement with respect to simulation time. Ionic conductivity (1.06 mS/cm) and activation energy (0.29eV) calculated by our simulation are highly comparable with that of experimental values. Overall, the combination of machine-learning methods and AIMD simulations explains the intricate electrochemical properties of the Li$_3$TiCl$_6$ cathode with remarkably reduced computational time. Thus, our work strongly suggests that the deep neural network-based MLFF could be a promising method for large-scale complex materials.</description>

Abstract: The selective-area epitaxy (SAE) is a useful technique to grow epitaxial films with a desired shape on a pre-patterned substrate. Although SAE of patterned topological-insulator (TI) thin films has been performed in the past, there has been no report of SAE-grown TI structures that are bulk-insulating. Here we report the successful growth of Hall-bars and nanowires of bulk-insulating TIs using the SAE technique. Their transport properties show that the quality of the selectively-grown structures is comparable to that of bulk-insulating TI films grown on pristine substrates. In SAE-grown TI nanowires, we were able to observe Aharonov-Bohm-like magnetoresistance oscillations that are characteristic of the quantum-confined topological surface states. The availability of bulk-insulating TI nanostructures via the SAE technique opens the possibility to fabricate intricate topological devices in a scalable manner.</description>

Abstract: We present the geodesic nature and quantization of geometric shift vector in quantum systems, with the parameter space defined by the Bloch momentum, using the Wilson loop approach. Our analysis extends to include bosonic phonon drag shift vectors with non-vertical transitions. We demonstrate that the gauge invariant shift vector can be quantized as integer values, analogous to the Euler characteristic based on the Gauss-Bonnet theorem for a manifold with a smooth boundary. We reveal intricate relationships among geometric quantities such as the shift vector, Berry curvature, and quantum metric. Our findings demonstrate that the loop integral of the shift vector in the quantized interband formula contributes to the non-quantized component of the trace of conductivity in the circular photogalvanic effect. The Wilson loop method facilitates first-principles calculations, providing insights in the geometric underpinnings of these interband gauge invariant quantities and shedding light on their nonlinear optical manifestations in real materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05380v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Obstructed atomic insulator is recently proposed as an unconventional material, in which electric charge centers localized at sites away from the atoms. A half-filling surface state would emerge at specific interfaces cutting through these charge centers and avoid intersecting any atoms. In this article, we utilized angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations to study one of the obstructed atomic insulator candidates, NiP$_2$. A floating surface state with large effective mass that is isolated from all bulk states is resolved on the (100) cleavage plane, distinct from previously reported surface states in obstructed atomic insulators that are merged into bulk bands. Density functional theory calculation results elucidate that this floating surface state is originated from the obstructed Wannier charge centers, albeit underwent surface reconstruction that splits the half-filled obstructed surface state. Our findings not only shed lights on the spectroscopy study of obstructed atomic insulators and obstructed surface states, but also provide possible route for development of new catalysts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09937v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The properties of functional oxide heterostructures are strongly influenced by the physics governing their interfaces. Modern deposition techniques allow us to accurately engineer the interface physics through the growth of atomically precise heterostructures. This enables minute control over the electronic, magnetic, and structural characteristics. Here, we investigate the magnetic properties of tailor-made superlattices employing the ferromagnetic and insulating double perovskites RE$_2$NiMnO$_6$ (RE = La, Nd), featuring distinct Curie temperatures. Adjusting the superlattice periodicity at the unit cell level allows us to engineer their magnetic phase diagram. Large periodicity superlattices conserve the individual para- to ferromagnetic transitions of the La$_2$NiMnO$_6$ and Nd$_2$NiMnO$_6$ parent compounds. As the superlattice periodicity is reduced, the Curie temperatures of the superlattice constituents converge and, finally, collapse into one single transition for the lowest period samples. This is a consequence of the magnetic order parameter propagating across the superlattice interfaces, as supported by a minimal Landau theory model. Further, we find that the Nd-Ni/Mn exchange interaction can be enhanced by the superlattice interfaces. This leads to a field-induced reversal of the Nd magnetic moments, as confirmed by synchrotron X-ray magnetic circular dichroism measurements and supported by first-principles calculations. Our work demonstrates how superlattice engineering can be employed to fine-tune the magnetic properties in oxide heterostructures and broadens our understanding of magnetic interfacial effects.</description>

      <title>Angle-resolved optically detected magnetic resonance as a tool for strain determination in nanostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.06451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2106.06451v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we apply the angle-resolved Optically Detected Magnetic Resonance (ODMR) technique to study series of strained (Cd, Mn)Te/(Cd, Mg)Te quantum wells (QWs) produced by molecular beam epitaxy. By analyzing characteristic features of ODMR angular scans, we determine strain-induced axial-symmetry spin Hamiltonian parameter D with neV precision. Furthermore, we use low-temperature optical reflectivity measurements and X-ray diffraction scans to evaluate the local strain present in QW material. In our analysis, we take into account different thermal expansion coefficients of GaAs substrate and CdTe buffer. The additional deformation due to the thermal expansion effects has the same magnitude as deformation origination from the different compositions of the samples. Based on the evaluated deformations and values of strain-induced axial-symmetry spin Hamiltonian parameter D, we find strain spin-lattice coefficient G11 = (72.2 +- 1.9) neV for Mn2+ in CdTe and shear deformation potential b = (-0.94 +- 0.11) eV for CdTe.</description>

      <title>Exciton-Enhanced Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion in Two-Dimensional Crystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.08345v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that excitonic resonances and interexciton transitions can enhance the probability of spontaneous parametric down-conversion, a second-order optical response which generates entangled photon pairs. We benchmark our ab initio many-body calculations using experimental polar plots of second harmonic generation in NbOI$_2$, clearly demonstrating the relevance of excitons in the nonlinear response. A strong double-exciton resonance in 2D NbOCl$_2$ leads to giant enhancement in the second order susceptibility. Our work paves the way for the realization of efficient ultrathin quantum light sources.</description>

      <title>Direct observation of current-induced nonlinear spin torque in Pt-Py bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.11156v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We experimentally observe nonlinear spin torque in metallic bilayers of platinum and permalloy by means of spin-torque ferromagnetic-resonance (ST-FMR) under massive dc current injection. The observed nonlinear spin torque exerted to permalloy magnetization is attributed primarily to nonlinear spin polarization. Additional origin of the nonlinear spin torque is magnon generation (annihilation) followed by shrinkage (expansion) of effective magnetization, which is reveled by STFMR and unidirectional spin Hall magnetoresistance measurements. The present study paves a way to spin-Hall effect based nonlinear spintronic devices as well as time-varying nonlinear magnetic metamaterials with tailor-made permeability.</description>

      <title>Monte-Carlo ray-tracing studies of multiplexed prismatic graphite analyzers for the cold-neutron triple-axis spectrometer at the High Flux Isotope Reactor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.03233v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A modern cold triple-axis spectrometer to study quantum condensed matter systems is planned for the High Flux Isotope Reactor (HFIR) at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Here, we describe the conceptual principles and design of a secondary spectrometer using a multiplexed, prismatic analyzer system relying on graphite crystals and inspired by the successful implementation of the Continuous Angle Multiple Energy Analysis (CAMEA) spectrometers at the Paul Scherrer Institute. This project is currently known as MANTA for Multi-analyzer Neutron Triple-Axis. We report Monte-Carlo ray-tracing simulations on a simple but realistic sample scattering kernel to further illustrate the prismatic analyzer concept's workings, calibration, and performance. Then, we introduce a new statistical analysis approach based on the prismatic analyzer concept to improve the number of final energies measured on the spectrometer. We also study possible evolutions in the CAMEA design relevant for MANTA.</description>

      <title>Quantized monopole nonlinear Hall current from chiral asymmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17690v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a topological probe for detecting chirality imbalance in time reversal invariant Weyl and Dirac semimetals via nonlinear Hall response. The chiral anomaly effect, occurring in parallel electric and magnetic fields, causes an energy shift between Weyl cones of different chirality, which leads to chirally asymmetric intra-node relaxation. The net nonlinear Hall current is thus quantized, and determined by the sum of monopole charge weighted by the transport relaxation time. Our theory directly applies to chiral Weyl semimetals even without a magnetic field. Additionally, besides DC transport probes, we anticipate that nonlinear circular dichroism measurements could detect chiral asymmetry-induced currents.</description>

      <title>Room temperature charge density wave in a tetragonal polymorph of Gd2Os3Si5 and study of its origin in the RE2T3X5 (RE = Rare earth, T = transition metal, X = Si, Ge) series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08660v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Charge density wave (CDW) systems are proposed to exhibit application potential for electronic and optoelectronic devices. Therefore, identifying new materials that exhibit a CDW state at room temperature is crucial for the development of CDW-based devices. Here, we present a non-layered tetragonal polymorph of Gd2Os3Si5, which exhibits a CDW state at room temperature. Gd2Os3Si5 crystallizes in the U2Mn3Si5-type tetragonal crystal structure with the space group P4/mnc. Single-crystal x-ray diffraction (SXRD) analysis shows that Gd2Os3Si5 possesses an incommensurately modulated structure with modulation wave vector q = (0.53, 0, 0), while the modulation reduces the symmetry to orthorhombic Cccm({\sigma}00)0s0. This differs in contrast to isostructural Sm2Ru3Ge5, where the modulated phase has been reported to possess the superspace symmetry Pm({\alpha} 0 {\gamma})0. However, reinvestigation of Sm2Ru3Ge5 suggests that its modulated crystal structure can alternatively be described by Cccm({\sigma}00)0s0, with modulations similar to Gd2Os3Si5. The magnetic susceptibility, \c{hi}(T), exhibits a maximum at low temperatures that indicates an antiferromagnetic transition at TN = 5.5 K. The \c{hi}(T) furthermore shows an anomaly at around 345 K, suggesting a CDW transition at TCDW = 345 K, that corroborates the result from high-temperature SXRD measurements. Interestingly, R2T3X5 compounds are known to crystallize either in the tetragonal Sc2Fe3Si5 type structure or in the orthorhombic U2Co3Si5 structure type. Not all of the compounds in the R2T3X5 series undergo CDW phase transitions. We find that R2T3X5 compounds will exhibit a CDW transition, if the condition : 0.526 &lt; c/sqrt(ab) &lt; 0.543 is satisfied. We suggest the wave vector-dependent electron-phonon coupling to be the dominant mechanism of CDW formation in the tetragonal polymorph of Gd2Os3Si5.</description>

      <title>Parameter identification and uncertainty propagation of hydrogel coupled diffusion-deformation using POD-based reduced-order modeling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08968v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study explores reduced-order modeling for analyzing the time-dependent diffusion-deformation of hydrogels. The full-order model describing hydrogel transient behavior consists of a coupled system of partial differential equations in which chemical potential and displacements are coupled. This system is formulated in a monolithic fashion and solved using the finite element method. We employ proper orthogonal decomposition as a model order reduction approach. The reduced-order model performance is tested through a benchmark problem on hydrogel swelling and a case study simulating co-axial printing. Then, we embed the reduced-order model into an optimization loop to efficiently identify the coupled problem's material parameters using full-field data. Finally, a study is conducted on the uncertainty propagation of the material parameter.</description>

      <title>Topology in a one-dimensional plasmonic crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19576v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study the topology of the bands of a plasmonic crystal composed of graphene and of a metallic grating. Firstly, we derive a Kronig-Penney type of equation for the plasmonic bands as function of the Bloch wavevector and discuss the propagation of the surface plasmon polaritons on the polaritonic crystal using a transfer-matrix approach considering a finite relaxation time. Second, we reformulate the problem as a tight-binding model that resembles the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) Hamiltonian, one difference being that the hopping amplitudes are, in this case, energy dependent. In possession of the tight-binding equations it is a simple task to determine the topology (value of the winding number) of the bands. This allows to determine the existense or absence of topological end modes in the system. Similarly to the SSH model, we show that there is a tunable parameter that induces topological phase transitions from trivial to non-trivial. In our case, it is the distance d between the graphene sheet and the metallic grating. We note that d is a parameter that can be easily tuned experimentally simply by controlling the thickness of the spacer between the grating and the graphene sheet. It is then experimentally feasible to engineer devices with the required topological properties. Finally, we suggest a scattering experiment allowing the observation of the topological states.</description>

      <title>Towards an exact electronic quantum many-body treatment of Kondo correlation in magnetic impurities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18709v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Kondo effect is a prototypical quantum phenomenon arising from the interaction between localized electrons in a magnetic impurity and itinerant electrons in a metallic host. Although it has served as the testing ground for quantum many-body methods for decades, the precise description of Kondo physics with material specificity remains challenging. Here, we present a systematic ab initio approach to converge towards an exact zero-temperature electronic treatment of Kondo correlations. Across a series of 3d transition metals, we extract Kondo temperatures matching the subtle experimental trends, with an accuracy far exceeding that of standard models. We further obtain microscopic insight into the origin of these trends. More broadly, we demonstrate the possibility to start from fully ab initio many-body simulations and push towards the realm of converged predictions.</description>

      <title>Autonomous programmable microscopic electronic lablets optimized with digital control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20110v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lablets are autonomous microscopic particles with programmable CMOS electronics that can control electrokinetic phenomena and electrochemical reactions in solution via actuator and sensor microelectrodes. In this paper, we describe the design and fabrication of optimized singulated lablets (CMOS3) with dimensions 140x140x50 micrometers carrying an integrated coplanar encapsulated supercapacitor as a rechargeable power supply. The lablets are designed to allow docking to one another or to a smart surface for interchange of energy, electronic information, and chemicals. The paper focusses on the digital and analog design of the lablets to allow significant programmable functionality in a microscopic footprint, including the control of autonomous actuation and sensing up to the level of being able to support a complete lablet self-reproduction life cycle, although experimentally this remains to be proven. The potential of lablets in autonomous sensing and control and for evolutionary experimentation are discussed.</description>

      <title>Investigating meV-scale Equilibrium Atomic Dynamics with X-Rays: focus on disordered materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08670v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper reviews non-resonant meV-resolved inelastic x-ray scattering (IXS) as a complementary method to inelastic neutron scattering (INS). Two aspects of IXS that are notable in this context are (1) that IXS allows straightforward measurements of phonons in small (sub-mm, and even $\sim 0.01$ mm) samples with $\sim 1$ meV resolution and excellent Q resolution and (2) that IXS avoids the kinematic constraints of INS. The first allows both new geometries (thin films, diamond anvil cells) and easy access to new materials, while the second allows high quality data on disordered materials, such as scans with sub-meV resolution to arbitrarily high energy transfer become possible , even at momentum transfers as small as 1/nm. The review briefly discusses the spectrometers and compares the practical forms for the dynamic structure factor for crystals, glasses and liquids. This is followed by a longer review of work on liquids and then shorter discussion of work on glasses, crystals, and discussion of specific geometries. This paper complements the longer introduction/review of IXS at arxiv:1504.01098 .</description>
