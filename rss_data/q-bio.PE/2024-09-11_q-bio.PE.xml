      <title>Mapping Evolution of Molecules Across Biochemistry with Assembly Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evolution is often understood through genetic mutations driving changes in an organism's fitness, but there is potential to extend this understanding beyond the genetic code. We propose that natural products - complex molecules central to Earth's biochemistry can be used to uncover evolutionary mechanisms beyond genes. By applying Assembly Theory (AT), which views selection as a process not limited to biological systems, we can map and measure evolutionary forces in these molecules. AT enables the exploration of the assembly space of natural products, demonstrating how the principles of the selfish gene apply to these complex chemical structures, selecting vastly improbable and complex molecules from a vast space of possibilities. By comparing natural products with a broader molecular database, we can assess the degree of evolutionary contingency, providing insight into how molecular novelty emerges and persists. This approach not only quantifies evolutionary selection at the molecular level but also offers a new avenue for drug discovery by exploring the molecular assembly spaces of natural products. Our method provides a fresh perspective on measuring the evolutionary processes both, shaping and being read out, by the molecular imprint of selection.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing semi-directed level-1 networks using few quarnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semi-directed networks are partially directed graphs that model evolution where the directed edges represent reticulate evolutionary events. We present an algorithm that reconstructs binary $n$-leaf semi-directed level-1 networks in $O( n^2)$ time from its quarnets (4-leaf subnetworks). Our method assumes we have direct access to all quarnets, yet uses only an asymptotically optimal number of $O(n \log n)$ quarnets. Under group-based models of evolution with the Jukes-Cantor or Kimura 2-parameter constraints, it has been shown that only four-cycle quarnets and the splits of the other quarnets can practically be inferred with high accuracy from nucleotide sequence data. Our algorithm uses only this information, assuming the network contains no triangles. Additionally, we provide an $O(n^3)$ time algorithm that reconstructs the blobtree (or tree-of-blobs) of any binary $n$-leaf semi-directed network with unbounded level from $O(n^3)$ splits of its quarnets.</description>

      <title>Mechanistic-statistical model for the expansion of ash dieback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hymenoscyphus fraxineus is an invasive forest fungal pathogen that induces severe dieback in European ash populations. The spread of the disease has been closely monitored in France by the forest health survey system. We have developed a mechanisticstatistical model that describes the spread of the disease. It takes into account climate (summer temperature and spring rainfall), pathogen population dynamics (foliar infection, Allee effect induced by limited sexual partner encounters) and host density. We fitted this model using available disease reports. We estimated the parameters of our model, first identifying the appropriate ranges for the parameters, which led to a model reduction, and then using an adaptive multiple importance sampling algorithm for fitting. The model reproduces well the propagation observed in France over the last 20 years. In particular, it predicts the absence of disease impact in the south-east of the country and its weak development in the Garonne valley in south-west France. Summer temperature is the factor with the highest overall effect on disease spread, and explains the limited impact in southern France. Among the different temperature indices tested, the number of summer days with temperatures above 28{\textdegree}C gave the best qualitative behavior and the best fit. In contrast, the Allee effect and the heterogeneity of spring precipitation did not strongly affect the overall expansion of H. fraxineus in France and could be neglected in the modeling process. The model can be used to infer the average annual dispersal of H. fraxineus in France.</description>

      <title>When can few-species models describe dynamics within a complex community?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamics of species' abundances in ecological communities are often described using models that only account for a few species. It is not clear when and why this would be possible, as most species form part of diverse ecological communities, with many species that are not included in these few-variable descriptions. We study theoretically the circumstances under which the use of such models is justified, by considering the dynamics of a small set of focal species embedded within a diverse, sparsely-interacting community. We find that in some cases the focal species' dynamics are high-dimensional, making a few-variable description impossible. In other cases we show that such a description exists, even though the effect of the surrounding community on the focal species' dynamics is not small or simple. We give two different methods for approximating the dynamics, by using effective parameters that depend on the surrounding community, which are relevant under different assumptions on the relation between the explicitly modeled focal species and the rest of the species. Both methods work surprisingly well in many of the cases that we check, with effective dynamics that are often very similar and sometimes indistinguishable from the true dynamics, even when the effect of the community on the focal species is significant.</description>

      <title>Rethinking tipping points in spatial ecosystems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.13571v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The theory of alternative stable states and tipping points has garnered substantial attention in the last several decades. It predicts potential critical transitions from one ecosystem state to a completely different state under increasing environmental stress. However, typically, ecosystem models that predict tipping do not resolve space explicitly. Ecosystems being inherently spatial, it is important to understand the effects of spatial processes. In fact, it has been argued that spatial dynamics can actually help ecosystems evade tipping. Here, using a dryland and a savanna-forest model as example systems, we provide a synthesis of several mechanisms by which spatial processes can change our predictions of tipping in ecosystems. We show that self-organized Turing patterns can emerge in drylands that help evade tipping, but that (non-Turing) patterns driven by environmental heterogeneity are key to evasion of tipping in humid savannas. Since the ecological interactions driving the dynamics of these ecosystems differ from each other, we suggest that tipping evasion mechanisms in ecosystems may be connected to the key ecological interactions in a system. This highlights the need for further research into the link between the two in order to formulate better strategies to make ecosystems resilient to global change.</description>
