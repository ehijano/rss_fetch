      <title>An Examination of Bitcoin's Structural Shortcomings as Money: A Synthesis of Economic and Technical Critiques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since its inception, Bitcoin has been positioned as a revolutionary alternative to national currencies, attracting immense public and academic interest. This paper presents a critical evaluation of this claim, suggesting that Bitcoin faces significant structural barriers to qualifying as money. It synthesizes critiques from two distinct schools of economic thought - Post-Keynesianism and the Austrian School - and validates their conclusions with rigorous technical analysis. From a Post-Keynesian perspective, it is argued that Bitcoin does not function as money because it is not a debt-based IOU and fails to exhibit the essential properties required for a stable monetary asset (Vianna, 2021). Concurrently, from an Austrian viewpoint, it is shown to be inconsistent with a strict interpretation of Mises's Regression Theorem, as it lacks prior non-monetary value and has not achieved the status of the most saleable commodity (Peniaz and Kavaliou, 2024). These theoretical arguments are then supported by an empirical analysis of Bitcoin's extreme volatility, hard-coded scalability limits, fragile market structure, and insecure long-term economic design. The paper concludes that Bitcoin is more accurately characterized as a novel speculative asset whose primary legacy may be the technological innovation it has spurred, rather than its viability as a monetary standard.</description>

      <title>When Medical AI Explanations Help and When They Harm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We document a fundamental paradox in AI transparency: explanations improve decisions when algorithms are correct but systematically worsen them when algorithms err. In an experiment with 257 medical students making 3,855 diagnostic decisions, we find explanations increase accuracy by 6.3 percentage points when AI is correct (73% of cases) but decrease it by 4.9 points when incorrect (27% of cases). This asymmetry arises because modern AI systems generate equally persuasive explanations regardless of recommendation quality-physicians cannot distinguish helpful from misleading guidance. We show physicians treat explained AI as 15.2 percentage points more accurate than reality, with over-reliance persisting even for erroneous recommendations. Competent physicians with appropriate uncertainty suffer most from the AI transparency paradox (-12.4pp when AI errs), while overconfident novices benefit most (+9.9pp net). Welfare analysis reveals that selective transparency generates \$2.59 billion in annual healthcare value, 43% more than the \$1.82 billion from mandated universal transparency.</description>

Abstract: New methods are needed to monitor environmental treaties, like the Montreal Protocol, by reviewing large, complex customs datasets. This paper introduces a framework using unsupervised machine learning to systematically detect suspicious trade patterns and highlight activities for review. Our methodology, applied to 100,000 trade records, combines several ML techniques. Unsupervised Clustering (K-Means) discovers natural trade archetypes based on shipment value and weight. Anomaly Detection (Isolation Forest and IQR) identifies rare "mega-trades" and shipments with commercially unusual price-per-kilogram values. This is supplemented by Heuristic Flagging to find tactics like vague shipment descriptions. These layers are combined into a priority score, which successfully identified 1,351 price outliers and 1,288 high-priority shipments for customs review. A key finding is that high-priority commodities show a different and more valuable value-to-weight ratio than general goods. This was validated using Explainable AI (SHAP), which confirmed vague descriptions and high value as the most significant risk predictors. The model's sensitivity was validated by its detection of a massive spike in "mega-trades" in early 2021, correlating directly with the real-world regulatory impact of the US AIM Act. This work presents a repeatable unsupervised learning pipeline to turn raw trade data into prioritized, usable intelligence for regulatory groups.</description>

      <title>Does it take two to tango: Interaction between Credit Default Swaps and National Stock Indices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07887v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates both short and long-run interaction between BIST-100 index and CDS prices over January 2008 to May 2015 using ARDL technique. The paper documents several findings. First, ARDL analysis shows that 1 TL increase in CDS shrinks BIST-100 index by 22.5 TL in short-run and 85.5 TL in long-run. Second, 1000 TL increase in BIST index price causes 25 TL and 44 TL reducation in Turkey's CDS prices in short- and long-run respectively. Third, a percentage increase in interest rate shrinks BIST index by 359 TL and a percentage increase in inflation rate scales CDS prices up to 13.34 TL both in long-run. In case of short-run, these impacts are limited with 231 TL and 5.73 TL respectively. Fourth, a kurush increase in TL/USD exchange rate leads 24.5 TL (short-run) and 78 TL (long-run) reductions in BIST, while it augments CDS prices by 2.5 TL (short-run) and 3 TL (long-run) respectively. Fifth, each negative political events decreases BIST by 237 TL in short-run and 538 TL in long-run, while it increases CDS prices by 33 TL in short-run and 89 TL in long-run. These findings imply the highly dollar indebted capital structure of Turkish firms, and overly sensitivity of financial markets to the uncertainties in political sphere. Finally, the paper provides evidence for that BIST and CDS with control variables drift too far apart, and converge to a long-run equilibrium at a moderate monthly speed.</description>

      <title>Cabin Layout, Seat Density, and Passenger Segmentation in Air Transport: Implications for Prices, Ancillary Revenues, and Efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates how the layout and density of seats in aircraft cabins influence the pricing of airline tickets on domestic flights. The analysis is based on microdata from boarding passes linked to face-to-face interviews with passengers, allowing us to relate the price paid to the location on the aircraft seat map, as well as market characteristics and flight operations. Econometric models were estimated using the Post-Double-Selection LASSO (PDS-LASSO) procedure, which selects numerous controls for unobservable factors linked to commercial and operational aspects, thus enabling better identification of the effect of variables such as advance purchase, reason for travel, fuel price, market structure, and load factor, among others. The results suggest that a higher density of seat rows is associated with lower prices, reflecting economies of scale with the increase in aircraft size and gains in operational efficiency. An unexpected result was also obtained: in situations where there was no seat selection fee, passengers with more expensive tickets were often allocated middle seats due to purchasing at short notice, when the side alternatives were no longer available. This behavior helps explain the economic logic behind one of the main ancillary revenues of airlines. In addition to quantitative analysis, the study incorporates an exploratory approach to innovative cabin concepts and their possible effects on density and comfort on board.</description>

      <title>Measuring Computer Science Enthusiasm: A Questionnaire-Based Analysis of Age and Gender Effects on Students' Interest</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study offers new insights into students' interest in computer science (CS) education by disentangling the distinct effects of age and gender across a diverse adolescent sample. Grounded in the person-object theory of interest (POI), we conceptualize enthusiasm as a short-term, activating expression of interest that combines positive affect, perceived relevance, and intention to re-engage. Experiencing such enthusiasm can temporarily shift CS attitudes and strengthen future engagement intentions, making it a valuable lens for evaluating brief outreach activities. To capture these dynamics, we developed a theoretically grounded questionnaire for pre-post assessment of the enthusiasm potential of CS interventions. Using data from more than 400 students participating in online CS courses, we examined age- and gender-related patterns in enthusiasm. The findings challenge the prevailing belief that early exposure is the primary pathway to sustained interest in CS. Instead, we identify a marked decline in enthusiasm during early adolescence, particularly among girls, alongside substantial variability in interest trajectories across age groups. Crucially, our analyses reveal that age is a more decisive factor than gender in shaping interest development and uncover key developmental breakpoints. Despite starting with lower baseline attitudes, older students showed the largest positive changes following the intervention, suggesting that well-designed short activities can effectively re-activate interest even at later ages. Overall, the study highlights the need for a dynamic, age-sensitive framework for CS education in which instructional strategies are aligned with developmental trajectories.</description>

      <title>Using firm-level supply chain networks to measure the speed of the energy transition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01572v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While many national and international climate policies clearly outline decarbonization targets and the timelines for achieving them, there is a notable lack of effort to objectively monitor progress. A significant share of the transition from fossil fuels to low-carbon energy will be borne by industry and the economy, requiring both the decarbonization of the electricity sector and the electrification of industrial processes. But how quickly are firms adopting low-carbon electricity? Using a unique dataset on Hungary's national supply chain network, we analyze the energy portfolios of 25,000 firms, covering more than 75% of gas, 70% of electricity, and 50% of oil consumption between 2020 and 2024. This enables us to objectively measure the trends of decarbonization efforts at the firm level. Although almost half of firms have increased their share of low-carbon electricity, more than half have reduced it. Extrapolating the observed trends, we find a transition of only 20% of total energy consumption to low-carbon electricity by 2050. The current speed of transition in the economy is not sufficient to reach climate neutrality by 2050. However, if firms would adopt the same efforts as the decarbonization frontrunners in their industry, a low-carbon share of up to 70% could be reached, putting climate targets within reach. We examine several firm characteristics that differentiate transitioning from non-transitioning firms. Our results are consistent with a 'lock-in' effect, whereby firms with a high share of fossil fuel costs relative to revenue are less likely to transition.</description>

      <title>The Economic Impact of Low- and High-Frequency Temperature Changes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08950v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Temperature variations at different frequencies may have distinct impacts on economic outcomes. We first explore ways to estimate the low- and high-frequency components in a U.S. panel of 48 states. All methods suggest slowly evolving low-frequency components of temperature at the state level, and that they share a common factor which covaries with the low-frequency component of economic activity. While we fail to find a statistically significant impact of low-frequency temperature changes on U.S. growth, an international panel of 50 countries suggests that a 1{\deg}C increase in the low-frequency component will reduce economic growth by about one percent in the long run. The linear effect of the high-frequency component is not well determined in all panels, but there is evidence of a non-linear effect in the international panel. The findings are corroborated by time series estimation using data at the unit and national levels. Our empirical work pays attention to distortions that may arise from using one-way clustered errors for inference, and to the possible inadequacy of the additive fixed effect specification in controlling for common time effects.</description>

      <title>Assessing the potential impact of environmental land management schemes on emergent infection disease risks</title>

Abstract: Financial incentives encourage the plantation of new woodland to increase habitat, biodiversity, carbon sequestration, as a contribution to meeting climate change and biodiversity conservation targets. Whilst these are largely positive effects, it is worth considering that this expansion of woodland can lead to increased presence of wildlife species in proximity to agricultural holdings that may pose an enhanced risk of disease transmission between wildlife and livestock. Wildlife and the provision of a reservoir for infectious disease is particularly important in the transmission dynamics of bovine tuberculosis, the case studied here.
  In this paper we develop an economic model for predicting changes in land use resulting from subsidies for woodland planting. We use this to assess the consequent impact on wild deer populations in the newly created woodland areas, and thus the emergent infectious disease risk arising from the proximity of new and existing wild deer populations and existing cattle holdings.
  We consider an area in the South-West of Scotland, having existing woodland, deer populations, and extensive and diverse cattle farm holdings. In this area we find that, with a varying level of subsidy and plausible new woodland creation scenarios, the contact risk between areas of wild deer and cattle increases between 26% and 35% over the risk present with a zero subsidy.
  This provides a foundation for extending to larger regions and for examining potential risk mitigation strategies, for example the targeting of subsidy in low disease risk areas, or provisioning for buffer zones between woodland and agricultural holdings.</description>

      <title>Left Leaning Models: How AI Evaluates Economic Policy?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15771v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Would artificial intelligence (AI) cut interest rates or adopt conservative monetary policy? Would it deregulate or opt for a more controlled economy? As AI use by economic policymakers, academics, and market participants grows exponentially, it is becoming critical to understand AI preferences over economic policy. However, these preferences are not yet systematically evaluated and remain a black box. This paper makes a conjoint experiment on leading large language models (LLMs) from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google, asking them to evaluate economic policy under multi-factor constraints. The results are remarkably consistent across models: most LLMs exhibit a strong preference for high growth, low unemployment, and low inequality over traditional macroeconomic concerns such as low inflation and low public debt. Scenario-specific experiments show that LLMs are sensitive to context but still display strong preferences for low unemployment and low inequality even in monetary-policy settings. Numerical sensitivity tests reveal intuitive responses to quantitative changes but also uncover non-linear patterns such as loss aversion.</description>
