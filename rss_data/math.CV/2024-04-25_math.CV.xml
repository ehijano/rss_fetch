      <title>Toeplitz Operators on Weighted Bergman Spaces over Tubular Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we mainly study the necessary and sufficient conditions for the boundedness and compactness of Toeplitz operators on weighted Bergman spaces over a tubular domains by using the Carlson measures on tubular domains. We also give some related results about Carlson measures.</description>

      <title>Hardy decomposition of higher order Lipschitz classes by polymonogenic functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we find a decomposition of higher order Lipschitz functions into the traces of a polymonogenic function and solve a related Riemann-Hilbert problem. Our approach lies in using a cliffordian Cauchy-type operator, which behaves as an involution operator on higher order Lipschitz spaces. The result obtained is a multidimensional sharpened version of the Hardy decomposition of H\"older continuous functions on a simple closed curve in the complex plane.</description>

      <title>On CR maps between hyperquadrics and Winkelmann hypersurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study CR maps between hyperquadrics and Winkelmann hypersurfaces. Based on a previous study on the CR Ahlfors derivative of Lamel-Son and a recent result of Huang-Lu-Tang-Xiao on CR maps between hyperquadrics, we prove that a transversal CR map from a hyperquadric into a hyperquadric or a Winkelmann hypersurface extends to a local holomorphic isometric embedding with respect to certain K\"ahler metrics if and only if the Hermitian part of its CR Ahlfors derivative vanishes on an open set of the source. Our proof is based on relating the geometric rank of a CR map into a hyperquadric and its CR Ahlfors derivative.</description>

      <title>On Finite Parts of Divergent Complex Geometric Integrals and Their Dependence on a Choice of Hermitian Metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.07417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.07417v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a reduced complex space of pure dimension. We consider divergent integrals of certain forms on $X$ that are singular along a subvariety defined by the zero set of a holomorphic section of some holomorphic vector bundle $E \rightarrow X$. Given a choice of Hermitian metric on $E$ we define a finite part of the divergent integral. Our main result is an explicit formula for the dependence on the choice of metric of the finite part.</description>

      <title>New examples of $2$-nondegenerate real hypersurfaces in $\mathbb{C}^N$ with arbitrary nilpotent symbols</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.00619v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a class of uniformly $2$-nondegenerate CR hypersurfaces in $\mathbb{C}^N$, for $N&gt;3$, having a rank $1$ Levi kernel. The class is first of all remarkable by the fact that for every $N&gt;3$ it forms an {\em explicit} infinite-dimensional family of everywhere $2$-nondegenerate hypersurfaces. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first such construction. Besides, the class an infinite-dimensional family of non-equivalent structures having a given constant nilpotent CR symbol for every such symbol. Using methods that are able to handle all cases with $N&gt;5$ simultaneously, we solve the equivalence problem for the considered structures whose symbol is represented by a single Jordan block, classify their algebras of infinitesimal symmetries, and classify the locally homogeneous structures among them. We show that the remaining considered structures, which have symbols represented by a direct sum of Jordan blocks, can be constructed from the single block structures through simple linking and extension processes.</description>

      <title>Manifolds with trivial Chern classes II: Manifolds Isogenous to a Torus Product, coframed Manifolds and a question by Baldassarri</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.11751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.11751v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by a general question addressed by Mario Baldassarri in 1956, we discuss characterizations of the Pseudo-Abelian Varieties introduced by Roth, and we introduce a first new notion, of Manifolds Isogenous to a k-Torus Product: the latter have the last k Chern classes trivial in rational cohomology and vanishing Chern numbers. We show that in dimension 2 the latter class is the correct substitute for some incorrect assertions by Enriques, Dantoni, Roth and Baldassarri: these are the surfaces with $K_X$ nef and $c_2(X)=0 \in H^4(X, \mathbb{Z})$. We observe in the last section, using a construction by Chad Schoen, that such a simple similar picture does not hold in higher dimension. We discuss then, as a class of solutions to Baldassarri's question, manifolds isogenous to projective (respectively: K\"ahler) manifolds whose tangent bundle or whose cotangent bundle has a trivial subbundle of positive rank. We see that the class of `partially framed' projective manifolds (that is, whose tangent bundle has a trivial subbundle) consists, in the case where $K_X$ is nef, of the Pseudo-Abelian varieties of Roth; while the class of `partially co-framed' projective manifolds is not yet fully understood in spite of the new results that we are able to show here: and we formulate some open questions and conjectures. In the course of the paper we address also the case of more general compact complex Manifolds, introducing the new notions of suspensions over parallelizable Manifolds, of twisted hyperelliptic Manifolds, and we describe the known results under the K\"ahler assumption.</description>
