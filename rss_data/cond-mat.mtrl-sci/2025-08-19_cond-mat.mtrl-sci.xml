      <title>The Rise of Generative AI for Metal-Organic Framework Design and Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advances in generative artificial intelligence are transforming how metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are designed and discovered. This Perspective introduces the shift from laborious enumeration of MOF candidates to generative approaches that can autonomously propose and synthesize in the laboratory new porous reticular structures on demand. We outline the progress of employing deep learning models, such as variational autoencoders, diffusion models, and large language model-based agents, that are fueled by the growing amount of available data from the MOF community and suggest novel crystalline materials designs. These generative tools can be combined with high-throughput computational screening and even automated experiments to form accelerated, closed-loop discovery pipelines. The result is a new paradigm for reticular chemistry in which AI algorithms more efficiently direct the search for high-performance MOF materials for clean air and energy applications. Finally, we highlight remaining challenges such as synthetic feasibility, dataset diversity, and the need for further integration of domain knowledge.</description>

      <title>Magnetic and Mossbauer studies of Ca$_x$Zn$_{1-x}$Fe$_2$O$_4$ nanoferrites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A one-step synthesis of Ca$_x$Zn$_{1-x}$Fe$_2$O$_4$ (x=0, 0.5 and 1) nanoferrites and nanocomposites by the glycol-thermal method is reported. The structural, morphological and magnetic properties were studied using XRD, HRTEM, HRSEM, Mossbauer spectroscopy and VSM. The XRD patterns show a single phase cubic spinel structure for x=0. A composite phase of a spinel and hematite-like structure was observed for x=0.5, and for x=1, CaFe$_2$O$_4$ has the same structure as hematite. The superparamagnetic nature of the samples was confirmed from the Mossbauer and magnetization results.</description>

      <title>Synthesis and Characterization of Mg doped ZnFe$_2$O$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-phase Mg-doped ZnFe$_2$O$_4$ nanoparticles with x= 0, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7 have been prepared by the glycol-thermal method without any subsequent calcination. The crystallite size, microstructure and magnetic properties of the prepared nanoparticles were studied using X-ray diffraction (XRD), high resolution scanning electron microscope (TEM), Mossbauer spectroscopy and vibrating sample magnetometer at room temperature. The XRD results revealed the production of a sharp single cubic spinel structure in all the synthesized samples without any impurity peak with the average crystallite size of about 19-28 nm. It was noticed that the lattice parameter varies as the Mg$^{2+}$ ion concentration increases. 57 Mossbauer measurement showed that the nano ferrites exhibit ferrimagnetic and superparamagnetic states. Magnetization measurements confirmed the superparamagnetic behaviour of the samples. The highest coercivity and saturation magnetization were observed at x=0.3. The saturation magnetization (MS) decreases while coercivity (HC) varies with an increase in the concentration of Mg$^{2+}$ ion.</description>

      <title>Towards Capacitive In-Memory-computing: A perspective on the future of AI hardware</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quest for energy-efficient, scalable neuromorphic computing has elevated compute-in-memory (CIM) architectures to the forefront of hardware innovation. While memristive memories have been extensively explored for synaptic implementation in CIM architectures, their inherent limitations, including static power dissipation, sneak-path currents, and interconnect voltage drops, pose significant challenges for large-scale deployment, particularly at advanced technology nodes. In contrast, capacitive memories offer a compelling alternative by enabling charge-domain computation with virtually zero static power loss, intrinsic immunity to sneak paths, and simplified selector-less crossbar operation, while offering superior compatibility with 3D Back-end-of-Line (BEOL) integration. This perspective highlights the architectural and device-level advantages of emerging non-volatile capacitive synapses. We examine how material engineering and interface control can modulate synaptic behavior, capacitive memory window and multilevel analog storage potential. Furthermore, we explore critical system-level trade-offs involving device-to-device variation, charge transfer noise, dynamic range, and effective analog resolution.</description>

      <title>Numerical Simulation of Lead-Free Absorbers in 2D Dion-Jacobson Phase Perovskite Solar Cells Using SCAPS-1D: Towards 41% Efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid advancement of photovoltaic science, there has been an increasing focus on the development of environment-friendly and structurally advanced perovskite solar cells (PSCs). In this context, this study investigates an architectural configuration employing 2D Dion-Jacobson phase perovskites as both electron and hole transport layers within a 2D/absorber/2D structure. The primary objective is to identify optimal absorber materials and enhance the overall efficiency of the device. While the reduction of lead content remains a significant challenge in PSC development, the present work focuses on the evaluation of seven lead-free absorber materials: MASnBr3, Sr3PI3/Sr3SbI3, p-CuBi2O4, p-Si, CH3NH3SnI3, Sb2Se3, and CZTSSe. These materials were assessed in the context of an FTO/PeDAMA8Pb6I19/IDL1/absorber/IDL2/PeDAMA2Pb3I10/C architecture utilizing SCAPS-1D simulation software. The study includes a comprehensive analysis of band alignment, pre-optimization screening, and performance optimization through the adjustment of absorber thickness, doping levels, and defect densities. Additionally, the temperature sensitivity and the substitution of the FTO layer with ITO, IZO, and MZO were also investigated. The simulation results indicated that Sb2Se3 and CZTSSe achieved the highest efficiencies of 41.00% and 41.19%, respectively. Furthermore, MZO was identified as a strong candidate for replacing FTO, maintaining consistent performance across all absorber types analyzed. Overall, this study provides a comparative framework for the material selection within layered PSC architectures and significantly contributes to the advancement of stable, efficient, and lead-free photovoltaic technologies.</description>

      <title>A Haldane-Anderson Hamiltonian Model for Hyperthermal Hydrogen Scattering from a Semiconductor Surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collisions of atoms and molecules with metal surfaces create electronic excitations in the metal, leading to nonadiabatic energy dissipation, inelastic scattering, and sticking. Mixed quantum-classical molecular dynamics simulation methods, such as molecular dynamics with electronic friction, are able to capture nonadiabatic energy loss during dynamics at metal surfaces. Hydrogen atom scattering on semiconductors, on the other hand, exhibits strong adsorbate-surface energy transfer only when the projectile kinetic energy exceeds the bandgap of the substrate. Electronic friction fails to describe this effect. Here, we report a first-principles parameterization of a simple Haldane-Anderson Hamiltonian model of hydrogen atom gas-surface scattering on $c(2\times8)$Ge(111), for which hyperthermal scattering experiments have been reported. We subsequently perform independent electron surface hopping and Ehrenfest dynamics simulations on this model. Whereas mean-field dynamics yield weak nonadiabatic energy loss that is independent of the initial kinetic energy, independent electron surface hopping simulations qualitatively agree with the experimental observation that nonadiabatic energy dissipation only occurs if the initial kinetic energy exceeds the bandgap of the surface. We further show how nonadiabatic energy loss affects sticking, which is yet to be experimentally measured.</description>

      <title>Expanding the search space of high entropy oxides and predicting synthesizability using machine learning interatomic potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an efficient computational methodology for predicting the synthesizability of high entropy oxides (HEOs) in a large space of possible candidate compounds. HEOs are a growing field with an enormous potential chemical composition space, and yet the discovery of new HEOs is slow and driven by experimental trial-and-error. In this work, we attempt to speed up this process by using a machine learned interatomic potential offering DFT-level accuracy. Our methodology starts by identifying a set of crystal structures and elements for screening, building a large random unit cell of each composition and structure, then relaxing this structure. The most promising candidates are distinguished based on the variance of the individual cation energies, which we introduce as our entropy descriptor, and the enthalpy of mixing, which is used as the enthalpy descriptor. The approach is applied to tetravalent HEOs, and its validity is confirmed by comparison to alternative descriptors and DFT calculations for a set of 7 elements. The search is then extended to a set of 14 elements and three crystal structures, where it successfully identifies the only known stable 4-component HEO in the $\alpha$-PbO$_2$ structure, as well as predicting several new 5-component candidate systems. This approach can straightforwardly be applied to new sets of elements and structures, allowing for the accelerated discovery of new HEOs.</description>

      <title>Dislocation-mediated short-range order evolution during thermomechanical processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermomechanical processing alters the microstructure of metallic alloys through coupled plastic deformation and thermal exposure, with dislocation motion driving plasticity and microstructural evolution. Our previous work showed that the same dislocation motion both creates and destroys chemical short-range order (SRO), driving alloys into far-from-equilibrium SRO states. However, the connection between this dislocation-mediated SRO evolution and processing parameters remains largely unexplored. Here, we perform large-scale atomistic simulations of thermomechanical processing of equiatomic TiTaVW to determine how temperature and strain rate control SRO via competing creation ($\Gamma$) and annihilation ($\lambda$) rates. Using machine learning interatomic potentials and information-theoretic metrics, we quantify that the magnitude and chemical character of SRO vary systematically with these parameters. We identify two regimes: a low-temperature regime with weak strain-rate sensitivity, and a high-temperature regime in which reduced dislocation density and increased screw character amplify chemical bias and accelerate SRO formation. The resulting steady-state SRO is far-from-equilibrium and cannot be produced by equilibrium thermal annealing. Together, these results provide a mechanistic and predictive link between processing parameters, dislocation physics, and SRO evolution in chemically complex alloys.</description>

      <title>Overcoming Quantum Resistivity Scaling in Nanoscale Interconnects Using Delafossite PdCoO2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continued scaling into the sub 7 nm regime exacerbates quantum limited resistivity in Cu interconnects. We evaluated layered PdCoO2 and explicitly benchmarked it against Cu to identify mechanisms that maintain conductivity under confinement. Using a momentum resolved relaxation time formalism derived from the conductivity tensor, we link k and energy resolved velocities, life times, and mean free paths (MFPs) to thickness dependent resistivity for films and wires. PdCoO2 exhibits quasi 2D transport with high inplane velocities and strongly anisotropic MFPs (15 nm inplane, 3 nm outofplane near EF), whereas Cu shows an isotropic 22 nm MFP. Under identical boundary conditions including a realistic 2 nm liner/diffusion barrier for Cu, PdCoO2 displays suppressed boundary scattering and a much slower resistivity increase from bulk down to sub 30 nm, preserving near bulk conductivity and remaining viable at 2 nm. Thickness trends reveal dual slope changes in PdCoO2 (35 nm and 7 nm) set by anisotropic MFPs, contrasting with the single characteristic scale of Cu (40 nm). The calculated bulk values and scaling curves track available measurements for both materials. These results establish PdCoO2 as a scalable interconnect that outperforms Cu under quantum confinement and provide a quantitative framework to screen layered conductors for next generation nanoelectronic interconnects.</description>

      <title>Deterministic N'eel vector switching of altermagnets via magnetic multipole torque</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnets have recently emerged as promising materials for next-generation spintronic devices. For their device applications, realizing a single-domain configuration is essential but remains challenging. We theoretically consider injecting magnetic multipoles into altermagnets, which can be achieved by applying an in-plane current to an altermagnet/normal metal bilayer. We demonstrate for $d$-wave altermagnets that the torque generated by the magnetic octupole injection can achieve magnetic-field-free deterministic switching of the altermagnets' N\'eel vector and transform their multidomain configurations into a single domain. This method allows the switching in diverse altermagnets, thereby facilitating their device applications and fundamental studies. This work also exemplifies the usefulness of magnetic multipole currents.</description>

      <title>Unlocking reversible and nonvolatile anomalous valley Hall control through multiferroic van der Waals heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving external control over the anomalous valley Hall (AVH) effect is essential for advancing valleytronic applications. However, many of the existing approaches suffer from limitations such as irreversibility or volatility. In this work, we propose a general strategy for enabling nonvolatile electrical tuning of the AVH effect by utilizing multiferroic van der Waals heterostructures. Using first-principles density functional theory calculations, we demonstrate that a heterostructure composed of a ferromagnetic monolayer VSSe and a ferroelectric monolayer Al$_2$S$_3$ permits fine control of valley transport properties. The AVH response in VSSe can be reversibly and nonvolatility switched by reversing the polarization of Al$_2$S$_3$ via an applied electric field. This ferroelectric mechanism ensures a stable valley state even without continuous energy input. Furthermore, the valley polarization can also be inverted through the same polarization switching process, providing a dual degree of control over valley-dependent phenomena. These findings establish a promising pathway toward intrinsically switchable and energy-efficient valleytronic devices.</description>

      <title>Evidence for single variant in altermagnetic RuO2(101) thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnetism presents intriguing possibilities for spintronic devices due to its unique combination of strong spin-splitting and zero net magnetization. However, realizing its full potential hinges on fabricating single-variant altermagnetic thin films. In this work, we present definitive evidence for the formation of single-variant altermagnetic RuO2(101) thin films with fully epitaxial growth on Al2O3(1-102) r-plane substrates, confirmed through rigorous structural analyses using X-ray diffraction, atomic-resolution transmission electron microscopy and X-ray magnetic linear dichroism. The mutual correspondence of the occupancy of oxygen atoms on the surfaces of RuO2(101)[010] and Al2O3(1-102)[11-20] plays a decisive role in the formation of the single-variant RuO2, which is also supported by our first-principles density functional theory calculations. We further observed spin-splitting magnetoresistance in the single-variant RuO2(101)/CoFeB bilayers, highlighting the characteristic effect of single variant on spin transport. The demonstration of single-variant RuO2(101) films marks a significant advancement in the field of altermagnetism and paves the way for exploring their potential applications.</description>

      <title>Large-scale cooperative sulfur vacancy dynamics in two-dimensional MoS2 from machine learning interatomic potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The formation of extended sulfur vacancies in MoS2 monolayers is closely associated with catalytic activity and may also be the basis for its memristive behavior. Nanosecond-scale molecular dynamics simulations using machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) reveal key mechanisms of cooperative vacancy transport, including incorporation of vacancies into clusters of arbitrary size. The simulations provide a coherent atomistic explanation for irradiation-induced vacancy patterns observed experimentally, especially the formation of line defects spanning tens of nanometers. Results and performance are compared of two MLIP frameworks: (i) on-the-fly learning with Gaussian approximation potential, and (ii) fine-tuning of an equivariant foundation model.</description>

      <title>Elementary Monte Carlo model of the anisotropic recrystallization and antiripening under intensive stirring and high supersaturations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Known method of fibrous oxides production (first of all, V2O5) by intensive stirring in water is treated in the frame of driven systems approach developed in 80s by Georges Martin et al for systems under irradiation or severe plastic deformation. Instead of ballistic diffusion, the ballistic detachments of atoms from the oxide surface under stirring are introduced. Simplified Monte Carlo scheme is suggested for crystal evolution within TLK model, taking into account anisotropy and additional athermal detachment probabilities. Individual cluster in limited volume becomes elongated in steady-state or dissolve. For the ensemble of clusters, the number is decreasing (as in common ripening), but the mean length of fibers grows, as well as the total surface energy (contrary to common ripening).</description>

      <title>Extraction of the self energy and Eliashberg function from angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy using the \textsc{xARPES} code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy is a powerful experimental technique for studying anisotropic many-body interactions through the electron spectral function. Existing attempts to decompose the spectral function into non-interacting dispersions and electron-phonon, electron-electron, and electron-impurity self-energies rely on linearization of the bands and manual assignment of self-energy magnitudes. Here, we show how self-energies can be extracted consistently for curved dispersions. We extend the maximum-entropy method to Eliashberg-function extraction with Bayesian inference, optimizing the parameters describing the dispersions and the magnitudes of electron-electron and electron-impurity interactions. We compare these novel methodologies with state-of-the-art approaches on model data, then demonstrate their applicability with two high-quality experimental data sets. With the first set, we identify the phonon modes of a two-dimensional electron liquid on TiO$_2$-terminated SrTiO$_3$. With the second set, we obtain unprecedented agreement between two Eliashberg functions of Li-doped graphene extracted from separate dispersions. We release these functionalities in the novel Python code \textsc{xARPES}.</description>

      <title>Atomistic mechanisms of phase transitions in all-temperature barocaloric material KPF$_6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional barocaloric materials typically exhibit limited operating temperature ranges. In contrast, KPF$_6$ has recently been reported to achieve an exceptional all-temperature barocaloric effect (BCE) via pressure-driven phase transitions. Here, we elucidate the atomistic mechanisms underlying the phase transitions through first-principles calculations and machine-learning potential accelerated molecular dynamics simulations. We identify four distinct phases: the room-temperature cubic (C) plastic crystal characterized by strong fluorine orientational disorder (FOD) and anharmonicity, the intermediate-temperature monoclinic (M-II) phase with decreasing FOD, the low-temperature monoclinic (M-I) phase with suppressed FOD, and the fully ordered rhombohedral (R) phase under pressure. Phonon calculations confirm the dynamic stability of the M-II, M-I, and R phases at 0 K, whereas the C phase requires thermal fluctuations for stabilization. Under pressure, all the C, M-II, and M-I phases transform to the R phase, which are driven by cooperative PF$_6$ octahedral rotations coupled with lattice modulations. These pressure-induced phase transitions result in persistent isothermal entropy changes across a wide temperature range, thereby explaining the experimentally observed all-temperature BCE in this material. Hybrid functional calculations reveal wide-bandgap insulating behavior across all phases. This work deciphers the interplay between FOD, anharmonicity, and phase transitions in KPF$_6$, providing important insights for the design of BCE materials with broad operational temperature spans.</description>

      <title>Observation of relativistic domain wall motion in amorphous ferrimagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Domain walls in magnetic materials are sine-Gordon solitons characterized by relativistic kinematics, with the maximum spin-wave group velocity setting a limit for the domain wall speed and hence the highest operation frequency of magnetic devices. This relativistic regime has been observed only in crystalline iron-garnet ferrimagnets but is in general expected in many magnetic materials. In particular, amorphous rare-earth -- transition metal ferrimagnets should exhibit relativistic effects because of their ultrafast magnetic dynamics. However, no evidence for these effects has been reported in these technologically relevant materials. Here, we show that the relativistic regime can be attained in easy-to-engineer amorphous ferrimagnetic alloys. In GdFeCo we observe a saturation of the current-induced domain wall velocity that is indicative of a maximum spin-wave speed of the order of 2 km/s. Our observations indicate that relativistic dynamics are not exclusive to ferrimagnetic garnets but also exist in rare-earth -- transition-metal ferrimagnets, which provide a robust material platform for future magnetic devices operating at the ultimate speed limit.</description>

      <title>Piezomagnetism-driven magnetoelectric coupling in altermagnetic multiferroic K3Cr2F7</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ferroelectric control of altermagnetism in momentum space has been studied widely, while the control of magnetism in real space of altermagnets are still rare. We present a design rule to identify multiferroicity in n=2 Ruddlesden-Popper halides. Our results show that a Jahn-Teller distortion can cooperate with oxygen octahedral rotations to break inversion symmetry, which we demonstrate in K3Cr2F7 and cation-ordered KAg2Cu2Cl7, and leads to a ferrielectric-to-ferroelectric phase transition in K3Cr2F7. Altermagnetic spin order in the ferrielectric phase of K3Cr2F7 transforms into a conventional antiferromagnetic order in the ferroelectric phase, at which strain/pressure engineered sizable changes of weak ferromagnetism can occur. Our study is not only conducive to realize strong magnetoelectric coupling in multiferroics, but also reveals more functionalities in altermagnetic materials.</description>

      <title>A first-principles theoretical study on two-dimensional MX and MX$_2$ metal halides: bandgap engineering, magnetism, and catalytic descriptors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metal halides, particularly MX and MX$_2$ compounds (where M represents metal elements and X = F, Cl, Br, I), have attracted significant interest due to their diverse electronic and optoelectronic properties. However, a comprehensive understanding of their structural and electronic behavior, particularly the evolution of these properties from bulk to low-dimensional forms, remains limited. To address this gap, we performed first-principles calculations to develop a database of 60 MX and MX$_2$ metal halides, detailing their structural and electronic properties in both bulk and slab configurations. Calculations were performed using the advanced \texttt{HSE06-D3} hybrid functional for density functional theory (DFT), ensuring high precision in predicting material properties despite the associated computational cost. The results reveal that these materials are predominantly semiconductors, but their bandgaps range from 0 to 9 eV. A detailed analysis of the transition from bulk to slab structures highlights notable shifts in electronic properties, including bandgap modifications. Upon dimensional reduction, 9 materials exhibit an indirect-to-direct bandgap transition, enhancing their potential for energy conversion. Beyond structural dimensionality, the influence of chemical composition on bandgap variations was also examined. To further assess their practical applicability, the catalytic and magnetic properties of these metal halides were systematically evaluated. These findings not only illuminate previously underexplored MX and MX$_2$ metal halides but also identify promising candidates for electronic, optoelectronic, catalytic and spintronic applications. This database serves as a valuable resource for guiding future research and technology development in low-dimensional materials.</description>

      <title>Fine-Tuning Hydrophilic-Hydrophobic Balance in Stimuli-Responsive PEGPNIPAM Micelles for Controlled Drug Delivery</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Temperature-responsive polymeric micelles have great potential in drug delivery, enhancing therapeutic efficacy while minimizing systemic toxicity. This study investigates the self-assembly of poly(ethylene glycol)-poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PEG-PNIPAM) block copolymers as nanocarriers for Doxorubicin (DOX) using coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CG-MD) simulations. We systematically examined the effects of polymer chain length and hydrophilic/hydrophobic balance on micelle formation, stability, and drug encapsulation efficiency. PEG-PNIPAM copolymers self-assembled above the lower critical solution temperature (LCST), forming stable micelles with varying morphologies. Our findings revealed that PEG enhances micelle hydration and stability, while PNIPAM improves drug retention but may hinder controlled release. Increasing PNIPAM or PEG length significantly increased micelle size, with DOX preferentially localizing in the PEG-rich outer shell, enhancing solubility and preventing aggregation. The DOX diffusion coefficient ranged from $10^{-8}$ to $10^{-9}$ cm$^{2}$s$^{-1}$, reflecting drug release dynamics. Structural and thermodynamic analyses confirmed spontaneous DOX encapsulation, with PEG-PNIPAM micelles providing a favorable environment for drug loading. Mean square displacement (MSD), radial distribution function (RDF), and solvent-accessible surface area (SASA) analyses highlighted the role of PEG in controlled drug release and PNIPAM in drug binding. These molecular-level insights underscore the potential of fine-tuning PEG-PNIPAM compositions for enhanced drug delivery, paving the way for precision cancer therapies.</description>

      <title>Visible-Light Photocatalytic Degradation of Cresols using Sustainable 3D-Printed Bi4O5I2-Hematite Scaffold</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In photocatalysis, the reusability limit of catalysts can contribute to secondary pollution, posing ecological risks. Addressing this, the present study explores the integration of additive manufacturing with photocatalysis by decorating Bi$_4$O$_5$I$_2$ onto a 3D-printed hematite scaffold (Bi$_4$O$_5$I$_2$@3DH) for the degradation of cresols. The 3D-printed hematite grid, fabricated via direct ink writing, exhibited excellent rheological behavior ($\tau\gamma = 24$ Pa), allowing precise shape retention. The sintered Bi$_4$O$_5$I$_2$ was subsequently immobilized via a facile dip-coating method. Under optimized conditions, the composite achieved 99.78\% degradation of 20 mg/L p-cresol within 240 min of irradiation. Notably, hematite served as a porous substrate and contributed to photocatalytic activity. Density functional theory simulations with Hubbard correction (DFT+U) indicated an interfacial charge transfer of approximately -0.9 electrons from hematite to Bi$_4$O$_5$I$_2$, confirming a S-scheme heterojunction between hematite and Bi$_4$O$_5$I$_2$ semiconductors, validating experimental observations. The composite demonstrated strong performance across varied water matrices and in the presence of other cresol isomers. It also retained 84.28\% degradation efficiency after 10 cycles, with negligible catalyst leaching. Furthermore, in vitro and in silico ecotoxicity analyses revealed reduced toxicity of the degradation products. The current work presents a novel and scalable strategy, advancing the use of earth-abundant hematite minerals in sustainable environmental remediation.</description>

      <title>"DIVE" into Hydrogen Storage Materials Discovery with AI Agents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13251v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data-driven artificial intelligence (AI) approaches are fundamentally transforming the discovery of new materials. Despite the unprecedented availability of materials data in the scientific literature, much of this information remains trapped in unstructured figures and tables, hindering the construction of large language model (LLM)-based AI agent for automated materials design. Here, we present the Descriptive Interpretation of Visual Expression (DIVE) multi-agent workflow, which systematically reads and organizes experimental data from graphical elements in scientific literatures. We focus on solid-state hydrogen storage materials-a class of materials central to future clean-energy technologies and demonstrate that DIVE markedly improves the accuracy and coverage of data extraction compared to the direct extraction by multimodal models, with gains of 10-15% over commercial models and over 30% relative to open-source models. Building on a curated database of over 30,000 entries from 4,000 publications, we establish a rapid inverse design workflow capable of identifying previously unreported hydrogen storage compositions in two minutes. The proposed AI workflow and agent design are broadly transferable across diverse materials, providing a paradigm for AI-driven materials discovery.</description>

      <title>Persistence of charge density wave fluctuations in the absence of long-range order in a hole-doped kagome metal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The kagome metals $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ ($A$ = K, Rb, Cs) exhibit a complex interplay between charge density wave (CDW) order and superconductivity. In this study, we use ultrafast coherent phonon spectroscopy to probe the evolution of CDW order in hole-doped CsV$_3$Sb$_{5-x}$Sn$_x$ across a broad range of compositions ($0 \leq x \leq 0.68$). While thermodynamic and diffraction measurements show long-range CDW order vanishes above $x \approx 0.05$, we observe persistent signatures of CDW fluctuations up to the highest doping levels, with correlation times on the order of several picoseconds. These results indicate the presence of robust fluctuating charge order that survives well beyond the established CDW phase boundary. Furthermore, these fluctuations are enhanced near a doping-tuned quantum phase transition at $x^* \approx 0.15$, which coincides with a local minimum in the superconducting $T_\mathrm{c}$ double-dome. Additional measurements on Ti- and K-substituted samples confirm that this behavior is intrinsic to hole doping and not tied to disorder. Overall, our findings suggest that CDW fluctuations play a central role in the electronic phase diagram of $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ and may mediate or compete with superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Fiber bundle model of thermally activated creep failure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An equal load sharing fiber bundle model for thermally activated breakdown is developed using transition state theory to describe the rate of elementary failures. The lifetime distribution, average, variance and their asymptotic limits for uniform fiber failure thresholds are derived and found to be in excellent agreement with simulations. The asymptotic scaling with regards to the number of fibers matches analytical approximations in the low temperature limit derived by Roux and co-workers for a model of thermal breakdown by stationary Gaussian noise. For the case of randomly distributed fiber failure strengths, the lifetime distribution is derived as a multidimensional integral with no closed form solution. Simulations with different fiber strength distributions indicate that, in the limit of large fiber numbers, the statistics of bundle lifetimes shows a similar asymptotic scaling for distributed and for uniform thresholds. Fiber breakage by thermal activation occurs in avalanches triggered by individual thermally activated failure events, and the asymptotic avalanche size distribution obtained from the simulations matches earlier theoretical results derived for quasistatic loading.</description>

      <title>Towards Routine Condensed Phase Simulations with Delta-Learned Coupled Cluster Accuracy: Application to Liquid Water</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13391v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulating liquid water to an accuracy that matches its wealth of available experimental data requires both precise electronic structure methods and reliable sampling of nuclear (quantum) motion. This is challenging because applying the electronic structure method of choice - coupled cluster theory with single, double and perturbative triple excitations [CCSD(T)] - to condensed phase systems is currently limited by its computational cost and complexity. Recent tour-de-force efforts have demonstrated that this accuracy can indeed bring simulated liquid water into close agreement with experiment using machine learning potentials (MLPs). However, achieving this remains far from routine, requiring large datasets and significant computational cost. In this work, we introduce a practical approach that combines developments in MLPs with local correlation approximations to enable routine CCSD(T)-level simulations of liquid water. When combined with nuclear quantum effects, we achieve agreement to experiments for structural and transport properties. Crucially, this approach extends beyond constant volume to constant pressure simulations, allowing fundamental properties such as the density to now be predicted by MLP-based CCSD(T) models. Importantly, the approach also handles constant pressure simulations, enabling MLP-based CCSD(T) models to predict isothermal-isobaric bulk properties, such as water's density maximum in close agreement with experiment. Encompassing tests across electronic structure, datasets and MLP architecture, this work provides a practical blueprint towards routinely developing CCSD(T)-based MLPs for the condensed phase.</description>

      <title>Charge Ordering and Magnetic Exchange in the Ladder-Type Compound NH$_4$V$_2$O$_5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The low-temperature electronic and magnetic properties of NH$_4$V$_2$O$_5$, an isoelectronic analog of the spin-ladder compound $\alpha'$-NaV$_2$O$_5$, are investigated using DFT+$U$ calculations. Two charge-ordering patterns - zigzag and linear chains of V$^{4+}$/V$^{5+}$ ions - are considered. The zigzag configuration is found to be energetically preferred and exhibits insulating behavior with a band gap of 1.7 eV. In this state, magnetic V$^{4+}$ (d$^1$) ions form antiferromagnetically coupled spin chains. Calculated exchange interactions reveal strong diagonal (intrarung) and interladder couplings, indicating a complex spin-ladder network. These results suggest that NH$_4$V$_2$O$_5$ retains essential spin-ladder characteristics while displaying new structural and magnetic features arising from the larger size and non-spherical geometry of the NH$_4^+$ ion compared to Na$^+$.</description>

      <title>Unified description of spin-lattice coupling: application to thermodynamic properties of the pyrochlore Heisenberg antiferromagnet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13535v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an extended model to describe the spin-lattice coupling, incorporating individual vibrations of bonds and atomic sites alongside distance-dependent exchange interactions. The proposed spin Hamiltonian can be effectively considered as an interpolation between two well-established minimum models, the bond-phonon model and the site-phonon model. The extended model well reproduces successive field-induced phase transitions as well as the thermodynamic properties of a 3-up-1-down state in the pyrochlore-lattice Heisenberg antiferromagnet, including negative thermal expansion, an enhanced magnetocaloric effect, and a sharp specific-heat peak. Our approach is broadly applicable to various spin models, providing a framework for identifying the primary phonon modes responsible for spin-lattice coupling and for understanding complex magnetic phase diagrams.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The presence of phonon instabilities that leads to the formation of charge modulated states in kagome metals has allowed their classification based on the atomic displacements. Here, we use diffuse and inelastic x-ray scattering, backed by Monte Carlo simulations to describe a type-I instability in the kagome metal Yb$_{0.5}$Co$_3$Ge$_3$. We find that the in-plane distortion of Co in the kagome plane drives a structural transition with the appearance of new Bragg peaks at odd $L$, which are surrounded by a hexagonal diffuse signal. The anisotropic diffuse scattering, characteristic of a highly frustrated triangular lattice was simulated following a combination of Ising hamiltonian and Lennard-Jones potential, and demonstrate that the structural phase transition in Yb$_{0.5}$Co$_3$Ge$_3$ is of an order-disorder transformation type. The inelastic spectra reveals no softening but an anomalous broadening of the $\Gamma-A$ low energy acoustic mode. Our results highlight the critical role of the geometric frustration in promoting ordering from disorder in kagome lattices and power of diffuse scattering to disentangle the internal atomic displacements and correlated disorder.</description>

      <title>The properties of the nitrogen-vacancy center in milled chemical vapor deposition nanodiamonds</title>

Abstract: Fluorescent nanodiamonds (FNDs) containing negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV-) centers are vital for many emerging quantum sensing applications from magnetometry to intracellular sensing in biology. However, developing a scalable fabrication method for FNDs hosting color centers with consistent bulk-like photoluminescence (PL) and spin coherence properties remains a highly desired but unrealized goal. Here, we investigate optimized ball milling of single-crystal diamonds produced via chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and containing 2 ppm of substitutional nitrogen and 0.3 ppm of NV- to achieve this goal. The NV charge state, PL lifetime, and spin properties of bulk CVD diamond samples are directly compared to milled CVD FNDs and commercial high-pressure high-temperature (HPHT) FNDs. We find that on average, the relative contribution of the NV- charge state to the total NV PL is lower and the NV PL lifetime is longer in CVD FNDs compared to HPHT FNDs, both likely due to the lower Ns0 concentration in CVD FNDs. The CVD bulk and CVD FNDs on average show similar average T1 spin relaxation times of 3.2 $\pm$ 0.7 ms and 4.7 $\pm$ 1.6 ms, respectively, compared to 0.17 $\pm$ 0.01 ms for commercial HPHT FNDs. Our results demonstrate that ball milling of CVD diamonds enables the large-scale fabrication of NV ensembles in FNDs with bulk-like T1 spin relaxation properties.</description>

      <title>Uniform electron benchmark for the first-principles $GW_{0}$-Eliashberg theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the numerical behavior of the Eliashberg equations for phonon-mediated superconductivity, incorporating normal-state self-energy calculations within the consistent $GW_{0}$ approximation. We account for the full wavenumber and frequency dependences of both the screened Coulomb interaction and phonon-mediated attraction. We present results for the prototypical uniform electron gas system with model Einstein phonons at temperatures of a few kelvin. At extremely low temperatures, we efficiently execute the required convolutions of Green's functions and interactions in Matsubara frequency and wavenumber using intermediate representation and Fourier convolution techniques. In particular, we elucidate the interplay between electron-phonon $\omega$-mass and $k$-mass renormalizations of the electronic self-energy in determining the normal-state effective mass, spectral weight and the superconducting transition temperature. The electron density regimes where the plasmon effect enhances or suppresses the phonon-mediated superconductivity on top of the static Coulomb effect are revealed. We compare our comprehensive Eliashberg calculation results with those from density functional theory for superconductors, where the functionals have been constructed with reference to Eliashberg theory. Our model, methods, and results provide a valuable benchmark for first-principles superconducting calculations that treat screened Coulomb interaction effects non-empirically.</description>

      <title>Modification of adhesion between microparticles and engineered silicon surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13887v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A key challenge in performing experiments with microparticles is controlling their adhesion to substrates. For example, levitation of a microparticle initially resting on a surface requires overcoming the surface adhesion forces to deliver the microparticle into a mechanical potential acting as a trap. By engineering the surface of silicon substrates, we aim to decrease the adhesion force between a metallic microparticle and the silicon surface. To this end, we investigate different methods of surface engineering that are based on chemical, physical, or physio-chemical modifications of the surface of silicon. We give quantitative results on the detachment force, finding a correlation between the water contact angle and the mean detachment force, indicating that hydrophobic surfaces are desired for low microparticle adhesion. We develop surface preparations decreasing the mean detachment force by more than a factor of three, or the force at which 50% of particles move by more than a factor of six, the compared to an untreated silicon surface. Our results will enable reliable levitation of microparticles and are relevant for experiments requiring low adhesion between microparticles and a surface.</description>

      <title>Photoinduced Frustration Modulation in $\kappa$-type Quantum Spin Liquid Candidates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14034v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Geometric frustration is a key parameter controlling electronic and magnetic properties of quantum spin liquid systems, yet remains challenging to tune. Here, we coherently drive molecular vibrations with midinfrared pulses in two organic quantum spin liquid candidates, the insulating $\kappa$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$Cu$_2$(CN)$_3$ and the metallic $\kappa$-(BEDT-TTF)$_4$Hg$_{2.89}$Br$_8$, and probe their electronic response through ultrafast reflectivity measurements. We observe a nonlinear coupling between local molecular vibrations and nonlocal phonons, which is expected to directly modulate the geometric frustration of their triangular lattice. Our findings establish a promising route to dynamically control frustration in nonbipartite quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Emergence of spin-phonon coupling in a Gd-doped Y$_2$CoMnO$_6$ double perovskite oxide: a combined experimental and ab-initio study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02407v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present Raman spectroscopy results backed by first-principles calculations and investigate the nature of possible spin-phonon coupling (SPC) in a Gd-doped Y$_2$CoMnO$_6$ (YGCMO) double perovskite oxide. The influence of Gd substitution, A-site ordering, and anti-site disorder is also studied. YGCMO exhibits anti-site disorder leading to both ferromagnetic (between Co and Mn) and antiferromagnetic interactions (Co-Co, Mn-Mn, Gd-Co/Mn), making the SPC quite intriguing. An analysis of the temperature-dependent phonon frequencies for the stretching modes of YGCMO indicates that SPC here possibly emerges from the simultaneous presence of competing ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interactions. The SPC strength comes out to be 0.29 cm$^{-1}$. Our density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that Phonon modes shifted towards lower frequency with Gd doping. Similarly, A-site ordring and anti-site disorder significantly alter the Raman spectra. Experimental findings are also corroborated by first-principles DFT calculations, which indicate that anti-site disorder and Gd doping enhances SPC in YGCMO. This implies a strong influence of A-site cationic radii, and B-site (Co/Mn) ordering on SPC in the bulk double perovskite systems. The phonon dynamics of YGCMO are, therefore, correlated with magnetic ordering, indicating potential applications in spintronics devices.</description>

      <title>Origin of unexpected weak Gilbert damping in the LSMO/Pt bilayer system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01209v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study presents a first-principles and semiclassical analysis of the puzzling observation that a La$_{0.7}$Sr$_{0.3}$MnO$_3$ (LSMO) thin film exhibits larger Gilbert damping than an LSMO/Pt bilayer, contrary to conventional spin-pumping expectations. Density functional theory with Wannier interpolation yields an intrinsic damping of $\alpha_{\mathrm{int}}^{\mathrm{LSMO}}\!\approx\!1.4\times10^{-3}$, supporting an extrinsic origin of the high experimental value. Guided by the self-induced inverse spin Hall effect (ISHE) demonstrated in LSMO [Gupta et al., Phys.Rev. B 109, 014437 (2024)], we argue that the large spin Hall angle $|\theta_{\mathrm{SH}}|\simeq 0.093$ and low longitudinal conductivity of LSMO enable an efficient conversion of spin current to charge current boosting the effective damping. In the LSMO/Pt heterostructure the Pt cap shunts the charge current, raising $\sigma_{xx}$ and reducing the interfacial $|\theta_{\mathrm{SH}}|$ to~0.007. A Valet-Fert analysis for layer-resolved ab-initio spin accumulation gives the Pt spin-diffusion length and a non-negligible antidamping SOT coefficient, qualitatively accounting for the observed damping reduction under current bias. The seemingly anomalous damping hierarchy is thus reconciled without invoking additional interfacial mechanisms. The distinct length scales governing spin-pumping normalization, namely, the short absorption depth relevant to self-pumping in a single LSMO film versus the full magnetic thickness applicable to an LSMO/Pt bilayer, are crucial in this context. This observation suggests a practical design strategy: by simultaneously tuning the spin Hall-to-longitudinal conductivity ratio and the spin-diffusion length, one can engineer heterostructures with minimized magnetic losses for spin-orbitronics applications.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of a compressible lattice gas crystal: Generalized Gibbs-Duhem equation and adsorption</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05117v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Compressible lattice gas models are used in material science to understand the coupling between composition and strain in alloys. The seminal work in this field is the 1973 Larch\'{e}-Cahn paper (Acta Metall. 21, 1051-1063). Single-phase crystals in Larch\'{e}-Cahn theory are stable under open constant pressure, constant temperature conditions. The Gibbs free energy does not have to match the product $\mu N$ of the number of particles $N$ and their chemical potential $\mu$. Similarly, the grand potential and the product $pV$ of pressure and volume $V$ may not add up to zero. Discrepancies already arise under hydrostatic stress. The elastic energy is not proportional to volume and the Gibbs-Duhem relation valid for liquids is violated. Extensivity is recovered by treating the number of lattice sites $M$ as an additional thermodynamic variable. The difference $ G-\mu N $ can be identified with $\nu M$ where $\nu$ is the thermodynamic force conjugate to $M$. The reinstated Gibbs-Duhem equation can be cast in the form of an adsorption equation and applied to quantify the tendency to vacancy creation under isothermal isobaric conditions. We have worked this out for a uniform one-component compressible lattice gas crystal. Shear stress is omitted. The coupling between composition and strain is implemented by decomposing pressure in a mechanical component depending on deformed density $N/V$ and an elastic term linear in the volume strain as determined by $V/M$. Various $\left( \mu, p, T \right) $ response functions are compared to the $\left( \mu, V, T \right) $ counterparts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10260v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has become a heated debate as to whether the orbital Hall effect of a material could generate a non-local orbital current and a non-zero spin-orbit torque on an adjacent magnetic layer. Here, we report unambiguous evidence that, regardless of the ferromagnets (FMs) (e.g., Ni, Ni81Fe19, Fe, Fe60Co20B20, and FePt), the spin-orbit torque generated by an adjacent Ta, which is predicted to have a 50 times greater positive orbital Hall conductivity than the negative spin Hall conductivity, has essentially the same, negative efficiency, in agreement with the spin Hall effect of Ta being the only source of the interfacial torque. We identify that the constant, positive estimate of the torque of the Ta/FM samples from spin-torque ferromagnetic resonance (ST-FMR) analysis in a specific FM thickness range (&gt;2 nm for Ni), that was heavily cited in the literature to signify an orbital current torque but strongly disagrees with the fairly long relaxation length in other orbital current torque claims, results from the overlook of a significant thick-dependent self-induced ST-FMR signal of the FM. These results indicate the absence of orbital current torque in Ta/ferromagnet systems, regardless of the type and the layer thickness of the ferromagnets.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of Circular Complex Permeability in Single-Crystal Yttrium Iron Garnet at Cryogenic Temperatures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07381v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The operation of superconducting qubits requires a sensitive readout circuit at cryogenic temperatures, driving the demand for cryogenic non reciprocal microwave components such as circulators. However, evaluating these components at low temperatures presents significant challenges for companies and institutions without specialized measurement systems. In the development of such cryogenic non reciprocal components, the temperature dependence of ferrite's magnetic properties is the most critical factor. Therefore, an evaluation technique for accurately assessing these properties at cryogenic temperatures is essential. In this study, we develop a measurement method to characterize low loss ferrite materials over a temperature range of 300 K to 2 K. The use of the circularly polarized resonance mode \( \text{TE}_{11n} \) enables the direct estimation of circular complex permeability and the determination of key material parameters, including saturation magnetization and damping constant both essential for assessing the performance of ferrite materials in circulator applications. To validate the reliability of our measurement method, we selected single crystal YIG as the test material, as its magnetic properties at cryogenic temperatures are relatively well known. This demonstration confirms that our method is effective for characterizing various low loss ferrite materials that are potential candidates for compact cryogenic non reciprocal devices.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the thermal transport properties of Biphenylene nanotubes: A molecular dynamics study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11981v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Biphenylene nanotubes (BPNNTs) represent a novel class of carbon-based nanomaterials, constructed by rolling a biphenylene network (BPN) monolayer into a one-dimensional tubular structure. In this study, the thermal transport properties of BPNNTs are investigated using reverse non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations. At room temperature, the lattice thermal conductivity of armchair and zigzag BPNNTs is found to be approximately 100 W/m.K and 90 W/m.K, respectively. These values are at least one order of magnitude lower than those reported for single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs). This significant reduction is attributed to the unique atomic arrangement of BPNNTs, which leads to a substantially lower phonon group velocity. Furthermore, the effects of nanotube length, diameter, and temperature on thermal transport are systematically analyzed. To elucidate the mechanisms underlying the geometry- and temperature-dependent thermal behavior, a comprehensive analysis of phonon dispersion relations, vibrational density of states, and phonon group velocities is conducted. This study offers valuable insight into the thermal transport properties of BPNNTs, with implications for thermal management and energy-related applications.</description>

Abstract: We present a first principles investigation of strain-driven vacancy clustering in aluminum. Specifically, we perform Kohn-Sham density functional theory calculations to study the influence of hydrostatic strains on clustering in tri-, quad-, and heptavacancies. We find that compressive strains are a key driving force for vacancy aggregation, particularly for collapse of clusters on the (111) plane, consistent with prior experimental observations of vacancy clusters on this plane. Notably, we find that the heptavacancy on the (111) plane collapses to form a prismatic dislocation loop for hydrostatic compressive strains exceeding 5\%, highlighting the critical role of such strains in prismatic dislocation loop nucleation in aluminum.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.24065v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The growth and characterization of materials using empirical optimization typically requires a significant amount of expert time, experience, and resources. Several complementary characterization methods are routinely performed to determine the quality and properties of a grown sample. Machine learning (ML) can support the conventional approaches by using historical data to guide and provide speed and efficiency to the growth and characterization of materials. Specifically, ML can provide quantitative information from characterization data that is typically obtained from a different modality. In this study, we have investigated the feasibility of projecting the quantitative metric from microscopy measurements, such as atomic force microscopy (AFM), using data obtained from spectroscopy measurements, like Raman spectroscopy. Generative models were also trained to generate the full and specific features of the Raman and photoluminescence spectra from each other and the AFM images of the thin film MoS$_2$. The results are promising and have provided a foundational guide for the use of ML for the cross-modal characterization of materials for their accelerated, efficient, and cost-effective discovery.</description>

      <title>Coherent phonon motions and ordered vacancy compound mediated quantum path interference in Cu-poor CuIn$_{x}$Ga$_{(1-x)}$Se$_2$ (CIGS) with attosecond transient absorption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05621v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, coherent phonon motion is observed in bandgap excited CuIn$_{x}$Ga$_{(1-x)}$Se$_2$ (CIGS) utilizing extreme ultraviolet (XUV) attosecond transient absorption spectroscopy across the Se M$_{4,5}$ absorption edge. Two frequencies of coherent phonon motion are resolved, a low frequency mode attributed through Raman measurements to the $A_{1g}$ phonon motion of a Cu-deficient ordered vacancy compound (OVC), while the high frequency mode originates from the $A_{1g}$ phonon motion in the chalcopyrite phase. The two oscillations lead to modulations in the XUV differential absorption $\Delta A(\epsilon,\tau)$ due to energy shifts of the Se M$_{4,5}$ edge, with a minima occuring approximately 1 ps after the band gap excitation. The hot carrier cooling time of holes and electrons are disentangled and the observed slower cooling of holes is attributed to the higher density of hole states in the valence band. We also observe fast oscillations (18.6(3) fs period) across the Se absorption edge, which are interpreted to originate from quantum path interference between the electronic conduction bands of the chalcopyrite CIGS and OVC phases, opening the possibility towards quantum coherent metrology in photovoltaics on the femtosecond timescale. The complex interplay between the chalcopyrite and OVC phases are revealed in this investigation through both coherent vibrational and electronic motions.</description>

      <title>Light-induced ultrafast magnetization dynamics in van der Waals antiferromagnetic CrSBr</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15199v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the ultrafast magnetization dynamics of semiconducting antiferromagnetic CrSBr using real-time time-dependent density functional theory. In zero magnetic field, laser excitation modifies only the magnetization along the easy axis, leaving transverse components unaffected. We find that below-gap, low-fluence pulses enhance the local magnetic moments via spin transfer from nonmagnetic to magnetic atoms, increasing the Neel vector. In contrast, high-fluence pulses drive interlayer spin transfer between magnetic atoms, producing strong demagnetization and reducing the Neel vector, while S and Br atoms exhibit primarily charge transfer with weak opposite contribution to the demagnetization. An applied magnetic field qualitatively alters the response, enabling both magnitude changes and ultrafast reorientation of the magnetization. We show that the resulting layer-resolved reorientation respects a twofold rotation about the x-axis, exciting coherent optical magnons even under this symmetry, which modulate the relative angle between neighboring layers and periodically tune electronic properties. These results reveal a microscopic pathway for coherent magnon excitation in van der Waals magnets and establish a framework for controlling their coupled spin-charge dynamics on femtosecond timescales.</description>

      <title>Design Rules and Discovery of Face-Sharing Hexagonal Perovskites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09088v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hexagonal perovskites with face-sharing octahedral connectivity are an underexplored class of materials. We propose quantitative design principles for stabilizing face-sharing ABX3 hexagonal perovskites based on a comparative analysis of oxides and sulfides. By mapping structural preferences across a phase-space defined by an electronegativity-corrected tolerance factor and the Shannon radius of the A-site cations, we identify distinct thresholds that separate hexagonal phases from competing cubic polymorphs having corner-sharing octahedral connectivity. Our analysis reveals that sulfides differ significantly from oxides due to the increased covalency of the transition metal-sulfur bonds, which enables broader compositional flexibility. Applying these principles, we predict a set of thermodynamically formable ABO3 and ABS3 compounds that are likely to adopt face-sharing octahedral connectivity. These findings establish a predictive framework for designing hexagonal perovskites, highlighting sulfides as promising candidates for obtaining quasi-one-dimensional materials having transition-metal cations for novel ferroic phenomena.</description>

      <title>Structural contribution to light-induced gap suppression in Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12363v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An excitonic insulator is a material that hosts an exotic ground state, where an energy gap opens due to spontaneous condensation of bound electron-hole pairs. Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$ is a promising candidate for this type of material, but the coexistence of a structural phase transition with the gap opening has led to a long-standing debate regarding the origin of the insulating gap. Here we employ MeV ultrafast electron diffraction to obtain quantitative insights into the atomic displacements in Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$ following photoexcitation, which has been overlooked in previous time-resolved spectroscopy studies. In conjunction with first-principles calculations using the measured atomic displacements, we find that the structural change can largely account for the photoinduced reduction in the energy gap without considering excitonic effects. Our work illustrates the importance of a quantitative reconstruction of individual atomic pathways during nonequilibrium phase transitions, paving the way for a mechanistic understanding of a diverse array of phase transitions in correlated materials where lattice dynamics can play a pivotal role.</description>

      <title>Tunable superconducting diode effect in a topological nano-SQUID</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16569v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A Josephson diode passes current with zero resistance in one direction but is resistive in the other direction. While such an effect has been observed in several platforms, a large and tunable Josephson diode effect has been rare. Here we report that a simple device consisting of a topological-insulator (TI) nanowire side-contacted by superconductors to form a lateral Josephson junction presents a large diode effect with the efficiency $\eta$ reaching 0.3 when a parallel magnetic field $B_{||}$ is applied. Interestingly, the sign and the magnitude of $\eta$ is tunable not only by $B_{||}$ but also by the back-gate voltage. This diode effect can be understood by modeling the system as a nano-SQUID, in which the top and bottom surfaces of the TI nanowire each form a line junction and $B_{||}$ creates a magnetic flux to thread the SQUID loop. This model further shows that the observed diode effect marks the emergence of topological superconductivity in TI-nanowire-based Josephson junction.</description>

      <title>Ultra-stretchable and Self-Healable Vitrimers with Tuneable Damping and Mechanical Response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03701v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vitrimers are a relatively new class of polymer materials with unique properties offered by cross-links that can undergo associative exchange dynamics. We here present a new class of vitrimers based on poly(methyl acrylate) with cross-links utilising dioxaboralane metathesis. These vitrimers demonstrate a combination of ultra-stretchability (up to $\sim$ 80 times their own length), mechanical toughness ($\sim$ 40 MJ/m$^3$), and thermal stability up to $T\sim$ 250 {\deg}C; moreover, the vitrimers demonstrate excellent mechanical damping characterised by a loss factor ($\tan(\delta)$) with a maximum of $\sim$ 2-3 and an effective value $&gt;$0.3 across five decades in frequency (0.001-100 Hz), or correspondingly across a $T$-range of $\sim$ 35 {\deg}C near room temperature (for a probe frequency of 1 Hz). The vitrimers can be successfully re-processed using both a thermo-mechanical and a chemical processing route, and can for low cross-link density self-heal at room temperature, making them suitable for sustainable applications. The material properties are directly tuneable by variation of both the amount of cross-linker and by the degree of curing. Thus, this class of vitrimers are promising for applications where stretchability combined with mechanical toughness and/or a high mechanical dissipation is required.</description>

      <title>Revisiting LaMnO3: A density functional theory study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11189v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Density functional theory (DFT) has been widely applied to a variety of realistic materials but often struggles to explain the properties of correlated systems. The DFT + U method, which introduces a Hubbard U correction to the DFT, has been instrumental in providing the treatment of systems such as transition metal oxide. The methodological details of DFT + U and their specifics on the electronic structures and magnetic properties of the correlated systems remain incompletely understood. In this study, taking the prototypical transition metal oxide system, LaMnO3, as an example, we systematically assess the performance of the two distinct DFT + U methods, spin-polarized DFT (SDFT + U) and spin-un-polarized DFT (CDFT + U). We found that while Coulomb U acts similarly for the two approaches, Hund JH plays a fundamentally different role, particularly in the determination of the magnetic phases. Our investigation shows the active role of Hund JH on the exchange splitting, leading to distinct magnetic ground configurations in the two methods. We further investigate the associated magnetic exchange interactions and compare our results with so-called beyond-DFT methods.</description>

      <title>Exchange interactions in itinerant magnets: the effects of local particle-hole irreducible vertex corrections and SU(2) symmetry of Hund interaction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08018v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study exchange interactions in iron and nickel within the DFT+DMFT approach with density-density and SU(2) symmetric Coulomb interaction. In particular, we analyze the representation of exchange interactions through the electron non-local Green's functions, connecting the local particle-hole (ph) irreducible interaction vertices. While the neglect of the local ph-irreducible vertex corrections, suggested previously within the dual fermion approach [E. A. Stepanov, et.al., Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 121}, 037204 (2018)], yields the result corresponding to the generalization of the magnetic force theorem approach, we argue that these vertex corrections are in fact less important for strong localized magnets, such as iron, but become more essential for weak itinerant magnets, such as nickel. At the same time, the overall account of the local vertex and self-energy corrections in the so-called renormalized magnetic force theorem approach is essential for iron, and less important for nickel. The difference of the results of density-density and SU(2) symmetric Coulomb interaction is found to be relatively small, in contrast to the Curie temperature and the value of the local magnetic moment.</description>

      <title>Observing Differential Spin Currents by Resonant Inelastic X-ray Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05796v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Controlling spin currents, i.e., the flow of spin angular momentum, in small magnetic devices is the principal objective of spin electronics, a main contender for future energy efficient information technologies. Surprisingly, a pure spin current has never been measured directly since the associated electric stray fields and/or shifts in the non-equilibrium spin-dependent distribution functions are too small for conventional experimental detection methods optimized for charge transport. Here we report that resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) can bridge this gap by measuring the spin current carried by magnons -- the quanta of the spin wave excitations of the magnetic order -- in the presence of temperature gradients across a magnetic insulator. This is possible due to the sensitivity of the momentum- and energy-resolved RIXS intensity to minute changes in the magnon distribution under non-equilibrium conditions. We use the Boltzmann equation in the relaxation time approximation to extract transport parameters, such as the magnon lifetime at finite momentum, essential for the realization of magnon spintronics.</description>

      <title>Edgetronics in 2D Altermagnet via Real-Space-Spin Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10451v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The coupling between real-space coordinates and spin (r-s) provides an alternative route to achieve efficient spin manipulation in spintronics beyond the conventional momentum-spin (k-s) coupling paradigm. Here we demonstrate an unexpected manifestation of one-dimensional (1D) r-s coupling in two-dimensional (2D) altermagnetic second-order topological insulators, where the spin-split floating edge states - energetically isolated within the bulk band gap - emerge and exhibit both Neel-vector-dependent and electrically tunable behaviors. The 1D edge-spin r-s coupling ensures carrier transport to be exclusively carried by the edge states with quantized spin conductance, giving rise to an unconventional edge tunnel magnetoresistance (edge-TMR) effect that can be switched On or Off. As a proof of concept, we computationally design an edge-TMR device based on Cr2Se2O monolayer to demonstrate its edge transportation and controllability via the Neel order or electric field. Our findings propose a general prototype altermagnetic device for next-generation low-dimensional spintronics.</description>
