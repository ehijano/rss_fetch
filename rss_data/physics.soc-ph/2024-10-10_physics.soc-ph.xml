      <title>Evaluating internal and external dissonance of belief dynamics in social systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Belief dynamics are fundamental to human behavior and social coordination. Individuals rely on accurate beliefs to make decisions, and shared beliefs form the basis of successful cooperation. Traditional studies often examined beliefs in isolation, but recent perspectives suggest beliefs operate as interconnected systems, both within individuals and across social networks. To better understand belief dynamics, we propose an extension of Galesic et al.'s model, which allows individuals to weigh internal and social dissonance based on belief certainty. Our model suggests that belief convergence occurs in two patterns: internal alignment, where beliefs become ideologically consistent but socially disagreeable, or social alignment, where beliefs become socially consistent but internally varied. These results highlight a competition between internal and social belief networks, with one network often dominating. Our findings suggest that belief dynamics tend to settle at extremes, indicating a need for future models to incorporate negative feedback to reflect more nuanced societal belief changes.</description>

      <title>Do we practice what we preach? The dissonance between resilience understanding and measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Resilience is needed to make infrastructures fit for the future, but its operationalization is still lively discussed. Here, we identify three understandings of resilience from the existing literature: resilience as a process, an outcome, and a capacity. We show that all three understandings have their justification, as each plays its part in the core business of resilience, that is, dealing with disruptive events. But, we also find that the trio differs considerably in terms of the implications for the operationalization of resilience. Most importantly, only the understanding of resilience as a capacity allows for a continuous resilience monitoring and a management which is agnostic to the type of disruptive event. We therefore advocate to understand and assess resilience as a capacity. While this understanding is in line with popular opinion, it is often not reflected in the assessment approaches applied. This dissonance shows, for example, in the use of single performance curves to assess resilience. We argue that in order to assess resilience as a capacity, we need to consider multiple performance curves, otherwise we will capture the system's ability to deal with one specific event instead of its ability to deal with any surprises that come its way.</description>

      <title>Crafting desirable climate trajectories with RL explored socio-environmental simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Climate change poses an existential threat, necessitating effective climate policies to enact impactful change. Decisions in this domain are incredibly complex, involving conflicting entities and evidence. In the last decades, policymakers increasingly use simulations and computational methods to guide some of their decisions. Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) are one of such methods, which combine social, economic, and environmental simulations to forecast potential policy effects. For example, the UN uses outputs of IAMs for their recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports. Traditionally these have been solved using recursive equation solvers, but have several shortcomings, e.g. struggling at decision making under uncertainty. Recent preliminary work using Reinforcement Learning (RL) to replace the traditional solvers shows promising results in decision making in uncertain and noisy scenarios. We extend on this work by introducing multiple interacting RL agents as a preliminary analysis on modelling the complex interplay of socio-interactions between various stakeholders or nations that drives much of the current climate crisis. Our findings show that cooperative agents in this framework can consistently chart pathways towards more desirable futures in terms of reduced carbon emissions and improved economy. However, upon introducing competition between agents, for instance by using opposing reward functions, desirable climate futures are rarely reached. Modelling competition is key to increased realism in these simulations, as such we employ policy interpretation by visualising what states lead to more uncertain behaviour, to understand algorithm failure. Finally, we highlight the current limitations and avenues for further work to ensure future technology uptake for policy derivation.</description>

      <title>How Social Network Structure Impacts the Ability of Zealots to Promote Weak Opinions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social networks are often permeated by agents who promote their opinions without allowing for their own mind to be changed: Understanding how these so-called `zealots' act to increase the prevalence of their promoted opinion over the network is important for understanding opinion dynamics. In this work, we consider these promoted opinions to be `weak' and therefore less likely to be accepted relative to the default opinion in the network. We show how the proportion of zealots in the network, the relative strength of the weak opinion, and the structure of the network impact the long-term proportion of the those in the network who subscribe to the weak opinion.</description>

      <title>Modularity maximization and community detection in complex networks through recursive and hierarchical annealing in the D-Wave Advantage quantum processing units</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum adiabatic optimization has long been expected to outperform classical methods in solving NP-type problems. While this has been proven in certain experiments, its main applications still reside in academic problems where the size of the system to be solved would not represent an obstacle to any modern desktop computer. Here we develop a systematic procedure to find the global optima of the modularity function to discover community structure in complex networks solely relying on pure annealers rather than hybrid solutions. We bypass the one-hot encoding constraints by hierarchically and recursively encoding binary instances of the problem that can be solved without the need to guess the exact penalties for the Lagrange multipliers. We study the variability, and robustness of the annealer as a function of network size, directness of connections, topology, and the resolution of the communities. We show how our approach produces meaningful and at least equally optimal solutions to state-of-the-art community detection algorithms while maintaining tractable computing times. Lastly, due to its recursive nature, the annealing process returns intermediate subdivisions thus offering interpretable rather than black-box solutions. These \textit{dendrograms} can be used to unveil normal and pathological hidden hierarchies in brain networks hence opening the door to clinical workflows. Overall, this represents a first step towards an applicable practice-oriented usage of pure quantum annealing potentially bridging two segregated communities in modern science and engineering; that of network science and quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Impact of Exoplanet Science on Society: Professional Contributions, Citizen Science Engagement and Public Perception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The impact of exoplanet science on both the scientific community and on the general public is presented through various indicators and examples. It is estimated that about 3-4% of all refereed astronomy articles focus on exoplanets, and between 15-20% percent of current, and up to 25% of upcoming astronomy space missions are dedicated to exoplanet research. Also, about 15-20% of the science cases for large multi-purpose ground-based astronomical instruments involve exoplanet science.
  Interactions between the scientific community and the public occur on several levels and play a crucial role in shaping the future of exoplanet science. The rise of citizen science platforms and the successes of coordinated observing projects involving amateur astronomers have engaged the public in meaningful scientific contributions, and contribute to some areas of discovery and characterization of exoplanet systems, for which several examples are given. These initiatives not only fuel public interest in the search for extraterrestrial life but also promote STEM education, broadening participation in science.
  Lastly, the changing perception of the informed public about the existence of "other Earths" and life in the Universe in the light of results from exoplanet science is outlined. Media coverage of results from exoplanet science has furthered the acceptance that extraterrestrial life, be it intelligent of not, is not rare in the Universe. The shift in perception that such life might be detected in a potentially not very distant future has, in turn, promoted public support for the research infrastructure necessary to sustain the growth of exoplanetology.</description>

      <title>Exploring the core-periphery and community structure in the financial networks through random matrix theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In finance, Random Matrix Theory (RMT) is an important tool for filtering out noise from large datasets, revealing true correlations among stocks, enhancing risk management and portfolio optimization. In this study, we use RMT to filter out noise from the full cross-correlation matrix of stock price returns for the NIFTY 200 and NIFTY 500 indices on the National Stock Exchange of India. In addition, we applied network theory tools to analyze market and sector modes as filtered correlation structures to study local interactions within financial networks. This allows us to study the very fundamental properties of networks, such as the core-periphery and the community structure of constructed networks over these filtered modes, and compare the results with the network constructed over the full cross-correlation matrix. The results suggest that the core-periphery structure is contained in the market mode, while the community structure is in the sector mode. Thus, both modes outperform the full cross-correlation in terms of capturing the essential respective structure of the network. Furthermore, we used these insights to build portfolios based on communities of the networks corresponding to the sector mode and the network corresponding to the full cross-correlation matrix. The results suggest that the portfolio constructed on the complete cross-correlation-based matrix performs better than the sector mode. These insights provide a greater understanding of RMT application in the financial market.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: During the COVID-19 pandemic, it became evident that the effectiveness of applying intervention measures is significantly influenced by societal acceptance, which, in turn, is affected by the processes of opinion formation. This article explores one among the many possibilities of a coupled opinion-epidemic system. The findings reveal either intricate periodic patterns or chaotic dynamics, leading to substantial fluctuations in opinion distribution and, consequently, significant variations in the total number of infections over time. Interestingly, the model is exhibiting the protective pattern.</description>

      <title>Agent-based modeling for realistic reproduction of human mobility and contact behavior to evaluate test and isolation strategies in epidemic infectious disease spread</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08050v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Agent-based models have proven to be useful tools in supporting decision-making processes in different application domains. The advent of modern computers and supercomputers has enabled these bottom-up approaches to realistically model human mobility and contact behavior. The COVID-19 pandemic showcased the urgent need for detailed and informative models that can answer research questions on transmission dynamics. We present a sophisticated agent-based model to simulate the spread of respiratory diseases. The model is highly modularized and can be used on various scales, from a small collection of buildings up to cities or countries. Although not being the focus of this paper, the model has undergone performance engineering on a single core and provides an efficient intra- and inter-simulation parallelization for time-critical decision-making processes.
  In order to allow answering research questions on individual level resolution, nonpharmaceutical intervention strategies such as face masks or venue closures can be implemented for particular locations or agents. In particular, we allow for sophisticated testing and isolation strategies to study the effects of minimal-invasive infectious disease mitigation. With realistic human mobility patterns for the region of Brunswick, Germany, we study the effects of different interventions between March 1st and May 30, 2021 in the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Our analyses suggest that symptom-independent testing has limited impact on the mitigation of disease dynamics if the dark figure in symptomatic cases is high. Furthermore, we found that quarantine length is more important than quarantine efficiency but that, with sufficient symptomatic control, also short quarantines can have a substantial effect.</description>

      <title>European Football Player Valuation: Integrating Financial Models and Network Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16179v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a new framework for player valuation in European football, by fusing principles from financial mathematics and network theory. The valuation model leverages a "passing matrix" to encapsulate player interactions on the field, utilizing centrality measures to quantify individual influence. Unlike traditional approaches, such as regressing on past performance-salary data, this model focuses on in-game performance as a player's contributions evolve over time. Consequently, our model provides a dynamic and individualized framework for ascertaining a player's fair market value. The methodology is empirically validated through a case study in European football, employing real-world match and financial data. This cross-disciplinary mechanism for player valuation adapts the effect of connecting pay with performance, first seen in Scully (1974), to include in-game contributions as well as expected present valuation of stochastic variables.</description>

      <title>Body and mind: Decoding the dynamics of pedestrians and the effect of smartphone distraction by coupling mechanical and decisional processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.03419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.03419v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pedestrians are able to anticipate, which gives them an edge in avoiding collisions and navigating in cluttered spaces. However, these capabilities are impaired by digital distraction through smartphones, a growing safety concern. To capture these features, we put forward a continuous agent-based model (dubbed ANDA) hinging on a transparent delineation of a decision-making process, wherein a desired velocity is selected as the optimum of a perceived cost, and a mechanical layer that handles contacts and collisions. Altogether, the model includes less than a dozen parameters, many of which are fit using independent experimental data. The versatility of ANDA is demonstrated by numerical simulations that successfully replicate empirical observations in a very wide range of scenarios. These scenarios vary from collision avoidance involving one, two, or more agents, to collective flow properties in unidirectional and bidirectional settings, and to the dynamics of evacuation through a bottleneck, where contact forces are directly accessible. Remarkably, the model is able to replicate the enhanced chaoticity of the flow observed experimentally in 'smartphone-walking' pedestrians, by reducing the frequency of decisional updates, replicating the digital distraction effect. The conceptual transparency of the model makes it easy to pinpoint the origin of its current limitations and to clarify the singular position of pedestrian crowds amid active-matter systems.</description>
