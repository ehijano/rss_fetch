      <title>Formal matrix representations of pseudo-Frobenius and Frobenius rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rings with Nakayama permutations, pseudo-Frobenius and Frobenius rings in particular, are studied by applying the general theory of formal matrix rings to their Peirce decompositions. A combinatorial criterion is given to decide whether a formal matrix ring with local rings on the diagonal has a prescribed Nakayama permutation.
  It is shown that a pseudo-Frobenius ring R can be represented as a block matrix ring, where the blocks on the diagonal are pseudo-Frobenius rings corresponding to cycles in the Nakayama permutation of R. All possible supports of such blocks are characterised. In the finite case, their local corner rings are shown to be isomorphic. We characterise local corners of quasi-Frobenius rings as a subclass of rings with a Morita self-duality. The duality contexts between these corners then appear on the shifted diagonal of their formal matrix representations.
  Using the combinatorial criterion, we give, under mild assumptions, a method of how to glue two rings with a Nakayama permutation. It is then used to construct an indecomposable Frobenius ring with two simple modules whose rings of endomorphisms are not isomorphic.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we prove that there exists an injective Lie morphism from the double shuffle Lie algebra ${\frak{ds}}$ into the Kashiwara-Vergne Lie algebra ${\frak{krv}}$, forming a commutative triangle with the known Lie injections of the Grothendieck-Teichm\"uller Lie algebra ${\frak{grt}}\rightarrow {\frak{ds}}$ and ${\frak{grt}}\rightarrow{\frak{krv}}$.</description>

      <title>Deformation Theory and Hopf Actions on Koszul Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider graded deformations and PBW deformations of algebras defined over noncommutative algebras. We explain how fibers of graded deformations correspond to filtered algebras admitting a PBW property, with focus on smash product algebras for Hopf algebras acting on quadratic algebras. In particular, we describe all PBW deformations arising from Hopf actions on Koszul algebras, giving Hopf-Koszul Hecke algebras. Alexander-Whitney and Eilenberg-Zilber maps for twisted tensor products transfer homological information between resolutions and convert conditions on Hochschild cocycles and Gerstenhaber brackets into explicit PBW conditions.</description>

      <title>Jacobson identities for post-Lie algebras in positive characteristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $p$ be a prime number. Given a restricted Lie algebra over a field of characteristic $p$ and a post-Lie operation over it, we prove the Jacobson identities for a $p$-structure built from the Lie bracket and the post-Lie operation, called sub-adjacent $p$-structure. Furthermore, we give sufficient conditions for the sub-adjacent Lie algebra to be restricted if equipped with this sub-adjacent $p$-structure. This construction is ''axiomatized'' by introducing the notion of restricted post-Lie algebras, and we work out several examples.</description>

      <title>The orbit method for the Virasoro algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $W = \mathbb{C}[t, t^{-1}]\partial_t$ be the Witt algebra of algebraic vector fields on $\mathbb{C}^\times$ and let $V\!ir$ be the Virasoro algebra, the unique nontrivial central extension of $W$. In 2023, Petukhov and Sierra showed that Poisson primitive ideals of $\mathrm{S}(W)$ and $\mathrm{S}(V\!ir)$ can be constructed from elements of $W^*$ and $V\!ir^*$ of a particular form, called local functions. In this paper, we show how to use a local function on $W$ or $V\!ir$ to construct a representation of the Lie algebra. We further show that the annihilators of these representations are new completely prime primitive ideals of $\mathrm{U}(W)$ and $\mathrm{U}(V\!ir)$. We use this to define a Dixmier map from the Poisson primitive spectrum of $\mathrm{S}(V\!ir)$, respectively $\mathrm{S}(W)$, to the primitive spectrum of $\mathrm{U}(V\!ir)$, respectively $\mathrm{U}(W)$, successfully extending the orbit method from finite-dimensional solvable Lie algebras to our countable-dimensional setting.
  Our method involves new ring homomorphisms from $\mathrm{U}(W)$ to the tensor product of a localized Weyl algebra and the enveloping algebra of a finite-dimensional solvable subquotient of $W$. We further show that the kernels of these homomorphisms are intersections of the primitive ideals constructed from natural subsets of $W^*$. As a corollary, we disprove the conjecture that any primitive ideal of $\mathrm{U}(W)$ is the kernel of some map from $\mathrm{U}(W)$ to the first Weyl algebra.</description>

      <title>$\mathrm{M}$-ideals: from Banach spaces to rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and investigate a class of ring ideals, termed ring $\mathrm{M}$-ideals, inspired by the Alfsen--Effros theory of $\mathrm{M}$-ideals in Banach spaces. We show that $\mathrm{M}$-ideals extend the classical notion of essential ideals and subsume them as a subclass. The central theorem provides a full characterization: an ideal is an $\mathrm{M}$-ideal if and only if it is either essential or relatively irreducible. This dichotomy reveals the abundant and diverse nature of $\mathrm{M}$-ideals, encompassing both essential and minimal ideals, and admits natural generalizations in rings beyond the commutative and unital settings.
  We systematically study the algebraic stability of $\mathrm{M}$-ideals under standard constructions such as intersection, quotient, direct product, and Morita equivalence and establish their behavior in topological rings and operator algebras. In certain rings such as $\mathbb{Z}_n$ and C*-algebras, we completely classify $\mathrm{M}$-ideals and relate them to algebraically minimal projections and central idempotents. The ring $\mathrm{M}$-ideals in $C(K)$ are shown to be precisely the essential ideals or those minimal ideals corresponding to isolated points.
  Structurally, we show that the absence of proper $\mathrm{M}$-ideals characterizes simplicity, while rings in which every proper $\mathrm{M}$-ideal is a direct summand must decompose as finite direct sums of simple rings. In closing, we introduce the notion of $\mathrm{M}$-complements, drawing an analogy with essential extensions in module theory, and demonstrate their existence.</description>

      <title>Extending structures for pre-Poisson algebras and pre-Poisson bialgebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the extending structures problem by the unified product for pre-Poisson algebras. In particular, the crossed product and the factorization problem are investigated. Furthermore, a special case of extending structures is studied under the case of pre-Poisson algebras, which leads to the discussion of bicrossed products and matched pairs of pre-Poisson algebras. We develop a bialgebra theory for pre-Poisson algebras and establish the equivalence between matched pairs and pre-Poisson bialgebras. We study coboundary pre-Poisson bialgebras, which lead to the introduction of the pre-Poisson Yang-Baxter equation (PPYBE). A symmetric solution of the PPYBE naturally gives a coboundary pre-Poisson bialgebra.</description>

      <title>Cluster structures on schemes of bands</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce new objects, called $(G,c)$-bands, associated with a simple simply-connected algebraic group $G$, and a Coxeter element $c$ in its Weyl group. We show that bands of a given type are the $K$-points of an infinite dimensional affine scheme, whose ring of regular functions has a cluster algebra structure. We also show that two important invariant sub-algebras of this ring are cluster sub-algebras. These three cluster structures have already appeared in different contexts related to the representation theories of quantum affine algebras, their Borel sub-algebras, and shifted quantum affine algebras. In this paper we show that they all belong to a common geometric setting.</description>

Abstract: An element of the algebra $M_n(\mathbb{F})$ of $n \times n$ matrices over a field $\mathbb{F}$ is called an involution if its square equals the identity matrix. Gustafson, Halmos, and Radjavi proved that any product of involutions in $M_n(\mathbb{F})$ can be expressed as a product of at most four involutions. In this article, we investigate the bijective linear preservers of the sets of products of two, three, or four involutions in $M_n(\mathbb{F})$.</description>

      <title>Endocabling of involutive solutions to the Yang-Baxter equation, with an application to solutions whose diagonal is a cyclic permutation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we introduce endocabling as a technique to deform involutive, non-degenerate set-theoretic solutions to the Yang-Baxter equation (``solutions'', for short) by means of $\lambda$-endomorphisms of their associated permutation brace, thus generalizing the cabling method by Lebed, Vendramin and Ram\'{i}rez. In the first part of the article, we define endocabling and investigate the behaviour of solutions and their invariants under endocabling. In the second part, we apply our findings to solutions of size $n$ whose diagonal map is an $n$-cycle: we will prove that solutions with this property whose size is an odd prime power, are of finite multipermutation level. Furthermore, solutions with this property whose size is a power of $2$, will be proven either to be of finite multipermutation level or to admit an iterated retraction onto a unique solution of size $4$.
  We formulate our results in the language of cycle sets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14844v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a geometric construction of Kashiwara crystals on the irreducible components of the varieties of multiparameter persistence modules. Our approach differs from the seminal work of Kashiwara and Saito, as well as subsequent related works, by emphasizing commutative relations rather than preprojective relations for a given quiver. Furthermore, we provide explicit descriptions of the Kashiwara operators in the fundamental cases of 1- and 2-parameter persistence modules, offering concrete insights into the crystal structure in these settings.</description>

      <title>Counting core sets in matrix rings over finite fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04106v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $R$ be a commutative ring and $M_n(R)$ be the ring of $n \times n$ matrices with entries from $R$. For each $S \subseteq M_n(R)$, we consider its (generalized) null ideal $N(S)$, which is the set of all polynomials $f$ with coefficients from $M_n(R)$ with the property that $f(A) = 0$ for all $A \in S$. The set $S$ is said to be core if $N(S)$ is a two-sided ideal of $M_n(R)[x]$. It is not known how common core sets are among all subsets of $M_n(R)$. We study this problem for $2 \times 2$ matrices over $\mathbb{F}_q$, where $\mathbb{F}_q$ is the finite field with $q$ elements. We provide exact counts for the number of core subsets of each similarity class of $M_2(\mathbb{F}_q)$. While not every subset of $M_2(\mathbb{F}_q)$ is core, we prove that as $q \to \infty$, the probability that a subset of $M_2(\mathbb{F}_q)$ is core approaches 1. Thus, asymptotically in~$q$, almost all subsets of $M_2(\mathbb{F}_q)$ are core.</description>

In this paper we will characterize the Rota-Baxter operators on the L-R smash product $A\natural H$ and give the necessary and sufficient conditions to make $\overline{B}$ a Rota-Baxter operator of $A\natural H$. Then we will consider the dual case, and construct a Rota-Baxter co-operator on the L-R smash product $C\ltimes H$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2012.14793v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a mathematical definition of spaces of irregular vacua/covacua in genus zero, for any simple Lie algebra, working at generic noncritical level. This uses coinvariants of affine-Lie-algebra modules whose parameters match up with those of moduli spaces of irregular-singular meromorphic connections: the de Rham spaces. The Segal--Sugawara representation of the Virasoro algebra is used to show that the spaces of irregular conformal blocks assemble into a flat vector bundle over the space of somonodromy times \`a la Klar\`es, and we provide a universal version of the resulting flat connection generalising the irregular KZ connection of Reshetikhin and the dynamical KZ connection of Felder--Markov--Tarasov--Varchenko.</description>

      <title>Local wild mapping class groups and cabled braids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.08188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.08188v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We will define and study some generalisations of pure $\mathfrak{g}$-braid groups that occur in the theory of connections on curves, for any complex reductive Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$. They make up local pieces of the wild mapping class groups, which are fundamental groups of (universal) deformations of wild Riemann surfaces, underlying the braiding of Stokes data and generalising the usual mapping class groups. We will establish a general product decomposition for the local wild mapping class groups, and in many cases define a fission tree controlling this decomposition. Further in type A we will show one obtains cabled versions of braid groups, related to braid operads.</description>

      <title>Partially compactified quantum cluster structures on simple algebraic groups and the full Berenstein--Zelevinsky conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05134v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The construction of partially compactified cluster algebras on coordinate rings is handled by using codimension 2 arguments on cluster covers. An analog of this in the quantum situation is highly desirable but has not been found yet. In this paper, we present a general method for the construction of partially compactified quantum cluster algebra structures on quantized coordinate rings from that of quantum cluster algebra structures on localizations. As an application, we construct a partially compactified quantum cluster algebra structure on the quantized coordinate ring of every connected, simply connected complex simple algebraic group. Along the way, we settle in full the Berenstein--Zelevinsky conjecture that all quantum double Bruhat cells have quantum cluster algebra structures associated to seeds indexed by arbitrary signed words, and prove that all such seeds are linked to each by mutations.</description>
