      <title>Self-Supervised Pre-Training with Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture Boosts ECG Classification Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate diagnosis of heart arrhythmias requires the interpretation of electrocardiograms (ECG), which capture the electrical activity of the heart. Automating this process through machine learning is challenging due to the need for large annotated datasets, which are difficult and costly to collect. To address this issue, transfer learning is often employed, where models are pre-trained on large datasets and fine-tuned for specific ECG classification tasks with limited labeled data. Self-supervised learning has become a widely adopted pre-training method, enabling models to learn meaningful representations from unlabeled datasets. In this work, we explore the joint-embedding predictive architecture (JEPA) for self-supervised learning from ECG data. Unlike invariance-based methods, JEPA does not rely on hand-crafted data augmentations, and unlike generative methods, it predicts latent features rather than reconstructing input data. We create a large unsupervised pre-training dataset by combining ten public ECG databases, amounting to over one million records. We pre-train Vision Transformers using JEPA on this dataset and fine-tune them on various PTB-XL benchmarks. Our results show that JEPA outperforms existing invariance-based and generative approaches, achieving an AUC of 0.945 on the PTB-XL all statements task. JEPA consistently learns the highest quality representations, as demonstrated in linear evaluations, and proves advantageous for pre-training even in the absence of additional data.</description>

      <title>Islanding Detection for Active Distribution Networks Using WaveNet+UNet Classifier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes an AI-based scheme for islanding detection in active distribution networks. By reviewing existing studies, it is clear that there are several gaps in the field to ensure reliable islanding detection, including (i) model complexity and stability concerns, (ii) limited accuracy under noisy conditions, and (iii) limited applicability to systems with different types of resources. Accordingly, this paper proposes a WaveNet classifier reinforced by a denoising U-Net model to address these shortcomings. The proposed scheme has a simple structure due to the use of 1D convolutional layers and incorporates residual connections that significantly enhance the model's generalization. Additionally, the proposed scheme is robust against noisy conditions by incorporating a denoising U-Net model. Furthermore, the model is sufficiently fast using a sliding window time series of 10 milliseconds for detection. Utilizing positive/negative/zero sequence components of voltages, superimposed waveforms, and the rate of change of frequency provides the necessary features to precisely detect the islanding condition. In order to assess the effectiveness of the suggested scheme, over 3k islanding/non-islanding cases were tested, considering different load active/reactive powers values, load switching transients, capacitor bank switching, fault conditions in the main grid, different load quality factors, signal-to-noise ratio levels, and both types of conventional and inverter-based sources.</description>

      <title>Jamming Detection and Channel Estimation for Spatially Correlated Beamspace Massive MIMO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the problem of jamming detection and channel estimation during multi-user uplink beam training under random pilot jamming attacks in beamspace massive multi-input-multi-output (MIMO) systems. For jamming detection, we distinguish the signals from the jammer and the user by projecting the observation signals onto the pilot space. By using the multiple projected observation vectors corresponding to the unused pilots, we propose a jamming detection scheme based on the locally most powerful test (LMPT) for systems with general channel conditions. Analytical expressions for the probability of detection and false alarms are derived using the second-order statistics and likelihood functions of the projected observation vectors. For the detected jammer along with users, we propose a two-step minimum mean square error (MMSE) channel estimation using the projected observation vectors. As a part of the channel estimation, we develop schemes to estimate the norm and the phase of the inner-product of the legitimate pilot vector and the random jamming pilot vector, which can be obtained using linear MMSE estimation and a bilinear form of the multiple projected observation vectors. From simulations under different system parameters, we observe that the proposed technique improves the detection probability by 32.22% compared to the baseline at medium channel correlation level, and the channel estimation achieves a mean square error of -15.93dB.</description>

      <title>Prior Information-Aided ADMM for Multi-User Detection in Codebook-Based Grant-Free NOMA: Dynamic Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Code-domain non-orthogonal multiple access (CD-NOMA) systems offer key benefits such as high spectral efficiency, low latency, high reliability, and massive connectivity. NOMA's ability to handle overloading allows multiple devices to share a single resource element (RE) for data transmission. In CD-NOMA, different users are assigned distinct codewords, which are leveraged during multi-user detection (MUD). Codebook-based NOMA systems outperform spread-sequence (SS)-based NOMA due to the coding gains provided by the codebooks. Sparse code multiple access (SCMA) and dense code multiple access (DCMA) are two prominent examples of such systems. Additionally, NOMA is seen as a crucial technology for enabling grant-free access, especially in massive machine-type communications (mMTC). One of the main challenges in deploying grant-free NOMA systems is accurately detecting both user activity and transmitted data, particularly when user activity fluctuates dynamically across the transmission frame. This paper introduces codebook-based grant-free NOMA systems modeled using a block sparsity signal structure. The joint activity and data detection (JADD) problem in these systems is formulated as group LASSO and sparse group LASSO block compressive sensing (BCS) problems. To address these, a robust prior information-aided alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm is proposed. Extensive numerical experiments and theoretical analysis show the efficiency of the proposed algorithm, making it a suitable solution for mMTC networks.</description>

      <title>Compression using Discrete Multi-Level Divisor Transform for Heterogeneous Sensor Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, multiple sensor-based devices and systems have been deployed in smart agriculture, industrial automation, E-Health, etc. The diversity of sensor data types and the amount of data pose critical challenges for data transmission and storage. The conventional data compression methods are tuned for a data type, e.g., OGG for audio. Due to such limitations, traditional compression algorithms may not be suitable for a system with multiple sensors. In this paper, we present a novel transform named as discrete multi-level divisor transform (DMDT). A signal compression algorithm is proposed for one-dimensional signals using the DMDT. The universality of the proposed compression algorithm is demonstrated by considering various types of signals, such as audio, electrocardiogram, accelerometer, magnetometer, photoplethysmography, and gyroscope. The proposed DMDT-based signal compression algorithm is also compared with the state-of-the-art compression algorithms.</description>

      <title>Deep Uncertainty-aware Tracking for Maneuvering Targets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When tracking maneuvering targets, model-driven approaches encounter difficulties in comprehensively delineating complex real-world scenarios and are prone to model mismatch when the targets maneuver. Meanwhile, contemporary data-driven methods have overlooked measurements' confidence, markedly escalating the challenge of fitting a mapping from measurement sequences to target state sequences. To address these issues, this paper presents a deep maneuvering target tracking methodology based on target state space projection. The proposed methodology initially establishes a projection from the target measurement sequence to the target state space by formulating the probability density function of measurement error and samples the distribution information of measurement noise within the target state space as a measurement representation. Under this representation, the sequential regression task of target state estimation can be transmuted into a task of detecting the target location in the state space. Subsequently, a deep detection network is devised to accomplish target location detection in the target state space. Finally, a loss function is designed to facilitate the network's training for attaining the desired network performance. Simulation experiments suggest that the proposed method can maintain satisfactory tracking performance even when the target maneuvers, and can rapidly converge and achieve higher estimation accuracy compared with existing methods after the target maneuvers.</description>

      <title>Mixed Attention Transformer Enhanced Channel Estimation for Extremely Large-Scale MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extremely large-scale massive multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO) is one of the key technologies for next-generation wireless communication systems. However, acquiring the accurate high-dimensional channel matrix of XL-MIMO remains a pressing challenge due to the intractable channel property and the high complexity. In this paper, a Mixed Attention Transformer based Channel Estimation Neural Network (MAT-CENet) is developed, which is inspired by the Transformer encoder structure as well as organically integrates the feature map attention and spatial attention mechanisms to better grasp the unique characteristics of the XL-MIMO channel. By incorporating the multi-head attention layer as the core enabler, the insightful feature importance is captured and exploited effectively. A comprehensive complexity analysis for the proposed MAT-CENet is also provided. Simulation results show that MAT-CENet outperforms the state of the art in different propagation scenarios of near-, far- and hybrid-fields.</description>

      <title>Comparing Differentiable and Dynamic Ray Tracing: Introducing the Multipath Lifetime Map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the increasing presence of dynamic scenarios, such as Vehicle-to-Vehicle communications, radio propagation modeling tools must adapt to the rapidly changing nature of the radio channel. Recently, both Differentiable and Dynamic Ray Tracing frameworks have emerged to address these challenges. However, there is often confusion about how these approaches differ and which one should be used in specific contexts. In this paper, we provide an overview of these two techniques and a comparative analysis against two state-of-the-art tools: 3DSCAT from UniBo and Sionna from NVIDIA. To provide a more precise characterization of the scope of these methods, we introduce a novel simulation-based metric, the Multipath Lifetime Map, which enables the evaluation of spatial and temporal coherence in radio channels only based on the geometrical description of the environment. Finally, our metrics are evaluated on a classic urban street canyon scenario, yielding similar results to those obtained from measurement campaigns.</description>

      <title>Joint Space-Time Adaptive Processing and Beamforming Design for Cell-Free ISAC Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore cooperative sensing and communication within cell-free integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems. Specifically, multiple transmit access points (APs) collaboratively serve multiple communication users while simultaneously illuminating a potential target, with a separate sensing AP dedicated to collecting echo signals for target detection. To improve the performance of identifying a moving target in the presence of strong interference originating from transmit APs, we employ the space-time adaptive processing (STAP) technique and jointly optimize the transmit/receive beamforming. Our goal is to maximize the radar output signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR), subject to the communication SINR requirements and the power budget. An efficient alternating algorithm is developed to solve the resulting non-convex optimization problem. Simulations demonstrate significant performance improvements in target detection and validate the advantages of the proposed joint STAP and beamforming design for cell-free ISAC systems.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Beamforming in 5G mmWave Networks: a Full-stack Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.04220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2010.04220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the cross-layer challenges and performance of Hybrid Beamforming (HBF) and Multi-User Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MU-MIMO) in 5G millimeter wave (mmWave) cellular networks with full-stack TCP/IP traffic and MAC scheduling. While previous research on HBF and MU-MIMO has focused on link-level analysis of full-buffer transmissions, this work reveals the interplay between HBF techniques and the higher layers of the protocol stack. To this aim, prior work on full stack simulation of mmWave cellular network has been extended by including the modeling of MU-MIMO and HBF. Our results reveal novel relations between the networking layers and the HBF MU-MIMO performance in the physical layer. Particularly, throughput can be increased in 5G networks by means of Spatial Division Multiple Access (SDMA). However, in order to achieve such benefits it is necessary to take into account certain trade-offs and the implementation complexity of a full-stack HBF solution.</description>

      <title>The SIMO Block Rayleigh Fading Channel Capacity Scaling with Number of Antennas, Bandwidth and Coherence Length</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.10647v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the capacity scaling of non-coherent Single-Input Multiple-Output (SIMO) independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) Rayleigh block fading channels versus bandwidth ($B$), number of receive antennas ($N$) and coherence block length ($L$). In non-coherent channels (without Channel State Information --CSI) capacity scales as $\Theta\left(\min(B,\sqrt{NL},N)\right)$. This is achievable using Pilot-Assisted signaling. Energy Modulation signaling rate scales as $\Theta\left(\min(B,\sqrt{N})\right)$. If $L$ is fixed while $B$ and $N$ grow, the two expressions grow equally and Energy Modulation achieves the capacity scaling. However, Energy Modulation rate does not scale as the capacity with the variable $L$. The coherent channel capacity with a priori CSI, in turn, scales as $\Theta\left(\min(B,N)\right)$. The coherent channel capacity scaling can be fully achieved in non-coherent channels when $L\geq\Theta(N)$. In summary, the channel coherence block length plays a pivotal role in modulation selection and the capacity gap between coherent and non-coherent channels. Pilot-Assisted signaling outperforms Energy Modulation's rate scaling versus coherence block length. Only in high mobility scenarios where $L$ is much smaller than the number of antennas ($L\ll\Theta(\sqrt{N})$), Energy Modulation is effective in non-coherent channels.</description>

Abstract: The study focuses on developing a digital twin testbed tailored for public safety technologies, incorporating simulated wireless communication within the digital world. The integration enables rapid analysis of signal strength, facilitating effective communication among personnel during catastrophic incidents in the virtual environment. The virtual world also helps with the training of first responders. The digital environment is constructed using the actual training facility for first responders as a blueprint. Using the photo-reference method, we meticulously constructed all buildings and objects within this environment. These reconstructed models are precisely placed relative to their real-world counterparts. Subsequently, all structures and objects are integrated into the Unreal Engine (UE) to create an interactive environment tailored specifically to the requirements of first responders.</description>

      <title>Wireless Human-Machine Collaboration in Industry 5.0</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14153v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wireless Human-Machine Collaboration (WHMC) represents a critical advancement for Industry 5.0, enabling seamless interaction between humans and machines across geographically distributed systems. As the WHMC systems become increasingly important for achieving complex collaborative control tasks, ensuring their stability is essential for practical deployment and long-term operation. Stability analysis certifies how the closed-loop system will behave under model randomness, which is essential for systems operating with wireless communications. However, the fundamental stability analysis of the WHMC systems remains an unexplored challenge due to the intricate interplay between the stochastic nature of wireless communications, dynamic human operations, and the inherent complexities of control system dynamics. This paper establishes a fundamental WHMC model incorporating dual wireless loops for machine and human control. Our framework accounts for practical factors such as short-packet transmissions, fading channels, and advanced HARQ schemes. We model human control lag as a Markov process, which is crucial for capturing the stochastic nature of human interactions. Building on this model, we propose a stochastic cycle-cost-based approach to derive a stability condition for the WHMC system, expressed in terms of wireless channel statistics, human dynamics, and control parameters. Our findings are validated through extensive numerical simulations and a proof-of-concept experiment, where we developed and tested a novel wireless collaborative cart-pole control system. The results confirm the effectiveness of our approach and provide a robust framework for future research on WHMC systems in more complex environments.</description>

      <title>Asymptotically Optimal Change Detection for Unnormalized Pre- and Post-Change Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14615v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of detecting changes when only unnormalized pre- and post-change distributions are accessible. This situation happens in many scenarios in physics such as in ferromagnetism, crystallography, magneto-hydrodynamics, and thermodynamics, where the energy models are difficult to normalize.
  Our approach is based on the estimation of the Cumulative Sum (CUSUM) statistics, which is known to produce optimal performance. We first present an intuitively appealing approximation method. Unfortunately, this produces a biased estimator of the CUSUM statistics and may cause performance degradation. We then propose the Log-Partition Approximation Cumulative Sum (LPA-CUSUM) algorithm based on thermodynamic integration (TI) in order to estimate the log-ratio of normalizing constants of pre- and post-change distributions. It is proved that this approach gives an unbiased estimate of the log-partition function and the CUSUM statistics, and leads to an asymptotically optimal performance. Moreover, we derive a relationship between the required sample size for thermodynamic integration and the desired detection delay performance, offering guidelines for practical parameter selection. Numerical studies are provided demonstrating the efficacy of our approach.</description>

      <title>Site-Specific Outdoor Propagation Assessment and Ray-Tracing Analysis for Wireless Digital Twins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14620</link>

Abstract: Digital twinning is becoming increasingly vital in the design and real-time control of future wireless networks by providing precise cost-effective simulations, predictive insights, and real-time data integration. This paper explores the application of digital twinning in optimizing wireless communication systems within urban environments, where building arrangements can critically impact network performances. We develop a digital twin platform to simulate and analyze how factors such as building positioning, base station placement, and antenna design influence wireless propagation. The ray-tracing software package of Matlab is compared with Remcom Wireless InSite. Using a realistic radiation pattern of a base transceiver station (BTS) antenna, ray tracing simulations for signal propagation and interactions in urban landscapes are then extensively examined. By analyzing radio heat maps alongside antenna patterns, we gain valuable insights into optimizing wireless deployment strategies. This study highlights the potential of digital twinning as a critical tool for urban planners and network engineers.</description>

      <title>Convergence of Manifold Filter-Combine Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14639v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In order to better understand manifold neural networks (MNNs), we introduce Manifold Filter-Combine Networks (MFCNs). The filter-combine framework parallels the popular aggregate-combine paradigm for graph neural networks (GNNs) and naturally suggests many interesting families of MNNs which can be interpreted as the manifold analog of various popular GNNs. We then propose a method for implementing MFCNs on high-dimensional point clouds that relies on approximating the manifold by a sparse graph. We prove that our method is consistent in the sense that it converges to a continuum limit as the number of data points tends to infinity.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Gradient Descent Jittering for Inverse Problems: Alleviating the Accuracy-Robustness Tradeoff</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inverse problems aim to reconstruct unseen data from corrupted or perturbed measurements. While most work focuses on improving reconstruction quality, generalization accuracy and robustness are equally important, especially for safety-critical applications. Model-based architectures (MBAs), such as loop unrolling methods, are considered more interpretable and achieve better reconstructions. Empirical evidence suggests that MBAs are more robust to perturbations than black-box solvers, but the accuracy-robustness tradeoff in MBAs remains underexplored. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective training scheme for MBAs, called SGD jittering, which injects noise iteration-wise during reconstruction. We theoretically demonstrate that SGD jittering not only generalizes better than the standard mean squared error training but is also more robust to average-case attacks. We validate SGD jittering using denoising toy examples, seismic deconvolution, and single-coil MRI reconstruction. The proposed method achieves cleaner reconstructions for out-of-distribution data and demonstrates enhanced robustness to adversarial attacks.</description>

      <title>Maximum A Posteriori Direction-of-Arrival Estimation via Mixed-Integer Semidefinite Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.03501v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation for the multiple measurement vectors (MMV) problem with application to direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation, which is classically formulated as a regularized least-squares (LS) problem with an $\ell_{2,0}$-norm constraint, and derive an equivalent mixed-integer semidefinite program (MISDP) reformulation. The proposed MISDP reformulation can be exactly solved by a generic MISDP solver using a semidefinite programming (SDP) based branch-and-bound method, which, unlike other nonconvex approaches for the MMV problem, such as the greedy methods and sparse Bayesian learning techniques, provides a solution with an optimality assessment even with early termination. We also present an approximate solution approach based on randomized rounding that yields high-quality feasible solutions of the proposed MISDP reformulation at a practically affordable computation time for problems of extremely large dimensions. Numerical simulations demonstrate the improved error performance of our proposed method in comparison to several popular DOA estimation methods. In particular, compared to the deterministic maximum likelihood (DML) estimator, which is often used as a benchmark, the proposed method applied with the randomized rounding algorithm exhibits a superior estimation performance at a significantly reduced running time.</description>

      <title>TiRE-GAN: Task-Incentivized Generative Learning for Radiomap Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02567v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To characterize radio frequency (RF) signal power distribution in wireless communication systems, the radiomap is a useful tool for resource allocation and network management. Usually, a dense radiomap is reconstructed from sparse observations collected by deployed sensors or mobile devices. To leverage both physical principles of radio propagation models and data statistics from sparse observations, this work introduces a novel task-incentivized generative learning model, namely TiRE-GAN, for radiomap estimation. Specifically, we first introduce a radio depth map to capture the overall pattern of radio propagation and shadowing effects, following which a task-driven incentive network is proposed to provide feedback for radiomap compensation depending on downstream tasks. Our experimental results demonstrate the power of the radio depth map to capture radio propagation information, and the efficiency of the proposed TiRE-GAN for radiomap estimation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14441v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) is one of the key technologies in 6G, and related research and standardization efforts are progressing vigorously. Wireless channel simulation is the cornerstone for the evaluation and optimization of wireless communication technologies. This paper proposes a design and implementation method for an ISAC channel simulation based on a Geometry-Based Stochastic Model (GBSM) simulation framework. First, we introduce the progress of 3GPP ISAC channel standardization and the key topics of discussion. Second, addressing the current lack of a standardized ISAC channel simulation framework, we propose a cascaded ISAC channel simulation framework based on GBSM, leveraging our team's related measurements, analyses, and proposal results. Based on this framework, we develop and design the ISAC channel simulator BUPTCMCC-6G-CMG+. Finally, we analyze and validate the simulation platform results, and provide some prospects for future ISAC testing research combined with channel simulators.</description>

      <title>AI-based 3-Lead to 12-Lead ECG Reconstruction: Towards Smartphone-based Public Healthcare</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13528v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Clinicians generally diagnose cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) using standard 12-Lead electrocardiogram (ECG). However, for smartphone-based public healthcare systems, a reduced 3-lead system may be preferred because of (i) increased portability, and (ii) reduced requirement for power, storage and bandwidth. Subsequently, clinicians require accurate 3-lead to 12-Lead ECG reconstruction, which has so far been studied only in the personalized setting. When each device is dedicated to one individual, artificial intelligence (AI) methods such as temporal long short-term memory (LSTM) and a further improved spatio-temporal LSTM-UNet combine have proven effective. In contrast, in the current smartphone-based public health setting where a common device is shared by many, developing an AI lead-reconstruction model that caters to the extensive ECG signal variability in the general population appears a far greater challenge. In this direction, we take a first step, and observe that the performance improvement achieved by a generative model, specifically, 1D Pix2Pix GAN (generative adversarial network), over LSTM-UNet is encouraging.</description>

      <title>Biometric Authentication Based on Enhanced Remote Photoplethysmography Signal Morphology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04127v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) is a non-contact method for measuring cardiac signals from facial videos, offering a convenient alternative to contact photoplethysmography (cPPG) obtained from contact sensors. Recent studies have shown that each individual possesses a unique cPPG signal morphology that can be utilized as a biometric identifier, which has inspired us to utilize the morphology of rPPG signals extracted from facial videos for person authentication. Since the facial appearance and rPPG are mixed in the facial videos, we first de-identify facial videos to remove facial appearance while preserving the rPPG information, which protects facial privacy and guarantees that only rPPG is used for authentication. The de-identified videos are fed into an rPPG model to get the rPPG signal morphology for authentication. In the first training stage, unsupervised rPPG training is performed to get coarse rPPG signals. In the second training stage, an rPPG-cPPG hybrid training is performed by incorporating external cPPG datasets to achieve rPPG biometric authentication and enhance rPPG signal morphology. Our approach needs only de-identified facial videos with subject IDs to train rPPG authentication models. The experimental results demonstrate that rPPG signal morphology hidden in facial videos can be used for biometric authentication.

      <title>Pre-Chirp-Domain Index Modulation for Full-Diversity Affine Frequency Division Multiplexing towards 6G</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00313v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM), tailored as a superior multicarrier technique utilizing chirp signals for high-mobility communications, is envisioned as a promising candidate for the sixth-generation (6G) wireless network. AFDM is based on the discrete affine Fourier transform (DAFT) with two adjustable parameters of the chirp signals, termed as the pre-chirp and post-chirp parameters, respectively. We show that the pre-chirp counterpart can be flexibly manipulated for additional degree-of-freedom (DoF). Therefore, this paper proposes a novel AFDM scheme with the pre-chirp index modulation (PIM) philosophy (AFDM-PIM), which can implicitly convey extra information bits through dynamic pre-chirp parameter assignment, thus enhancing both spectral and energy efficiency. Specifically, we first demonstrate that the subcarrier orthogonality is still maintained by applying distinct pre-chirp parameters to various subcarriers in the AFDM modulation process. Inspired by this property, each AFDM subcarrier is constituted with a unique pre-chirp signal according to the incoming bits. By such arrangement, extra binary bits can be embedded into the index patterns of pre-chirp parameter assignment without additional energy consumption. For performance analysis, we derive the asymptotically tight upper bounds on the average bit error rates (BERs) of the proposed schemes with maximum-likelihood (ML) detection, and validate that the proposed AFDM-PIM can achieve the optimal diversity order under doubly dispersive channels. Based on the derivations, we further propose an optimal pre-chirp alphabet design to enhance the BER performance via intelligent optimization algorithms. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed AFDM-PIM outperforms the classical benchmarks under doubly dispersive channel.</description>

      <title>X-Fi: A Modality-Invariant Foundation Model for Multimodal Human Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10167v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Human sensing, which employs various sensors and advanced deep learning technologies to accurately capture and interpret human body information, has significantly impacted fields like public security and robotics. However, current human sensing primarily depends on modalities such as cameras and LiDAR, each of which has its own strengths and limitations. Furthermore, existing multi-modal fusion solutions are typically designed for fixed modality combinations, requiring extensive retraining when modalities are added or removed for diverse scenarios. In this paper, we propose a modality-invariant foundation model for all modalities, X-Fi, to address this issue. X-Fi enables the independent or combinatory use of sensor modalities without additional training by utilizing a transformer structure to accommodate variable input sizes and incorporating a novel "X-fusion" mechanism to preserve modality-specific features during multimodal integration. This approach not only enhances adaptability but also facilitates the learning of complementary features across modalities. Extensive experiments conducted on the MM-Fi and XRF55 datasets, employing six distinct modalities, demonstrate that X-Fi achieves state-of-the-art performance in human pose estimation (HPE) and human activity recognition (HAR) tasks. The findings indicate that our proposed model can efficiently support a wide range of human sensing applications, ultimately contributing to the evolution of scalable, multimodal sensing technologies.</description>
