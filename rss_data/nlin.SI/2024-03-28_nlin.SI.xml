      <title>A Generic Nonlinear Evolution Equation of Magnetic Type II. Particular Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a matrix nonlinear partial differential equation that generalizes Heisenberg ferromagnet equation. This generalized Heisenberg ferromagnet equation is completely integrable with a linear bundle Lax pair related to the pseudo-unitary algebra. This allows us to explicitly derive particular solutions by using dressing technique. We shall discuss two classes of solutions over constant background: soliton-like solutions and quasi-rational solutions. Both classes have their analogues in the case of the Heisenberg ferromagnet equation related to the same Lie algebra.</description>

      <title>Affine Weyl groups and non-Abelian discrete systems: an application to the $d$-Painlev\'e equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A non-abelian generalisation of a birational representation of affine Weyl groups and their application to the discrete dynamical systems is presented. By using this generalisation, non-commutative analogs for the discrete systems of $A_n^{(1)}$, $n \geq 2$ type and of $d$-Painlev\'e equations with an additive dynamic were derived. A coalescence cascade of the later is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Rogue curves in the Davey-Stewartson I equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report new rogue wave patterns whose wave crests form closed or open curves in the spatial plane, which we call rogue curves, in the Davey-Stewartson I equation. These rogue curves come in various striking shapes, such as rings, double rings, and many others. They emerge from a uniform background (possibly with a few lumps on it), reach high amplitude in such striking shapes, and then disappear into the same background again. We reveal that these rogue curves would arise when an internal parameter in bilinear expressions of the rogue waves is real and large. Analytically, we show that these rogue curves are predicted by root curves of certain types of double-real-variable polynomials. We compare analytical predictions of rogue curves to true solutions and demonstrate good agreement between them.</description>

      <title>Nonstandard Lagrangians and branched Hamiltonians: A brief review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time and again, non-conventional forms of Lagrangians have found attention in the literature. For one thing, such Lagrangians have deep connections with several aspects of nonlinear dynamics including specifically the types of the Li\'{e}nard class; for another, very often the problem of their quantization opens up multiple branches of the corresponding Hamiltonians, ending up with the presence of singularities in the associated eigenfunctions. In this article, we furnish a brief review of the classical theory of such Lagrangians and the associated branched Hamiltonians, starting with the example of Li\'{e}nard-type systems. We then take up other cases where the Lagrangians depend upon the velocity with powers greater than two while still having a tractable mathematical structure, while also describing the associated branched Hamiltonians for such systems. For various examples, we emphasize upon the emergence of the notion of momentum-dependent mass in the theory of branched Hamiltonians.</description>

      <title>Yangian of the periplectic Lie superalgebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18501v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study in detail the Yangian of the periplectic Lie superalgebra. For this Yangian we verify an analogue of the Poincar\'e-Birkhoff-Witt Theorem. Moreover we introduce a family of free generators of the centre of this Yangian.</description>
