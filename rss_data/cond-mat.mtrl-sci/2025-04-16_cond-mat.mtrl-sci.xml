      <title>Magnetically modified double slit based x-ray interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate an experimental approach to determine magneto-optical effects which combines x-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) with x-ray interferometry, based on the concepts of Young's canonical double slit. By covering one of two slits with a magnetic thin film and employing XMCD, we show that it is possible to determine both the real and the imaginary parts of the complex refractive index by measuring the fringe shifts that occur due to a change in the sample magnetization. Our hybrid spectroscopic-interferometric methodology provides a means to probe changes in the magnetic refractive index in terms of the electron spin moment.</description>

      <title>MatterTune: An Integrated, User-Friendly Platform for Fine-Tuning Atomistic Foundation Models to Accelerate Materials Simulation and Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Geometric machine learning models such as graph neural networks have achieved remarkable success in recent years in chemical and materials science research for applications such as high-throughput virtual screening and atomistic simulations. The success of these models can be attributed to their ability to effectively learn latent representations of atomic structures directly from the training data. Conversely, this also results in high data requirements for these models, hindering their application to problems which are data sparse which are common in this domain. To address this limitation, there is a growing development in the area of pre-trained machine learning models which have learned general, fundamental, geometric relationships in atomistic data, and which can then be fine-tuned to much smaller application-specific datasets. In particular, models which are pre-trained on diverse, large-scale atomistic datasets have shown impressive generalizability and flexibility to downstream applications, and are increasingly referred to as atomistic foundation models. To leverage the untapped potential of these foundation models, we introduce MatterTune, a modular and extensible framework that provides advanced fine-tuning capabilities and seamless integration of atomistic foundation models into downstream materials informatics and simulation workflows, thereby lowering the barriers to adoption and facilitating diverse applications in materials science. In its current state, MatterTune supports a number of state-of-the-art foundation models such as ORB, MatterSim, JMP, and EquformerV2, and hosts a wide range of features including a modular and flexible design, distributed and customizable fine-tuning, broad support for downstream informatics tasks, and more.</description>

      <title>Grain Boundary Space Charge Engineering of Solid Oxide Electrolytes: Model Thin Film Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Grain boundaries (GB) profoundly influence the electrical properties of polycrystalline ionic solids. Yet, precise control of their transport characteristics has remained elusive, thereby limiting the performance of solid-state electrochemical devices. Here, we demonstrate unprecedented manipulation of space charge controlled ionic grain boundary resistance (up to 12 orders of magnitude) in metal oxide thin films. We exploit the orders of magnitude higher grain boundary diffusivities of substrate cation elements (i.e. Al from $Al_2O_3$ and Mg from MgO) relative to the bulk to modify the grain boundary chemistry, and thereby GB core charge, in a model oxygen ion conducting polycrystalline thin film solid electrolyte, Gd-doped $CeO_2$. This approach, confirmed jointly by TEM imaging and by extracting the respective GB and bulk diffusivities from measured SIMS profiles, enabled us to selectively control the chemistry of the GBs, while minimally modifying grain (bulk) chemistry or film microstructure, thereby ruling out potential effects of microstructure, strain or secondary phases. Broad tuning of GB space charge potentials is achieved by manipulating GB core charge density by over an order of magnitude, thereby providing a powerful tool for systematic studies of grain boundary phenomena across various functional materials. The implications of such control are far-reaching in achieving new functionality, improving efficiency and longevity of solid-state electrochemical devices.</description>

      <title>XRD study of the magnetization plateau above 40 T in the frustrated helimagnet CuGaCr$_{4}$S$_{8}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: CuGaCr$_{4}$S$_{8}$, which contains a chromium breathing pyrochlore network, exhibits diverse magnetic phases, including an incommensurate helical state below 31 K and a 1/2-magnetization plateau above 40 T, owing to the interplay between magnetic frustration and spin-lattice coupling. Here, we perform a single-shot powder x-ray diffraction experiment on CuGaCr$_{4}$S$_{8}$ in a pulsed high magnetic field of 55 T, revealing an orthorhombic-to-cubic (or pseudocubic) structural transition upon entering the 1/2-magnetization plateau phase at low temperatures. This observation suggests the emergence of a commensurate ferrimagnetic order, where a 3-up-1-down spin configuration is realized in each small tetrahedron, and the all-up or all-down in each large tetrahedron. We propose two types of 16-sublattice magnetic structures, which are degenerate within exchange interactions between the first, second, and third nearest neighbors.</description>

      <title>Strain effect on optical properties and quantum weight of 2D magnetic topological insulators MnBi$_2$X$_4$ (X = Te, Se, S)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Manipulating the optical and quantum properties of two-dimensional (2D) materials through strain engineering is not only fundamentally interesting but also provides significant benefits across various applications. In this work, we employ first-principles calculations to investigate the effects of strain on the magnetic and optical properties of 2D topological insulators MnBi$_2$X$_4$ (X = Te, Se, S). Our results indicate that biaxial strain enhances the Mn magnetic moment, while uniaxial strains reduce it. Significantly, the strain-dependent behavior, quantified through the quantum weight, can be leveraged to control the system's quantum geometry and topological features. Particularly, uniaxial strains reduce the quantum weight and introduce anisotropy, thus providing an additional degree of freedom to tailor device functionalities. Finally, by analyzing chemical bonds under various strain directions, we elucidate how the intrinsic ductile or brittle fracture behavior of MnBi$_2$X$_4$ could impact fabrication protocols and structural stability. These insights pave the way for strain-based approaches to optimize the quantum properties in 2D magnetic topological insulators in practical device contexts.</description>

      <title>Unusual gas sensor response and semiconductor-to-insulator transition in WO3-x nanostructures : The role of oxygen vacancy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: WO3-x thinfilms featuring petal-like and lamella-like nanostructures are grown under controlled oxygen partial pressures using hot filament chemical vapor deposition. These synthesized WO3-x nanostructures exhibit monoclinic structure and contain a significant amount of oxygen vacancies (VO) as confirmed by X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy, respectively. These WO3-x nanostructures demonstrate sensor response to both NH3 and NO2 gases even at room temperature. However, the sensor response varies with temperature and analyte gas type. For NH3, the sensors exhibit an increase in resistance behaving like a p-type semiconductor at temperatures below 150 0C while the resistance decreases at higher temperatures, resembling n-type semiconductor behavior. On the other hand, below 150 0C, these sensors display n-type behavior towards NO2 but act like p-type semiconductor at higher temperatures. Further temperature dependent transport studies were performed in these WO3-x nanostructures in the temperature range from 25 to 300 oC, after inducing additional VO in the films through annealing under CH4. The petal-like WO3-x nanostructures display an abrupt change in resistance, indicating insulator-to-semiconductor and semiconductor-to-insulator transitions during heating and cooling cycles respectively, in the temperature range of 100 - 212 0C. In lamella-like WO3-x nanostructures, the resistance is flipped from semiconductor-to-insulator at 300 0C and remains insulating state when cooled down to 30 0C. The abnormal gas sensing behavior and insulator - semiconductor transition is discussed in terms of VO in WO3-x nanostructures.</description>

      <title>Raman Fingerprints of Phase Transitions and Ferroic Couplings in Van der Waals Material CuCrP$_2$S$_6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: CuCrP$_2$S$_6$ (CCPS), a type-II multiferroic material, exhibits unique phase transitions involving ferroelectric, antiferroelectric, and antiferromagnetic ordering. In this study, we conduct a comprehensive investigation on the intricate phase transitions and their multiferroic couplings in CCPS across a wide temperature range from 4 to 345 K through Raman spectroscopic measurements down to 5 cm$^{-1}$. We first assign the observed Raman modes with the support of theoretical calculations and angle-resolved polarized Raman measurements. We further present clear signatures of phase transitions from analyses of temperature-dependent Raman spectral parameters. Particularly, two low-frequency soft modes are observed at 36.1 cm$^{-1}$ and 70.5 cm$^{-1}$ below 145 K, indicating the antiferroelectric to quasi-antiferroelectric transition. Moreover, phonon modes hardening is observed when the temperature increases from 4 to 65 K, suggesting negative thermal expansion (NTE) and strong magnetoelastic coupling below 65 K. These findings advance the understanding of vdW multiferroic CCPS, paving the way for future design and engineering of multiferroicity in cutting-edge technologies, such as spintronics and quantum devices.</description>

      <title>douka: A universal platform of data assimilation for materials modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A large-scale, general-purpose data assimilation (DA) platform for materials modeling, douka, was developed and applied to nonlinear materials models. The platform demonstrated its effectiveness in estimating physical properties that cannot be directly obtained from observed data. DA was successfully performed using experimental images of oxygen evolution reaction at a water electrolysis electrode, enabling the estimation of oxygen gas injection velocity and bubble contact angle. Furthermore, large-scale ensemble DA was conducted on the supercomputer Fugaku, achieving state estimation with up to 8,192 ensemble members. The results confirmed that runtime scaling for the prediction step follows the weak scaling law, ensuring computational efficiency even with increased ensemble sizes. These findings highlight the potential of douka as a new approach for data-driven materials science, integrating experimental data with numerical simulation.</description>

      <title>Induced magnetic moment at two-dimensional MXene/ferromagnetic interface evaluated by angle-dependent hard X-ray photoemission spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emergent ferromagnetism on the surface of recent two-dimensional (2D) MXene is investigated by X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) and angle-dependent hard X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (HAXPES). Focusing on the Cr2N as one of the 2D-MXenes, the bilayers of Cr2N/Co and Cr2N/Pt are prepared by magnetron sputtering technique. XMCD reveals the induced magnetic moment of Cr in the Cr2N/Co interface, while it is not observed in the Cr2N/Pt interface at room temperature. To distinguish the possible origins of either the interlayer magnetic exchange coupling or the charge transfer at the interfaces, the additional controlled Cr2N/Cu bilayer, whose work function of Cu is consistent with Co, is prepared. HAXPES spectra for the Cr 2p core level near the interface of Cr2N/Cu is consistent with that of Cr2N/Co, indicating that the induced magnetic moment of Cr observed by XMCD for the Cr2N/Co can be attributed to the interlayer magnetic exchange coupling, rather than the charge transfer, which is a specific characteristics emerged at the interface with 2D-MXene.</description>

      <title>Phonon-polaritons in Zn(1-x)MgxTe (x&lt;0.09): A Raman scattering study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phonon-polaritons (PP) are phonon-photon coupled modes. Using near-forward Raman scattering, the PP of the cubic Zn(1-x)MgxTe (x&lt;0.09) semiconductor alloy could be measured. While the PP-coupling hardly develops in pure ZnTe, minor Mg-alloying suffices to stabilize a long-lifetime PP strongly bound to the lattice, i.e., with a pronounced phonon character, and yet a fast one originating from the highly dispersive photon-like bottleneck of the PP-dispersion. By combining the advantages of a phonon and of a photon, the long-lifetime PP generated by minor Mg-alloying of ZnTe marks an improvement over the PP of pristine ZnTe, that, from the Raman cross section calculation, can only achieve a balanced compromise between the two kinds of advantages, intensity and speed. The discussion of the PP-related lattice dynamics of Zn(1-x)MgxTe (x&lt;0.09) is grounded in a preliminary study of the lattice macro- and microstructure using X-ray diffraction and solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance, respectively, and further relies on ab initio calculations of the native phonon modes behind the PP in the Mg-dilute limit of Zn(1-x)MgxTe (x~0), considering various Mg-isotopes.</description>

      <title>Near-room-temperature zero-dimensional polariton lasers with sub-10 GHz linewidths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Narrow and brilliant spectral lines are essential assets for high-resolution spectroscopy as well as for precision sensing and optomechanics. In semiconductor structures and, in particular, in the well-established (Al,Ga)As material system, strong emission lines with nanosecond coherence times can be provided by the opto-electronic resonances of microcavity exciton-polariton condensates. The temporal coherence of these resonances, however, normally rapidly deteriorates as the temperature increases beyond a few tens of kelvins due to exciton dissociation. Here, we demonstrate that the temperature stability of polariton condensates in (Al,Ga)As can be significantly improved by confinement within micrometer-sized intracavity traps. We show that trapped condensates can survive up to ~200 K while maintaining a light-matter character with decoherence rates below 10 GHz (i.e., $&lt; 40 {\mu}$eV linewidths). These linewidths are by an order of magnitude smaller than those so far reported for other solid-state systems at these temperatures. Confinement thus provides a pathway towards room-temperature polariton condensation using the well-established (Al,Ga)As material system with prospects for application in scalable on-chip photonic devices for optical processing, sensing, and computing.</description>

      <title>Modeling dislocations in quasicrystals through amplitude equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasicrystals (QCs) are a class of aperiodic ordered structures that emerge in various systems, from metallic alloys to soft matter and driven non-equilibrium systems. Within a mesoscale theory based on slowly-varying complex amplitudes for QCs, we track dislocations as topological defects harbored by the amplitudes and characterize their Burgers vectors and induced deformations. We study the formation of dislocations at semicoherent interfaces, particularly those emerging from rotated inclusions, and find a hierarchy of dislocations forming at such interfaces. We further analyze interfaces in strained systems, revealing conditions for the emergence of periodic dislocation arrays and discussing the energetics of dislocations associated with different phonon and phason deformations. The stability, interaction, and motion of dislocation dipoles and quadrupoles are also discussed. These findings provide new insights into the mesoscale modeling of dislocations in QCs and their distinct behavior compared to conventional crystals, while demonstrating a versatile framework for studying dislocations in systems exhibiting quasicrystalline order.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty-aware electronic density-functional distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a method for the estimation of uncertainties in density-functional-theory (DFT) calculations for atomistic systems. The method is based on the construction of an uncertainty-aware functional distribution (UAFD) in a space spanned by a few different exchange-correlation functionals and is illustrated at the level of generalized-gradient-approximation functionals. The UAFD provides reliable estimates of errors -- compared to experiments or higher-quality calculations -- in calculations performed self-consistently with the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof functional. The scheme furthermore allows for a decomposition of the error into a systematic bias and a reduced error. The approach is applied to four different properties: molecular atomization energies, cohesive energies, lattice constants, and bulk moduli of solids. The probability distribution can be tailored to optimize the prediction of a single property or for several properties simultaneously.</description>

Abstract: Zr-Cu-Al alloys belong to a commercially important family of CuZr-based alloys that form bulk metallic glasses on microalloying of Al. However, the identification of compositions with good glass-forming ability and desirable properties from a vast compositional space remains a major challenge due to complex compositional effects on the structure, dynamics and properties. In the present work, we report molecular dynamic investigations of structure, dynamics, thermodynamic and mechanical properties of Zr$_{50}$Cu$_{50-x}$Al$_x$ and Cu$_{50}$Zr$_{50-x}$Al$_x$ alloys ($x=5,10,15,20,25,30,40$) covering a wide compositional space. Our results and findings lead to some important conclusions that could serve as overarching guidelines for choosing good glass-forming alloy compositions that give Zr-Cu-Al glasses with tailored thermal and mechanical properties. Overall, present results suggest that a good glass-forming Zr-Cu-Al alloy composition leading to an MG with good thermal and mechanical properties should be Cu-rich with Zr concentration in the window 30\%-35\% and Al\% &gt; 20. Our results also highlight the impact of icosahedral short- and medium-range ordering on the dynamics and mechanical properties of the alloys. It is observed that the fractions of the full icosahedra $\langle 0,0,12,0 \rangle$ and the degree of their interconnectivity are directly correlated to the structural relaxation, diffusion, dynamic heterogeneity and mechanical properties.</description>

      <title>Adjustable Molecular Cross-Linkage of MXene Layers for Tunable Charge Transport and VOC Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: MXenes, two-dimensional transition metal carbides, nitrides or carbonitrides, are emerging as highly promising materials due to their remarkable charge transport characteristics and their versatile surface chemistry. Herein, we demonstrate the tunability of interfaces and the inter-layer spacing between Ti$_3$C$_2$T$_X$ MXene flakes through molecular cross-linking via ligand exchange with homologous diamines. Oleylamine was initially introduced as a ligand, to facilitate the delamination and stable dispersion of pristine Ti$_3$C$_2$T$_X$ flakes in chloroform. Subsequently, controlled cross-linkage of the flakes was achieved using diamine ligands with varying aliphatic chain lengths, enabling the precise tuning of the inter-layer spacing. Grazing incidence X-ray scattering (GIXRD / GIWAXS) confirmed the correlation between ligand chain length and inter-layer spacing, which was further supported by Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations. Furthermore, we investigated the charge transport properties of thin films consisting of these diamine cross-linked MXenes and observed a strong dependence of the conductivity on the interlayer spacing. Finally, we probed chemiresistive vapor sensing properties of the MXene composites and observed a pronounced sensitivity and selectivity towards water vapor, highlighting their potential for use in humidity sensors. Providing significant insights into molecular cross-linking of MXenes to form hybrid inorganic/organic composites and its consequences for charge transport, this study opens avenues for the development of next-generation MXene-based electronic devices.</description>

      <title>Accurate Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials for Polyacene Molecular Crystals: Application to Single Molecule Host-Guest Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emerging machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) offer a promising solution for large-scale accurate material simulations, but stringent tests related to the description of vibrational dynamics in molecular crystals remain scarce. Here, we develop a general MLIP by leveraging the graph neural network-based MACE architecture and active-learning strategies to accurately capture vibrational dynamics across a range of polyacene-based molecular crystals, namely naphthalene, anthracene, tetracene and pentacene. Through careful error propagation, we show that these potentials are accurate and enable the study of anharmonic vibrational features, vibrational lifetimes, and vibrational coupling. In particular, we investigate large-scale host-guest systems based on these molecular crystals, showing the capacity of molecular-dynamics-based techniques to explain and quantify vibrational coupling between host and guest nuclear motion. Our results establish a framework for understanding vibrational signatures in large-scale complex molecular systems and thus represent an important step for engineering vibrational interactions in molecular environments.</description>

      <title>Ab initio Maxwell-Bloch Approach for X-Ray Excitations in Two-Dimensional Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The combination of Maxwell and X-ray Bloch equations forms an appropriate framework to describe ultrafast time-resolved X-ray experiments on attosecond time scale in crystalline solids. However, broadband experiments such as X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy or resonant inelastic X-ray scattering require a detailed knowledge of the electronic structure and transition matrix elements. Here, we show how to fill this gap by combining the Maxwell-X-ray Bloch formalism with first-principles calculations treating explicitly the core states. The resulting X-ray absorption spectrum recovers key spectral signatures which were missing in our previous work relying on a semi-empirical tight-binding approach.</description>

      <title>Emergent Magnetic Structures at the 2D Limit of the Altermagnet MnTe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: MnTe has recently emerged as a canonical altermagnet, a newly identified class of magnetism characterized by compensated antiferromagnetic order coexisting with spin-split electronic bands, traditionally considered exclusive to ferromagnets. However, the extent to which altermagnetism persists as altermagnets are thinned to the two-dimensional (2D) limit remains unexplored. Here, we investigate the magnetic behaviour of 2D MnTe, specifically atomically-thin monolayers (MLs) and bilayers (BLs) grown on graphene/Ir(111) substrate, by combining experimental scanning tunneling microscopy, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, x-ray absorption spectroscopy and x-ray magnetic circular dichroism with density functional theory calculations. We find that while ML and BL MnTe adopt atomic structures with symmetries incompatible with altermagnetism, they exhibit intriguing magnetic phases: the BL forms a highly-robust layered antiferromagnet with in-plane spin anisotropy, whereas the ML exhibits a spin-glass-like behavior below its freezing temperature, a phenomenon not previously observed in an atomically thin material. These findings highlight how reduced dimensionality can promote the emergence of unusual magnetic structures distinct from those of their three-dimensional counterparts, providing new insights into low-dimensional magnetism.</description>

      <title>Influence of a Xenon interlayer on dissociative electron attachment to deuterated methane on a platinum substrate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of intercalating a xenon layer between a thin condensed CD4 film of two monolayers (ML) and a platinum surface on the dissociative electron attachment (DEA). The observed desorption results are compared with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, which reveal the binding energies of various anionic and neutral species as a function of the xenon film thickness on the Pt (111) substrate. The theoretical results suggest that 6 ML of xenon are sufficient to diminish the surface effect, enabling physisorbed anionic fragments to desorb from the CD4 film. In contrast, 20 ML (approximately 10 nm) are experimentally necessary to achieve saturation in the desorption of D-. In addition, the presence of xenon layers enables the coupling of resonance states with Xe excited states, thereby inhibiting the electrons from returning to the metal. Aside from reducing surface interactions, the xenon interlayer significantly enhances DEA to CD4.</description>

      <title>Energy-resolved tip-orbital fingerprint in scanning tunneling spectroscopy based on the revised Chen's derivative rule</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The revised Chen's derivative rule for electron tunneling is implemented to enable computationally efficient first-principles-based calculations of the differential conductance dI/dV for scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) simulations. The probing tip is included through a single tip apex atom, and its electronic structure can be modeled as a linear combination of electron orbitals of various symmetries, or can be directly transferred from first-principles electronic structure calculations. By taking pristine and boron- or nitrogen-doped graphene sheets as sample surfaces, the reliability of our implementation is demonstrated by comparing its results to those obtained by the Tersoff-Hamann and Bardeen's electron tunneling models. It is highlighted that the energy-resolved direct and interference contributions to dI/dV arising from the tip's electron orbitals result in a fingerprint of the particular combined surface-tip system. The significant difference between the electron acceptor boron and donor nitrogen dopants in graphene is reflected in their dI/dV fingerprints. The presented theoretical method allows for an unprecedented physical understanding of the electron tunneling process in terms of tip-orbital-resolved energy-dependent dI/dV maps, that is anticipated to be extremely useful for investigating the local electronic properties of novel material surfaces in the future.</description>

      <title>Crystal nucleation and growth in high-entropy alloys revealed by atomic electron tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-entropy alloys (HEAs) balance mixing entropy and intermetallic phase formation enthalpy, creating a vast compositional space for structural and functional materials (1-6). They exhibit exceptional strength-ductility trade-offs in metallurgy (4-10) and near-continuum adsorbate binding energies in catalysis (11-16). A deep understanding of crystal nucleation and growth in HEAs is essential for controlling their formation and optimizing their structural and functional properties. However, atomic-scale nucleation in HEAs challenges traditional theories based on one or two principal elements (17-23). The intricate interplay of structural and chemical orders among multiple principal elements further obscures our understanding of nucleation pathways (5,24-27). Due to the lack of direct three-dimensional (3D) atomic-scale observations, previous studies have relied on simulations and indirect measurements (28-32), leaving HEA nucleation and growth fundamentally elusive. Here, we advance atomic electron tomography (33,34) to resolve the 3D atomic structure and chemical composition of 7,662 HEA and 498 medium-entropy alloy nuclei at different nucleation stages. We observe local structural order that decreases from core to boundary, correlating with local chemical order. As nuclei grow, structural order improves. At later stages, most nuclei coalesce without misorientation, while some form coherent twin boundaries. To explain these experimental observations, we propose the gradient nucleation pathways model, in which the nucleation energy barrier progressively increases through multiple evolving intermediate states. We expect these findings to not only provide fundamental insights into crystal nucleation and growth in HEAs, but also offer a general framework for understanding nucleation mechanisms in other materials.</description>

      <title>Deciphering the Structure of Push-Pull Conjugated Polymer Aggregates in Solution and Film</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The morphology of conjugated polymer films is highly tunable, influencing their performance in organic electronics. Specifically, molecular packing or crystal structure strongly influence electronic processes such as light absorption and charge transfer. However, the unit cells of high-performance electron donor polymers remain unknown, limiting the understanding of how processing affects structure and device performance. This study characterizes the aggregate structure of PM6-type push-pull polymers using X-ray scattering, cryogenic electron microscopy, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. A novel forward simulation approach linking grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) with MD resolves a monoclinic unit cell that accurately describes PM6-type polymer aggregates in both thin films and casting solutions. Intimate pi-pi stacking between donor and acceptor units emerges from this unit cell. Analysis of experimental GIWAXS using this unit cell quantifies sliding disorder in these aggregates, which may impact device performance. The shape and internal structure of solution aggregates are also identified in chlorobenzene. These findings enhance our understanding of PM6-type polymer packing, outline a strategy for elucidating the crystal structure of weakly ordered materials, and provide an opportunity to control optoelectronic performance through aggregate formation in PM6 and other push-pull conjugated polymers.</description>

      <title>Development of microwave surface elastoresistivity measurement technique under tunable strain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By integrating a dielectric microwave resonator with a piezoelectric-based strain device, we develop an in situ strain-tunable microwave spectroscopy technique that enables contactless measurements of superconducting properties under strain. In the slightly overdoped iron-based superconductor BaFe$_2$(As$_{1-x}$P$_x$)$_2$, we successfully observe a systematic strain dependence of the superconducting transition, manifested as changes in the quality factor and resonance frequency shifts. Both compressive and tensile anisotropic lattice distortions along the [110]${_{\rm T}}$ direction suppress superconductivity, consistent with standard transport measurements, highlighting the pivotal role of nematic fluctuations in the superconducting mechanism. Our strain-tunable cavity therefore serves as a powerful, contactless probe of fundamental superconducting material properties under strain and may also potentially facilitate the design of hybrid quantum systems with strain-controlled quantum degrees of freedom.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work the synthesis and characterization of novel gold-nanodiamond nanoparticles was performed. The synthesis was based on the reduction of gold onto the different types of nanodiamond (annealed or annealed and oxidized, 50 or 230 nm) using root extracts of Nympheaea alba as a reducing agent. These gold-coated nanodiamonds were characterized by UV-Vis, PXRD, DLS, zeta-potential, PIXE, Raman, SEM, and TEM, assessing particle size, stability, and gold coating effectiveness. Cellular studies in the A549 and Panc1 cancer cell lines assessed uptake, cytotoxicity, and colony formation to evaluate NDAu's biological activity. NDAu demonstrated strong cellular uptake and cytotoxic effects in A549 and Panc1 cell lines, reducing cell survival in clonogenic assay. Futher research in the capabilites of these nanoparticles for proton therapy will be performed.</description>

      <title>Electronic transport properties of titanium nitride grown by molecular beam epitaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the molecular beam epitaxial (MBE) growth of titanium nitride (TiN) thin films, achieving a high residual resistivity ratio (RRR) of 15.8. We observed a strong correlation between growth temperature and crystalline quality, as reflected in both RRR values and lattice parameter variations. Characterization of superconductivity yielded a Ginzburg-Landau coherence length of 60.4 $\pm$ 0.6 nm, significantly higher than typical sputtered films, suggesting improved superconducting coherence. First-principles calculations, in conjunction with experimental data, provided detailed insights into the electronic structure and transport properties of the TiN films. Temperature-dependent Hall coefficient measurements further revealed the influence of anisotropic scattering mechanisms. These findings establish a promising route for the development of nitride-based superconducting materials for advanced quantum computing technologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11145v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gradual modification of the magnetic properties in ferromagnetic films has recently been proposed as an effective method to channel and control spin waves for the development of new functionalities in magnonic devices. Here, we investigate graded FeN films prepared by low-dose nitrogen implantation of Fe epitaxial thin films. Combining Brillouin light scattering measurements and a spin-wave theoretical approach, we show that nitrogen implantation induces a graded profile of both the in-plane and the perpendicular anisotropies along the film thickness. This graduation leads to a significant modification of the spin-wave spatial localization and generates a marked frequency asymmetry in the spin-wave dispersion. Moreover, we find that the anisotropy profile, and as a consequence the dispersion relation, can be tuned on changing the implantation dose, opening a way for the potential use of the graded Fe-N films in magnonic applications.</description>

      <title>Field-effect detected magnetic resonance of NV centers in diamond based on all-carbon Schottky contacts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11192v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nitrogen vacancy (NV) center is a defect in diamond whose spin state can be read optically by exploiting its photoluminescence or electrically by exploiting its charge generation rate under illumination, both of which being spin-dependent. The latter method offers numerous opportunities in terms of integration and performance compared to conventional optical reading. Here, we investigate the physical properties of a graphitic-diamond-graphitic structure under illumination. We show how, for a type IIa diamond material, electron-hole pairs generated by an ensemble of NV centers lead to a p-type material upon illumination, making this all-carbon structure equivalent to two back-to-back Schottky diodes. We analyze how the reverse current flowing upon illumination changes as a function of bias voltage and radiofrequency-induced excitation of the NV ensemble spin resonances. Furthermore, we demonstrate how an additional field effect arising from the illumination scheme affects the reverse current, resulting in a photoelectrical signal that can exceed the optical signal under the same illumination conditions.</description>

Abstract: The phase retrieval problem is a fundamental shortcoming of all diffraction-based methods, arising from the inability to measure the phase of scattered waves. The (normal incidence) X-ray standing wave (NIXSW) technique circumvents this issue by introducing a (Bragg-generated) X-ray standing wave field throughout the sample, relative to which any atomic species can be localized by probing its fluorescence or photoelectron yield. In essence, in a single measurement the complex scattering factor (i.e., its amplitude \textit{and} phase) corresponding to the used Bragg reflection is determined. Performing this for multiple Bragg reflections enables one to reconstruct the scattering density of the sample in three dimensions, straightforwardly as the Fourier sum of all measured (complex) scattering factors. Here, we utilize this technique to reveal the structural key features involved in the formation of the quantum spin Hall insulator bismuthene on silicon carbide. In this prominent example, the two-dimensional Bi layer is confined between a 4H-SiC substrate crystal and an epitaxial graphene layer. The key finding is a change in the adsorption site of the Bi atoms underneath the graphene upon hydrogenation, caused by the H-saturation of one (out of three) Si dangling bonds per unit cell. This structural change, clearly revealed by our NIXSW imaging experiment, is the key feature leading to the formation of the characteristic band structure of the 2D bismuthene honeycomb.</description>

      <title>X-type stacking in cross-chain antiferromagnets</title>

Abstract: Physical phenomena in condensed matter normally arise from the collective effect of all atoms, while selectively addressing a lone atomic sublattice by external stimulus is elusive. The later functionality may, however, benefit various applications, as the response may differ when the external stimulus affects only a specific sublattice rather than the entire solid. Here, we introduce cross-chain antiferromagnets, where the stacking of two magnetic sublattices forms a pattern of intersecting atomic chains, allowing for the sublattice selectivity. We dub this antiferromagnetic (AFM) stacking X-type and demonstrate that it exhibits unique spin-dependent transport properties not present in conventional magnets. Through high-throughput analyses and computations, we unveil three prototypes of X-type AFM stacking and identify 15 candidate candidates. Using $\beta$-Fe$_{2}$PO$_{5}$ as a representative X-type antiferromagnet, we predict sublattice-selective spin-polarized transport driven by the X-type stacking, where one magnetic sublattice conducts, while the other does not. Consequently, a spin torque can be exerted solely on a single sublattice, leading to unconventional ultrafast dynamics of the N\`eel vector capable of deterministic switching of the AFM domains. Our work uncovers a previously overlooked type of magnetic moment stacking and reveals sublattice-selective physical properties promising for high-performance spintronic applications.</description>

      <title>OmniXAS: A Universal Deep-Learning Framework for Materials X-ray Absorption Spectra</title>

Abstract: X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) is a powerful characterization technique for probing the local chemical environment of absorbing atoms. However, analyzing XAS data presents significant challenges, often requiring extensive, computationally intensive simulations, as well as significant domain expertise. These limitations hinder the development of fast, robust XAS analysis pipelines that are essential in high-throughput studies and for autonomous experimentation. We address these challenges with OmniXAS, a framework that contains a suite of transfer learning approaches for XAS prediction, each contributing to improved accuracy and efficiency, as demonstrated on K-edge spectra database covering eight 3d transition metals (Ti-Cu). The OmniXAS framework is built upon three distinct strategies. First, we use M3GNet to derive latent representations of the local chemical environment of absorption sites as input for XAS prediction, achieving up to order-of-magnitude improvements over conventional featurization techniques. Second, we employ a hierarchical transfer learning strategy, training a universal multi-task model across elements before fine-tuning for element-specific predictions. Models based on this cascaded approach after element-wise fine-tuning outperform element-specific models by up to 69%. Third, we implement cross-fidelity transfer learning, adapting a universal model to predict spectra generated by simulation of a different fidelity with a higher computational cost. This approach improves prediction accuracy by up to 11% over models trained on the target fidelity alone. Our approach boosts the throughput of XAS modeling by orders of magnitude versus first-principles simulations and is extendable to XAS prediction for a broader range of elements. This transfer learning framework is generalizable to enhance deep-learning models that target other properties in materials research.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10910v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a program named KPROJ that unfolds the electronic and phononic band structure of materials modeled by supercells. The program is based on the $\textit{k}$-projection method, which projects the wavefunction of the supercell onto the ${\textbf{k}}$-points in the Brillouin zone of the artificial primitive cell. It allows for obtaining an effective "local" band structure by performing partial integration over the wavefunctions, e.g., the unfolded band structure with layer-projection for interfaces and the weighted band structure in the vacuum for slabs. The layer projection is accelerated by a scheme that combines the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and the inverse FFT algorithms. It is now interfaced with a few first-principles codes based on plane waves such as VASP, Quantum Espresso, and ABINIT. In addition, it also has interfaces with ABACUS, a first-principles simulation package based on numerical atomic basis sets, and PHONOPY, a program for phonon calculations.</description>

      <title>Terahertz electro-optic effect in Bi$_2$Se$_3$ crystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20277v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the observation of the electro-optic effect in Bi$_2$Se$_3$ crystals induced by an intense single-cycle terahertz pulse. The effect reveals itself as a transient change of the polarization state of a femtosecond laser pulse reflected from the crystal that is exposed to the terahertz electric field. The corresponding experimental signal follows the field with a sub-100-fs delay and can be represented as a linear combination of the terahertz electric field and its square. The linear and quadratic components are of comparable magnitude. The latter is almost independent of crystal orientation, while the former demonstrates three-fold rotational symmetry in agreement with the trigonal symmetry of the crystal surface. The electro-optic effect vanishes upon phase transition to the non-topological metal state induced by indium doping and also can be quenched by a femtosecond pre-pulse. We associate this effect with surface Dirac electronic states of Bi$_2$Se$_3$ and discuss its possible mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Predicting ionic conductivity in solids from the machine-learned potential energy landscape</title>

Abstract: Discovering new superionic materials is essential for advancing solid-state batteries, which offer improved energy density and safety compared to the traditional lithium-ion batteries with liquid electrolytes. Conventional computational methods for identifying such materials are resource-intensive and not easily scalable. Recently, universal interatomic potential models have been developed using equivariant graph neural networks. These models are trained on extensive datasets of first-principles force and energy calculations. One can achieve significant computational advantages by leveraging them as the foundation for traditional methods of assessing the ionic conductivity, such as molecular dynamics or nudged elastic band techniques. However, the generalization error from model inference on diverse atomic structures arising in such calculations can compromise the reliability of the results. In this work, we propose an approach for the quick and reliable screening of ionic conductors through the analysis of a universal interatomic potential. Our method incorporates a set of heuristic structure descriptors that effectively employ the rich knowledge of the underlying model while requiring minimal generalization capabilities. Using our descriptors, we rank lithium-containing materials in the Materials Project database according to their expected ionic conductivity. Eight out of the ten highest-ranked materials are confirmed to be superionic at room temperature in first-principles calculations. Notably, our method achieves a speed-up factor of approximately 50 compared to molecular dynamics driven by a machine-learning potential, and is at least 3,000 times faster compared to first-principles molecular dynamics.</description>

      <title>Ferromagnetic Resonance in a Magnetically Dilute Percolating Ferromagnet: An Experimental and Theoretical Study</title>

Abstract: Ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) serves as a powerful probe of magnetization dynamics and anisotropy in percolating ferromagnets, where short-range interactions govern long-range magnetic order. We apply this approach to Ga$_{1-x}$Mn$_x$N ($x \simeq 8$\%), a dilute ferromagnetic semiconductor, combining FMR and superconducting quantum interference device magnetometry. Our results confirm the percolative nature of ferromagnetism in (Ga,Mn)N, with a Curie temperature $T_{\mathrm{C}} = 12$ K, and reveal that despite magnetic dilution, key features of conventional ferromagnets are retained. FMR measurements establish a robust uniaxial anisotropy, dictated by Mn$^{3+}$ single-ion anisotropy, with an easy-plane character at low Mn content. While excessive line broadening suppresses FMR signals below 9 K, they persist up to 70~K, indicating the presence of non-percolating ferromagnetic clusters well above $T_{\mathrm{C}}$. The temperature dependence of the FMR intensity follows that of the magnetization, underscoring the stability of these clusters. We quantitatively describe both FMR and SQUID observables using atomistic spin model operating on a common set of parameters. The level of agreement, achieved without tuning parameters between datasets, demonstrates the robustness and practical applicability of the approach in capturing the essential physics of spin-diluted, percolating ferromagnets. This study advances the understanding of percolating ferromagnetic systems, demonstrating that FMR is a key technique for probing their unique dynamic and anisotropic properties. Our findings contribute to the broader exploration of dilute ferromagnets and provide new insights into percolating ferromagnetic systems, which will be relevant for spintronic opportunities.</description>

Abstract: Altermagnets, which exhibit spin-split electronic bands without net magnetization, provide an appealing platform for exploring unconventional spin and ferroic physics. Through symmetry analyses and first-principles calculations, we show that monolayer \(\mathrm{VOX_2}\) (\(\mathrm{X = Cl, Br, I}\)) is a two-dimensional (2D) ferroelectric altermagnet (FEAM). The spin splitting in its electronic band structure can be precisely tuned by ferroelectric polarization and magnetic order, accompanied by a giant magnetoelectric coupling coefficient. Owing to the absence of inversion symmetry, this material also exhibits pronounced nonlinear optical responses. The altermagnetic \(\mathrm{VOI_2}\) monolayer show an exceptionally large spin shift current of up to \(330.072\,\mu\mathrm{A}/\mathrm{V}^2\), which is switchable by reversing the magnetic order. These results uncover a strong interplay between magnetic and ferroelectric orders, offering a route toward electrically and magnetically tunable nonlinear spin photocurrents in 2D multiferroic systems.</description>

Abstract: Triggered by the development of exfoliation and the identification of a wide range of extraordinary physical properties in self-standing films consisting of one or few atomic layers, two-dimensional (2D) materials such as graphene, transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), and other van der Waals (vdW) crystals currently constitute a wide research field protruding in multiple directions in combination with layer stacking and twisting, nanofabrication, surface-science methods, and integration into nanostructured environments. Photonics encompasses a multidisciplinary collection of those directions, where 2D materials contribute with polaritons of unique characteristics such as strong spatial confinement, large optical-field enhancement, long lifetimes, high sensitivity to external stimuli (e.g., electric and magnetic fields, heating, and strain), a broad spectral range from the far infrared to the ultraviolet, and hybridization with spin and momentum textures of electronic band structures. The explosion of photonics with 2D materials as a vibrant research area is producing breakthroughs, including the discovery and design of new materials and metasurfaces with unprecedented properties as well as applications in integrated photonics, light emission, optical sensing, and exciting prospects for applications in quantum information, and nanoscale thermal transport. This Roadmap summarizes the state of the art in the field, identifies challenges and opportunities, and discusses future goals and how to meet them through a wide collection of topical sections prepared by leading practitioners.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional perovskites with maximum symmetry enable exciton diffusion length exceeding 2 micrometers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08121v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Realizing semiconductors with high symmetry of their crystallographic structures has been a virtue of inorganic materials and has resulted in novel physical behaviors. In contrast, hybrid (organic and inorganic) crystals such as two-dimensional metal halide perovskites exhibit much lower crystal symmetry due to in-plane or out of plane octahedral distortions. Despite their amazing ability for photoinduced light emission at room temperature, the Achilles' heel of this attractive class of 2D materials for optoelectronics remains the poor control and lack of performance for charge carrier transport. Inspired by the tremendous charge carrier properties of the 3D cubic perovskite phase of FAPbI3 and combining the use of the appropriate cage cation, the spacer molecule and the temperature and rate of crystallization, we report a new series of FA-based layered two-dimensional perovskites that exhibits the highest theoretically predicted symmetry with a tetragonal P4/mmm space group, resulting in no octahedral distortion in both in-plane and out-of-plane directions. These 2D perovskites present the shortest interlayer distances (4 angstrom), which results in systematically lower bandgaps (1.7 to 1.8 eV). Finally, the absence of octahedral distortions, results in an exciton diffusion length of 2.5 {\mu}m, and a diffusivity of 4.4 cm2s-1, both of which are an order of magnitude larger compared to previously reported 2D perovskites and on par with monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides.</description>

Abstract: The demand for advanced photonics technology is increasing rapidly, fueled by the necessity for high-performance and cost-effective optical information processing systems extending into the quantum domain. Silicon, benefiting from its mature fabrication processes, stands as an ideal platform. However, its inherent indirect bandgap leads to inefficient light emission. The integration of III-V materials has been proven essential to overcome this drawback. These materials are recognized for their efficient light emission and superior bandgap engineering capabilities, making them indispensable in photonics and beyond. Here, we present the monolithic integration of small-volume III-V nanoheterostructures with silicon via selective area epitaxy in the pyramidal openings etched in (100)-oriented silicon substrate. The precise positioning of the nano-heterostructures is achieved using electron beam lithography. Our atomic resolution imaging and chemical analysis confirms the epitaxial nature of InP growth, revealing well-defined heterointerfaces. Each structure incorporates an InAsP quantum dot-like active medium, and the correlation of the growth parameters with the nanoscale structure was analyzed using advanced electron microscopy. The eight-band k.p calculations demonstrate energy level quantization in three spatial dimensions. Optical characterization shows that heterostructure emission can be engineered to cover the entire telecom wavelength range. Consequently, these InAsP/InP nano-heterostructures could serve as a gain medium for silicon-based hybrid nano-lasers and nano-LEDs and quantum light sources in the telecom wavelength range.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10382v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bending the edge of a thin elastic material promotes rigidity far from its clamped boundary. However, this curvature-induced rigidity can be overwhelmed by gravity or other external loading, resulting in elastic buckling and large deformations. We consider the role of body geometry on this competition using experiments, numerical simulations, and reduced-order models. Finite element simulations are performed using a model nonlinear hyperelastic material, and a theoretical framework is proposed that incorporates small lateral curvatures, large longitudinal rotations, and a varying cross-sectional width. A particular focus is on the comparison between rectangular and triangular sheets, and trapezoidal sheets in between. Sheet geometry affects downward tip deflection by changing the relative importance of the sheet's weight and the rigidity provided by curvature, often in subtle ways. In extreme cases, non-monotonic deflection is observed with increasing sheet length, and a region of hysteretic bistability emerges, becoming more pronounced with rectangular sheets and large imposed curvatures. These findings demonstrate the profound impact of geometry on the competition between curvature-induced rigidity and gravity-induced deformation in thin elastic materials.</description>

      <title>Multi-Length-Scale Dopants Analysis of an Image Sensor via Focused Ion Beam-Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry and Atom Probe Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08980v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The following article presents a multi-length-scale characterization approach for investigating doping chemistry and spatial distributions within semiconductors, as demonstrated using a state-of-the-art CMOS image sensor. With an intricate structural layout and varying doping types/concentration levels, this device is representative of the current challenges faced in measuring dopants within confined volumes using conventional techniques. Focused ion beam-secondary ion mass spectrometry is applied to produce large-area compositional maps with a sub-20 nm resolution, while atom probe tomography is used to extract atomic-scale quantitative dopant profiles. Leveraging the complementary capabilities of the two methods, this workflow is shown to be an effective approach for resolving nano- and micro- scale dopant information, crucial for optimizing the performance and reliability of advanced semiconductor devices.</description>

      <title>Excited States of the Uniform Electron Gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02378v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The uniform electron gas (UEG) is a cornerstone of density-functional theory (DFT) and the foundation of the local-density approximation (LDA), one of the most successful approximations in DFT. In this work, we extend the concept of UEG by introducing excited-state UEGs, systems characterized by a gap at the Fermi surface created by the excitation of electrons near the Fermi level. We report closed-form expressions of the reduced kinetic and exchange energies of these excited-state UEGs as functions of the density and the gap. Additionally, we derive the leading term of the correlation energy in the high-density limit. By incorporating an additional variable representing the degree of excitation into the UEG paradigm, the present work introduces a new framework for constructing local and semi-local state-specific functionals for excited states.</description>

      <title>Backscattering in Topological Edge States Despite Time-Reversal Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11497v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spin-momentum-locked edge states of quantum spin Hall insulators (QSHIs) provide a compelling platform for spintronic applications, owing to their intrinsic protection against backscattering from non-magnetic disorder. This protection emerges from time-reversal symmetry, which pairs Kramers partners of helical edge modes with opposite spin and momentum, thereby strictly forbidding elastic single-particle backscattering within the pair. Yet, contrary to the idealized notion of linear edge bands, the non-monotonic dispersions of realistic materials can host multiple Kramers pairs, reintroducing backscattering channels between them without violating time-reversal symmetry. Here, we investigate inter-Kramers pair backscattering in the non-linear edge bands of the QSHI indenene, highlighting a critical aspect of edge-state stability. Using quasiparticle interference in scanning tunneling spectroscopy -- a direct probe of backscattering -- we observe pairwise coupling between energy-degenerate Kramers pairs, while energy regions with only a single Kramers pair remain strictly protected. Supported by theoretical analysis, our findings provide an unprecedented experimental demonstration of edge state backscattering fully consistent with their underlying topological protection. This insight has profound implications for numerous QSHI candidates, emphasizing that the mere presence of gap-traversing edge modes does not inherently guarantee their protection against backscattering.</description>

      <title>Chemical enhancement of superconductivity in LaRu3Si2 with mode-selective coupling between kagome phonons and flat bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22477v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In kagome metals, flat electronic bands induced by frustrated hopping are a platform for strong electron correlations. In particular, a selective coupling of flat band states to certain kagome phonon modes is proposed as a universal origin of superconductivity in this material class. Here, we investigate the superconductivity in the kagome system LaRu$_3$(Si$_{1-x}$Ge$_x$)$_2$ by chemical pressure tuning while preserving the Ru-$4d$ states that constitute the kagome flat bands. We observe a sizable enhancement in the density of states up to $x = 0.07$, as determined by the specific heat, with a concomitant increase in the superconducting transition temperature $T_\mathrm{c}$. Ge-dopants induce a uniaxial lattice expansion along the $c$-axis. Our first-principles calculations suggest that this mitigates the detrimental effect of hybridization between kagome layers and reduces the dispersion of the Ru-$4d_{x^2-y^2}$ flat band. The calculated chemical potential moves closer to the maximum in the energy-dependent density of states. Our result is consistent with a theoretical prediction of tunable flat band superconductivity in LaRu$_3$Si$_2$ by mode-selective coupling between specific kagome phonons and the Ru-$d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals.</description>
