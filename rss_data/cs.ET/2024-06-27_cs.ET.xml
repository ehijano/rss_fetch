      <title>The Impact of Feature Representation on the Accuracy of Photonic Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photonic Neural Networks (PNNs) are gaining significant interest in the research community due to their potential for high parallelization, low latency, and energy efficiency. PNNs compute using light, which leads to several differences in implementation when compared to electronics, such as the need to represent input features in the photonic domain before feeding them into the network. In this encoding process, it is common to combine multiple features into a single input to reduce the number of inputs and associated devices, leading to smaller and more energy-efficient PNNs. Although this alters the network's handling of input data, its impact on PNNs remains understudied. This paper addresses this open question, investigating the effect of commonly used encoding strategies that combine features on the performance and learning capabilities of PNNs. Here, using the concept of feature importance, we develop a mathematical framework for analyzing feature combination. Through this framework, we demonstrate that encoding multiple features together in a single input determines their relative importance, thus limiting the network's ability to learn from the data. Given some prior knowledge of the data, however, this can also be leveraged for higher accuracy. By selecting an optimal encoding method, we achieve up to a 12.3\% improvement in accuracy of PNNs trained on the Iris dataset compared to other encoding techniques, surpassing the performance of networks where features are not combined. These findings highlight the importance of carefully choosing the encoding to the accuracy and decision-making strategies of PNNs, particularly in size or power constrained applications.</description>

      <title>Commodification of Compute</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancements in artificial intelligence, big data analytics, and cloud computing have precipitated an unprecedented demand for computational resources. However, the current landscape of computational resource allocation is characterized by significant inefficiencies, including underutilization and price volatility. This paper addresses these challenges by introducing a novel global platform for the commodification of compute hours, termed the Global Compute Exchange (GCX) (Patent Pending). The GCX leverages blockchain technology and smart contracts to create a secure, transparent, and efficient marketplace for buying and selling computational power. The GCX is built in a layered fashion, comprising Market, App, Clearing, Risk Management, Exchange (Offchain), and Blockchain (Onchain) layers, each ensuring a robust and efficient operation. This platform aims to revolutionize the computational resource market by fostering a decentralized, efficient, and transparent ecosystem that ensures equitable access to computing power, stimulates innovation, and supports diverse user needs on a global scale. By transforming compute hours into a tradable commodity, the GCX seeks to optimize resource utilization, stabilize pricing, and democratize access to computational resources. This paper explores the technological infrastructure, market potential, and societal impact of the GCX, positioning it as a pioneering solution poised to drive the next wave of innovation in commodities and compute.</description>

      <title>Neuromorphic hardware for sustainable AI data centers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02521v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As humans advance toward a higher level of artificial intelligence, it is always at the cost of escalating computational resource consumption, which requires developing novel solutions to meet the exponential growth of AI computing demand. Neuromorphic hardware takes inspiration from how the brain processes information and promises energy-efficient computing of AI workloads. Despite its potential, neuromorphic hardware has not found its way into commercial AI data centers. In this article, we try to analyze the underlying reasons for this and derive requirements and guidelines to promote neuromorphic systems for efficient and sustainable cloud computing: We first review currently available neuromorphic hardware systems and collect examples where neuromorphic solutions excel conventional AI processing on CPUs and GPUs. Next, we identify applications, models and algorithms which are commonly deployed in AI data centers as further directions for neuromorphic algorithms research. Last, we derive requirements and best practices for the hardware and software integration of neuromorphic systems into data centers. With this article, we hope to increase awareness of the challenges of integrating neuromorphic hardware into data centers and to guide the community to enable sustainable and energy-efficient AI at scale.</description>
