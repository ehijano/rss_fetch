      <title>Poincar\'e invariance, the Unruh effect, and black hole evaporation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In quantum field theory, the vacuum is widely considered to be a complex medium populated with virtual particle + antiparticle pairs. To an observer experiencing uniform acceleration, it is generally held that these virtual particles become real, appearing as a gas at a temperature which grows with the acceleration. This is the Unruh effect. However, it can be shown that vacuum complexity is an artifact, produced by treating quantum field theory in a manner that does not manifestly enforce causality. Choosing a quantization approach that patently enforces causality, the quantum field theory vacuum is barren, bereft even of virtual particles. We show that acceleration has no effect on a trivial vacuum; hence, there is no Unruh effect in such a treatment of quantum field theory. Since the standard calculations suggesting an Unruh effect are formally consistent, insofar as they have been completed, there must be a cancelling contribution that is omitted in the usual analyses. We argue that it is the dynamical action of conventional Lorentz transformations on the structure of an Unruh detector. Given the equivalence principle, an Unruh effect would correspond to black hole radiation. Thus, our perspective has significant consequences for quantum gravity and black hole physics: no Unruh effect entails the absence of black hole radiation evaporation.</description>
