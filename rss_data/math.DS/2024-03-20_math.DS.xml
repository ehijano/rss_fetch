      <title>Local spectral estimates and quantitative weak mixing for substitution $\mathbb{Z}$-actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper investigates H\"older and log-H\"older regularity of spectral measures for weakly mixing substitutions and the related question of quantitative weak mixing. It is assumed that the substitution is primitive, aperiodic, and its substitution matrix is irreducible over the rationals. In the case when there are no eigenvalues of the substitution matrix on the unit circle, our main theorem says that a weakly mixing substitution $\mathbb{Z}$-action has uniformly log-H\"older regular spectral measures, and hence admits power-logarithmic bounds for the rate of weak mixing. In the more delicate Salem substitution case, our second main result says that H\"older regularity holds for algebraic spectral parameters, but the H\"older exponent cannot be chosen uniformly.</description>

      <title>Iterated Monodromy Group With Non-Martingale Fixed-Point Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12165v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct families of rational functions $f: \mathbb{P}^1_k \rightarrow \mathbb{P}^1_k$ of degree $d \geq 2$ over a perfect field $k$ with non-martingale fixed-point processes. Then for any normal variety $X$ over $\mathbb{P}_{\bar{k}}^N$, we give conditions on $f: X \rightarrow X$ to guarantee that the associated fixed-point process is a martingale. This work extends the previous work of Bridy, Jones, Kelsey, and Lodge ~\cite{iterated} on martingale conditions and answers their question on the existence of a non-martingale fixed-point process associated with the iterated monodromy group of a rational function.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic reachable sets of stochastic nonlinear systems with contextual uncertainties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12379v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Validating and controlling safety-critical systems in uncertain environments necessitates probabilistic reachable sets of future state evolutions. The existing methods of computing probabilistic reachable sets normally assume that the uncertainties are independent of the state. However, this assumption falls short in many real-world applications, where uncertainties are state-dependent, referred to as contextual uncertainties. This paper formulates the problem of computing probabilistic reachable sets of stochastic nonlinear states with contextual uncertainties by seeking minimum-volume polynomial sublevel sets with contextual chance constraints. The formulated problem cannot be solved by the existing sample-based approximation method since the existing methods do not consider the conditional probability densities. To address this, we propose a consistent sample approximation of the original problem by leveraging the conditional density estimation and resampling. The obtained approximate problem is a tractable optimization problem. Additionally, we prove the almost uniform convergence of the proposed sample-based approximation, showing that it gives the optimal solution almost consistently with the original ones. Through a numerical example, we evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method against existing approaches, highlighting its capability to significantly reduce the bias inherent in sample-based approximation without considering a conditional probability density.</description>

      <title>Importance sampling for rare event tracking within the ensemble Kalman filtering framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we employ importance sampling (IS) techniques to track a small over-threshold probability of a running maximum associated with the solution of a stochastic differential equation (SDE) within the framework of ensemble Kalman filtering (EnKF). Between two observation times of the EnKF, we propose to use IS with respect to the initial condition of the SDE, IS with respect to the Wiener process via a stochastic optimal control formulation, and combined IS with respect to both initial condition and Wiener process. Both IS strategies require the approximation of the solution of Kolmogorov Backward equation (KBE) with boundary conditions. In multidimensional settings, we employ a Markovian projection dimension reduction technique to obtain an approximation of the solution of the KBE by just solving a one dimensional PDE. The proposed ideas are tested on two illustrative examples: Double Well SDE and Langevin dynamics, and showcase a significant variance reduction compared to the standard Monte Carlo method and another sampling-based IS technique, namely, multilevel cross entropy.</description>

      <title>Projections of four corner Cantor set: total self-similarity, spectrum and unique codings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.11241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.11241v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given $\rho\in (0,1/4]$, the four corner Cantor set $E\subset \mathbb{R}^{2}$ is a self-similar set generated by the iterated function system
  \[
  \left\{(\rho x, \rho y), \quad(\rho x, \rho y+1-\rho),\quad (\rho x+1-\rho, \rho y),\quad(\rho x+1-\rho,\rho y+1-\rho)\right\}.
  \]
  For $\theta\in[0,\pi)$ let $E_\theta$ be the orthogonal projection of $E$ onto a line with an angle $\theta$ to the $x$-axis. In this paper we give a complete characterization on which the projection $E_\theta$ is totally self-similar. We also study the spectrum of $E_\theta $, which turns out that the spectrum of $E_\theta$ achieves its maximum value if and only if $E_\theta $ is totally self-similar. Furthermore, when $E_\theta$ is totally self-similar, we calculate its Hausdorff dimension and study the subset $U_\theta $ which consists of all $x\in E_\theta $ having a unique coding. In particular, we show that $\dim_H U_\theta=\dim_H E_\theta$ for Lebesgue almost every $\theta \in[0,\pi)$. Finally, for $\rho=1/4$ we describe the distribution of $\theta $ in which $E_\theta$ contains an interval. It turns out that the possibility for $E_\theta$ to contain an interval is smaller than that for $E_\theta$ to have an exact overlap.</description>

      <title>The High-Frequency and Rare Events Barriers to Neural Closures of Atmospheric Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.04331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.04331v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent years have seen a surge in interest for leveraging neural networks to parameterize small-scale or fast processes in climate and turbulence models. In this short paper, we point out two fundamental issues in this endeavor. The first concerns the difficulties neural networks may experience in capturing rare events due to limitations in how data is sampled. The second arises from the inherent multiscale nature of these systems. They combine high-frequency components (like inertia-gravity waves) with slower, evolving processes (geostrophic motion). This multiscale nature creates a significant hurdle for neural network closures. To illustrate these challenges, we focus on the atmospheric 1980 Lorenz model, a simplified version of the Primitive Equations that drive climate models. This model serves as a compelling example because it captures the essence of these difficulties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.13972v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the distribution and multiple occurrences of extreme events stochastic processes constructed by sampling the solution of a Stochastic Differential Equation on $\mathbb{R}^n$. We do so by studying the action of an annealead transfer operators on ad-hoc spaces of probability densities. The spectral properties of such operators are obtained by employing a mixture of techniques coming from SDE theory and a functional analytic approach to dynamical systems.</description>

Abstract: In this short note, we investigate non-invertible stochastic dynamical systems on the unit interval $[0, 1]$. We provide a handy condition for unique ergodicity for systems that are injective in mean. On the other hand, we give concrete examples where unique ergodicity fails.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Systems on Compact Metrizable Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.19074v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is aim to extend Kenneth R. Berg's findings on the maximal entropy theorem and the ergodicity of measure convolution to the case of surjective homomorphisms.
  We further explores dynamical systems under surjective homomorphism in detail, especially the variation of entropy. Let $G_{1} $ and $G_{2} $ be compact metrizable groups, and suppose that $G_{2} $ acts freely on $G_{1} $, the continuous mapping $T_{1} $ and homomorphism $T_{2} :G_{2} \to G_{2} $ satisfy $T_{1} (yx)=T_{2} (y)T_{1} (x)$, where $y\in G_{2} ,{\rm \; }x\in G_{1} $. If $\mu _{0} \in M(T_{0} )$, $\mu _{0} '$ is the Haar extention of $\mu _{0} $, we proved that when $\mu \in $$M(T_{1} ,\mu _{0} )$, the entropy $h(T_{1} ,\mu _{0} '){\rm \; }$is always greater than or equal to $h(T_{1} ,\mu )$; if $\mu _{0} '$ is ergodic with respect to $T_{1} $, and the Haar measure $m$ on $G_{2} $ is ergodic with respect to $T_{2} $, and if $h(T_{1} ,\mu _{0} ')&lt;\infty $, then the entropy $h(T_{1} ,\mu _{0} '){\rm \; }$is greater than $h(T_{1} ,\mu ).$
  Finally, this paper also specifically discusses the ergodicity of the convolution of invariant measures. Let $T$ be a surjective homomorphism on $G$, if $(G,T,{\rm {\mathcal F}},\mu )$ and$(G,T,{\rm {\mathcal F}},\nu )$ are disjoint ergodic dynamical systems, then $\mu *\nu $ is ergodic. Via a proof by contradiction, the study demonstrates that the measure convolution of two disjoint ergodic dynamical systems can maintain ergodicity under the condition that $T$is a surjective homomorphism on $G$.</description>

      <title>Finite Time Stability Analysis for Fractional Stochastic Neutral Delay Differential Equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00650v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this manuscript, we delve into the study of a stochastic differential equation with a fractional order and a time delay, encompassing deterministic and stochastic components. Our primary aim is to rigorously establish the existence of a unique solution that follows specified initial conditions, achieved through mathematical analysis. Moreover, we extend our research to investigate the finite-time stability of the system, analyzing trajectory behavior within a specific time frame. Employing advanced mathematical techniques, we systematically verify the finite-time stability, providing insights into convergence and stability within this defined interval. By employing illustrative examples, we strengthen this all-encompassing investigation into the intricate dynamics and stability properties that exist in fractionally ordered stochastic systems with time delays.</description>

      <title>Unique double base expansions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.02373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.02373v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For two real bases $q_0, q_1 &gt; 1$, we consider expansions of real numbers of the form $\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} i_k/(q_{i_1}q_{i_2}\cdots q_{i_k})$ with $i_k \in \{0,1\}$, which we call $(q_0,q_1)$-expansions. A sequence $(i_k)$ is called a unique $(q_0,q_1)$-expansion if all other sequences have different values as $(q_0,q_1)$-expansions, and the set of unique $(q_0,q_1)$-expansions is denoted by $U_{q_0,q_1}$. In the special case $q_0 = q_1 = q$, the set $U_{q,q}$ is trivial if $q$ is below the golden ratio and uncountable if $q$ is above the Komornik--Loreti constant. The curve separating pairs of bases $(q_0, q_1)$ with trivial $U_{q_0,q_1}$ from those with non-trivial $U_{q_0,q_1}$ is the graph of a function $\mathcal{G}(q_0)$ that we call generalized golden ratio. Similarly, the curve separating pairs $(q_0, q_1)$ with countable $U_{q_0,q_1}$ from those with uncountable $U_{q_0,q_1}$ is the graph of a function $\mathcal{K}(q_0)$ that we call generalized Komornik--Loreti constant. We show that the two curves are symmetric in $q_0$ and $q_1$, that $\mathcal{G}$ and $\mathcal{K}$ are continuous, strictly decreasing, hence almost everywhere differentiable on $(1,\infty)$, and that the Hausdorff dimension of the set of $q_0$ satisfying $\mathcal{G}(q_0)=\mathcal{K}(q_0)$ is zero. We give formulas for $\mathcal{G}(q_0)$ and $\mathcal{K}(q_0)$ for all $q_0 &gt; 1$, using characterizations of when a binary subshift avoiding a lexicographic interval is trivial, countable, uncountable with zero entropy and uncountable with positive entropy respectively. Our characterizations in terms of $S$-adic sequences including Sturmian and the Thue--Morse sequences are simpler than those of Labarca and Moreira (2006) and Glendinning and Sidorov (2015), and are relevant also for other open dynamical systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.07019v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce and study the \emph{Fourier spectrum} which is a continuously parametrised family of dimensions living between the Fourier dimension and the Hausdorff dimension for both sets and measures. We establish some fundamental theory and motivate the concept via several applications, especially to sumset type problems. For example, we study dimensions of convolutions and sumsets, and solve the distance set problem for sets satisfying certain Fourier analytic conditions.</description>

Abstract: We study the problem of unlikely intersections for automorphisms of Markov surfaces of positive entropy. We show for certain parameters that two automorphisms with positive entropy share a Zariski dense set of periodic points if and only if they share a common iterate. Our proof uses arithmetic equidistribution for adelic line bundles over quasiprojective varieties, the theory of laminar currents and quasi-Fuchsian representation theory.</description>
