      <title>Online Fair Allocations with Binary Valuations and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In an online fair allocation problem, a sequence of indivisible items arrives online and needs to be allocated to offline agents immediately and irrevocably. In our paper, we study the online allocation of either goods or chores. We adapt popular fairness notions, including envy-freeness up to one item (EF1) and maximin share fairness (MMS), and use utilitarian social welfare (USW) to measure efficiency. For both settings of items, we present a series of positive results regarding the existence of fair and efficient allocations with widely studied classes of binary and bivalued valuation/cost functions. Additionally, we complement our results by constructing some counterexamples to establish our results as among the best guarantees possible.</description>

      <title>Balancing incentives in committee-based blockchains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Blockchain protocols incentivize participation through monetary rewards, assuming rational actors behave honestly to maximize their gains. However, attackers may attempt to harm others even at personal cost. These denial of profit attacks aim to reduce the rewards of honest participants, potentially forcing them out of the system. While existing work has largely focused on the profitability of attacks, they often neglect the potential harm inflicted on the victim, which can be significant even when the attacker gains little or nothing.
  This paper introduces a framework to quantify denial of profit attacks by measuring both attacker cost and victim loss. We model these attacks as a game and introduce relevant metrics to quantify these attacks. We then focus on committee-based blockchains and model vote collection as a game. We show that in the vote collection game, disincentivizing one denial of profit attack will make another attack more appealing, and therefore, attacks have to be balanced. We apply our framework to analyze real-world reward mechanisms in Ethereum and Cosmos. Our framework reveals imbalances in Cosmos that can make correct behavior suboptimal in practice. While Ethereum provides stronger protections, our framework shows that it is also not complete, and we propose alternative parameter settings to improve the balance between attacks. Our findings highlight the need for better-balanced reward designs to defend against denial of profit attacks.</description>

      <title>Online Fair Division with Additional Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of fairly allocating indivisible goods to agents in an online setting, where goods arrive sequentially and must be allocated irrevocably to agents. Focusing on the popular fairness notions of envy-freeness, proportionality, and maximin share fairness (and their approximate variants), we ask how the availability of information on future goods influences the existence and approximability of fair allocations. In the absence of any such information, we establish strong impossibility results, demonstrating the inherent difficulty of achieving even approximate fairness guarantees. In contrast, we demonstrate that knowledge of additional information -- such as aggregate of each agent's total valuations (equivalently, normalized valuations) or the multiset of future goods values (frequency predictions) -- would enable the design of fairer online algorithms. Given normalization information, we propose an algorithm that achieves stronger fairness guarantees than previously known results. Given frequency predictions, we introduce a meta-algorithm that leverages frequency predictions to match the best-known offline guarantees for a broad class of ''share-based'' fairness notions. Our complementary impossibility results in each setting underscore both the limitations imposed by uncertainty about future goods and the potential of leveraging structured information to achieve fairer outcomes in online fair division.</description>

      <title>Online Budget-Feasible Mechanism Design with Predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Augmenting the input of algorithms with predictions is an algorithm design paradigm that suggests leveraging a (possibly erroneous) prediction to improve worst-case performance guarantees when the prediction is perfect (consistency), while also providing a performance guarantee when the prediction fails (robustness). Recently, Xu and Lu [2022] and Agrawal et al. [2024] proposed to consider settings with strategic agents under this framework. In this paper, we initiate the study of budget-feasible mechanism design with predictions. These mechanisms model a procurement auction scenario in which an auctioneer (buyer) with a strict budget constraint seeks to purchase goods or services from a set of strategic agents, so as to maximize her own valuation function. We focus on the online version of the problem where the arrival order of agents is random. We design mechanisms that are truthful, budget-feasible, and achieve a significantly improved competitive ratio for both monotone and non-monotone submodular valuation functions compared to their state-of-the-art counterparts without predictions. Our results assume access to a prediction for the value of the optimal solution to the offline problem. We complement our positive results by showing that for the offline version of the problem, access to predictions is mostly ineffective in improving approximation guarantees.</description>

      <title>Emergent LLM behaviors are observationally equivalent to data leakage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ashery et al. recently argue that large language models (LLMs), when paired to play a classic "naming game," spontaneously develop linguistic conventions reminiscent of human social norms. Here, we show that their results are better explained by data leakage: the models simply reproduce conventions they already encountered during pre-training. Despite the authors' mitigation measures, we provide multiple analyses demonstrating that the LLMs recognize the structure of the coordination game and recall its outcomes, rather than exhibit "emergent" conventions. Consequently, the observed behaviors are indistinguishable from memorization of the training corpus. We conclude by pointing to potential alternative strategies and reflecting more generally on the place of LLMs for social science models.</description>

      <title>Looking for Attention: Randomized Attention Test Design for Validator Monitoring in Optimistic Rollups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optimistic Rollups (ORUs) significantly enhance blockchain scalability but inherently suffer from the verifier's dilemma, particularly concerning validator attentiveness. Current systems lack mechanisms to proactively ensure validators are diligently monitoring L2 state transitions, creating a vulnerability where fraudulent states could be finalized. This paper introduces the Randomized Attention Test (RAT), a novel L1-based protocol designed to probabilistically challenge validators in ORUs, thereby verifying their liveness and computational readiness. Our game-theoretic analysis demonstrates that an Ideal Security Equilibrium, where all validators are attentive and proposers are honest, can be achieved with RAT. Notably, this equilibrium is attainable and stable with relatively low economic penalties (e.g., under $1000) for non-responsive validators and a low attention test frequency (e.g., under 1% per epoch). RAT thus provides a crucial, practical mechanism to enforce validator diligence, fortifying the overall security and integrity of ORU systems with minimizing additional costs.</description>

      <title>Stop Guessing: Optimizing Goalkeeper Policies for Soccer Penalty Kicks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24629v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Penalties are fraught and game-changing moments in soccer games that teams explicitly prepare for. Consequently, there has been substantial interest in analyzing them in order to provide advice to practitioners. From a data science perspective, such analyses suffer from a significant limitation: they make the unrealistic simplifying assumption that goalkeepers and takers select their action -- where to dive and where to the place the kick -- independently of each other. In reality, the choices that some goalkeepers make depend on the taker's movements and vice-versa. This adds substantial complexity to the problem because not all players have the same action capacities, that is, only some players are capable of basing their decisions on their opponent's movements. However, the small sample sizes on the player level mean that one may have limited insights into a specific opponent's capacities. We address these challenges by developing a player-agnostic simulation framework that can evaluate the efficacy of different goalkeeper strategies. It considers a rich set of choices and incorporates information about a goalkeeper's skills. Our work is grounded in a large dataset of penalties that were annotated by penalty experts and include aspects of both kicker and goalkeeper strategies. We show how our framework can be used to optimize goalkeeper policies in real-world situations.</description>

      <title>On Incentivizing Social Information Sharing Through Routing Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.13301v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Crowdsourcing services, such as Waze, leverage a mass of mobile users to learn massive point-of-interest (PoI) information while traveling and share it as a public good. Given that crowdsourced users mind their travel costs and possess various preferences over the PoI information along different paths, we formulate the problem as a novel non-atomic multi-path routing game with positive network externalities among users in social information sharing. In the absence of any incentive design, our price of anarchy (PoA) analysis shows that users' selfish routing on the path with the lowest cost will limit information diversity and lead to $PoA = 0$ with an arbitrarily large efficiency loss from the social optimum. This motivates us to design effective incentive mechanisms to remedy while upholding desirable properties such as individual rationality, incentive compatibility, and budget balance for practical users. Without requiring a specific user's path preference, we present a non-monetary mechanism called Adaptive Information Restriction (AIR) that reduces non-cooperative users' access to the public good as an indirect penalty, which meets all the desirable properties. By meticulously adapting penalty fractions to the actual user flows along different paths, our AIR achieves non-trivial $PoA = \frac{1}{4}$ with low complexity $O(k\log k+\log m)$, where $k$ and $m$ denote the numbers of involved paths and user types, respectively. If the system can further enable pricing for users, we then propose a new monetary mechanism called Adaptive Side-Payment (ASP), which adaptively charges and rewards users according to their chosen paths, respectively. Our ASP mechanism successively achieves a $PoA = \frac{1}{2}$ with even reduced complexity $O(k\log k)$. Finally, our theoretical findings are well corroborated by our experimental results using a real-world public dataset.</description>

      <title>Fair Division via Resource Augmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09377v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce and formalize the notion of resource augmentation for maximin share allocations -- an idea that can be traced back to the seminal work of Budish [JPE 2011]. Specifically, given a fair division instance with $m$ goods and $n$ agents, we ask how many copies of the goods should be added in order to guarantee that each agent receives at least their original maximin share, or an approximation thereof. We establish a tight bound of $m/e$ copies for arbitrary monotone valuations. For additive valuations, we show that at most $\min\{n-2,\lfloor \frac{m}{3}\rfloor (1+o(1))\}$ copies suffice. For approximate-MMS in ordered instances, we give a tradeoff between the number of copies needed and the approximation guarantee. In particular, we prove that $\lfloor n/2 \rfloor$ copies suffice to guarantee a $6/7$-approximation to the original MMS, and $\lfloor n/3 \rfloor$ copies suffice for a $4/5$-approximation. Both results improve upon the best known approximation guarantees for additive valuations in the absence of copies.</description>

      <title>A Linear Programming Approach to the Super-Stable Roommates Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16052v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The stable roommates problem is a non-bipartite version of the well-known stable matching problem. Teo and Sethuraman proved that, for each instance of the stable roommates problem in a complete graph, there exists a linear inequality system such that there exists a feasible solution to this system if and only if there exists a stable matching in the given instance. The aim of this paper is to extend the result of Teo and Sethuraman to the stable roommates problem with ties. More concretely, we prove that, for each instance of the stable roommates problem with ties in a complete graph, there exists a linear inequality system such that there exists a feasible solution to this system if and only if there exists a super-stable matching in the given instance.</description>

      <title>Modelling bounded rational decision-making through Wasserstein constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03743v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modelling bounded rational decision-making through information constrained processing provides a principled approach for representing departures from rationality within a reinforcement learning framework, while still treating decision-making as an optimization process. However, existing approaches are generally based on Entropy, Kullback-Leibler divergence, or Mutual Information. In this work, we highlight issues with these approaches when dealing with ordinal action spaces. Specifically, entropy assumes uniform prior beliefs, missing the impact of a priori biases on decision-makings. KL-Divergence addresses this, however, has no notion of "nearness" of actions, and additionally, has several well known potentially undesirable properties such as the lack of symmetry, and furthermore, requires the distributions to have the same support (e.g. positive probability for all actions). Mutual information is often difficult to estimate. Here, we propose an alternative approach for modeling bounded rational RL agents utilising Wasserstein distances. This approach overcomes the aforementioned issues. Crucially, this approach accounts for the nearness of ordinal actions, modeling "stickiness" in agent decisions and unlikeliness of rapidly switching to far away actions, while also supporting low probability actions, zero-support prior distributions, and is simple to calculate directly.</description>
