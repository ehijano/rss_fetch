      <title>Electro-mechanical wrinkling of soft dielectric films bonded to hyperelastic substrates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21488v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Active control of wrinkling in soft film-substrate composites using electric fields is a critical challenge in tunable material systems.
  Here, we investigate the electro-mechanical instability of a soft dielectric film bonded to a hyperelastic substrate, revealing the fundamental mechanisms that enable on-demand surface patterning. For the linearized stability analysis, we use the Stroh formalism and the surface impedance method to obtain exact and sixth-order approximate bifurcation equations that signal the onset of wrinkles.
  We derive the explicit bifurcation equations giving the critical stretch and critical voltage for wrinkling, as well as the corresponding critical wavenumber.
  We look at scenarios where the voltage is kept constant and the stretch changes, and vice versa.
  We provide the thresholds of the shear modulus ratio $r_{\rm c}^0$ or pre-stretch $\lambda_{\rm c}^0$ below which the film-substrate system wrinkles mechanically, prior to the application of a voltage.
  These predictions offer theoretical guidance for practical structural design, as the shear modulus ratio $r$ and/or the pre-stretch $\lambda$ can be chosen to be slightly greater than $r_{\rm c}^0$ and/or $\lambda_{\rm c}^0$, so that the film-substrate system wrinkles with a small applied voltage.
  Finally, we simulate the full nonlinear behavior using the Finite Element method (FEniCS) to validate our formulas and conduct a post-buckling analysis. This work advances the fundamental understanding of electro-mechanical wrinkling instabilities in soft material systems. By enabling active control of surface morphologies via applied electric fields, our findings open new avenues for adaptive technologies in soft robotics, flexible electronics, smart surfaces, and bioinspired systems.</description>

      <title>Sharp Interface Dynamics in a Minimal Non-Reciprocal Cahn-Hilliard System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interest in non-reciprocally coupled systems recently led to the introduction of a minimal non-reciprocally coupled Cahn-Hilliard (CH) model by Brauns and Marchetti in 2024 arXiv:2306.08868, which we refer to as the Brauns-Marchetti (BM) model. This model can be seen as a conservative counterpart to the spatially extended FitzHugh-Nagumo model. Lacking a gradient structure, the BM model was observed to exhibit interesting dynamics including traveling periodic wave-trains and other coherent structures, as well as spatiotemporal chaos in certain parameter regimes. In this paper, we derive an effective equation for the interface dynamics of solutions to the BM model in $\mathbb{R}^2$ in the sharp-interface limit. The resulting system of equations is a generalization of the classical Mullins-Sekerka (MS) equations, which we refer to as the modified MS equations. We show that the modified MS equation shares some properties with its classical counterpart, but importantly, it is not in general a length minimizing flow. To illustrate the utility of this asymptotic reduction in the sharp interface limit, we perform a detailed analysis of stationary and periodic wave-trains, systematically deriving expressions for wave-train speeds and stability thresholds. The methods used here should be applicable to other non-reciprocally coupled CH models and therefore provide another avenue for their more detailed analysis.</description>

      <title>Tunable optical lattices for the creation of matter-wave lattice solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22471v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present experimental techniques that employ an optical accordion lattice with dynamically tunable spacing to create and study bright matter-wave solitons in optical lattices. The system allows precise control of lattice parameters over a wide range of lattice spacings and depths. We detail calibration methods for the lattice parameters that are adjusted to the varying lattice spacing, and we demonstrate site-resolved atom number preparation via microwave addressing. Lattice solitons are generated through rapid quenches of the atomic interaction strength and the external trapping potential. We systematically optimize the quench parameters, such as duration and final scattering length, to maximize soliton stability. Our results provide insight into nonlinear matter-wave dynamics in discretized systems and establish a versatile platform for the controlled study of lattice solitons.</description>

      <title>The Glider Equation for Asymptotic Lenia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04167v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lenia is a continuous extension of Conway's Game of Life that exhibits rich pattern formations including self-propelling structures called gliders. In this paper, we focus on Asymptotic Lenia, a variant formulated as partial differential equations. By utilizing this mathematical formulation, we analytically derive the conditions for glider patterns, which we term the ``Glider Equation.'' We demonstrate that by using this equation as a loss function, gradient descent methods can successfully discover stable glider configurations. This approach enables the optimization of update rules to find novel gliders with specific properties, such as faster-moving variants. We also derive a velocity-free equation that characterizes gliders of any speed, expanding the search space for novel patterns. While many optimized patterns result in transient gliders that eventually destabilize, our approach effectively identifies diverse pattern formations that would be difficult to discover through traditional methods. Finally, we establish connections between Asymptotic Lenia and neural field models, highlighting mathematical relationships that bridge these systems and suggesting new directions for analyzing pattern formation in continuous dynamical systems.</description>
