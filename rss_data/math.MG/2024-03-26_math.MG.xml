      <title>Vietoris-Rips Complexes of Split-Decomposable Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Split-metric decompositions are an important tool in the theory of phylogenetics, particularly because of the link between the tight span and the class of totally decomposable spaces, a generalization of metric trees whose decomposition does not have a ``prime'' component. We use this connection to study the Vietoris-Rips complexes of totally decomposable spaces. In particular, we characterize the homotopy type of the Vietoris-Rips complex of circular decomposable spaces whose metric is monotone. We extend this result to compute the homology of certain non-monotone circular decomposable spaces. We also use the block decomposition of the tight span of a totally decomposable metric to induce a decomposition of the VR complex of a totally decomposable metric.</description>

      <title>Optimality of spherical codes via exact semidefinite programming bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the spectral embeddings of all known triangle-free strongly regular graphs are optimal spherical codes (the new cases are $56$ points in $20$ dimensions, $50$ points in $21$ dimensions, and $77$ points in $21$ dimensions), as are certain mutually unbiased basis arrangements constructed using Kerdock codes in up to $1024$ dimensions (namely, $2^{4k} + 2^{2k+1}$ points in $2^{2k}$ dimensions for $2 \le k \le 5$). As a consequence of the latter, we obtain optimality of the Kerdock binary codes of block length $64$, $256$, and $1024$, as well as uniqueness for block length $64$. We also prove universal optimality for $288$ points on a sphere in $16$ dimensions. To prove these results, we use three-point semidefinite programming bounds, for which only a few sharp cases were known previously. To obtain rigorous results, we develop improved techniques for rounding approximate solutions of semidefinite programs to produce exact optimal solutions.</description>

      <title>On the Maximum Theta Series over Unimodular Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The theta series of a lattice has been extensively studied in the literature and is closely related to a critical quantity widely used in the fields of physical layer security and cryptography, known as the flatness factor, or equivalently, the smoothing parameter of a lattice. Both fields raise the fundamental question of determining the (globally) maximum theta series over a particular set of volume-one lattices, namely, the stable lattices.
  In this work, we present a property of unimodular lattices, a subfamily of stable lattices, to verify that the integer lattice $\mathbb{Z}^{n}$ achieves the largest possible value of theta series over the set of unimodular lattices. Such a result moves towards proving the conjecture recently stated by Regev and Stephens-Davidowitz: any unimodular lattice, except for those lattices isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}^{n}$, has a strictly smaller theta series than that of $\mathbb{Z}^{n}$. Our techniques are mainly based on studying the ratio of the theta series of a unimodular lattice to the theta series of $\mathbb{Z}^n$, called the secrecy ratio. We relate the Regev and Stephens-Davidowitz conjecture with another conjecture for unimodular lattices, known in the literature as the Belfiore-Sol{\'e} conjecture. The latter assumes that the secrecy ratio of any unimodular lattice has a symmetry point, which is exactly where the global minimum of the secrecy ratio is achieved.</description>

      <title>Positive mass and isoperimetry for continuous metrics with nonnegative scalar curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper deals with the positive mass theorem and the existence of isoperimetric sets on $3$-manifolds endowed with continuous complete metrics having nonnegative scalar curvature in a suitable weak sense.
  We prove that if the manifold has an end that is $C^0$-locally asymptotically flat, and the metric is the local uniform limit of smooth metrics with vanishing lower bounds on the scalar curvature outside a compact set, then Huisken's isoperimetric mass is nonnegative. This addresses a version of a recent conjecture of Huisken about positive isoperimetric mass theorems for continuous metrics satisfying $R_g\geq 0$ in a weak sense. As a consequence, any fill-in of a truncation of a Schwarzschild space with negative ADM mass has nonnegative isoperimetric mass.
  Moreover, in case the whole manifold is $C^0$-locally asymptotically flat and the metric is the local uniform limit of smooth metrics with vanishing lower bounds on the scalar curvature outside a compact set, we prove that, as a large scale effect, isoperimetric sets with arbitrarily large volume exist.</description>

      <title>Angular constraints on planar frameworks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16145v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider a collection of points and the sets of slopes or directions of the lines between pairs of points. It is known that the algebraic matroid on this set of elements is the well studied 2-dimensional rigidity matroid. This article analyzes a construction on top of the set of slopes given by an angle constraint system of incidences and angles. In this setting we provide a matricial rigidity formulation of the problem for colored graphs, an algebro-geometric reformulation, precise necessary conditions and a combinatorial characterization of the generic behaviour for a special case.</description>

      <title>Dowker-type theorems for disk-polygons in normed planes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.04026v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A classical result of Dowker (Bull. Amer. Math. Soc. 50: 120-122, 1944) states that for any plane convex body $K$ in the Euclidean plane, the areas of the maximum (resp. minimum) area convex $n$-gons inscribed (resp. circumscribed) in $K$ is a concave (resp. convex) sequence. It is known that this theorem remains true if we replace area by perimeter, the Euclidean plane by an arbitrary normed plane, or convex $n$-gons by disk-$n$-gons, obtained as the intersection of $n$ closed Euclidean unit disks. The aim of our paper is to investigate these problems for $C$-$n$-gons, defined as intersections of $n$ translates of the unit disk $C$ of a normed plane. In particular, we show that Dowker's theorem remains true for the areas and the perimeters of circumscribed $C$-$n$-gons, and the perimeters of inscribed $C$-$n$-gons. We also show that in the family of origin-symmetric plane convex bodies, for a typical element $C$ with respect to Hausdorff distance, Dowker's theorem for the areas of inscribed $C$-$n$-gons fails.</description>

      <title>Higher-Order Reverse Isoperimetric Inequalities for Log-concave Functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05712v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Rogers-Shephard and Zhang's projection inequalities are two reverse, affine isoperimetric inequalities relating the volumes of a convex body and its difference body and polar projection body, respectively. Following a classical work by Schneider, both inequalities have been extended to the so-called higher-order setting. In this work, we establish the higher-order analogues for these inequalities in the setting of log-concave functions.</description>

      <title>On restricted projections to planes in $\mathbb{R}^3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.13844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.13844v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\gamma:[0,1]\rightarrow \mathbb{S}^{2}$ be a non-degenerate curve in $\mathbb{R}^3$, that is to say, $\det\big(\gamma(\theta),\gamma'(\theta),\gamma"(\theta)\big)\neq 0$. For each $\theta\in[0,1]$, let
  $V_\theta=\gamma(\theta)^\perp$ and let
  $\pi_\theta:\mathbb{R}^3\rightarrow V_\theta$ be the orthogonal projections. We prove that if $A\subset \mathbb{R}^3$ is a Borel set, then for a.e. $\theta\in [0,1]$ we have $\text{dim}(\pi_\theta(A))=\min\{2,\text{dim} A\}$.
  More generally, we prove an exceptional set estimate. For $A\subset\mathbb{R}^3$ and $0\le s\le 2$, define $E_s(A):=\{\theta\in[0,1]: \text{dim}(\pi_\theta(A))&lt;s\}$. We have $\text{dim}(E_s(A))\le 1+s-\text{dim}(A)$.
  We also prove that if $\text{dim}(A)&gt;2$, then for a.e. $\theta\in[0,1]$ we have $\mathcal{H}^2(\pi_\theta (A))&gt;0$.</description>

      <title>Rigidity of locally symmetric rank one manifolds of infinite volume</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04104v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss questions by Mostow \cite{Mo1}, Bers \cite{B} and Krushkal \cite{Kr1, Kr2} about uniqueness of a conformal or spherical CR structure on the sphere at infinity $\partial H_\mathbb{F}^n$ of symmetric rank one space $H_\mathbb{F}^n$ over division algebra $\mathbb{F}=\mathbb{R}\,,\mathbb{C}\,,\mathbb{H}\,,\text{or}\,\, \mathbb{O} $ compatible with the action of a discrete group $G\subset\operatorname{Isom}H_\mathbb{F}^n$. Introducing a nilpotent Sierpi\'{n}ski carpet with a positive Lebesgue measure in the nilpotent geometry in $\partial H_\mathbb{F}^n\setminus\{\infty\}$ and its stretching, we construct a non-rigid discrete $\mathbb{F}$-hyperbolic groups $G\subset\operatorname{Isom}H_\mathbb{F}^n$ whose non-trivial deformations are induced by $G$-equivariant homeomorphisms of the space. Here we consider two situations: either the limit set $\Lambda(G)$ is the whole sphere at infinity $\partial H_\mathbb{F}^n$ or restrictions of such non-trivial deformations to components of the discontinuity set $\Omega(G)\subset \partial H_\mathbb{F}^n$ are given by restrictions of $\mathbb{F}$-hyperbolic isometries. In both cases the demonstrated non-rigidity is related to non-ergodic dynamics of the discrete group action on the limit set which could be the whole sphere at infinity.</description>
