      <title>A Layered Architecture for Developing and Enhancing Capabilities in Large Language Model-based Software Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Significant efforts has been made to expand the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) beyond basic language tasks. While the generalizability and versatility of LLMs have enabled widespread adoption, evolving demands in application development often exceed their native capabilities. Meeting these demands may involve a diverse set of methods, such as enhancing creativity through either inference temperature adjustments or creativity-provoking prompts. Selecting the right approach is critical, as different methods lead to trade-offs in engineering complexity, scalability, and operational costs. This paper introduces a layered architecture that organizes LLM software system development into distinct layers, each characterized by specific attributes. By aligning capabilities with these layers, the framework encourages the systematic implementation of capabilities in effective and efficient ways that ultimately supports desired functionalities and qualities. Through practical case studies, we illustrate the utility of the framework. This work offers developers actionable insights for selecting suitable technologies in LLM-based software system development, promoting robustness and scalability.</description>

      <title>Can Agents Spontaneously Form a Society? Introducing a Novel Architecture for Generative Multi-Agents to Elicit Social Emergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06750v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generative agents have demonstrated impressive capabilities in specific tasks, but most of these frameworks focus on independent tasks and lack attention to social interactions. We introduce a generative agent architecture called ITCMA-S, which includes a basic framework for individual agents and a framework called LTRHA that supports social interactions among multi-agents. This architecture enables agents to identify and filter out behaviors that are detrimental to social interactions, guiding them to choose more favorable actions. We designed a sandbox environment to simulate the natural evolution of social relationships among multiple identity-less agents for experimental evaluation. The results showed that ITCMA-S performed well on multiple evaluation indicators, demonstrating its ability to actively explore the environment, recognize new agents, and acquire new information through continuous actions and dialogue. Observations show that as agents establish connections with each other, they spontaneously form cliques with internal hierarchies around a selected leader and organize collective activities.</description>

      <title>Plurals: A System for Guiding LLMs Via Simulated Social Ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17213v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent debates raised concerns that language models may favor certain viewpoints. But what if the solution is not to aim for a 'view from nowhere' but rather to leverage different viewpoints? We introduce Plurals, a system and Python library for pluralistic AI deliberation. Plurals consists of Agents (LLMs, optionally with personas) which deliberate within customizable Structures, with Moderators overseeing deliberation. Plurals is a generator of simulated social ensembles. Plurals integrates with government datasets to create nationally representative personas, includes deliberation templates inspired by deliberative democracy, and allows users to customize both information-sharing structures and deliberation behavior within Structures. Six case studies demonstrate fidelity to theoretical constructs and efficacy. Three randomized experiments show simulated focus groups produced output resonant with an online sample of the relevant audiences (chosen over zero-shot generation in 75% of trials). Plurals is both a paradigm and a concrete system for pluralistic AI. The Plurals library is available at https://github.com/josh-ashkinaze/plurals and will be continually updated.</description>

      <title>Signaling and Social Learning in Swarms of Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11616v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the role of communication in improving coordination within robot swarms, focusing on a paradigm where learning and execution occur simultaneously in a decentralized manner. We highlight the role communication can play in addressing the credit assignment problem (individual contribution to the overall performance), and how it can be influenced by it. We propose a taxonomy of existing and future works on communication, focusing on information selection and physical abstraction as principal axes for classification: from low-level lossless compression with raw signal extraction and processing to high-level lossy compression with structured communication models. The paper reviews current research from evolutionary robotics, multi-agent (deep) reinforcement learning, language models, and biophysics models to outline the challenges and opportunities of communication in a collective of robots that continuously learn from one another through local message exchanges, illustrating a form of social learning.</description>
