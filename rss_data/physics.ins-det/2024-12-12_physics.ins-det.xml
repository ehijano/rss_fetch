      <title>Investigation of Electron Backscattering on Silicon Drift Detectors for the Sterile Neutrino Search with TRISTAN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12776v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sterile neutrinos are hypothetical particles in the minimal extension of the Standard Model of Particle Physics. They could be viable dark matter candidates if they have a mass in the keV range. The Karlsruhe tritium neutrino (KATRIN) experiment, extended with a silicon drift detector focal plane array (TRISTAN), has the potential to search for keV-scale sterile neutrinos by measuring the kinematics of the tritium $\beta$-decay. The collaboration targets a sensitivity of $10^{-6}$ on the mixing amplitude $\sin^2{\Theta}$. For this challenging target, a precise understanding of the detector response is necessary. In this work, we report on the characterization of electron backscattering from the detector surface, which is one of the main effects that influence the shape of the observed energy spectrum. Measurements were performed with a tandem silicon drift detector system and a custom-designed electron source. The measured detector response and backscattering probability are in good agreement with dedicated backscattering simulations using the Geant4 simulation toolkit.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Spin Dressing Sensitivity for the nEDMSF Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19033v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: nEDMSF aims to measure the neutron electric dipole moment ($d_n$) with unprecedented precision. In this paper we explore the experiment's sensitivity when operating with an implementation of the critical dressing method in which the angle between the neutron and Helium-3 spins ($\phi_{3n}$) is subjected to a square modulation by an amount $\phi_d$ (the "dressing angle"). Several parameters can be tuned to optimize sensitivity. We find roughly 10% improvement over a previous estimate, resulting primarily from the addition of a waiting period between the $\pi/2$ pulse that initiates $d_n$-driven $\phi_{3n}$ growth and the start of $\phi_{3n}$ modulation. We find negligible further improvement by allowing $\phi_d$ to vary continuously over the course of a run, and no degradation resulting from the addition of an in situ background measurement into each $\phi_{3n}$ modulation sequence. A complete simulation confirms a 300 live-day sensitivity of $\sigma = 1.45\times10^{-28}\,e \cdot \rm{cm}$. At this level of sensitivity, $\sigma_{\phi_{3n0}} = 1\,{\rm mrad}$ precision on the initial $n/^3{\rm He}$ angle difference is not negligible.</description>

      <title>High-Precision Excited-State Nuclear Recoil Spectroscopy with Superconducting Sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08076v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Superconducting sensors doped with rare isotopes have recently demonstrated powerful sensing performance for sub-keV radiation from nuclear decay. Here, we report the first high-resolution recoil spectroscopy of a single, selected nuclear state using superconducting tunnel junction (STJ) sensors. The STJ sensors were used to measure the eV-scale nuclear recoils produced in $^7$Be electron capture decay in coincidence with a 478 keV $\gamma$-ray emitted in decays to the lowest-lying excited nuclear state in $^7$Li. Details of the Doppler broadened recoil spectrum depend on the slow-down dynamics of the recoil ion. The measured spectral broadening is compared to empirical stopping power models as well as modern molecular dynamics simulations at low energy. The results have implications in several areas from nuclear structure and stopping powers at eV-scale energies to direct searches for dark matter, neutrino mass measurements, and other physics beyond the standard model.</description>

      <title>Conditioned quantum-assisted deep generative surrogate for particle-calorimeter interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22870v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Particle collisions at accelerators such as the Large Hadron Collider, recorded and analyzed by experiments such as ATLAS and CMS, enable exquisite measurements of the Standard Model and searches for new phenomena. Simulations of collision events at these detectors have played a pivotal role in shaping the design of future experiments and analyzing ongoing ones. However, the quest for accuracy in Large Hadron Collider (LHC) collisions comes at an imposing computational cost, with projections estimating the need for millions of CPU-years annually during the High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) run \cite{collaboration2022atlas}. Simulating a single LHC event with \textsc{Geant4} currently devours around 1000 CPU seconds, with simulations of the calorimeter subdetectors in particular imposing substantial computational demands \cite{rousseau2023experimental}. To address this challenge, we propose a conditioned quantum-assisted deep generative model. Our model integrates a conditioned variational autoencoder (VAE) on the exterior with a conditioned Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) in the latent space, providing enhanced expressiveness compared to conventional VAEs. The RBM nodes and connections are meticulously engineered to enable the use of qubits and couplers on D-Wave's Pegasus-structured \textit{Advantage} quantum annealer (QA) for sampling. We introduce a novel method for conditioning the quantum-assisted RBM using \textit{flux biases}. We further propose a novel adaptive mapping to estimate the effective inverse temperature in quantum annealers. The effectiveness of our framework is illustrated using Dataset 2 of the CaloChallenge \cite{calochallenge}.</description>
