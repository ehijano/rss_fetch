      <title>Advancing Local Search in SMT-NRA with MCSAT Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00557v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we advance local search for Satisfiability Modulo the Theory of Nonlinear Real Arithmetic (SMT-NRA for short). First, we introduce a two-dimensional cell-jump move, called \emph{$2d$-cell-jump}, generalizing the key operation, cell-jump, of the local search method for SMT-NRA. Then, we propose an extended local search framework, named \emph{$2d$-LS} (following the local search framework, LS, for SMT-NRA), integrating the model constructing satisfiability calculus (MCSAT) framework to improve search efficiency. To further improve the efficiency of MCSAT, we implement a recently proposed technique called \emph{sample-cell projection operator} for MCSAT, which is well suited for CDCL-style search in the real domain and helps guide the search away from conflicting states. Finally, we design a hybrid framework for SMT-NRA combining MCSAT, $2d$-LS and OpenCAD, to improve search efficiency through information exchange. The experimental results demonstrate improvements in local search performance, highlighting the effectiveness of the proposed methods.</description>

      <title>High-resolution spatial memory requires grid-cell-like neural codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00598v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Continuous attractor networks (CANs) are widely used to model how the brain temporarily retains continuous behavioural variables via persistent recurrent activity, such as an animal's position in an environment. However, this memory mechanism is very sensitive to even small imperfections, such as noise or heterogeneity, which are both common in biological systems. Previous work has shown that discretising the continuum into a finite set of discrete attractor states provides robustness to these imperfections, but necessarily reduces the resolution of the represented variable, creating a dilemma between stability and resolution. We show that this stability-resolution dilemma is most severe for CANs using unimodal bump-like codes, as in traditional models. To overcome this, we investigate sparse binary distributed codes based on random feature embeddings, in which neurons have spatially-periodic receptive fields. We demonstrate theoretically and with simulations that such grid-cell-like codes enable CANs to achieve both high stability and high resolution simultaneously. The model extends to embedding arbitrary nonlinear manifolds into a CAN, such as spheres or tori, and generalises linear path integration to integration along freely-programmable on-manifold vector fields. Together, this work provides a theory of how the brain could robustly represent continuous variables with high resolution and perform flexible computations over task-relevant manifolds.</description>
