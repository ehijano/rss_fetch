      <title>$1/f$ Noise in the Heliosphere: A Target for PUNCH Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a broad review of 1/f noise observations in the heliosphere, and discuss and complement the theoretical background of generic 1/f models as relevant to NASA's Polarimeter to Unify the Corona and Heliosphere (PUNCH) mission. First observed in the voltage fluctuations of vacuum tubes, the scale-invariant 1/f spectrum has since been identified across a wide array of natural and artificial systems, including heart rate fluctuations and loudness patterns in musical compositions. In the solar wind, the interplanetary magnetic field trace spectrum exhibits 1/f scaling within the frequency range from around 2e-6 Hz to 1e-4 Hz at 1 au. One compelling mechanism for the generation of 1/f noise is the superposition principle, where a composite 1/f spectrum arises from the superposition of a collection of individual power-law spectra characterized by a scale-invariant distribution of correlation times. In the context of the solar wind, such a superposition could originate from scale-invariant reconnection processes in the corona. Further observations have detected 1/f signatures in the photosphere and corona at frequency ranges compatible with those observed at 1 au, suggesting an even lower altitude origin of 1/f spectrum in the solar dynamo itself. This hypothesis is bolstered by dynamo experiments and simulations that indicate inverse cascade activities, which can be linked to successive flux tube reconnections beneath the corona, and are known to generate 1/f noise possibly through nonlocal interactions at the largest scales. Conversely, models positing in situ generation of 1/f signals face causality issues in explaining the low-frequency portion of the 1/f spectrum. Understanding 1/f noise in the solar wind may inform central problems in heliospheric physics, such as the solar dynamo, coronal heating, the origin of the solar wind, and the nature of interplanetary turbulence.</description>

      <title>Photometric and kinematic studies of open clusters Ruprecht 1 and Ruprecht 171</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study outlines a detailed investigation using CCD {\it UBV} and {\it Gaia} DR3 data sets of the two open clusters Ruprecht 1 (Rup-1) and Ruprecht 171 (Rup-171). Fundamental astrophysical parameters such as color excesses, photometric metallicities, ages, and isochrone distances were based on {\it UBV}-data analyses, whereas membership probability calculations, structural and astrophysical parameters, as well as the kinematic analyses were based on {\it Gaia} DR3-data. We identified 74 and 596 stars as the most probable cluster members with membership probabilities over 50\% for Rup-1 and Rup-171, respectively. The color excesses $E(B-V)$ were obtained as $0.166\pm0.022$ and $0.301\pm0.027$ mag for Rup-1 and Rup-171, respectively. Photometric metallicity analyses were performed by considering F-G type main-sequence member stars and found to be [Fe/H]=$-0.09\pm 0.16$ and [Fe/H]=$-0.20\pm 0.20$ dex for Rup-1 and Rup-171, respectively. Ages and distances were based on both {\it UBV} and {\it Gaia}-data analyses; according to isochrone-fitting these values were estimated to be $t=580\pm60$ Myr, $d=1469\pm57$ pc for Rup-1 and $t=2700\pm200$ Myr, $d=1509\pm69$ pc for Rup-171. The present-day mass function slope of Rup-1 was estimated as $1.26\pm0.32$ and Rup-171 as $1.53\pm1.49$. Galactic orbit integration analyses showed that both of the clusters might be formed outside the solar circle.</description>

      <title>Energy and helicity evolution in a flux emergence simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aims. The main aim of this work is to study the evolution of the recently introduced relative helicity of the magnetic polarity inversion line (PIL) in a magnetohydrodynamics simulation. Methods. The simulation used is a typical flux emergence simulation in which there is additionally an oblique, pre-existing magnetic field. The interaction of the emerging and ambient fields produces intense coronal activity, with four jets standing out. The 3D magnetic field allows us to compute various energies and helicities, and to study their evolution during the simulation, especially around the identified jets. We examine the evolution of all quantities in three different regions: in the whole volume, in three separate subvolumes of the whole volume, and in a 2D region around the PIL on the photosphere. Results. We find that the helicities are in general more responsive to the jets, followed by the free energy. The eruptivity index, the ratio of the current-carrying helicity to the relative helicity, does not show the typical behaviour it has in other cases, as its variations do not follow the production of the jets. By considering the subvolumes we find that the magnetic field gets more potential and less helical with height. The PIL relative helicity confirms the recent results it showed in observed active regions, exhibiting stronger variations during the jets compared to the standard relative helicity. Moreover, the current-carrying helicity around the PIL has a similar behaviour to the PIL relative helicity, and so this quantity could be equally useful in solar eruptivity studies.</description>

      <title>A brown dwarf orbiting around the planetary-nebula central binary KV Vel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: KV Vel is a non-eclipsing short-period (P = 0.3571 days) close binary containing a very hot subdwarf primary (77000 K) and a cool low-mass secondary star (3400 K) that is located at the center of the planetary nebula DS 1. The changes in the orbital period of the close binary were analyzed based on 262 new times of light maximum together with those compiled from the literature. It is discovered that the O-C curve shows a small-amplitude (0.0034 days) cyclic period variation with a period of 29.55 years. The explanation by the solar-type magnetic activity cycles of the cool component is ruled out because the required energies are much larger than the total radiant energy of this component in a whole cycle. Therefore, the cyclic variation was plausibly explained as the light-travel time effect via the presence of a tertiary component, which is supported by the periodic changes of the O-C curve and the rather symmetric and stable light curves obtained by TESS. The mass of the tertiary companion is determined to be M_3sini' = 0.060(7) M_sun. If the third body is coplanar with the central binary (i.e., i' = 62.5{\deg}), the mass of the tertiary component is computed as M_3 ~ 0.068 M\sun, and thus it would be below the stable hydrogen-burning limit and is a brown dwarf. The orbital separation is shorter than 9.35 astronomical units (AU). KV Vel together with its surrounding planetary nebula and the brown-dwarf companion may be formed through the common-envelope evolution after the primary filled its Roche lobe during the early asymptotic giant branch stage.</description>

      <title>Toward Realistic Solar Flare Models: An explicit Particle-In-Cell solver in the DISPATCH framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Simulating solar flares, which involve large-scale dynamics and small-scale magnetic reconnection, poses significant computational challenges. Aims. This study aims to develop an explicit Particle-In-Cell (PIC) solver within the DISPATCH framework to model the small-scale kinetic processes in solar corona setting. This study in the first in a series with the ultimate goal to develop a hybrid PIC-MHD solver, to simulate solar flares. Methods. The PIC solver, inspired by the PhotonPlasma code, solves the Vlasov-Maxwell equations in a collisionless regime using explicit time-staggering and spatial-staggering techniques. Validation included unit tests, plasma frequency recovery, two-stream instability, and current sheet dynamics. Results. Validation tests confirmed the solver's accuracy and robustness in modeling plasma dynamics and electromagnetic fields. Conclusions. The integration of the explicit PIC solver into the DISPATCH framework is the first step towards bridging the gap between large and small scale dynamics, providing a robust platform for future solar physics research.</description>

      <title>Scalable, Advanced Machine Learning-based Approaches for Stellar Flare Identification: Application to TESS short-cadence Data and Analysis of a New Flare Catalogue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply multi-algorithm machine learning models to TESS 2-minute survey data from Sectors 1-72 to identify stellar flares. Models trained with Deep Neural Network, Random Forest, and XGBoost algorithms, respectively, utilized four flare light curve characteristics as input features. Model performance is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics, all exceeding 94%. Validation against previously reported TESS M dwarf flare identifications showed that our models successfully recovered over 92% of the flares while detecting $\sim2,000$ more small events, thus extending the detection sensitivity of previous work. After processing 1.3 million light curves, our models identified nearly 18,000 flare stars and 250,000 flares. We present an extensive catalog documenting both flare and stellar properties. We find strong correlations in total flare energy and flare amplitude with color, in agreement with previous studies. Flare frequency distributions are analyzed, refining power-law slopes for flare behavior with the frequency uncertainties due to the detection incompleteness of low-amplitude events. We determine rotation periods for $\sim120,000$ stars thus yielding the relationship between rotation period and flare activity. We find that the transition in rotation period between the saturated and unsaturated regimes in flare energy coincides with the same transition in rotation period separating the saturated and unsaturated levels in coronal X-ray emission. We find that X-ray emission increases more rapidly with flare luminosity in earlier-type and unsaturated stars, indicating more efficient coronal heating in these objects. Additionally, we detect flares in white dwarfs and hot subdwarfs that are likely arising from unresolved low-mass companions.</description>

      <title>Modelling the TESS light curve of Ap Si star MX TrA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The TESS light curve of the silicon Ap star MX TrA was modelled using the observational surface distribution of silicon, iron, helium, and chromium obtained previously with the Doppler Imaging technique. The theoretical light curve was calculated using a grid of synthetic fluxes from line-by-line stellar atmosphere models with individual chemical abundances. The observational TESS light curve was fitted by synthetic one with an accuracy better than 0.001~mag. The influence of Si and Fe abundance stratification on the amplitude of variability was estimated. Also the wavelength dependence of the photometric amplitude and phase of the maximum light was modelled showing the typical for Ap Si stars behaviour with increased amplitude and anti-phase variability in far ultraviolet caused by the flux redistribution.</description>

      <title>DH type II radio bursts during solar cycles 23-25: Origin and association with solar eruptive events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyses occurrence of DH type II solar radio bursts spanning over solar cycles 23-25 during which a total of 590 DH type II bursts are reported with confirmed 568 and 462 cases of associated CME and flares, respectively. We find short-term yet important differences in DH type II activity when the data is examined in terms of event counts and their durations, e.g., temporal shift in the peak activity during cycle 24 and variation in the growth rate of the activity level during cycle 25. For an in-depth exploration, DH type II bursts are classified in 3 categories based on their end-frequencies: Low-, Medium-, and High- Frequency Groups (LFG, MFG, and HFG, respectively). The HFG category is the most populous (~47 %) while the LFG category occupy about a quarter of the events (~24 %). The LFG events show a clear inclination toward fastest CMEs and X-class flares with a quarter of events exhibiting end frequency below 50 MHz.</description>

      <title>Observed Fluctuation Enhancement and Departure from WKB Theory in Sub-Alfv\'enic Solar Wind</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using Parker Solar Probe data from orbits 8 through 17, we examine fluctuation amplitudes throughout the critical region where the solar wind flow speed approaches and then exceeds the Alfv\'en wave speed, taking account of various exigencies of the plasma data. In contrast to WKB theory for non-interacting Alfv\'en waves streaming away from the Sun, the magnetic and kinetic fluctuation energies per unit volume are not monotonically decreasing. Instead, there is clear violation of conservation of standard WKB wave action, which is consistent with previous indications of strong in-situ fluctuation energy input in the solar wind near the Alfv\'en critical region. This points to strong violations of WKB theory due to nonlinearity (turbulence) and major energy input near the critical region, which we interpret as likely due to driving by large-scale coronal shear flows.</description>

      <title>How does the critical torus instability height vary with the solar cycle?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ideal magnetohydrodynamic torus instability can drive the eruption of coronal mass ejections. The critical threshold of magnetic field strength decay for the onset of the torus instability occurs at different heights in different solar active regions, and understanding this variation could therefore improve space weather prediction. In this work, we aim to find out how the critical torus instability height evolves throughout the solar activity cycle. We study a significant subset of HMI and MDI Space-Weather HMI Active Region Patches (SHARPs and SMARPs) from 1996-2023, totalling 21584 magnetograms from 4436 unique active region patches. For each magnetogram, we compute the critical height averaged across the main polarity inversion line, the total unsigned magnetic flux and the separation between the positive and negative magnetic polarities. We find the critical height in active regions varies with the solar cycle, with higher (lower) average critical heights observed around solar maximum (minimum). We conclude this is because the critical height is proportional to the separation between opposite magnetic polarities, which in turn is proportional to the total magnetic flux in a region, and more magnetic regions with larger fluxes and larger sizes are observed at solar maximum. This result is noteworthy because, despite the higher critical heights, more CMEs are observed around solar maximum than at solar minimum.</description>

      <title>Phosphorus Abundances of B-Type Stars in the Solar Neighborhood</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phosphorus abundances of ~80 apparently bright sharp-lined early-to-late B-type stars on the upper main sequence are determined by applying the non-LTE analysis to the P II line at 6043.084 A, with an aim of getting information on the P abundance of the galactic gas (from which these young stars were formed) in comparison with the reference solar abundance (A_sun = 5.45). These sample stars turned out to be divided into two distinct groups with respect to their P abundances: (1) chemically peculiar late B-type stars of HgMn group show considerable overabundances of P (supersolar by ~0.5--1.5 dex), the extent of which progressively increases with T_eff. (2) In contrast, the P abundances of normal B-type stars are comparatively homogeneous, though a notable difference is observed between the LTE and non-LTE cases. Although their LTE abundances are near-solar, a slight gradual trend with T_eff is observed. However, after applying the negative non-LTE corrections (amounting ~0.1-0.5 dex), this T_eff-dependence is successfully removed, but the resulting non-LTE abundances (their mean is ~5.20) are appreciably underabundant relative to the Sun by ~0.2--0.3 dex. The cause of this systematic discrepancy (contradicting the galactic chemical evolution) is yet to be investigated.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic pressure effect on central EOS of PSR J0740+6620 in the light of dimensionless TOV equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02147v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is generally agreed upon that the pressure inside a neutron star is isotropic. However, a strong magnetic field or superfluidity suggests that the pressure anisotropy may be a more realistic model. We derived the dimensionless TOV equation for anisotropic neutron stars based on two popular models, namely the BL model and the H model, to investigate the effect of anisotropy. Similar to the isotropic case, the maximum mass $M_{max}$ and its corresponding radius $R_{Mmax}$ can also be expressed linearly by a combination of radial central pressure $p_{rc}$ and central energy density $\varepsilon_{c}$, which is insensitive to the equation of state (EOS). We also found that the obtained central EOS would change with different values of $\lambda_{BL}$ ($\lambda_{H}$), which controls the magnitude of the difference between the transverse pressure and the radial pressure. Combining with observational data of PSR J0740+6620 and comparing to the extracted EOS based on isotropic neutron star, it is shown that in the BL model, for $\lambda_{BL}$ = 0.4, the extracted central energy density $\varepsilon_{c}$ changed from 546 -- 1056 MeV/fm$^{3}$ to 510 -- 1005 MeV/fm$^{3}$, and the extracted radial central pressure $p_{rc}$ changed from 87 -- 310 MeV/fm$^{3}$ to 76 -- 271 MeV/fm$^{3}$. For $\lambda_{BL}$ = 2, the extracted $\varepsilon_{c}$ and $p_{rc}$ changed to 412 -- 822 MeV/fm$^{3}$ and 50 -- 165 MeV/fm$^{3}$, respectively. In the H model, for $\lambda_{H}$ = 0.4, the extracted $\varepsilon_{c}$ changed to 626 -- 1164 MeV/fm$^{3}$, and the extracted $p_{rc}$ changed to 104 -- 409 MeV/fm$^{3}$. For $\lambda_{H}$ = 2, the extracted $\varepsilon_{c}$ decreased to 894 -- 995 MeV/fm$^{3}$, and the extracted $p_{rc}$ changed to 220 -- 301 MeV/fm$^{3}$.</description>

      <title>An Earth-Mass Planet and a Brown Dwarf in Orbit Around a White Dwarf</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02157v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Terrestrial planets born beyond 1-3 AU have been theorized to avoid being engulfed during the red-giant phases of their host stars. Nevertheless, only a few gas-giant planets have been observed around white dwarfs (WDs) -- the end product left behind by a red giant. Here we report on evidence that the lens system that produced the microlensing event KMT-2020-BLG-0414 is composed of a WD orbited by an Earth-mass planet and a brown dwarf (BD) companion, as shown by the non-detection of the lens flux using Keck Adaptive Optics (AO). From microlensing orbital motion constraints, we determine the planet to be a $1.9\pm0.2$ Earth-mass ($M_\oplus$) planet at a physical separation of $2.1\pm0.2$ au from the WD during the event. By considering the system evolutionary history, we determine the BD companion to have a projected separation of 22 au from the WD, and reject an alternative model that places the BD at 0.2 au. Given planetary orbital expansion during the final evolutionary stages of the host star, this Earth-mass planet may have existed in an initial orbit close to 1 au, thereby offering a glimpse into the possible survival of planet Earth in the distant future.</description>

Abstract: The Atacama Large Millimetre/submillimetre Array (ALMA) receivers and technical papers are cited fewer than once in every six publications. This citation shortage is impeding the development of future (sub)millimetre instruments. In an effort to facilitate the correct citations of ALMA receivers and technical papers, this memo provides a comprehensive list of papers for the scientific community. This list was produced in discussion with the scientific and instrumentalist community, based on a June 2024 survey at the European Southern Observatory workshop on the ALMA Wideband Sensitivity Upgrade, as well as with the ALMA technical staff. We now encourage the community to enhance their already-excellent ALMA science with the appropriate references to ensure future (sub)millimetre instrumentation can keep addressing the key questions about our Universe.</description>

      <title>Quasi-periodic X-ray eruptions years after a nearby tidal disruption event</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02181v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quasi-periodic Eruptions (QPEs) are luminous bursts of soft X-rays from the nuclei of galaxies, repeating on timescales of hours to weeks. The mechanism behind these rare systems is uncertain, but most theories involve accretion disks around supermassive black holes (SMBHs), undergoing instabilities or interacting with a stellar object in a close orbit. It has been suggested that this disk could be created when the SMBH disrupts a passing star, implying that many QPEs should be preceded by observable tidal disruption events (TDEs). Two known QPE sources show long-term decays in quiescent luminosity consistent with TDEs, and two observed TDEs have exhibited X-ray flares consistent with individual eruptions. TDEs and QPEs also occur preferentially in similar galaxies. However, no confirmed repeating QPEs have been associated with a spectroscopically confirmed TDE or an optical TDE observed at peak brightness. Here we report the detection of nine X-ray QPEs with a mean recurrence time of approximately 48 hours from AT2019qiz, a nearby and extensively studied optically-selected TDE. We detect and model the X-ray, ultraviolet and optical emission from the accretion disk, and show that an orbiting body colliding with this disk provides a plausible explanation for the QPEs.</description>

      <title>Orbital Architectures of Planet-Hosting Binaries III. Testing Mutual Inclinations of Stellar and Planetary Orbits in Triple-Star Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02223v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transiting planets in multiple-star systems, especially high-order multiples, make up a small fraction of the known planet population but provide unique opportunities to study the environments in which planets would have formed. Planet-hosting binaries have been shown to have an abundance of systems in which the stellar orbit aligns with the orbit of the transiting planet, which could give insights into the planet formation process in such systems. We investigate here if this trend of alignment extends to planet-hosting triple-star systems. We present long-term astrometric monitoring of a novel sample of triple-star systems that host Kepler transiting planets. We measured orbit arcs in 21 systems, including 12 newly identified triples, from a homogeneous analysis of our Keck adaptive optics data and, for some systems, Gaia astrometry. We examine the orbital alignment within the nine most compact systems ($\lesssim500$ au), testing if either (or both) of the stellar orbits align with the edge-on orbits of their transiting planets. Our statistical sample of triple systems shows a tendency toward alignment, especially when assessing the alignment probability using stellar orbital inclinations computed from full orbital fits, but is formally consistent with isotropic orbits. Two-population tests where half of the stellar orbits are described by a planet-hosting-binary-like moderately aligned distribution give the best match when the other half (non-planet-hosting) has a Kozai-like misaligned distribution. Overall, our results suggest that our sample of triple-star planet-hosting systems are not fully coplanar systems and have at most one plane of alignment.</description>

      <title>The Wanderer: Charting WASP-77A b's Formation and Migration Using a System-Wide Inventory of Carbon and Oxygen Abundances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02286v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The elemental and isotopic abundances of volatiles like carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen may trace a planet's formation location relative to H$_2$O, CO$_2$, CO, NH$_3$, and N$_2$ "snowlines", or the distance from the star at which these volatile elements sublimate. By comparing the C/O and $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratios measured in giant exoplanet atmospheres to complementary measurements of their host stars, we can determine whether the planet inherited stellar abundances from formation inside the volatile snowlines, or non-stellar C/O and $^{13}$C enrichment characteristic of formation beyond the snowlines. To date, there are still only a handful of exoplanet systems where we can make a direct comparison of elemental and isotopic CNO abundances between an exoplanet and its host star. Here, we present a $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C abundance analysis for host star WASP-77A (whose hot Jupiter's $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C abundance was recently measured). We use MARCS stellar atmosphere models and the radiative transfer code TurboSpectrum to generate synthetic stellar spectra for isotopic abundance calculations. We find a $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratio of $51\pm 6$ for WASP-77A, which is sub-solar ($\sim 91$) but may still indicate $^{13}$C-enrichment in its companion planet WASP-77A b ($^{12}$C/$^{13}$C = 26 $\pm$ 16, previously reported). Together with the inventory of carbon and oxygen abundances in both the host and companion planet, these chemical constraints point to WASP-77A b's formation beyond the H$_2$O and CO$_2$ snowlines and provide chemical evidence for the planet's migration to its current location $\sim$0.024 AU from its host star.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Fortran Codes: A Method for Integrating Coarray Fortran with CUDA Fortran and OpenMP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fortran's prominence in scientific computing requires strategies to ensure both that legacy codes are efficient on high-performance computing systems, and that the language remains attractive for the development of new high-performance codes. Coarray Fortran (CAF), part of the Fortran 2008 standard introduced for parallel programming, facilitates distributed memory parallelism with a syntax familiar to Fortran programmers, simplifying the transition from single-processor to multi-processor coding. This research focuses on innovating and refining a parallel programming methodology that fuses the strengths of Intel Coarray Fortran, Nvidia CUDA Fortran, and OpenMP for distributed memory parallelism, high-speed GPU acceleration and shared memory parallelism respectively. We consider the management of pageable and pinned memory, CPU-GPU affinity in NUMA multiprocessors, and robust compiler interfacing with speed optimisation. We demonstrate our method through its application to a parallelised Poisson solver and compare the methodology, implementation, and scaling performance to that of the Message Passing Interface (MPI), finding CAF offers similar speeds with easier implementation. For new codes, this approach offers a faster route to optimised parallel computing. For legacy codes, it eases the transition to parallel computing, allowing their transformation into scalable, high-performance computing applications without the need for extensive re-design or additional syntax.</description>

      <title>Internal Dynamics of Multiple Populations in 28 Galactic Globular Clusters: A Wide-Field study with Gaia and the Hubble Space Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02330v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first comprehensive analysis of the internal dynamics of multiple stellar populations (MPs) in 28 Galactic Globular Clusters (GCs) across a wide field of view, extending from the innermost regions to the clusters' outskirts. Using astro-photometric catalogs from ground-based observations, Gaia, and the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), we identify first- (1P) and second-population (2P) stars, and study the internal dynamics of MPs using high-precision Gaia DR3 and HST proper motions. Our results reveal that while the 1P transitions from isotropy to slight tangential anisotropy toward the outer regions, 2P stars become increasingly radially anisotropic beyond the half-light radius. We also explore the connection between the dynamics of MPs and the clusters' structural and dynamical properties, finding statistically significant differences in the anisotropy profiles of dynamically young and non-relaxed clusters, particularly beyond the 1-2 half-light radii. In these regions, 1P stars transition from isotropic to slightly tangentially anisotropic motion, while 2P stars become more radially anisotropic. In contrast, dynamically older clusters, with mixed MPs, exhibit weaker relative differences. Furthermore, clusters with orbits closer to the Galactic center exhibit larger dynamical differences between 1P and 2P stars than those with larger peri-Galactic radii. These findings are consistent with a scenario where 2P stars form in a more centrally concentrated environment, where the interaction with the Milky Way tidal field plays a crucial role in the dynamical evolution of MPs, especially of 1P.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Study of Open Cluster Chemical Homogeneity using APOGEE and Milky Way Mapper Abundances</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02360v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stars in an open cluster are assumed to have formed from a broadly homogeneous distribution of gas, implying that they should be chemically homogeneous. Quantifying the level to which open clusters are chemically homogeneous can therefore tell us about ISM pollution and gas-mixing in progenitor molecular clouds. Using SDSS-V Milky Way Mapper and SDSS-IV APOGEE DR17 abundances, we test this assumption by quantifying intrinsic chemical scatter in up to 20 different chemical abundances across 26 Milky Way open clusters. We find that we can place 3${\sigma}$ upper limits on open cluster homogeneity within 0.02 dex or less in the majority of elements, while for neutron capture elements, as well as those elements having weak lines, we place limits on their homogeneity within 0.2 dex. Finally, we find that giant stars in open clusters are ~0.01 dex more homogeneous than a matched sample of field stars.</description>

Abstract: The increasing number of observations towards different environments in the Milky Way, as well as theoretical and experimental works, are improving our knowledge of the astrochemical processes in the interstellar medium (ISM). In this chapter we report some of the main projects to study the chemical complexity and isotopic ratios across the Galaxy. High-sensitivity spectral surveys covering broad bandwidths towards Galactic Center molecular clouds (e.g. G+0.693-0.027) and star-forming regions (e.g. the hot core G31.41+0.31) are revealing very rich astrochemical reservoirs, which include molecules of prebiotic interest. At the same time, isotopic ratios (e.g. $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C and $^{14}$N/$^{15}$N) can give important information on the Galactic chemical evolution, as well as on chemical local processes due to the physical conditions of the molecular clouds. We also highlight the role of cosmic rays as a key agent affecting the interstellar chemistry described above.</description>

      <title>Do anomalously-dense hot Jupiters orbit stealth binary stars?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02639v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Wide Angle Search for Planets (WASP) survey used transit photometry to discover nearly 200 gas-giant exoplanets and derive their planetary and stellar parameters. Reliable determination of the planetary density depends on accurate measurement of the planet's radius, obtained from the transit depth and photodynamical determination of the stellar radius. The stellar density, and hence the stellar radius are typically determined in a model-independent way from the star's reflex orbital acceleration and the transit profile. Additional flux coming from the system due to a bright, undetected stellar binary companion can, however, potentially dilute the transit curve and radial velocity signal, leading to under-estimation of the planet's mass and radius, and to overestimation of the planet's density. In this study, we cross-check the published radii of all the WASP planet host stars, determined from their transit profiles and radial-velocity curves, against radiometric measurements of stellar radii derived from their angular diameters (via the Infrared Flux method) and trigonometric parallaxes. We identify eight systems showing radiometric stellar radii significantly greater than their published photodynamical values: WASPs 20, 85, 86, 103, 105, 129, 144 and 171. We investigate these systems in more detail to establish plausible ranges of angular and radial-velocity separations within which such "stealth binaries" could evade detection, and deduce their likely orbital periods, mass ratios, and flux ratios. After accounting for the dilution of transit depth and radial velocity amplitude, we find that on average, the planetary densities for the identified stealth binary systems should be reduced by a factor of 1.3.</description>

      <title>Accretion vs. Core-Filament Collision: Implications for Streamer Formation in Per-emb-2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02661v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent millimeter and submillimeter observations have unveiled elongated and asymmetric structures around protostars. These structures, referred to as streamers, often exhibit coherent velocity gradients, seemingly indicating a directed gas flow towards the protostars. However, their origin and role in star formation remain uncertain. A protostellar core Per-emb-2, located in Barnard 1, has a relatively large streamer with $10^4$ au, which is more prominent in emission from carbon chain molecules. We aim to unveil the formation mechanism of this streamer. We conducted mapping observations towards Per-emb-2 using the NRO 45-m telescope. We targeted carbon chain molecular lines such as CCS, HC$_3$N, and HC$_5$N. Using astrodendro, we identified one protostellar and four starless cores, including three new detections, on the Herschel map. The starless and protostellar cores are more or less gravitationally bound. We discovered strong CCS and HC$_3$N emissions extending from the north to the south, appearing to bridge the gap between the protostellar core and the starless core north of it. This bridge spans $3\times 10^4$ au with the velocities from 6.5 to 7.0 km s$^{-1}$. The bridge has the velocity gradient opposite to the streamer. Thus, the streamer is unlikely to be connected to this bridge, suggesting that the streamer does not have an accretion origin. We propose that a collision between a spherical core and the filament has shaped the density structure in this region, consequently triggering star formation within the head-tail-shaped core. In this core-filament collision (CFC) scenario, the collision appears to have fragmented the filament into two structures. The streamer is a bow structure, while the bridge is a remnant of the shock-compressed filament. Thus, we conclude that the Per-emb-2 streamer does not significantly contribute to the mass accumulation towards the protostar.</description>

      <title>Muon collider probes of Majorana neutrino dipole moments and masses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Majorana neutrinos may have transitional dipole moments, which violate lepton number as well as lepton flavour. We estimate the sensitivity of future colliders to the electron-muon neutrino dipole moment, $\lambda_{e\mu}$, by considering same-sign dilepton final states. We find that hadron colliders, even the proposed FCC-hh upgrade, are sensitive only to $|\lambda_{e\mu}|\gtrsim 10^{-9}\mu_B$ (with $\mu_B$ the Bohr magneton), a value two-three orders of magnitude larger than current bounds from astrophysics and low-energy neutrino-scattering experiments. In the case of a future muon collider, we show that the sensitivity varies from $|\lambda_{e\mu}|\sim 5\cdot 10^{-9}\mu_B$ for energy $\sqrt{s}\simeq 3$ TeV, to $\sim 10^{-12}\mu_B$ for $\sqrt{s}\simeq 50$ TeV, matching the current laboratory bounds for $\sqrt{s}\simeq 30$ TeV. The singular advantage of the muon collider signal would be a direct, clean identification of lepton number and flavour violation. We also show that a muon collider would improve by orders of magnitude the direct bounds on $m_{e\mu}$ and $m_{\mu\mu}$, two of the entries of the Majorana neutrino mass matrix. These bounds could be as strong as $\sim 50$ keV, still far above the neutrino mass scale.</description>

      <title>Magnetic, Kinetic, and Transition regime: Spatially-segregated structure of compressive MHD turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02769v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Turbulence is a complex physical process that emerges in multiple areas of modern physics, and in ionized environments such as interstellar gas, the magnetic field can be dynamically important. However, the exact function of the magnetic field in the ionized gas remains unclear. We use the $M_{\rm A} = \sqrt{E_{\rm k}/E_B}
  $ to describe the importance of the magnetic field measured to the turbulent motion, and reveal diverse ways of mutual interaction. At low $M_{\rm A}$ (magnetic regime), the magnetic field is well-described as force-free. Despite the strong magnetic field, the motion of gas does not stay aligned with the magnetic field. At the regime of intermediate $M_{\rm A}$ (magnetic-kinetic transition regime), the velocity field and the magnetic field exhibit the highest degree of alignment, which is likely the result of a rapid relaxation. At high $M_{\rm A}$ (kinetic regime), both the magnetic field and the velocity field are irregular, with no alignment. We find observational counterparts to these regimes in observations of interstellar gas. The results highlight the diverse behavior of gas in MHD turbulence and guide future interpretations of the role of the magnetic field in astrophysical observations.</description>

      <title>High resolution observations of 12CO and 13CO(3--2) toward the NGC 6334 extended filament</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: NGC 6334 is a giant molecular cloud complex with elongated filamentary structure, harbouring OB-stars, HII regions and star forming clumps. To study the emission and velocity structure of the gas in the extended NGC 6334 region, we made observations of the 12CO and 13CO (J=3-2) lines with the APEX telescope. The data provides a spatial resolution of 20 arcsec (~0.16 pc) and sensitivity of ~0.4 K at a spectral resolution of 0.25 km/s. Our observations reveal in the extended NGC 6334 region a connected velocity coherent structure of ~-3.9 km/s over ~80 pc parallel to the galactic plane. The NGC 6334 complex has two connected velocity structures at velocities ~ -9.2 km/s (the bridge features) and ~-20 km/s (the Northern Filament, NGC 6334-NF). We observed local velocity fluctuations at smaller spatial scales along the filament tracing local density enhancement and infall. We investigated the 13CO emission and velocity structure around HII regions and found that most HII regions show signs of molecular gas dispersal from the center and intensity enhancement at their outer radii. Overall NGC 6334 exhibits sequential star formation from west to east. Located in the west, the GM-24 region exhibits bubbles within bubbles and is at a relatively evolved stage of star formation. The NGC 6334 central ridge is undergoing global gas infall and exhibits two gas bridge features possibly connected to the cloud-cloud collision scenario of the NGC 6334-NF and the NGC 6334 main gas component. The relatively quiescent eastern filament (EF1 - G352.1) is a hub-filament in formation which shows the kinematic signature of global gas infall onto the filament. Our observations highlight the important role of H II regions in shaping the molecular gas emission and velocity structure as well as the overall evolution of the molecular filaments in NGC 6334.</description>

      <title>Follow the Mass -- A Concordance Picture of Tidal Disruption Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Three recent global simulations of tidal disruption events (TDEs) have produced, using different numerical techniques and parameters, very similar pictures of their dynamics. In typical TDEs, after the star is disrupted by a supermassive black hole, the bound portion of the stellar debris follows highly eccentric trajectories, reaching apocenters of several thousand gravitational radii. Only a very small fraction is captured upon returning to the vicinity of the supermassive black hole. Nearly all the debris returns to the apocenter, where shocks produce a thick irregular cloud on this radial scale and power the optical/UV flare. These simulation results imply that over a few years, the thick cloud settles into an accretion flow responsible for the long term emission. Despite not being designed to match observations, the dynamical picture given by the three simulations aligns well with observations of typical events, correctly predicting the flares' total radiated energy, luminosity, temperature and emission line width. On the basis of these predictions, we provide an updated method ({\sc TDEmass}) to infer the stellar and black hole masses from a flare's peak luminosity and temperature. This picture also correctly predicts the luminosity observed years after the flare. In addition, we show that in a magnitude-limited survey, if the intrinsic rate of TDEs is independent of black hole mass, the detected events will preferentially have black hole masses $\sim 10^{6 \pm 0.3} M_\odot$ and stellar masses of $\sim 1-1.5 M_\odot$.</description>

      <title>Separating States in Astronomical Sources Using Hidden Markov Models: With a Case Study of Flaring and Quiescence on EV Lac</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06540v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new method to distinguish between different states (e.g., high and low, quiescent and flaring) in astronomical sources with count data. The method models the underlying physical process as latent variables following a continuous-space Markov chain that determines the expected Poisson counts in observed light curves in multiple passbands. For the underlying state process, we consider several autoregressive processes, yielding continuous-space hidden Markov models of varying complexity. Under these models, we can infer the state that the object is in at any given time. The continuous state predictions from these models are then dichotomized with the help of a finite mixture model to produce state classifications. We apply these techniques to X-ray data from the active dMe flare star EV Lac, splitting the data into quiescent and flaring states. We find that a first-order vector autoregressive process efficiently separates flaring from quiescence: flaring occurs over 30-40% of the observation durations, a well-defined persistent quiescent state can be identified, and the flaring state is characterized by higher plasma temperatures and emission measures.</description>

      <title>Possibilities for methanogenic and acetogenic life in molecular cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.14291v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: According to panspermia, life on Earth may have originated from life forms transported through space from elsewhere. These life forms could have passed through molecular clouds, where the process of methanogenesis could have provided enough energy to sustain living organisms. In this study, we have calculated the Gibbs free energy released from synthesizing hydrocarbons for methanogenic (acetogenic) life in a molecular cloud, with methane (acetic acid) as the final metabolic product. Our calculations demonstrate that the chemical reactions during methanogenesis can release enough free energy to support living organisms. The methanogenic life may have served as the ancestor of life on Earth, and there is some preliminary evidence from various molecular biology studies to support this idea. Furthermore, we propose a potential distinguishing signal to test our model.</description>

      <title>The Intrabinary Shock and Companion Star of Redback Pulsar J2215+5135</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13889v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: PSR J2215+5135 (J2215) is a `redback' spider pulsar, where the intrabinary shock (IBS) wraps around the pulsar rather than the stellar-mass companion. Spider orbital light curves are modulated, dominated by their binary companion thermal emission in the optical bands and by IBS synchrotron emission in the X-rays. We report on new XMM-Newton X-ray and U-band observations of J2215. We produce orbital light curves and use them to model the system properties. Our best-fit optical light model gives a neutron star mass $M_{NS}=1.98\pm0.08$ M$_\odot$, lower than previously reported. However, uncertainty in the stellar atmosphere metallicity, a parameter to which J2215 is unusually sensitive, requires us to consider an acceptable systematic plus statistical range of $M_{NS}\sim1.85-2.3$ M$_\odot$. From the X-ray analysis, we find that the IBS wraps around the pulsar, but with a pulsar wind to companion wind momentum ratio unusually close to unity, implying a flatter IBS geometry than seen in other spiders. Estimating the companion wind momentum and speed from the X-ray light curve, we find a companion mass-loss rate of ${\dot M}_c\gtrsim10^{-10}$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$, so that J2215 may become an isolated millisecond pulsar in $\sim 1$ Gyr. Our X-ray analyses place constraints on the magnetization and particle density of the pulsar wind and support models of magnetic reconnection and particle acceleration in the highly magnetized relativistic IBS.</description>

      <title>Unravelling the asphericities in the explosion and multi-faceted circumstellar matter of SN 2023ixf</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20989v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a detailed investigation of photometric, spectroscopic, and polarimetric observations of the Type II SN 2023ixf. Earlier studies have provided compelling evidence for a delayed shock breakout from a confined dense circumstellar matter (CSM) enveloping the progenitor star. The temporal evolution of polarization in SN~2023ixf revealed three distinct peaks in polarization evolution at 1.4 d, 6.4 d, and 79.2 d, indicating an asymmetric dense CSM, an aspherical shock front and clumpiness in the low-density extended CSM, and an aspherical inner ejecta/He-core. SN 2023ixf displayed two dominant axes, one along the CSM-outer ejecta and the other along the inner ejecta/He-core, showcasing the independent origin of asymmetry in the early and late evolution. The argument for an aspherical shock front is further strengthened by the presence of a high-velocity broad absorption feature in the blue wing of the Balmer features in addition to the P-Cygni absorption post 16 d. Hydrodynamical light curve modeling indicated a progenitor of 10 solar mass with a radius of 470 solar radii and explosion energy of 2e51 erg, along with 0.06 solar mass of 56-Ni, though these properties are not unique due to modeling degeneracies. The modeling also indicated a two-zone CSM: a confined dense CSM extending up to 5e14 cm, with a mass-loss rate of 1e-2 solar mass per year, and an extended CSM spanning from 5e14 cm to at least 1e16cm with a mass-loss rate of 1e-4 solar mass per year, both assuming a wind-velocity of 10 km/s. The early nebular phase observations display an axisymmetric line profile of [OI], red-ward attenuation of the emission of Halpha post 125 days, and flattening in the Ks-band, marking the onset of dust formation.</description>

      <title>Magnetically Arrested Circumbinary Accretion Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00757v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Binary systems with comparable masses and a surrounding accretion disk can accrete gas through spiral accretion streams penetrating the central cavity formed by tidal interactions. Using three-dimensional Newtonian magnetohydrodynamics simulations, we investigate the possibility of a magnetically arrested accretion flow through the cavity. Rather than solely continuously feeding the binary through spiral accretion streams, the accretion is regulated by the strong magnetic field inside the cavity. Transport of mass and angular momentum onto the binary then proceeds largely periodically in magnetic flux eruption episodes. The ejected flux tubes carry angular momentum outwards and away from the binary, inject hot plasma into the disk and can launch flares. This likely intermittent scenario could have potential implications for the emission signatures of supermassive black hole binaries, and shed light onto the role magnetic fields play in the binary's orbital evolution.</description>
