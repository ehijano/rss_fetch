      <title>Transverse and longitudinal spin alignment from color fields in heavy ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the spin alignment stemming from spin correlation of the quark and antiquark induced by background color fields in relativistic heavy ion collisions. The quark-coalescence equation relating the collision kernel of the vector-meson kinetic equation to spin alignment is expanded to the relativistic case. Focusing on the color-octet contribution, the spin alignment for $\phi$ mesons from glasma fields with momentum dependence is investigated, where the scenarios for different spin quantization axes are considered. Moreover, we qualitatively analyze the spin alignment from isotropic color fields in the quark gluon plasma phase for comparison. In particular, we propose that the experimental measurement of spin alignment along the beam direction, dubbed as the longitudinal spin alignment, could be useful to identify the dominance of longitudinal spin correlation potentially led by the glasma effect in high-energy nuclear collisions.</description>

      <title>Determining proto-neutron stars' minimal mass with chirally constrained nuclear equations of state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The minimal masses and radii of proto-neutron stars during different stages of their evolution are investigated. In our work we focus on two stages, directly after the supernova shock wave moves outwards, where neutrinos are still captured in the core and the lepton per baryon ratio is fixed to $Y_L = 0.4$, and a few seconds afterwards, when all neutrinos have left the star. All nuclear equations of state used for this purpose fulfill the binding energy constraints from chiral effective field theory for neutron matter at zero temperature. We find for the neutrino-trapped case higher minimal masses than for the case when neutrinos have left the proto-neutron star. Thermal effects, here in the form of a given constant entropy per baryon $s$, have a smaller effect on increasing the minimal mass. The minimal proto-neutron star mass for the first evolutionary stage with $Y_L = 0.4$ and $s = 1$ amounts to $M_{min} \sim 0.62M_{\odot}$ and for the stage without neutrinos and $s = 2$ to $M_{min} \sim 0.22M_{\odot}$ rather independent on the nuclear equation of state used. We also study the case related to an accretion induced collapse of a white dwarf where the initial lepton fraction is $Y_L = 0.5$ and observe large discrepancies in the results of the different tables of nuclear equations of state used. Our finding points towards a thermodynamical inconsistent treatment of the nuclear liquid-gas phase transition for nuclear equations of state in tabular form demanding a fully generalized three-dimensional Gibbs construction for a proper treatment. Finally, we demonstrate that there is a universal relation for the increase of the proto-neutron star minimal mass with the lepton fraction for all nuclear equations of state used.</description>

      <title>Energy dependence of the deformed nuclear structure at small-$x$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We quantify the effect of high-energy JIMWLK evolution on the deformed structure or heavy (Uranium) and intermediate (Ruthenium) nuclei. The soft gluon emissions in the high-energy evolution are found to drive the initially deformed nuclei towards a more spherical shape, although the evolution is slow ,especially for the longest distance-scale quadrupole deformation. We confirm a linear relationship between the squared eccentricity $\varepsilon_n^2$ and the deformation parameter $\beta_n^2$ in central collisions across the energy range covered by the RHIC and LHC measurements. The applied JIMWLK evolution is found to leave visible signatures in the eccentricity evolution that can be observed if the same nuclei can be collided at RHIC and at the LHC, or in rapidity-dependent flow measurements. Our results demonstrate the importance of including the Bjorken-$x$ dependent nuclear geometry when comparing simulations of the Quark Gluon Plasma evolution with precise flow measurements at high collision energies.</description>

      <title>Ab initio study of the beryllium isotopes $^{7}$Be to $^{12}$Be</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14935v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a systematic \textit{ab initio} study of the low-lying states in beryllium isotopes from $^7\text{Be}$ to $^{12}\text{Be}$ using nuclear lattice effective field theory with the N$^3$LO interaction. Our calculations achieve excellent agreement with experimental data for energies, radii, and electromagnetic properties. We introduce a novel, model-independent method to quantify nuclear shapes, uncovering a distinct pattern in the interplay between positive and negative parity states across the isotopic chain. Our geometrical analysis reveals prominent two-center cluster structures, the emergence of one-neutron halo, and complex nuclear molecular dynamics, underscoring the strong clustering features inherent to beryllium isotopes.</description>

      <title>Constraining Jet Quenching in Heavy-Ion Collisions with Bayesian Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14552v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Jet suppression and modification is a hallmark feature of heavy-ion collisions. This can be attributed to an accumulated set of effects, including radiative and elastic energy loss and reabsorption of thermalized energy within the jet cone, which are encoded in a quenching weight, determining the probability distribution for a shift of the $p_T$ (energy loss). We perform a data-driven analysis, based on Bayesian inference, to extract information about the energy-loss distribution experienced by propagating jets using generic and flexible parametrizations. We first establish the consistency between different data-sets and, thereby, provide evidence for the universality of the quark/gluon quenching weights for different observables. Furthermore, we extract that the color dependence of energy loss is slightly bigger than what expected from Casimir scaling, pointing to the importance of multi-parton quenching within high-$p_T$ jets at the LHC.</description>

      <title>CompactObject: An open-source Python package for full-scope neutron star equation of state inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14615v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The CompactObject package is an open-source software framework developed to constrain the neutron star equation of state (EOS) through Bayesian statistical inference. It integrates astrophysical observational constraints from X-ray timing, gravitational wave events, and radio measurements, as well as nuclear experimental constraints derived from perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics (pQCD) and Chiral Effective Field Theory ($\chi$EFT). The package supports a diverse range of EOS models, including meta-model like and several physics-motivated EOS models. It comprises three independent components: an EOS generator module that currently provides seven EOS choices, a Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equation solver, that allows the determination of the Mass Radius and Tidal deformability as observables, and a comprehensive Bayesian inference workflow module, including a complete pipeline for implementing EOS Bayesian inference. Each component can be used independently in different scientific research contexts, such as nuclear physics and astrophysics. In addition, CompactObject is designed to work in synergy with existing software such as CompOSE, allowing the use of the CompOSE EOS database to extend the EOS options available.</description>

      <title>Lattice gradient flows (de-)stabilizing topological sectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the stability of topological charge under gradient flow taking the admissibility condition into account. For the $SU(2)$ Wilson gauge theory with $\beta=2.45$ and $L^4=12^4$, we numerically show that the gradient flows with the Iwasaki and DBW2 gauge actions stabilize the topological sectors significantly, and they have qualitatively different behaviors compared with the Wilson and tree-level Symanzik flows. By considering the classical continuum limit of the flow actions, we discuss that the coefficient of dimension-$6$ operators has to be positive for stabilizing the one-instanton configuration, and the Iwasaki and DBW2 actions satisfy this criterion while the Wilson and Symanzik actions do not. Moreover, we observe that the DBW2 flow stabilizes the topological sectors at the very early stage of the flow ($\hat{t}\approx 0.5$--$1$), which suggests that the use of the DBW2 action for the gradient flow is computationally efficient to determine the gauge topology.</description>

      <title>Gluon Saturation Effects in Exclusive Heavy Vector Meson Photoproduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study exclusive $J/\psi$ and $\Upsilon$ photoproduction for proton and Pb targets in the high-energy limit, with the energy dependence computed using the linear Balitsky-Fadin-Kuraev-Lipatov and the nonlinear Balitsky-Kovchegov evolution equations. The difference between these two evolution equations can be directly attributed to gluon saturation physics. We find that for proton targets there is no difference between the two approaches at the energies of the currently available data, while for Pb targets in $J/\psi$ production the data shows a clear preference for the evolution with gluon saturation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14826v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the framework of a constituent quark mass model, the modified baryon masses are incorporated into the hadron resonance gas (HRG) based analysis of the like mass particle ratios in ultra relativistic nucleus-nucleus collisions (URNNC) over a wide range of collision energy. In addition we have incorporated an essential feature of the hadronic interaction at short distance, i.e. the hard-core repulsion by using the standard excluded volume type approach. We have extracted the chemical freeze-out conditions. The resulting freeze-out line in our case is compared with those obtained earlier using different model approaches. The correlation between $k^{-}/k^{+}$ and $\bar p/p$ ratios is also studied.</description>

      <title>Bayesian inference of strangeon matter using the measurements of PSR J0437-4715 and GW190814</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14938v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The observations of compact star inspirals from LIGO/Virgo combined with mass and radius measurements from NICER provide a valuable tool to study the highly uncertain equation of state (EOS) of dense matter at the densities characteristic of compact stars. In this work, we constrain the solid states of strange-cluster matter, called strangeon matter, as the putative basic units of the ground state of bulk strong matter using a Bayesian statistical method, incorporating the mass and radius measurements of PSR J0030+0451, PSR J0740+6620, and the recent data for the $1.4\ M_{\odot}$ pulsar PSR J0437-4715. We also include constraints from gravitational wave events GW170817 and GW190814. Under the prior assumption of a finite number of quarks in a strangeon, $N_{\rm q}$, our analysis reveals that current mass-radius measurements favor a larger $N_{\rm q}$. Specifically, the results support the scenario where a strangeon forms a stable bound state with $N_{\rm q}=18$, symmetric in color, flavor, and spin spaces, compared to the minimum $N_{\rm q}$ prior. The comparative analyses of the posterior EOS parameter spaces derived from three-parameter model and two-parameter model demonstrate a consistent prediction under identical observational constraints. In particular, our results indicate that the most probable values of the maximum mass are found to be $3.58^{+0.16}_{-0.12}\ M_{\odot}$ ($3.65^{+0.18}_{-0.16}\ M_{\odot}$) at $90\%$ confidence level for three-parameter (two-parameter) EOS considering the constraints of GW190814. The corresponding radii for $1.4\ M_{\odot}$ and $2.1\ M_{\odot}$ stars are $12.04^{+0.27}_{-0.31}~\rm km$ ($12.16^{+0.26}_{-0.31}~\rm km$) and $13.43^{+0.31}_{-0.32}~\rm km$ ($13.60^{+0.29}_{-0.34}~\rm km$), respectively. This result may impact interestingly on the research of multiquark states, which could improve our understanding of the nonperturbative strong force.</description>

      <title>Hyperons in neutron star mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14978v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss the effects induced by the potential presence of hyperons in hot and ultra-dense matter within the context of neutron star mergers. Specifically, we address their effect on the dominant post-merger frequency of the gravitational waves. By performing a simulation campaign with a large sample of hyperonic and nucleonic equations of state, we explicitly show that the unique thermal behavior of hyperonic equations of state results in a systematic shift of the dominant frequency with respect to the nucleonic reference level. The predicted shift has values of up to 150 Hz, and it could be detected with the newest generations of gravitational wave detectors. Thus this approach opens a new path for signaling the presence of hyperons in neutron star remnant matter.</description>

      <title>Systematic shell-model analysis of $2\nu\beta\beta$ decay of $^{76}$Ge and $^{96}$Zr to the ground and excited states of $^{76}$Se and $^{96}$Mo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11896v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we have studied the $2\nu\beta\beta$ decay of $^{76}$Ge and $^{96}$Zr isotopes utilizing large-scale shell-model calculations. The GWBXG effective interaction has been employed in the calculation of $2\nu\beta\beta$-decay nuclear matrix elements (NMEs). We have tested the effective interaction by comparing the predicted spectroscopic properties, such as energy spectra and transition probabilities, with the available experimental data. The variation of cumulative NMEs with respect to the $1^+$ state energies of the intermediate nucleus is also studied, corresponding to $0^+_{\rm g.s.}\rightarrow0^+_{\rm g.s.}$, $0^+_{\rm g.s.}\rightarrow0^+_{2}$, and $0^+_{\rm g.s.}\rightarrow2^+_{1}$ transitions between the parent and grand-daughter nuclei. The effective values of axial-vector coupling strength ($g_A^{\rm eff}$) are calculated using the predicted NMEs and experimental half-lives for $0^+_{\rm g.s.}\rightarrow0^+_{\rm g.s.}$ transitions. The extracted half-lives for $0^+_{\rm g.s.}\rightarrow0^+_{2}$, and $0^+_{\rm g.s.}\rightarrow2^+_{1}$ transitions using the shell-model predicted NMEs are consistent with the recent experimental data. The comparison of the shell-model predicted NMEs with previous NMEs available in the literature is discussed. Also, the computed branching ratios for the $2\nu\beta\beta$ decay of $^{76}$Ge and both the $2\nu\beta\beta$ and single-$\beta$ decay of $^{96}$Zr are reported corresponding to the calculated $g_A^{\rm eff}$ values.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21643v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rates of flavor-changing weak processes are crucial in determining the conditions of beta equilibrium in neutron stars and mergers, influencing the damping of oscillations, the stability of rotating pulsars, and the emission of gravitational waves. We derive a formula for these rates at nonzero temperature, to leading order in the Fermi coupling and exact in the QCD coupling. Utilizing a simple phenomenological holographic model dual to QCD, we study massless unpaired quark matter at high densities. We numerically compute the rate for small deviations from beta equilibrium and derive an analytic approximation for small temperatures. Our findings reveal that, compared to the perturbative result, the rate is suppressed by logarithmic factors of the temperature.</description>

      <title>Transient dynamics of quasinormal mode sums</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06685v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quasinormal modes of spacetimes with event horizons are typically governed by a non-normal operator. This gives rise to spectral instabilities, a topic of recent interest in the black hole pseudospectrum programme. In this work we show that non-normality leads to the existence of arbitrarily long-lived sums of short-lived quasinormal modes, corresponding to localising packets of energy near the future horizon. There exist sums of $M$ quasinormal modes whose lifetimes scale as $\log{M}$. This transient behaviour results from large cancellations between non-orthogonal quasinormal modes. We provide simple closed-form examples for a massive scalar field in the static patch of dS$_{d+1}$ and the BTZ black hole. We also provide numerical examples for scalar perturbations of Schwarzschild-AdS$_{d+1}$, and gravitational perturbations of Schwarzschild in asymptotically flat spacetime, using hyperboloidal foliations. The existence of these perturbations is linked to certain properties of black hole pseudospectra. We comment on implications for thermalisation times in holographic plasmas.</description>

Abstract: We investigate contributions of excited states to nucleon matrix elements computed in lattice QCD by employing, in addition to the standard nucleon interpolating operator, pion-nucleon ($\pi$-$N$) operators. We solve a generalized eigenvalue problem (GEVP) to obtain an optimal interpolating operator that minimizes overlap with the $\pi$-$N$ states. We derive a variant of the standard application of the GEVP method, which allows for constructing 3-point correlation functions using the optimized interpolating operator without requiring the computationally demanding combination that includes $\pi$-$N$ operators in both sink and source. We extract nucleon matrix elements using two twisted mass fermion ensembles, one ensemble generated using pion mass of 346 MeV and one ensemble tuned to reproduce the physical value of the pion mass. Especially, we determine the isoscalar and isovector scalar, pseudoscalar, vector, axial, and tensor matrix elements. We include results obtained using a range of kinematic setups, including momentum in the sink. Our results using this variational approach are compared with previous results obtained using the same ensembles and multi-state fits without GEVP improvement. We find that for the physical mass point ensemble, the improvement, in terms of suppression of excited states using this method, is most significant for the case of the matrix elements of the isovector axial and pseudoscalar currents.</description>

      <title>The impact of dark matter on tidal signatures in neutron star mergers with Einstein Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14711v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: If dark matter (DM) accumulates inside neutron stars (NS), it changes their internal structure and causes a shift of the tidal deformability from the value predicted by the dense-matter equation of state (EOS). In principle, this shift could be observable in the gravitational-wave (GW) signal of binary neutron star (BNS) mergers. We investigate the effect of fermionic, non-interacting DM when observing a large number of GW events from DM-admixed BNSs with the precision of the proposed Einstein telescope (ET). Specifically, we study the impact on the recovery of the baryonic EOS and whether DM properties can be constrained. For this purpose, we create event catalogues of BNS mock events with DM fraction up to 1%, from which we reconstruct the posterior uncertainties with the Fisher matrix approach. Using this data, we perform joint Bayesian inference on the baryonic EOS, DM particle mass, and DM particle fraction in each event. Our results reveal that when falsely ignoring DM effects, the EOS posterior is biased towards softer EOSs, though the offset is rather small. Further, we find that within our assumptions of our DM model and population, ET will likely not be able to test the presence of DM in BNSs, even when combining many events and adding Cosmic Explorer (CE) to the next-generation detector network. Likewise, the potential constraints on the DM particle mass will remain weak because of degeneracies with the fraction and EOS.</description>
