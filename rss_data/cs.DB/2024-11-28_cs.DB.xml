      <title>CrypQ: A Database Benchmark Based on Dynamic, Ever-Evolving Ethereum Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern database systems are expected to handle dynamic data whose characteristics may evolve over time. Many popular database benchmarks are limited in their ability to evaluate this dynamic aspect of the database systems. Those that use synthetic data generators often fail to capture the complexity and unpredictable nature of real data, while most real-world datasets are static and difficult to create high-volume, realistic updates for. This paper introduces CrypQ, a database benchmark leveraging dynamic, public Ethereum blockchain data. CrypQ offers a high-volume, ever-evolving dataset reflecting the unpredictable nature of a real and active cryptocurrency market. We detail CrypQ's schema, procedures for creating data snapshots and update sequences, and a suite of relevant SQL queries. As an example, we demonstrate CrypQ's utility in evaluating cost-based query optimizers on complex, evolving data distributions with real-world skewness and dependencies.</description>

      <title>Stochastic SketchRefine: Scaling In-Database Decision-Making under Uncertainty to Millions of Tuples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decision making under uncertainty often requires choosing packages, or bags of tuples, that collectively optimize expected outcomes while limiting risks. Processing Stochastic Package Queries (SPQs) involves solving very large optimization problems on uncertain data. Monte Carlo methods create numerous scenarios, or sample realizations of the stochastic attributes of all the tuples, and generate packages with optimal objective values across these scenarios. The number of scenarios needed for accurate approximation - and hence the size of the optimization problem when using prior methods - increases with variance in the data, and the search space of the optimization problem increases exponentially with the number of tuples in the relation. Existing solvers take hours to process SPQs on large relations containing stochastic attributes with high variance. Besides enriching the SPaQL language to capture a broader class of risk specifications, we make two fundamental contributions towards scalable SPQ processing. First, to handle high variance, we propose risk-constraint linearization (RCL), which converts SPQs into Integer Linear Programs (ILPs) whose size is independent of the number of scenarios used. Solving these ILPs gives us feasible and near-optimal packages. Second, we propose Stochastic SketchRefine, a divide and conquer framework that breaks down a large stochastic optimization problem into subproblems involving smaller subsets of tuples. Our experiments show that, together, RCL and Stochastic SketchRefine produce high-quality packages in orders of magnitude lower runtime than the state of the art.</description>

      <title>Equi join query acceleration using algebraic signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evaluation of join queries is very challenging since they have to deal with an increasing data size. We study the relational join query processing realized by hash tables and we focus on the case of equi join queries. We propose to use a new form of signatures, the algebraic signatures, for fast comparison between values of two attributes in relations participating in an equi join operations. Our technique is efficient especially when the attribute join is a long string. In this paper, we investigate this issue and prove that algebraic signatures combined to known hash join technique constitute an efficient method to accelerate equi join operations. Algebraic signatures allow fast string search. They are descending from the Karp-Rabin signatures. String matching using our algebraic calculus is then several times faster comparing to the fastest known methods, e.g. Boyer Moore.We justify our approach and present an experimental evaluation. We also present a cost analysis for an equi join operation using algebraic signatures. The performance evaluation of our technique shows the improvement of query processing times. We also discuss the reductions of required memory sizes and the disk I/O. The main contribution of this paper is the using of algebraic signatures to accelerate equi join operations especially when the attribute join is a long string and to avoid multiples I/O disk by reduce memory requirement.</description>

      <title>DataVisT5: A Pre-trained Language Model for Jointly Understanding Text and Data Visualization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07401v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data visualization (DV) is the fundamental and premise tool to improve the efficiency in conveying the insights behind the big data, which has been widely accepted in existing data-driven world. Task automation in DV, such as converting natural language queries to visualizations (i.e., text-to-vis), generating explanations from visualizations (i.e., vis-to-text), answering DV-related questions in free form (i.e. FeVisQA), and explicating tabular data (i.e., table-to-text), is vital for advancing the field. Despite their potential, the application of pre-trained language models (PLMs) like T5 and BERT in DV has been limited by high costs and challenges in handling cross-modal information, leading to few studies on PLMs for DV. We introduce DataVisT5, a novel PLM tailored for DV that enhances the T5 architecture through a hybrid objective pre-training and multi-task fine-tuning strategy, integrating text and DV datasets to effectively interpret cross-modal semantics. Extensive evaluations on public datasets show that DataVisT5 consistently outperforms current state-of-the-art models on various DV-related tasks. We anticipate that DataVisT5 will not only inspire further research on vertical PLMs but also expand the range of applications for PLMs.</description>
