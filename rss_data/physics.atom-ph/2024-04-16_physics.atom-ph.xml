      <title>Ultra-Wide Dual-band Rydberg Atomic Receiver Based on Space Division Multiplexing RF-Chip Modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detecting microwave signals over a wide frequency range has numerous advantages as it enables simultaneous transmission of a large amount of information and access to more spectrum resources. This capability is crucial for applications such as microwave communication, remote sensing, and radar. However, conventional microwave receiving systems are limited by amplifiers and band-pass filters that can only operate efficiently in a specific frequency range. Typically, these systems can only process signals within a three-fold frequency range, which limits the data transfer bandwidth of the microwave communication systems. Developing novel atom-integrated microwave sensors, for example, radio frequency (RF)-chip coupled Rydberg atomic receiver, provides opportunities for a large working bandwidth of microwave sensing at the atomic level. Here, an ultra-wide dual-band RF sensing scheme is demonstrated by space-division multiplexing two RF-chip-integrated atomic receiver modules. The system can simultaneously receive dual-band microwave signals that span a frequency range exceeding 6 octaves (300 MHz and 24 GHz). This work paves the way for multi-band microwave reception applications within an ultra-wide range by RF-chip-integrated Rydberg atomic sensor.</description>

      <title>Temporal-Spatial Manipulation of Bi-Focal Bi-Chromatic Fields for Terahertz Radiations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mixing the fundamental ($\omega$) and the second harmonic (2$\omega$) waves in gas phase is a widely employed technique for emitting terahertz (THz) pulses. The THz generation driven by bi-chromatic fields can be described by the photocurrent model, where the THz generation is attributed to free electrons ionized by the $\omega$ field, and the 2$\omega$ field provides a perturbation to break the symmetry of the asymptotic momentum of free electrons. However, we find that the THz radiation is amplified by one order of magnitude when driven by bi-focal bi-chromatic fields, contradicting the common understanding of the photocurrent model. Meanwhile, present measurements demonstrate that the THz radiation mainly originates from the plasma created by the 2$\omega$ pulses instead of the $\omega$ pulses. Energy transfer from the 2$\omega$ beam to the THz beam during the THz generation has been observed, validating the major contribution of the 2$\omega$ beam. Furthermore, the THz bandwidth has been observed to extensively exceed the bandwidth of the pump pulse, not be explained by the photocurrent model as well. These counterintuitive results indicate that undiscovered physical mechanisms are involved in bi-chromatic THz generation in plasma, presenting a significant challenge for understanding strong-field nonlinear optics and simultaneously expanding various applications.</description>

      <title>Coherently controlling robust spin-orbit qubits of electrons in nanowire quantum dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider an electron confined in a gated nanowire quantum dot (NQD) with arbitrarily strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and weak static magnetic field, and treat the latter as a perturbation to seek the maximal spin-motion entangled states with the exact general solutions of the perturbed equations. From the boundedness and self-consistent conditions of the general solutions we find two corrected energies to any n level of the unperturbed system with ground state n = 0, which are much less than the unperturbed level-difference and corresponds to a spin-orbit qubit. We demonstrate the metastability of the two-level states and the decoherence-averse effect of SOC, and suggest an alternative scheme to perform the qubit control, simply by adjusting the orientation of magnetic field for any fixed SOC. Such a adjustment can lead to the spin flipping of the state vector and the position exchanging of the probability-density wavepackets which can be proposed as the non-Abelian quasiparticles. The results could be directly extended to a weakly coupled array of NQDs for coherently encoding the robust spin-orbit qubits.</description>

      <title>Early warning signals of the tipping point in strongly interacting Rydberg atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09239v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The identification of tipping points is essential for prediction of collapses or other sudden changes in complex systems. Applications include studies of ecology, thermodynamics, climatology, and epidemiology. However, detecting early signs of proximity to a tipping is made challenging by complexity and non-linearity. Strongly interacting Rydberg atom gases offer a model systems that offer both complexity and non-linearity, including phase transition and critical slowing down. Here, via an external probe we observe prior warning of the proximity of a phase transition of Rydberg thermal gases. This warning signal is manifested as a cessation of the variance growth with increasing probe intensity. We also observed the dynamics of the critical slowing down behavior versus different time scales, driving intensities, and atomic densities, thus providing insights into the study of a Rydberg atom system's critical behavior. Our experiment suggests that the full critical slowing down dynamics of strongly-interacting Rydberg atoms can be probed systematically, thus providing a benchmark with which to identify critical phenomena in quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Measurement-Induced Heating of Trapped Ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We experimentally study the heating of trapped atomic ions during measurement of their internal qubit states. During measurement, ions are projected into one of two basis states and discriminated by their state-dependent fluorescence. We observe that ions in the fluorescing state rapidly scatter photons and heat at a rate of $\dot{\bar{n}}\sim 2\times 10^4$ quanta/s, which is $\sim 30$ times faster than the anomalous ion heating rate. We introduce a quantum trajectory-based framework that accurately reproduces the experimental results and provides a unified description of ion heating for both continuous and discrete sources.</description>

      <title>Fast single atom imaging in optical lattice arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09978v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-resolution fluorescence imaging of ultracold atoms and molecules is paramount to performing quantum simulation and computation in optical lattices and optical tweezers. Imaging durations in these experiments typically range from a millisecond to a second, which can significantly limit the cycle time. In this work, we present fast, 2.4 us single-atom imaging in lattices, with 99.4% fidelity. Additionally, we resolve lattice sites spaced within the diffraction limit by using accordion lattices to increase the atom spacing before imaging. This overcomes the challenge of imaging small-spacing lattices and enables the study of extended Hubbard models using magnetic atoms. We also demonstrate number-resolved imaging without parity projection, which will facilitate experiments such as the exploration of high-filling phases in the extended Bose-Hubbard models, multi-band or SU(N) Fermi-Hubbard models, and quantum link models.</description>

      <title>Closed-Loop Dual-Atom-Interferometer Inertial Sensor with Continuous Cold Atomic Beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.15346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.15346v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate a closed-loop light-pulse atom interferometer inertial sensor that can realize continuous decoupled measurements of acceleration and rotation rate. The sensor operates with double-loop atom interferometers, which share the same Raman light pulses in a spatially separated Mach-Zehnder configuration and use continuous cold atomic beams propagating in opposite directions from two 2D$^+$ magneto-optical trappings. Acceleration and the rotation rate are decoupled and simultaneously measured by the sum and difference of dual atom-interferometer signals, respectively. The sensitivities of inertial measurements are also increased to be approximately 1.86 times higher than that of a single atom interferometer. The acceleration phase shift is compensated in real time by phase-locking these interferometers via the Raman laser phases from the sum interferometer signal, and the gyroscope perfomance is improved. We achieve long-term stabilities of $6.1 \ \mu g$ and 840 nrad/s for the acceleration and the rotation rate, respectively, using a short interrogation time of 0.87ms (interference area $A=0.097$ mm$^2$). This work provides a building block for an atomic interferometer based inertial measurement unit for use in field applications that require a high data-rate and high stability.</description>

      <title>Observation of a time crystal comb in a driven-dissipative system with Rydberg gas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.13112v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Time crystals, as temporal analogs of space crystals, manifest as stable and periodic behavior that breaks time translation symmetry. In an open quantum system, many-body interaction subjected to dissipation allows one to develop the time crystalline order in an unprecedented way, as refer to dissipative time crystal. Here we report the observation of a time crystal comb in the continuously driven-dissipative and strongly interacting Rydberg thermal gas, in which continuous time crystal and sub-harmonics of limit cycles as well as the high-order harmonic oscillation phases are observed in the same system by manipulating the Rydberg excitation. Our work provides new ways to explore the nonequilibrium phases of matter in open systems. Such time crystals with persistent oscillation rooted in emergent quantum correlations, may emerge as a ubiquitous tool in quantum metrology, for instance, continuous sensing and parameter estimation surpassing the standard quantum limit.</description>

      <title>Fock-space relativistic coupled-cluster calculations of clock transition properties in Pb$^{2+}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15841v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have implemented an all-particle multireference Fock-space relativistic coupled-cluster theory to probe $6s^2{\;^1}S_{0} - 6s6p{\;^3P^o_{0}}$ clock transition in an even isotope of Pb$^{2+}$. We have computed, excitation energy for several low lying states, E1 and M1 transition amplitudes, and the lifetime of the clock state. Moreover, we have also calculated the ground state dipole polarizability using perturbed relativistic coupled-cluster theory. To improve the accuracy of results, we incorporated the corrections from the relativistic and QED effects in all our calculations. The contributions from triple excitations are accounted perturbatively. Our computed excitation energies are in excellent agreement with the experimental values for all the states. Our result for lifetime, $9.76\times10^{6}$ s, of clock state is $\approx$ 8.5\% larger than the previous value using CI+MBPT [Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 127}, 013201 (2021)]. Based on our analysis, we find that the contributions from the {\em valence-valence} correlations arising from higher energy configurations and the corrections from the perturbative triples and QED effects are essential to get accurate clock transition properties in Pb$^{2+}$. Our computed value of dipole polarizability is in good agreement with the available theoretical and experimental data.</description>

      <title>Connecting shear-flow and vortex array instabilities in annular atomic superfluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.12631v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: At the interface between two fluid layers in relative motion, infinitesimal fluctuations can be exponentially amplified, inducing vorticity and the breakdown of the laminar flow. This process, known as the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, is responsible for many familiar phenomena observed in the atmosphere and in the oceans, as well as in astrophysical objects, being known as one of the paradigmatic routes to turbulence in fluid mechanics. While shear-flow instabilities in classical fluids have been extensively observed in various contexts, controlled experiments in the presence of quantized circulation are comparatively very few. Here, we engineer two counter-rotating atomic superflows, a configuration that in classical inviscid fluids is unstable via the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. We observe how the contact interface, i.e. the shear layer, develops into an ordered circular array of quantized vortices, which loses stability and rolls up into vortex clusters. We extract the instability growth rates and find that they obey the same scaling relations across different superfluid regimes, ranging from weakly-interacting bosonic to strongly-correlated fermionic pair condensates. The measured scalings, reproduced by numerical simulations and well described by a microscopic point-vortex model, are consistent with the classical hydrodynamic Kelvin-Helmholtz instability of a finite-width shear layer. Our results establish interesting connections between vortex arrays and shear-flow instabilities, suggesting a possible interpretation of the observed quantized vortex dynamics as a manifestation of the underlying unstable flow. Moreover, they open the way for exploring a wealth of out-of-equilibrium phenomena, from vortex-matter phase transitions to the spontaneous emergence and decay of two-dimensional quantum turbulence.</description>
