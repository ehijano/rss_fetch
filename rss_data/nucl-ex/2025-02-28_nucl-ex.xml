      <title>Measurement of $\omega$ meson production in pp and p-Pb collisions at $\mathbf{\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} = 5.02}$ TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the measurement of the $p_{\rm T}$-differential production cross section of $\omega$ mesons in pp and p-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} = 5.02$ TeV at midrapidity by ALICE. In addition, the first measurement of the nuclear modification factor $R_{\rm{pPb}}$ for $\omega$ mesons at LHC energies is presented, complementing the existing measurements of lighter neutral mesons such as the $\pi^0$ and $\eta$. Within the measured $p_{\rm T}$-range, the $R_{\rm{pPb}}$ of $\omega$ mesons shows no cold nuclear matter effects within the uncertainties, consistent with previous measurements at lower energies. The $\omega/\pi^0$ ratio is presented for both collision systems, showing no collision system dependence within the uncertainties. The comparison to previously published $\omega/\pi^0$ ratios at lower and higher collision energies in pp collisions suggests a decreasing trend of the ratio above $p_{\rm T} = 4$ GeV/$c$ with increasing collision energy. The data in both collision systems are compared to predictions from PYTHIA 8, EPOS LHC and DPMJET event generators, revealing significant shortcomings in these models' ability to describe the production of $\omega$ mesons.</description>

      <title>Investigating the p-$\pi^{\pm}$ and p-p-$\pi^{\pm}$ dynamics with femtoscopy in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interaction between pions and nucleons plays a crucial role in hadron physics. It represents a fundamental building block of the low-energy QCD dynamics and is subject to several resonance excitations. This work studies the p-$\pi^{\pm}$ dynamics using femtoscopic correlations in high-multiplicity pp collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV measured by ALICE at the LHC. As the final-state interaction between protons and pions is well constrained by scattering experiments and the study of pionic hydrogen, the results give access to information on the particle-emitting source in pp collisions using the femtoscopy methods. The scaling of the source size of primordial protons and pions against their pair transverse mass is extracted. The results are compared with the source sizes studied with p-p, p-K$^+$, and $\pi^{\pm}$-$\pi^{\pm}$ pairs by ALICE in the same collision system and are found to be in agreement for the different particle pairs. This reinforces recent findings by ALICE of a common emission source for all hadron-pairs in pp collisions at LHC energies. Furthermore, the p-p-$\pi^{\pm}$ systems are studied using three-particle femtoscopy in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV. The presence of three-body effects is analyzed utilizing the cumulant expansion method. In this formalism, the known two-body interactions are subtracted in order to isolate the three-body effects. For both, p-p-$\pi^{+}$ and p-p-$\pi^{-}$, a non-zero cumulant is found, indicating effects beyond pairwise interactions. These results give information on the coupling of the pion to multiple nucleons.</description>

      <title>Low-energy neutron cross-talk between organic scintillator detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19508v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A series of measurements have been performed with low-energy monoenergetic neutrons to characterise cross-talk between two organic scintillator detectors. Cross-talk time-of-flight spectra and probabilities were determined for neutron energies from 1.4 to 15.5 MeV and effective scattering angles ranging from $\sim$50{\deg} to $\sim$100{\deg}. Monte-Carlo simulations incorporating both the active and inactive materials making up the detectors showed reasonable agreement with the measurements. Whilst the time-of-flight spectra were very well reproduced, the cross-talk probabilities were only in approximate agreement with the measurements, with the most significant discrepancies ($\sim$40 %) occurring at the lowest energies. The neutron interaction processes producing cross-talk at the energies explored here are discussed in the light of these results.</description>

      <title>The Gross-Llewellyn Smith sum rule from lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the Gross-Llewellyn Smith sum rule, i.e. the lowest odd moment of the parity-violating structure function, $F_3$, of the nucleon from a lattice QCD calculation of the Compton amplitude. Our calculations are performed on $48^3 \times 96$ lattices at the $SU(3)$ symmetric point for two lattice spacings. We extract the moments for several values of the current momenta in the range $0.5 \lesssim Q^2 \lesssim 10 \; {\rm GeV}^2$, covering both the nonperturbative and perturbative regimes. We compare our moments to the Gross-Llewellyn Smith sum rule and discuss the implications for higher-twist effects, a determination of $\alpha_s(Q^2)$ from a hadronic quantity complementing the phenomenological and other lattice approaches, and electroweak box contributions crucial for CKM unitarity studies.</description>

      <title>Correlations between neutron driplines and neutron star properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19762v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the influence of the nuclear symmetry energy and its density slope parameter on the neutron dripline and neutron star properties using a semi-classical liquid drop model (LDM) and energy density functionals constrained by chiral effective field theory. To analyze finite nuclei and mass tables, the nuclear symmetry energy at saturation density is fixed, and the surface tension is determined to minimize the root-mean-square deviation of the total binding energy for 2208 nuclei. Correlations between symmetry energy parameters and neutron driplines, crust-core transition densities, and the radii of $1.4\,\msun$ neutron stars are explored using the LDM framework. Additionally, we examine the relationship between macroscopic properties, such as neutron star radii ($R_{1.4}$), and microscopic properties, including the number of isotopes and the last bound nucleus for $Z=28$, within the LDM context.</description>

      <title>The $\eta^\prime N$ interaction from the $\eta^\prime p$ correlation function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20020v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We evaluate for the first time the $\eta^\prime p$ femtoscopic correlation function to study the $\eta^\prime N$ interaction. We find it extremely sensitive to the value of the $\eta^\prime p$ scattering length, for which at present there exists only very limited information, not even knowing its sign. The measurement of this correlation function would provide much valuable information on the $\eta^\prime N$ interaction, which could then also be used to settle the issue of possible $\eta^\prime$ nucleus bound states, an issue attracting much attention in the nuclear physics community.</description>

      <title>Generative adversarial neural networks for simulating neutrino interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20244v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new approach to simulate neutrino scattering events as an alternative to the standard Monte Carlo generator approach. Generative adversarial neural network (GAN) models are developed to simulate neutrino-carbon collisions in the few-GeV energy range. The models produce scattering events for a given neutrino energy. GAN models are trained on simulation data from NuWro Monte Carlo event generator. Two GAN models have been obtained: one simulating only quasielastic neutrino-nucleus scatterings and another simulating all interactions at given neutrino energy. The performance of both models has been assessed using two statistical metrics. It is shown that both GAN models successfully reproduce the event distributions.</description>

      <title>Critical evaluation of reference charge radii and applications in mirror nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08193v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I present a critical review of absolute root-mean-square charge radii of stable nuclei from $Z=3$ to $Z=32$, which includes a previously overlooked uncertainty in the combined analysis of muonic x-ray and electron scattering experiments. From these \textit{reference radii} and isotope shift measurements, I obtain those of 12 mirror pairs with a traceable and realistic uncertainty budget. The difference in radii between mirror nuclei is found to be proportional to the isospin asymmetry, confirming recent calculations by Novario \emph{et al}~[PRL~130, 032501]. Assuming that this linear relation holds across the nuclear chart, the fitted proportionality constant, combined with the revised known radii, predicts the radii of 73 previously unknown mirror partners. These are useful e.g., for benchmarking atomic and nuclear theory, calibrating entire chains, and as an input to nuclear beta-decay calculations. The radii of $(T=1,T_z=0)$ nuclei are interpolated assuming negligible isospin symmetry breaking. This completes a model-independent, high-precision extraction of the charge and weak radii of all nuclei involved in the testing of the unitarity of the CKM matrix.</description>

      <title>Thermal production of charm quarks in relativistic heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00425v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the thermal production of charm quarks in the strongly interacting quark-gluon plasma (sQGP) created in heavy-ion collisions at relativistic energies. Our study is based on the off-shell parton-hadron-string dynamics (PHSD) transport approach describing the full time evolution of heavy-ion collisions on a microscopic basis with hadronic and partonic degrees of freedom. The sQGP is realized within the effective dynamical quasi-particle model (DQPM) which is adjusted to reproduce the lattice QCD results for the thermodynamic observables of the sQGP. Relying on the fact that the DQPM successfully describes the spatial diffusion coefficients $D_s$ from the lQCD, which control the interaction of charm quarks with thermal partons (expressed in terms of strongly interacting off-shell quasiparticles), we evaluate the production of charm quark pairs through the rotation of Feynman diagrams such that the incoming charm quark and outgoing light parton in elastic scattering diagrams are exchanged. The charm quark annihilation is realized by detailed balance. We find that the number of produced thermal charm quark pairs strongly depends on the charm quark mass in the QGP. While for the heavy charm quarks of mass $m_c=1.8$ GeV it is subdominant compared to the primary charm production by binary nucleon-nucleon collisions at RHIC and LHC energies, the numbers of primary and thermal charm quarks become comparable for a smaller (bare) $m_c=1.2$ GeV. Compared with the experimental data on the $R_{\rm AA}$ of $D$-mesons in heavy-ion collisions at RHIC and LHC energies, it is more favorable for charm quarks in the QGP to gain additional mass due to thermal effects rather than to have a low bare mass.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic flow in fixed-target $^{208}$Pb+$^{20}$Ne collisions as a probe of quark-gluon plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20210v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The System for Measuring Overlap with Gas (SMOG2) at the LHCb detector enables the study of fixed-target ion-ion collisions at relativistic energies ($\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}\sim100$ GeV in the centre-of-mass). With input from \textit{ab initio} calculations of the structure of $^{16}$O and $^{20}$Ne, we compute 3+1D hydrodynamic predictions for the anisotropic flow of Pb+Ne and Pb+O collisions, to be tested with upcoming LHCb data. This will allow the detailed study of quark-gluon plasma (QGP) formation as well as experimental tests of the predicted nuclear shapes. Elliptic flow ($v_2$) in Pb+Ne collisions is greatly enhanced compared to the Pb+O baseline due to the shape of $^{20}$Ne, which is deformed in a bowling-pin geometry. Owing to the large $^{208}$Pb radius, this effect is seen in a broad centrality range, a unique feature of this collision configuration. Larger elliptic flow further enhances the quadrangular flow ($v_4$) of Pb+Ne collisions via non-linear coupling, and impacts the sign of the kurtosis of the elliptic flow vector distribution ($c_2\{4\}$). Exploiting the shape of $^{20}$Ne proves thus an ideal method to investigate the formation of QGP in fixed-target experiments at LHCb, and demonstrates the power of SMOG2 as a tool to image nuclear ground states.</description>

      <title>Minimizing Selection Bias in Inclusive Jets in Heavy-Ion Collisions with Energy Correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07514v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The first-ever measurement of energy correlators within inclusive jets produced in heavy-ion collisions, revealed by the CMS Collaboration, shows a clear enhancement at large angles relative to the proton-proton (p-p) baseline. However, interpreting this enhancement is complicated due to selection bias from energy loss, which also distorts the energy correlator heavy-ion to p-p ratio in the hadronization region, hindering our understanding of parton/hadron dynamics in a colored medium. In this Letter, we introduce a new ratio of energy correlator observables that removes the leading effects of selection bias from the two-point energy correlator spectrum (E2C). Pythia and Herwig simulations show that the impact of selection bias in the E2C is reduced by an order of magnitude, while sensitivity to any other medium modifications is retained. This quantity can be obtained directly from the experimental measurements presented by CMS, as illustrated in the accompanying note.</description>

      <title>Azimuthal Correlation Anisotropies in p + p Collisions Simulated by Pythia</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13143v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stimulated by the keen interest of possible collective behavior in high-energy proton-proton and proton-nucleus collisions, we study two-particle angular correlations in pseudorapidity and azimuthal differences in simulated p + p interactions by the Pythia 8 event generator. Multi-parton interactions and color connection are included in these simulations which have been perceived to produce collectivity in final-state particles. Meanwhile, contributions from genuine few-body nonflow correlations, not of collective flow behavior, are known to be severe in those small-system collisions. We present our Pythia correlation studies in a pedagogical way and report azimuthal harmonic anisotropies analyzed by several methods. We observe anisotropies in those Pythia simulated events qualitatively and semi-quantitatively similar to experimental data. Our findings highlight the delicate nature of azimuthal anisotropies in small-system collisions, and provide a benchmark helping improve data analysis and interpret experimental measurements in small-system collisions.</description>

      <title>Imaging Freeze-out Sources and Extracting Strong Interaction Parameters in Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08718v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By combining femtoscopic interferometry with an optical deblurring algorithm, we present a novel method to image the source in heavy-ion collisions (HICs) while simultaneously determining the interaction strength between particle pairs. The spatial distribution of the emission source has been reconstructed for protons ($p$) and antiprotons ($\bar{p}$) from the respective $pp$ and $\bar{p}\bar{p}$ correlation functions in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{S_{\rm NN}}=200$ GeV. Within experimental uncertainties, protons and antiprotons share the same freeze-out distribution showing higher density in the center compared to the widely assumed Gaussian shape. The results evidence the matter-antimatter symmetry in coordinate space at the moment of freeze-out before the nucleons are fully randomized in the collisions.</description>
