      <title>Modeling the Feedback of AI Price Estimations on Actual Market Values</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18434</link>

Abstract: Public availability of Artificial Intelligence generated information can change the markets forever, and its factoring into economical dynamics may take economists by surprise, out-dating models and schools of thought. Real estate hyper-inflation is not a new phenomenon but its consistent and almost monotonous persistence over 12 years, coinciding with prominence of public estimation information from Zillow, a successful Mass Real Estate Estimator (MREE), could not escape unobserved. What we model is a repetitive theoretical game between the MREE and the home owners, where each player has secret information and expertise. If the intention is to keep housing affordable and maintain old American lifestyle with broad home-ownership, new challenges are defined. Simulations show that a simple restriction of MREE-style price estimation availability to opt-in properties may help partially reduce feedback loop by acting on its likely causes, as suggested by experimental simulation models. The conjecture that the MREE pressure on real estate inflation rate is correlated with the absolute MREE estimation errors, which is logically explainable, is then validated in simulations.</description>

      <title>Equity Implications of Net-Zero Emissions: A Multi-Model Analysis of Energy Expenditures Across Income Classes Under Economy-Wide Deep Decarbonization Policies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18748v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With companies, states, and countries targeting net-zero emissions around midcentury, there are questions about how these targets alter household welfare and finances, including distributional effects across income groups. This paper examines the distributional dimensions of technology transitions and net-zero policies with a focus on welfare impacts across household incomes. The analysis uses a model intercomparison with a range of energy-economy models using harmonized policy scenarios reaching economy-wide, net-zero CO2 emissions across the United States in 2050. We employ a novel linking approach that connects output from detailed energy system models with survey microdata on energy expenditures across income classes to provide distributional analysis of net-zero policies. Although there are differences in model structure and input assumptions, we find broad agreement in qualitative trends in policy incidence and energy burdens across income groups. Models generally agree that direct energy expenditures for many households will likely decline over time with reference and net-zero policies. However, there is variation in the extent of changes relative to current levels, energy burdens relative to reference levels, and electricity expenditures. Policy design, primarily how climate policy revenues are used, has first-order impacts on distributional outcomes. Net-zero policy costs, in both absolute and relative terms, are unevenly distributed across households, and relative increases in energy expenditures are higher for lowest-income households. However, we also find that recycled revenues from climate policies have countervailing effects when rebated on a per-capita basis, offsetting higher energy burdens and potentially even leading to net progressive outcomes.</description>

      <title>Phase transitions in debt recycling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Debt recycling is an aggressive equity extraction strategy that potentially permits faster repayment of a mortgage. While equity progressively builds up as the mortgage is repaid monthly, mortgage holders may obtain another loan they could use to invest on a risky asset. The wealth produced by a successful investment is then used to repay the mortgage faster. The strategy is riskier than a standard repayment plan since fluctuations in the house market and investment's volatility may also lead to a fast default, as both the mortgage and the liquidity loan are secured against the same good. The general conditions of the mortgage holder and the outside market under which debt recycling may be recommended or discouraged have not been fully investigated. In this paper, to evaluate the effectiveness of traditional monthly mortgage repayment versus debt recycling strategies, we build a dynamical model of debt recycling and study the time evolution of equity and mortgage balance as a function of loan-to-value ratio, house market performance, and return of the risky investment. We find that the model has a rich behavior as a function of its main parameters, showing strongly and weakly successful phases - where the mortgage is eventually repaid faster and slower than the standard monthly repayment strategy, respectively - a default phase where the equity locked in the house vanishes before the mortgage is repaid, signalling a failure of the debt recycling strategy, and a permanent re-mortgaging phase - where further investment funds from the lender are continuously secured, but the mortgage is never fully repaid. The strategy's effectiveness is found to be highly sensitive to the initial mortgage-to-equity ratio, the monthly amount of scheduled repayments, and the economic parameters at the outset. The analytical results are corroborated with numerical simulations with excellent agreement.</description>

      <title>Language Models Trained to do Arithmetic Predict Human Risky and Intertemporal Choice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19313v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The observed similarities in the behavior of humans and Large Language Models (LLMs) have prompted researchers to consider the potential of using LLMs as models of human cognition. However, several significant challenges must be addressed before LLMs can be legitimately regarded as cognitive models. For instance, LLMs are trained on far more data than humans typically encounter, and may have been directly trained on human data in specific cognitive tasks or aligned with human preferences. Consequently, the origins of these behavioral similarities are not well understood. In this paper, we propose a novel way to enhance the utility of LLMs as cognitive models. This approach involves (i) leveraging computationally equivalent tasks that both an LLM and a rational agent need to master for solving a cognitive problem and (ii) examining the specific task distributions required for an LLM to exhibit human-like behaviors. We apply this approach to decision-making -- specifically risky and intertemporal choice -- where the key computationally equivalent task is the arithmetic of expected value calculations. We show that an LLM pretrained on an ecologically valid arithmetic dataset, which we call Arithmetic-GPT, predicts human behavior better than many traditional cognitive models. Pretraining LLMs on ecologically valid arithmetic datasets is sufficient to produce a strong correspondence between these models and human decision-making. Our results also suggest that LLMs used as cognitive models should be carefully investigated via ablation studies of the pretraining data.</description>

      <title>Kites and Quails: Monetary Policy and Communication with Strategic Financial Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.08958v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a model to study the consequences of including financial stability among the central bank's objectives when market players are strategic, and surprises compromise their stability. In this setup, central banks underreact to economic shocks, a prediction consistent with the Federal Reserve's behavior during the 2023 banking crisis. Moreover, policymakers' stability concerns bias investors' choices, inducing inefficiency. If the central bank has private information about its policy intentions, the equilibrium forward guidance entails an information loss, highlighting a trade-off between stabilizing markets through policy and communication. A "kitish" central banker, who puts less weight on stability, reduces these inefficiencies.</description>

      <title>Consumers' Perceived Privacy Violations in Online Advertising</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03612v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In response to privacy concerns about collecting and using personal data, the online advertising industry has been developing privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs), e.g., under Google's Privacy Sandbox initiative. In this research, we use the dual-privacy framework, which postulates that consumers have intrinsic and instrumental preferences for privacy, to understand consumers' perceived privacy violations (PPVs) for current and proposed online advertising practices. The key idea is that different practices differ in whether individual data leaves the consumer's machine or not and in how they track and target consumers; these affect, respectively, the intrinsic and instrumental components of privacy preferences differently, leading to different PPVs for different practices. We conducted online studies focused on consumers in the United States to elicit PPVs for various advertising practices. Our findings confirm the intuition that tracking and targeting consumers under the industry status quo of behavioral targeting leads to high PPV. New technologies or proposals that ensure that data are kept on the consumer's machine lower PPV relative to behavioral targeting but, importantly, this decrease is small. Furthermore, group-level targeting does not differ significantly from individual-level targeting in reducing PPV. Under contextual targeting, where there is no tracking, PPV is significantly reduced. Interestingly, with respect to PPV, consumers are indifferent between seeing untargeted ads and no ads when they are not being tracked. We find that consumer perceptions of privacy violations under different tracking and targeting practices may differ from what technical definitions suggest. Therefore, rather than relying solely on technical perspectives, a consumer-centric approach to privacy is needed, based on, for instance, the dual-privacy framework.</description>

      <title>The Economics of Blockchain Governance: Evaluate Liquid Democracy on the Internet Computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13768v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), utilizing blockchain technology to enable collective governance, are a promising innovation. This research addresses the ongoing query in blockchain governance: How can DAOs optimize human cooperation? Focusing on the Network Nervous System (NNS), a comprehensive on-chain governance framework underpinned by the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) and liquid democracy principles, we employ theoretical abstraction and simulations to evaluate its potential impact on cooperation and economic growth within DAOs. Our findings emphasize the significance of the NNS's staking mechanism, particularly the reward multiplier, in aligning individual short-term interests with the DAO's long-term prosperity. This study contributes to the understanding and effective design of blockchain-based governance systems.</description>
