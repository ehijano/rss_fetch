      <title>Automated Visualization Makeovers with LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Making a good graphic that accurately and efficiently conveys the desired message to the audience is both an art and a science, typically not taught in the data science curriculum. Visualisation makeovers are exercises where the community exchange feedback to improve charts and data visualizations. Can multi-modal large language models (LLMs) emulate this task? Given a plot in the form of an image file, or the code used to generate it, an LLM, primed with a list of visualization best practices, is employed to semi-automatically generate constructive criticism to produce a better plot. Our system is centred around prompt engineering of a pre-trained model, relying on a combination of userspecified guidelines and any latent knowledge of data visualization practices that might lie within an LLMs training corpus. Unlike other works, the focus is not on generating valid visualization scripts from raw data or prompts, but on educating the user how to improve their existing data visualizations according to an interpretation of best practices. A quantitative evaluation is performed to measure the sensitivity of the LLM agent to various plotting issues across different chart types. We make the tool available as a simple self-hosted applet with an accessible Web interface.</description>

      <title>A Humanoid Social Robot as a Teaching Assistant in the Classroom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although innovation and the support of new technologies are much needed to ease the burden on the education system, social robots in schools to help teachers with educational tasks are rare. Child-Robot Interaction (CRI) could support teachers and add an embodied social component to modern multi-modal and multi-sensory learning environments already in use. The social robot Pepper, connected to the Large Language Model (LLM) ChatGPT, was used in a high school classroom to teach new learning content to groups of students. I tested the technical possibilities with the robot on site and asked the students about their acceptance and perceived usefulness of teaching with the help of a social robot. All participants felt that the robot's presentation of the learning material was appropriate or at least partially appropriate and that its use made sense.</description>

      <title>Modeling Interactive Narrative Systems: A Formal Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interactive Narrative Systems (INS) have revolutionized digital experiences by empowering users to actively shape their stories, diverging from traditional passive storytelling. However, the field faces challenges due to fragmented research efforts and diverse system representations. This paper introduces a formal representation framework for INS, inspired by diverse approaches from the state of the art. By providing a consistent vocabulary and modeling structure, the framework facilitates the analysis, the description and comparison of INS properties. Experimental validations on the "Little Red Riding Hood" scenario highlight the usefulness of the proposed formalism and its impact on improving the evaluation of INS. This work aims to foster collaboration and coherence within the INS research community by proposing a methodology for formally representing these systems.</description>

      <title>Do Ethical AI Principles Matter to Users? A Large-Scale Analysis of User Sentiment and Satisfaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As AI systems become increasingly embedded in organizational workflows and consumer applications, ethical principles such as fairness, transparency, and robustness have been widely endorsed in policy and industry guidelines. However, there is still scarce empirical evidence on whether these principles are recognized, valued, or impactful from the perspective of users. This study investigates the link between ethical AI and user satisfaction by analyzing over 100,000 user reviews of AI products from G2. Using transformer-based language models, we measure sentiment across seven ethical dimensions defined by the EU Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI. Our findings show that all seven dimensions are positively associated with user satisfaction. Yet, this relationship varies systematically across user and product types. Technical users and reviewers of AI development platforms more frequently discuss system-level concerns (e.g., transparency, data governance), while non-technical users and reviewers of end-user applications emphasize human-centric dimensions (e.g., human agency, societal well-being). Moreover, the association between ethical AI and user satisfaction is significantly stronger for non-technical users and end-user applications across all dimensions. Our results highlight the importance of ethical AI design from users' perspectives and underscore the need to account for contextual differences across user roles and product types.</description>

      <title>REFS: Robust EEG feature selection with missing multi-dimensional annotation for emotion recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The affective brain-computer interface is a crucial technology for affective interaction and emotional intelligence, emerging as a significant area of research in the human-computer interaction. Compared to single-type features, multi-type EEG features provide a multi-level representation for analyzing multi-dimensional emotions. However, the high dimensionality of multi-type EEG features, combined with the relatively small number of high-quality EEG samples, poses challenges such as classifier overfitting and suboptimal real-time performance in multi-dimensional emotion recognition. Moreover, practical applications of affective brain-computer interface frequently encounters partial absence of multi-dimensional emotional labels due to the open nature of the acquisition environment, and ambiguity and variability in individual emotion perception. To address these challenges, this study proposes a novel EEG feature selection method for missing multi-dimensional emotion recognition. The method leverages adaptive orthogonal non-negative matrix factorization to reconstruct the multi-dimensional emotional label space through second-order and higher-order correlations, which could reduce the negative impact of missing values and outliers on label reconstruction. Simultaneously, it employs least squares regression with graph-based manifold learning regularization and global feature redundancy minimization regularization to enable EEG feature subset selection despite missing information, ultimately achieving robust EEG-based multi-dimensional emotion recognition. Simulation experiments on three widely used multi-dimensional emotional datasets, DREAMER, DEAP and HDED, reveal that the proposed method outperforms thirteen advanced feature selection methods in terms of robustness for EEG emotional feature selection.</description>

      <title>ASLSL: Adaptive shared latent structure learning with incomplete multi-modal physiological data for multi-dimensional emotional feature selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, multi-modal physiological signals based emotion recognition has garnered increasing attention in the field of brain-computer interfaces. Nevertheness, the associated multi-modal physiological features are often high-dimensional and inevitably include irrelevant, redundant, and noisy representation, which can easily lead to overfitting, poor performance, and high computational complexity in emotion classifiers. Feature selection has been widely applied to address these challenges. However, previous studies generally assumed that multi-modal physiological data are complete, whereas in reality, the data are often incomplete due to the openness of the acquisition and operational environment. For example, a part of samples are available in several modalities but not in others. To address this issue, we propose a novel method for incomplete multi-modal physiological signal feature selection called adaptive shared latent structure learning (ASLSL). Based on the property that similar features share similar emotional labels, ASLSL employs adaptive shared latent structure learning to explore a common latent space shared for incomplete multi-modal physiological signals and multi-dimensional emotional labels, thereby mitigating the impact of missing information and mining consensus information. Two most popular multi-modal physiological emotion datasets (DEAP and DREAMER) with multi-dimensional emotional labels were utilized to compare the performance between compare ASLSL and seventeen feature selection methods. Comprehensive experimental results on these datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of ASLSL.</description>

      <title>It's a Complete Haystack: Understanding Dependency Management Needs in Computer-Aided Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In today's landscape, hardware development teams face increasing demands for better quality products, greater innovation, and shorter manufacturing lead times. Despite the need for more efficient and effective processes, hardware designers continue to struggle with a lack of awareness of design changes and other collaborators' actions, a persistent issue in decades of CSCW research. One significant and unaddressed challenge is understanding and managing dependencies between 3D CAD (computer-aided design) models, especially when products can contain thousands of interconnected components. In this two-phase formative study, we explore designers' pain points of CAD dependency management through a thematic analysis of 100 online forum discussions and semi-structured interviews with 10 designers. We identify nine key challenges related to the traceability, navigation, and consistency of CAD dependencies, that harm the effective coordination of hardware development teams. To address these challenges, we propose design goals and necessary features to enhance hardware designers' awareness and management of dependencies, ultimately with the goal of improving collaborative workflows.</description>

      <title>Hand by Hand: LLM Driving EMS Assistant for Operational Skill Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Operational skill learning, inherently physical and reliant on hands-on practice and kinesthetic feedback, has yet to be effectively replicated in large language model (LLM)-supported training. Current LLM training assistants primarily generate customized textual feedback, neglecting the crucial kinesthetic modality. This gap derives from the textual and uncertain nature of LLMs, compounded by concerns on user acceptance of LLM driven body control. To bridge this gap and realize the potential of collaborative human-LLM action, this work explores human experience of LLM driven kinesthetic assistance. Specifically, we introduced an "Align-Analyze-Adjust" strategy and developed FlightAxis, a tool that integrates LLM with Electrical Muscle Stimulation (EMS) for flight skill acquisition, a representative operational skill domain. FlightAxis learns flight skills from manuals and guides forearm movements during simulated flight tasks. Our results demonstrate high user acceptance of LLM-mediated body control and significantly reduced task completion times. Crucially, trainees reported that this kinesthetic assistance enhanced their awareness of operation flaws and fostered increased engagement in the training process, rather than relieving perceived load. This work demonstrated the potential of kinesthetic LLM training in operational skill acquisition.</description>

      <title>RAGTrace: Understanding and Refining Retrieval-Generation Dynamics in Retrieval-Augmented Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems have emerged as a promising solution to enhance large language models (LLMs) by integrating external knowledge retrieval with generative capabilities. While significant advancements have been made in improving retrieval accuracy and response quality, a critical challenge remains that the internal knowledge integration and retrieval-generation interactions in RAG workflows are largely opaque. This paper introduces RAGTrace, an interactive evaluation system designed to analyze retrieval and generation dynamics in RAG-based workflows. Informed by a comprehensive literature review and expert interviews, the system supports a multi-level analysis approach, ranging from high-level performance evaluation to fine-grained examination of retrieval relevance, generation fidelity, and cross-component interactions. Unlike conventional evaluation practices that focus on isolated retrieval or generation quality assessments, RAGTrace enables an integrated exploration of retrieval-generation relationships, allowing users to trace knowledge sources and identify potential failure cases. The system's workflow allows users to build, evaluate, and iterate on retrieval processes tailored to their specific domains of interest. The effectiveness of the system is demonstrated through case studies and expert evaluations on real-world RAG applications.</description>

      <title>ThematicPlane: Bridging Tacit User Intent and Latent Spaces for Image Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative AI has made image creation more accessible, yet aligning outputs with nuanced creative intent remains challenging, particularly for non-experts. Existing tools often require users to externalize ideas through prompts or references, limiting fluid exploration. We introduce ThematicPlane, a system that enables users to navigate and manipulate high-level semantic concepts (e.g., mood, style, or narrative tone) within an interactive thematic design plane. This interface bridges the gap between tacit creative intent and system control. In our exploratory study (N=6), participants engaged in divergent and convergent creative modes, often embracing unexpected results as inspiration or iteration cues. While they grounded their exploration in familiar themes, differing expectations of how themes mapped to outputs revealed a need for more explainable controls. Overall, ThematicPlane fosters expressive, iterative workflows and highlights new directions for intuitive, semantics-driven interaction in generative design tools.</description>

      <title>A Multimodal Framework for Understanding Collaborative Design Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An essential task in analyzing collaborative design processes, such as those that are part of workshops in design studies, is identifying design outcomes and understanding how the collaboration between participants formed the results and led to decision-making. However, findings are typically restricted to a consolidated textual form based on notes from interviews or observations. A challenge arises from integrating different sources of observations, leading to large amounts and heterogeneity of collected data. To address this challenge we propose a practical, modular, and adaptable framework of workshop setup, multimodal data acquisition, AI-based artifact extraction, and visual analysis. Our interactive visual analysis system, reCAPit, allows the flexible combination of different modalities, including video, audio, notes, or gaze, to analyze and communicate important workshop findings. A multimodal streamgraph displays activity and attention in the working area, temporally aligned topic cards summarize participants' discussions, and drill-down techniques allow inspecting raw data of included sources. As part of our research, we conducted six workshops across different themes ranging from social science research on urban planning to a design study on band-practice visualization. The latter two are examined in detail and described as case studies. Further, we present considerations for planning workshops and challenges that we derive from our own experience and the interviews we conducted with workshop experts. Our research extends existing methodology of collaborative design workshops by promoting data-rich acquisition of multimodal observations, combined AI-based extraction and interactive visual analysis, and transparent dissemination of results.</description>

      <title>Automatic Semantic Alignment of Flow Pattern Representations for Exploration with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Explorative flow visualization allows domain experts to analyze complex flow structures by interactively investigating flow patterns. However, traditional visual interfaces often rely on specialized graphical representations and interactions, which require additional effort to learn and use. Natural language interaction offers a more intuitive alternative, but teaching machines to recognize diverse scientific concepts and extract corresponding structures from flow data poses a significant challenge. In this paper, we introduce an automated framework that aligns flow pattern representations with the semantic space of large language models (LLMs), eliminating the need for manual labeling. Our approach encodes streamline segments using a denoising autoencoder and maps the generated flow pattern representations to LLM embeddings via a projector layer. This alignment empowers semantic matching between textual embeddings and flow representations through an attention mechanism, enabling the extraction of corresponding flow patterns based on textual descriptions. To enhance accessibility, we develop an interactive interface that allows users to query and visualize flow structures using natural language. Through case studies, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in enabling intuitive and intelligent flow exploration.</description>

      <title>Emoji Reactions on Telegram Often Reflect Social Approval Over Emotional Resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emoji reactions are a frequently used feature of messaging platforms. Prior work mainly interpreted emojis as indicators of emotional resonance or user sentiment. However, emoji reactions may instead reflect broader social dynamics. Here, we investigate the communicative function of emoji reactions on Telegram by analyzing the relationship between the emotional and rhetorical content of messages and the emoji reactions they receive. We collect and analyze over 650k Telegram messages that received at least one emoji reaction. We annotate each message with sentiment, emotion, persuasion strategy, and speech act labels, and infer the sentiment and emotion of emoji reactions using both lexicons and large languages. We find a systematic mismatch between message sentiment and reaction sentiment, with positive reactions dominating even when the message is neutral or negative. We show that this pattern remains consistent across rhetorical strategies and emotional tones, suggesting that emoji reactions may signal a degree of social approval rather than reflecting emotional resonance. Finally, we shed light on the communicative strategies that predict greater emoji engagement. These findings have methodological implications for sentiment analysis, as interpreting emoji reactions as direct proxies for emotional response may be misleading.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article explores the possibilities of reusing obsolete smartphones and tablets to build new interactive systems. Taking the case of a musical instrument, I present my research into the design of a controller made from various of these obsolete smartphones. From the diagnostic stage to the creation of a new autonomous electronic object, I document the process, the barriers and the levers encountered. Based on these explorations and discussions with two professional musicians, I provide several insights into the software and hardware aspects, with a view to continuing this work, towards the creation of an open-source toolkit enabling anyone to build new interactive systems with old devices. I discuss the implication of how a high-level web-based approach could allow designers to enter the black box and foster permacomputing using smartphones.</description>

Abstract: Non-technical end-users increasingly rely on AI code generation to perform technical tasks like data analysis. However, large language models (LLMs) remain unreliable, and it is unclear whether end-users can effectively identify model errors $\unicode{x2014}$ especially in realistic and domain-specific scenarios. We surveyed marketing and sales professionals to assess their ability to critically evaluate LLM-generated analyses of marketing data. Participants were shown natural language explanations of the AI's code, repeatedly informed the AI often makes mistakes, and explicitly prompted to identify them. Yet, participants frequently failed to detect critical flaws that could compromise decision-making, many of which required no technical knowledge to recognize. To investigate why, we reformatted AI responses into clearly delineated steps and provided alternative approaches for each decision to support critical evaluation. While these changes had a positive effect, participants often struggled to reason through the AI's steps and alternatives. Our findings suggest that business professionals cannot reliably verify AI-generated data analyses on their own and explore reasons why to inform future designs. As non-programmers adopt code-generating AI for technical tasks, unreliable AI and insufficient human oversight poses risks of unsafe or low-quality decisions.</description>

      <title>AI-Guided Exploration of Large-Scale Codebases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding large-scale, complex software systems is a major challenge for developers, who spend a significant portion of their time on program comprehension. Traditional tools such as static visualizations and reverse engineering techniques provide structural insights but often lack interactivity, adaptability, and integration with contextual information. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) offer new opportunities to enhance code exploration workflows, yet their lack of grounding and integration with structured views limits their effectiveness. This work introduces a hybrid approach that integrates deterministic reverse engineering with LLM-guided, intent-aware visual exploration. The proposed system combines UML-based visualization, dynamic user interfaces, historical context, and collaborative features into an adaptive tool for code comprehension. By interpreting user queries and interaction patterns, the LLM helps developers navigate and understand complex codebases more effectively. A prototype implementation for Java demonstrates the feasibility of this approach. Future work includes empirical evaluation, scaling to polyglot systems, and exploring GUI-driven LLM interaction models. This research lays the groundwork for intelligent, interactive environments that align with developer cognition and collaborative workflows.</description>

      <title>Towards Transparent Ethical AI: A Roadmap for Trustworthy Robotic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05846v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics increasingly permeate society, ensuring the ethical behavior of these systems has become paramount. This paper contends that transparency in AI decision-making processes is fundamental to developing trustworthy and ethically aligned robotic systems. We explore how transparency facilitates accountability, enables informed consent, and supports the debugging of ethical algorithms. The paper outlines technical, ethical, and practical challenges in implementing transparency and proposes novel approaches to enhance it, including standardized metrics, explainable AI techniques, and user-friendly interfaces. This paper introduces a framework that connects technical implementation with ethical considerations in robotic systems, focusing on the specific challenges of achieving transparency in dynamic, real-world contexts. We analyze how prioritizing transparency can impact public trust, regulatory policies, and avenues for future research. By positioning transparency as a fundamental element in ethical AI system design, we aim to add to the ongoing discussion on responsible AI and robotics, providing direction for future advancements in this vital field.</description>

      <title>Social and Telepresence Robots for Accessibility and Inclusion in Small Museums</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05946v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There are still many museums that present accessibility barriers, particularly regarding perceptual, cultural, and cognitive aspects. This is especially evident in low-density population areas. The aim of the ROBSO-PM project is to improve the accessibility of small museums through the use of social robots and social telepresence robots, focusing on three museums as case studies: the Museum of the Holy Shroud in Turin, a small but globally known institution, and two lesser known mountain museums: the Museum of the Champlas du Col Carnival and the Pragelato Museum of Alpine Peoples' Costumes and Traditions. The project explores two main applications for robots: as guides supporting inclusive visits for foreign or disabled visitors, and as telepresence tools allowing people with limited mobility to access museums remotely. From a research perspective, key topics include storytelling, robot personality, empathy, personalization, and, in the case of telepresence, collaboration between the robot and the person, with clearly defined roles and autonomy.</description>

      <title>Bionic Vision as Neuroadaptive XR: Closed-Loop Perceptual Interfaces for Neurotechnology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Visual neuroprostheses are commonly framed as technologies to restore natural sight to people who are blind. In practice, they create a novel mode of perception shaped by sparse, distorted, and unstable input. They resemble early extended reality (XR) headsets more than natural vision, streaming video from a head-mounted camera to a neural "display" with under 1000 pixels, limited field of view, low refresh rates, and nonlinear spatial mappings. No amount of resolution alone will make this experience natural. This paper proposes a reframing: bionic vision as neuroadaptive XR. Rather than replicating natural sight, the goal is to co-adapt brain and device through a bidirectional interface that responds to neural constraints, behavioral goals, and cognitive state. By comparing traditional XR, current implants, and proposed neuroadaptive systems, it introduces a new design space for inclusive, brain-aware computing. It concludes with research provocations spanning encoding, evaluation, learning, and ethics, and invites the XR community to help shape the future of sensory augmentation.</description>

      <title>Learning by Teaching: Engaging Students as Instructors of Large Language Models in Computer Science Education</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05979v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) are often used as virtual tutors in computer science (CS) education, this approach can foster passive learning and over-reliance. This paper presents a novel pedagogical paradigm that inverts this model: students act as instructors who must teach an LLM to solve problems. To facilitate this, we developed strategies for designing questions with engineered knowledge gaps that only a student can bridge, and we introduce Socrates, a system for deploying this method with minimal overhead. We evaluated our approach in an undergraduate course and found that this active-learning method led to statistically significant improvements in student performance compared to historical cohorts. Our work demonstrates a practical, cost-effective framework for using LLMs to deepen student engagement and mastery.</description>

      <title>Exploring Interactive Simulation of Grass Display Color Characteristic Based on Real-World Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent research has focused on incorporating media into living environments via color-controlled materials and image display. In particular, grass-based displays have drawn attention as landscape-friendly interactive interfaces. To develop the grass display, it is important to obtain the grass color change characteristics that depend on the real environment. However, conventional methods require experiments on actual equipment every time the lighting or viewpoint changes, which is time-consuming and costly. Although research has begun on simulating grass colors, this approach still faces significant issues as it takes many hours for a single measurement. In this paper, we explore an interactive simulation of a grass display color change characteristic based on real-world conditions in a virtual environment. We evaluated our method's accuracy by simulating grass color characteristics across multiple viewpoints and environments, and then compared the results against prior work. The results indicated that our method tended to simulate the grass color characteristics similar to the actual characteristics and showed the potential to do so more quickly and with comparable accuracy to the previous study.</description>

      <title>Pragmatics beyond humans: meaning, communication, and LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper reconceptualizes pragmatics not as a subordinate, third dimension of meaning, but as a dynamic interface through which language operates as a socially embedded tool for action. With the emergence of large language models (LLMs) in communicative contexts, this understanding needs to be further refined and methodologically reconsidered. The first section challenges the traditional semiotic trichotomy, arguing that connectionist LLM architectures destabilize established hierarchies of meaning, and proposes the Human-Machine Communication (HMC) framework as a more suitable alternative. The second section examines the tension between human-centred pragmatic theories and the machine-centred nature of LLMs. While traditional, Gricean-inspired pragmatics continue to dominate, it relies on human-specific assumptions ill-suited to predictive systems like LLMs. Probabilistic pragmatics, particularly the Rational Speech Act framework, offers a more compatible teleology by focusing on optimization rather than truth-evaluation. The third section addresses the issue of substitutionalism in three forms - generalizing, linguistic, and communicative - highlighting the anthropomorphic biases that distort LLM evaluation and obscure the role of human communicative subjects. Finally, the paper introduces the concept of context frustration to describe the paradox of increased contextual input paired with a collapse in contextual understanding, emphasizing how users are compelled to co-construct pragmatic conditions both for the model and themselves. These arguments suggest that pragmatic theory may need to be adjusted or expanded to better account for communication involving generative AI.</description>

      <title>EICAP: Deep Dive in Assessment and Enhancement of Large Language Models in Emotional Intelligence through Multi-Turn Conversations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06196v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Emotional Intelligence (EI) is a critical yet underexplored dimension in the development of human-aligned LLMs. To address this gap, we introduce a unified, psychologically grounded four-layer taxonomy of EI tailored for large language models (LLMs), encompassing emotional tracking, cause inference, appraisal, and emotionally appropriate response generation. Building on this framework, we present EICAP-Bench, a novel MCQ style multi-turn benchmark designed to evaluate EI capabilities in open-source LLMs across diverse linguistic and cultural contexts. We evaluate six LLMs: LLaMA3 (8B), LLaMA3-Instruct, Gemma (9B), Gemma-Instruct, Qwen2.5 (7B), and Qwen2.5-Instruct on EmoCap-Bench, identifying Qwen2.5-Instruct as the strongest baseline. To assess the potential for enhancing EI capabilities, we fine-tune both Qwen2.5-Base and Qwen2.5-Instruct using LoRA adapters on UltraChat (UC), a large-scale, instruction-tuned dialogue dataset, in both English and Arabic. Our statistical analysis reveals that among the five EI layers, only the Appraisal layer shows significant improvement through UC-based fine-tuning. These findings highlight the limitations of existing pretraining and instruction-tuning paradigms in equipping LLMs with deeper emotional reasoning and underscore the need for targeted data and modeling strategies for comprehensive EI alignment.</description>

      <title>EmoAugNet: A Signal-Augmented Hybrid CNN-LSTM Framework for Speech Emotion Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recognizing emotional signals in speech has a significant impact on enhancing the effectiveness of human-computer interaction (HCI). This study introduces EmoAugNet, a hybrid deep learning framework, that incorporates Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layers with one-dimensional Convolutional Neural Networks (1D-CNN) to enable reliable Speech Emotion Recognition (SER). The quality and variety of the features that are taken from speech signals have a significant impact on how well SER systems perform. A comprehensive speech data augmentation strategy was used to combine both traditional methods, such as noise addition, pitch shifting, and time stretching, with a novel combination-based augmentation pipeline to enhance generalization and reduce overfitting. Each audio sample was transformed into a high-dimensional feature vector using root mean square energy (RMSE), Mel-frequency Cepstral Coefficient (MFCC), and zero-crossing rate (ZCR). Our model with ReLU activation has a weighted accuracy of 95.78\% and unweighted accuracy of 92.52\% on the IEMOCAP dataset and, with ELU activation, has a weighted accuracy of 96.75\% and unweighted accuracy of 91.28\%. On the RAVDESS dataset, we get a weighted accuracy of 94.53\% and 94.98\% unweighted accuracy for ReLU activation and 93.72\% weighted accuracy and 94.64\% unweighted accuracy for ELU activation. These results highlight EmoAugNet's effectiveness in improving the robustness and performance of SER systems through integated data augmentation and hybrid modeling.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Partner Design Enables Robust Ad-hoc Teamwork</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06336v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce Unsupervised Partner Design (UPD) - a population-free, multi-agent reinforcement learning framework for robust ad-hoc teamwork that adaptively generates training partners without requiring pretrained partners or manual parameter tuning. UPD constructs diverse partners by stochastically mixing an ego agent's policy with biased random behaviours and scores them using a variance-based learnability metric that prioritises partners near the ego agent's current learning frontier. We show that UPD can be integrated with unsupervised environment design, resulting in the first method enabling fully unsupervised curricula over both level and partner distributions in a cooperative setting. Through extensive evaluations on Overcooked-AI and the Overcooked Generalisation Challenge, we demonstrate that this dynamic partner curriculum is highly effective: UPD consistently outperforms both population-based and population-free baselines as well as ablations. In a user study, we further show that UPD achieves higher returns than all baselines and was perceived as significantly more adaptive, more human-like, a better collaborator, and less frustrating.</description>

      <title>From Explainable to Explanatory Artificial Intelligence: Toward a New Paradigm for Human-Centered Explanations through Generative AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current explainable AI (XAI) approaches prioritize algorithmic transparency and present explanations in abstract, non-adaptive formats that often fail to support meaningful end-user understanding. This paper introduces "Explanatory AI" as a complementary paradigm that leverages generative AI capabilities to serve as explanatory partners for human understanding rather than providers of algorithmic transparency. While XAI reveals algorithmic decision processes for model validation, Explanatory AI addresses contextual reasoning to support human decision-making in sociotechnical contexts. We develop a definition and systematic eight-dimensional conceptual model distinguishing Explanatory AI through narrative communication, adaptive personalization, and progressive disclosure principles. Empirical validation through Rapid Contextual Design methodology with healthcare professionals demonstrates that users consistently prefer context-sensitive, multimodal explanations over technical transparency. Our findings reveal the practical urgency for AI systems designed for human comprehension rather than algorithmic introspection, establishing a comprehensive research agenda for advancing user-centered AI explanation approaches across diverse domains and cultural contexts.</description>

      <title>Improved Dysarthric Speech to Text Conversion via TTS Personalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06391v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a case study on developing a customized speech-to-text system for a Hungarian speaker with severe dysarthria. State-of-the-art automatic speech recognition (ASR) models struggle with zero-shot transcription of dysarthric speech, yielding high error rates. To improve performance with limited real dysarthric data, we fine-tune an ASR model using synthetic speech generated via a personalized text-to-speech (TTS) system. We introduce a method for generating synthetic dysarthric speech with controlled severity by leveraging premorbidity recordings of the given speaker and speaker embedding interpolation, enabling ASR fine-tuning on a continuum of impairments. Fine-tuning on both real and synthetic dysarthric speech reduces the character error rate (CER) from 36-51% (zero-shot) to 7.3%. Our monolingual FastConformer_Hu ASR model significantly outperforms Whisper-turbo when fine-tuned on the same data, and the inclusion of synthetic speech contributes to an 18% relative CER reduction. These results highlight the potential of personalized ASR systems for improving accessibility for individuals with severe speech impairments.</description>

      <title>Can LLM "Self-report"?: Evaluating the Validity of Self-report Scales in Measuring Personality Design in LLM-based Chatbots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00207v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A chatbot's personality design is key to interaction quality. As chatbots evolved from rule-based systems to those powered by large language models (LLMs), evaluating the effectiveness of their personality design has become increasingly complex, particularly due to the open-ended nature of interactions. A recent and widely adopted method for assessing the personality design of LLM-based chatbots is the use of self-report questionnaires. These questionnaires, often borrowed from established human personality inventories, ask the chatbot to rate itself on various personality traits. Can LLM-based chatbots meaningfully "self-report" their personality? We created 500 chatbots with distinct personality designs and evaluated the validity of their self-report personality scores by examining human perceptions formed during interactions with these chatbots. Our findings indicate that the chatbot's answers on human personality scales exhibit weak correlations with both human-perceived personality traits and the overall interaction quality. These findings raise concerns about both the criterion validity and the predictive validity of self-report methods in this context. Further analysis revealed the role of task context and interaction in the chatbot's personality design assessment. We further discuss design implications for creating more contextualized and interactive evaluation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16321v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As immersive technologies enable unique, multimodal interaction methods, developers must also use tailored methods to support user accessibility, distinct from traditional software practices. We interviewed 25 industry extended reality (XR) developers, including freelancers, startups, midsize, and big tech companies about their motivations, techniques, barriers, and attitudes towards incorporating accessibility features in their XR apps. Our study revealed a variety of challenges, including conflicting priorities between application and platform developers regarding accessibility infrastructure; rapid development culture hindering accessible development; and the lack of accessible interaction design considerations at the ideation, design, and early prototyping stages. As a comprehensive set of XR accessibility guidelines has yet to be established, we also compiled and evaluated a set of accessibility guidelines for 3D virtual worlds and addressed their limitations when applied to XR. Finally, we inform the creation of effective support methods for industry developers.</description>

      <title>Examining Algorithmic Curation on Social Media: An Empirical Audit of Reddit's r/popular Feed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20491v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Platforms are increasingly relying on algorithms to curate the content within users' social media feeds. However, the growing prominence of proprietary, algorithmically curated feeds has concealed what factors influence the presentation of content on social media feeds and how that presentation affects user behavior. This lack of transparency can be detrimental to users, from reducing users' agency over their content consumption to the propagation of misinformation and toxic content. To uncover details about how these feeds operate and influence user behavior, we conduct an empirical audit of Reddit's algorithmically curated trending feed called r/popular. Using 10K r/popular posts collected by taking snapshots of the feed over 11 months, we find that recent comments help a post remain on r/popular longer and climb the feed. We also find that posts below rank 80 correspond to a sharp decline in activity compared to posts above. When examining the effects of having a higher proportion of undesired behavior -- i.e., moderator-removed and toxic comments -- we find no significant evidence that it helps posts stay on r/popular for longer. Although posts closer to the top receive more undesired comments, we find this increase to coincide with a broader increase in overall engagement -- rather than indicating a disproportionate effect on undesired activity. The relationships between algorithmic rank and engagement highlight the extent to which algorithms employed by social media platforms essentially determine which content is prioritized and which is not. We conclude by discussing how content creators, consumers, and moderators on social media platforms can benefit from empirical audits aimed at improving transparency in algorithmically curated feeds.</description>

      <title>AI-Assisted Conversational Interviewing: Effects on Data Quality and User Experience</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13908v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Standardized surveys scale efficiently but sacrifice depth, while conversational interviews improve response quality at the cost of scalability and consistency. This study bridges the gap between these methods by introducing a framework for AI-assisted conversational interviewing. To evaluate this framework, we conducted a web survey experiment where 1,800 participants were randomly assigned to AI 'chatbots' which use large language models (LLMs) to dynamically probe respondents for elaboration and interactively code open-ended responses to fixed questions developed by human researchers. We assessed the AI chatbot's performance in terms of coding accuracy, response quality, and respondent experience. Our findings reveal that AI chatbots perform moderately well in live coding even without survey-specific fine-tuning, despite slightly inflated false positive errors due to respondent acquiescence bias. Open-ended responses were more detailed and informative, but this came at a slight cost to respondent experience. Our findings highlight the feasibility of using AI methods such as chatbots enhanced by LLMs to enhance open-ended data collection in web surveys.</description>

      <title>Measurement as Bricolage: Examining How Data Scientists Construct Target Variables for Predictive Modeling Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02819v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Data scientists often formulate predictive modeling tasks involving fuzzy, hard-to-define concepts, such as the "authenticity" of student writing or the "healthcare need" of a patient. Yet the process by which data scientists translate fuzzy concepts into a concrete, proxy target variable remains poorly understood. We interview fifteen data scientists in education (N=8) and healthcare (N=7) to understand how they construct target variables for predictive modeling tasks. Our findings suggest that data scientists construct target variables through a bricolage process, involving iterative negotiation between high-level measurement objectives and low-level practical constraints. Data scientists attempt to satisfy five major criteria for a target variable through bricolage: validity, simplicity, predictability, portability, and resource requirements. To achieve this, data scientists adaptively use problem (re)formulation strategies, such as swapping out one candidate target variable for another when the first fails to meet certain criteria (e.g., predictability), or composing multiple outcomes into a single target variable to capture a more holistic set of modeling objectives. Based on our findings, we present opportunities for future HCI, CSCW, and ML research to better support the art and science of target variable construction.</description>

      <title>Using Tactile Charts to Support Comprehension and Learning of Complex Visualizations for Blind and Low-Vision Individuals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21462v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate whether tactile charts support comprehension and learning of complex visualizations for blind and low-vision (BLV) individuals and contribute four tactile chart designs and an interview study. Visualizations are powerful tools for conveying data, yet BLV individuals typically can rely only on assistive technologies -- primarily alternative texts -- to access this information. Prior research shows the importance of mental models of chart types for interpreting these descriptions, yet BLV individuals have no means to build such a mental model based on images of visualizations. Tactile charts show promise to fill this gap in supporting the process of building mental models. Yet studies on tactile data representations mostly focus on simple chart types, and it is unclear whether they are also appropriate for more complex charts as would be found in scientific publications. Working with two BLV researchers, we designed 3D-printed tactile template charts with exploration instructions for four advanced chart types: UpSet plots, violin plots, clustered heatmaps, and faceted line charts. We then conducted an interview study with 12 BLV participants comparing whether using our tactile templates improves mental models and understanding of charts and whether this understanding translates to novel datasets experienced through alt texts. Thematic analysis shows that tactile models support chart type understanding and are the preferred learning method by BLV individuals. We also report participants' opinions on tactile chart design and their role in BLV education.</description>

      <title>Reframing Pattern: A Comprehensive Approach to a Composite Visual Variable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02639v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new comprehensive theory for explaining, exploring, and using pattern as a visual variable in visualization. Although patterns have long been used for data encoding and continue to be valuable today, their conceptual foundations are precarious: the concepts and terminology used across the research literature and in practice are inconsistent, making it challenging to use patterns effectively and to conduct research to inform their use. To address this problem, we conduct a comprehensive cross-disciplinary literature review that clarifies ambiguities around the use of "pattern" and "texture". As a result, we offer a new consistent treatment of pattern as a composite visual variable composed of structured groups of graphic primitives that can serve as marks for encoding data individually and collectively. This new and widely applicable formulation opens a sizable design space for the visual variable pattern, which we formalize as a new system comprising three sets of variables: the spatial arrangement of primitives, the appearance relationships among primitives, and the retinal visual variables that characterize individual primitives. We show how our pattern system relates to existing visualization theory and highlight opportunities for visualization design. We further explore patterns based on complex spatial arrangements, demonstrating explanatory power and connecting our conceptualization to broader theory on maps and cartography.

      <title>LLM Agent-Based Simulation of Student Activities and Mental Health Using Smartphone Sensing Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02679v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Students' mental well-being is vital for academic success, with activities such as studying, socializing, and sleeping playing a role. Current mobile sensing data highlight this intricate link using statistical and machine learning analyses. We propose a novel LLM agent-based simulation framework to model student activities and mental health using the StudentLife Dataset. Each LLM agent was initialized with personality questionnaires and guided by smartphone sensing data throughout the simulated semester. These agents predict individual behaviors, provide self-reported mental health data via ecological momentary assessments (EMAs), and complete follow-up personality questionnaires. To ensure accuracy, we investigated various prompting techniques, memory systems, and activity-based mental state management strategies that dynamically update an agent's mental state based on their daily activities. This simulation goes beyond simply replicating existing data. This allows us to explore new scenarios that are not present in the original dataset, such as peer influence through agent-to-agent interactions and the impact of social media. Furthermore, we can conduct intervention studies by manipulating activity patterns via sensing signals and personality traits using questionnaire responses. This provides valuable insights into the behavioral changes that could enhance student well-being. The framework also facilitates hypothetical interviews with LLM agents, offering deeper insights into their mental health. This study showcases the power of LLM-driven behavioral modeling with sensing data, opening new avenues for understanding and supporting student mental health.</description>

      <title>MagicGUI: A Foundational Mobile GUI Agent with Scalable Data Pipeline and Reinforcement Fine-tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03700v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents MagicGUI, a foundational mobile GUI agent designed to address critical challenges in perception, grounding, and reasoning within real-world mobile GUI environments. The framework is underpinned by following six key components: (1) a comprehensive and accurate dataset, constructed via the scalable GUI Data Pipeline, which aggregates the largest and most diverse GUI-centric multimodal data to date from open-source repositories, automated crawling, and targeted manual annotation; (2) enhanced perception and grounding capabilities, facilitating fine-grained multimodal alignment for UI element referencing, grounding, and screen comprehension; (3) a comprehensive and unified action space, encompassing both fundamental UI operations and complex interactive intents to support human-agent interactions; (4) planning-oriented reasoning mechanisms that enable the model to decompose complex user instructions into sequential actions with explicit intermediate meta-paln reasoning; (5) an iterative two-stage training procedure, combining large-scale continue pre-training on 7.8M samples with reinforcement fine-tuning utilizing a spatially enhanced composite reward and dual filtering strategy; and (6) competitive performance on both the proprietary Magic-RICH benchmark and over a dozen public benchmarks, achieving superior performance across GUI perception and agent tasks, while demonstrating robust generalization and real-world deployment potential in practical mobile GUI scenarios, as detailed in Figure 1.</description>

      <title>Measuring Information Richness in Product Images: Implications for Online Sales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04541v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A common challenge for e-commerce sellers is to decide what product images to display on online shopping sites. In this paper, we propose and validate a novel metric, k-value, to quantify the information richness of an image set, and we further investigate its effect on consumers' purchase decisions. We leverage patch-level embeddings from Vision Transformers (ViT) and apply k-means clustering to identify distinct visual features, defining k-value as the number of clusters. An online experiment demonstrates that k-value aligns with human-perceived information richness, validating the metric. A simulated online shopping experiment further reveals a significant yet counterintuitive result: while an image set with a higher k-value (richer information) shortens decision time, it paradoxically reduces purchase propensity. Our findings illuminate the complex relationship between visual information richness and consumer behavior, providing sellers a quantifiable tool for image selection.</description>

      <title>Learning AI Auditing: A Case Study of Teenagers Auditing a Generative AI Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04902v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates how high school-aged youth engage in algorithm auditing to identify and understand biases in artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) tools they encounter daily. With AI/ML technologies being increasingly integrated into young people's lives, there is an urgent need to equip teenagers with AI literacies that build both technical knowledge and awareness of social impacts. Algorithm audits (also called AI audits) have traditionally been employed by experts to assess potential harmful biases, but recent research suggests that non-expert users can also participate productively in auditing. We conducted a two-week participatory design workshop with 14 teenagers (ages 14-15), where they audited the generative AI model behind TikTok's Effect House, a tool for creating interactive TikTok filters. We present a case study describing how teenagers approached the audit, from deciding what to audit to analyzing data using diverse strategies and communicating their results. Our findings show that participants were engaged and creative throughout the activities, independently raising and exploring new considerations, such as age-related biases, that are uncommon in professional audits. We drew on our expertise in algorithm auditing to triangulate their findings as a way to examine if the workshop supported participants to reach coherent conclusions in their audit. Although the resulting number of changes in race, gender, and age representation uncovered by the teens were slightly different from ours, we reached similar conclusions. This study highlights the potential for auditing to inspire learning activities to foster AI literacies, empower teenagers to critically examine AI systems, and contribute fresh perspectives to the study of algorithmic harms.</description>

      <title>The Alternative Annotator Test for LLM-as-a-Judge: How to Statistically Justify Replacing Human Annotators with LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10970v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The "LLM-as-an-annotator" and "LLM-as-a-judge" paradigms employ Large Language Models (LLMs) as annotators, judges, and evaluators in tasks traditionally performed by humans. LLM annotations are widely used, not only in NLP research but also in fields like medicine, psychology, and social science. Despite their role in shaping study results and insights, there is no standard or rigorous procedure to determine whether LLMs can replace human annotators. In this paper, we propose a novel statistical procedure, the Alternative Annotator Test (alt-test), that requires only a modest subset of annotated examples to justify using LLM annotations. Additionally, we introduce a versatile and interpretable measure for comparing LLM annotators and judges. To demonstrate our procedure, we curated a diverse collection of ten datasets, consisting of language and vision-language tasks, and conducted experiments with six LLMs and four prompting techniques. Our results show that LLMs can sometimes replace humans with closed-source LLMs (such as GPT-4o), outperforming the open-source LLMs we examine, and that prompting techniques yield judges of varying quality. We hope this study encourages more rigorous and reliable practices.</description>

      <title>From Autonomy to Agency: Agentic Vehicles for Human-Centered Mobility Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04996v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Autonomy, from the Greek autos (self) and nomos (law), refers to the capacity to operate according to internal rules without external control. Accordingly, autonomous vehicles (AuVs) are defined as systems capable of perceiving their environment and executing preprogrammed tasks independently of external input. However, both research and real-world deployments increasingly showcase vehicles that demonstrate behaviors beyond this definition (including the SAE levels 1 to 6), such as interaction with humans and machines, goal adaptation, contextual reasoning, external tool use, and long-term planning, particularly with the integration of large language models (LLMs) and agentic AI systems. These developments reveal a conceptual gap between technical autonomy and the broader cognitive and social capabilities needed for future human-centered mobility systems. To address this, we introduce the concept of agentic vehicles (AgVs), referring to vehicles that integrate agentic AI to reason, adapt, and interact within complex environments. This paper presents a systems-level framework to characterize AgVs, focusing on their cognitive and communicative layers and differentiating them from conventional AuVs. It synthesizes relevant advances in agentic AI, robotics, multi-agent systems, and human-machine interaction, and highlights how agentic AI, through high-level reasoning and tool use, can function not merely as computational tools but as interactive agents embedded in mobility ecosystems. The paper concludes by identifying key challenges in the development and governance of AgVs, including safety, real-time control, public acceptance, ethical alignment, and regulatory frameworks.</description>

      <title>Humans overrely on overconfident language models, across languages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06306v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are deployed globally, it is crucial that their responses are calibrated across languages to accurately convey uncertainty and limitations. Prior work shows that LLMs are linguistically overconfident in English, leading users to overrely on confident generations. However, the usage and interpretation of epistemic markers (e.g., 'I think it's') differs sharply across languages. Here, we study the risks of multilingual linguistic (mis)calibration, overconfidence, and overreliance across five languages to evaluate LLM safety in a global context. Our work finds that overreliance risks are high across languages. We first analyze the distribution of LLM-generated epistemic markers and observe that LLMs are overconfident across languages, frequently generating strengtheners even as part of incorrect responses. Model generations are, however, sensitive to documented cross-linguistic variation in usage: for example, models generate the most markers of uncertainty in Japanese and the most markers of certainty in German and Mandarin. Next, we measure human reliance rates across languages, finding that reliance behaviors differ cross-linguistically: for example, participants are significantly more likely to discount expressions of uncertainty in Japanese than in English (i.e., ignore their 'hedging' function and rely on generations that contain them). Taken together, these results indicate a high risk of reliance on overconfident model generations across languages. Our findings highlight the challenges of multilingual linguistic calibration and stress the importance of culturally and linguistically contextualized model safety evaluations.</description>
