      <title>Integrating Protein Sequence and Expression Level to Analysis Molecular Characterization of Breast Cancer Subtypes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Breast cancer's complexity and variability pose significant challenges in understanding its progression and guiding effective treatment. This study aims to integrate protein sequence data with expression levels to improve the molecular characterization of breast cancer subtypes and predict clinical outcomes. Using ProtGPT2, a language model designed for protein sequences, we generated embeddings that capture the functional and structural properties of proteins sequence. These embeddings were integrated with protein expression level to form enriched biological representations, which were analyzed using machine learning methods like ensemble K-means for clustering and XGBoost for classification. Our approach enabled successful clustering of patients into biologically distinct groups and accurately predicted clinical outcomes such as survival and biomarkers status, achieving high performance metrics, notably an F1 score of 0.88 for survival and 0.87 for biomarkers status prediction. Analysis of feature importance highlighted key proteins like KMT2C, GCN1, and CLASP2, linked to hormone receptor and Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 (HER2) expression, which play a role in tumor progression and patient outcomes, respectively. Furthermore, protein-protein interaction networks and correlation analyses revealed the interdependence of proteins that may influence breast cancer subtype behaviors. These findings suggest that integrating protein sequence and expression data provides valuable insights into tumor biology and has significant potential to enhance personalized treatment strategies in breast cancer care.</description>

      <title>Towards deep learning sequence-structure co-generation for protein design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep generative models that learn from the distribution of natural protein sequences and structures may enable the design of new proteins with valuable functions. While the majority of today's models focus on generating either sequences or structures, emerging co-generation methods promise more accurate and controllable protein design, ideally achieved by modeling both modalities simultaneously. Here we review recent advances in deep generative models for protein design, with a particular focus on sequence-structure co-generation methods. We describe the key methodological and evaluation principles underlying these methods, highlight recent advances from the literature, and discuss opportunities for continued development of sequence-structure co-generation approaches.</description>

      <title>Optimistic Games for Combinatorial Bayesian Optimization with Application to Protein Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bayesian optimization (BO) is a powerful framework to optimize black-box expensive-to-evaluate functions via sequential interactions. In several important problems (e.g. drug discovery, circuit design, neural architecture search, etc.), though, such functions are defined over large $\textit{combinatorial and unstructured}$ spaces. This makes existing BO algorithms not feasible due to the intractable maximization of the acquisition function over these domains. To address this issue, we propose $\textbf{GameOpt}$, a novel game-theoretical approach to combinatorial BO. $\textbf{GameOpt}$ establishes a cooperative game between the different optimization variables, and selects points that are game $\textit{equilibria}$ of an upper confidence bound acquisition function. These are stable configurations from which no variable has an incentive to deviate$-$ analog to local optima in continuous domains. Crucially, this allows us to efficiently break down the complexity of the combinatorial domain into individual decision sets, making $\textbf{GameOpt}$ scalable to large combinatorial spaces. We demonstrate the application of $\textbf{GameOpt}$ to the challenging $\textit{protein design}$ problem and validate its performance on four real-world protein datasets. Each protein can take up to $20^{X}$ possible configurations, where $X$ is the length of a protein, making standard BO methods infeasible. Instead, our approach iteratively selects informative protein configurations and very quickly discovers highly active protein variants compared to other baselines.</description>

      <title>Constant pH Simulation with FMM Electrostatics in GROMACS. (A) Design and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The structural dynamics of biological macromolecules, such as proteins, DNA/RNA, or complexes thereof, are strongly influenced by protonation changes of their typically many titratable groups, which explains their sensitivity to pH changes. Conversely, conformational and environmental changes of the biomolecule affect the protonation state of these groups. With few exceptions, conventional force field-based molecular dynamics (MD) simulations do not account for these effects, nor do they allow for coupling to a pH buffer.
  Here we present a GROMACS implementation of a rigorous Hamiltonian interpolation $\lambda$-dynamics constant pH method, which rests on GPU-accelerated Fast Multipole Method (FMM) electrostatics. Our implementation supports both CHARMM36m and Amber99sb*-ILDN force fields and is largely automated to enable seamless switching from regular MD to constant pH MD, involving minimal changes to the input files. Here, the first of two companion papers describes the underlying constant pH protocol and sample applications to several prototypical benchmark systems such as cardiotoxin V, lysozyme, and staphylococcal nuclease. Enhanced convergence is achieved through a new dynamic barrier height optimization method, and high p$K_a$ accuracy is demonstrated. We use Functional Mode Analysis and Mutual Information to explore the complex intra- and intermolecular couplings between the protonation states of titratable groups as well as those between protonation states and conformational dynamics. We identify striking conformation-dependent p$K_a$ variations and unexpected inter-residue couplings. Conformation-protonation coupling is identified as a primary cause of the slow protonation convergence notorious to constant pH simulations involving multiple titratable groups, suggesting enhanced sampling methods to accelerate convergence.</description>
