      <title>Space-Time Graded-Index Interfaces and Related Chirping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Space-time modulated systems have recently emerged as a powerful platform for dynamic electromagnetic processing in both space and time. Most of the related research so far has assumed abrupt parameter profiles. This paper extends the field to generalized graded-index (GRIN) interfaces, which are both more practical than ideal profiles and offer new avenues for wave manipulations. It presents an exact solution for wave propagation across arbitrary space-time modulated GRIN interfaces and describes versatile chirping effects. The solution is based on a generalization of the impulse response method from linear time-invariant to linear space-time-varying systems. The proposed framework shows that space-time GRIN systems represent a novel approach for generating a new form of chirping that is not inherently based on dispersion, with promising applications in pulse shaping and signal processing.</description>

      <title>Monolithic 3D integration of tantalum pentoxide photonics on arbitrary substrates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The photonics landscape encompasses a wide scope of material platforms, each optimized for specific functionalities, yet no platform meets the demands of all current and evolving photonic applications. While combining integrated photonics materials enhances overall capability - such as unifying nonlinear optics, low-loss passive devices, and electro-optics - material and process compatibility remains a major challenge. We introduce full-wafer, monolithic 3D integration of tantalum pentoxide (Ta$_2$O$_5$, hereafter tantala) photonics onto arbitrary substrates, which we explore here with thin-film lithium niobate (LN) on silicon. Tantala's unique properties, importantly room-temperature deposition, low-temperature annealing, and low stress in thick films optimized for phase matching, make it well suited for monolithic 3D integration without compromising substrate performance or compatibility. We demonstrate low-loss, high-quality-factor microresonators and nanophotonics in tantala, robust quasi-phase-matching in poled LN waveguides, and efficient 3D interlayer routing. This enables us to demonstrate a rich palette of nonlinear frequency conversion processes, including $\chi^{(3)}$ optical parametric oscillation (OPO) and soliton microcomb generation in tantala microresonators and photonic-crystal resonators, $\chi^{(2)}$ second-harmonic generation (SHG) in periodically poled LN, and combinations thereof. Monolithic 3D integration with tantala opens a new paradigm for scalable, multifunctional photonic systems, enabling visible, near-IR, and nonlinear operation into existing photonic infrastructure.</description>

      <title>Continuous scanning full-field OCT for fast volumetric imaging of multi-cellular aggregates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Full-field optical coherence tomography (FF-OCT) offers label-free, high-resolution imaging of biological samples but remains limited by slow acquisition due to piezoelectric mirror modulation. We present a continuous-scanning FF-OCT method that eliminates piezoelectric displacement and synchronization by continuously translating the sample with a motorized stage while recording images on the fly. Depth-resolved information is retrieved via Fourier analysis of the temporal signal at each pixel. This approach enables volumetric imaging over several hundred micrometers within tens of seconds and provides a higher contrast-to-noise ratio than traditional four-phase FF-OCT. Continuous-scanning FF-OCT thus represents a simpler and faster alternative for 3D bio-imaging of living tissues and organoids.</description>

      <title>Agile and Broadband All-Optical Wavelength Conversion with Multi-Wavelength Lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate a novel approach to all-optical wavelength conversion (AOWC) using a monolithically integrated InP multi-wavelength laser (MWL). By exploiting carrier-induced gain modulation and intermodal coupling within the common gain section, we achieve data wavelength conversion over a 1.3 THz range for signals up to 10 GBd, without the need for an external probe laser. The scheme relies on optical injection of the data signal into the MWL, where strong mode coupling enables transfer of the modulation to other longitudinal modes. A monolithically integrated feedback cavity provides agile switching between three longitudinal modes or even broadcasting across the three channels by adjusting the feedback phase. We evaluate the signal quality of the converted data through BER measurements for various symbol rates, showing both transparent conversion and, at low injection powers, even net signal gain. Complementary numerical simulations, based on a multimode extension of the Lang-Kobayashi rate equations, reveal the role of modal gain imbalance and cross-saturation in shaping the conversion efficiency. These results establish a scalable, compact, and energy-efficient route toward agile AOWC devices.</description>

      <title>Comparing Machine Learning and Physics-Based Nanoparticle Geometry Determinations Using Far-Field Spectral Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anisotropic metal nanostructures exhibit polarization-dependent light scattering. This property has been widely exploited to determine geometries of subwavelength structures using far-field microscopy. Here, we explore the use of variational autoencoders (VAEs) to determine the geometries of gold nanorods (NRs) such as in-plane orientation and aspect ratio under linearly polarized dark-field illumination in an optical microscope. We input polarized dark-field scattering spectra and electron microscopy images into a dual-branch multimodal VAE with a single shared latent space trained on paired spectra-image data, using a learnable linear adapter. We achieve prediction of Au NRs using only polarized dark-field scattering spectra input. We determine geometrical parameters of orientational angle and aspect ratio quantitatively via both dual-VAE and physics-based analysis. We show that orientational angle prediction by dual-VAE performs well with only a small (300 particle) training set, yielding a mean absolute error (MAE) of 14.4 and a concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) of 0.95. This performance is only marginally worse than the physics-based cos(2theta) fitting approach between the scattering intensity and the polarizing angle, which achieves MAE of 8.78 and CCC of 0.99. Aspect ratio determination is also similar for the dual-VAE and physics-based fitting comparison (MAE of 0.21 vs. 0.23 and CCC of 0.53 vs. 0.68). By learning a shared latent manifold linking spectra and morphology, the model can generate NR images with accurate orientation and aspect ratio with spectra-only input in the small-data regime (300 particles), suggesting a general recipe for inverse nano-optical problems requiring both structure and orientation information.</description>

      <title>How Does Incubation Affect Laser Material Processing?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the last decades, the subject of laser-induced damage (LID) moved from a topic of scientific interest toward laser material processing for technical applications. When using pulsed lasers, the cumulative effect known as incubation is one of the most fundamental features of the processing event. Incubation manifests by the fact that the critical fluence for LID (known as laser-induced damage threshold, LIDT) depends on the number of pulses N exciting one spot on the sample. In most cases, the threshold fluence decreases with N starting from the single-shot ablation threshold and remains constant for large N. No ablation or damage occurs for any N, if the fluence is kept below the multiple-pulse threshold. In contrast, examples where the LIDT increases with N have been reported. The latter effect is known as laser conditioning and is advantageously used when ramping up the power of high-power laser systems. Incubation has been described for many types of solids; the motivation for these comprehensive efforts is twofold. Firstly, one tries to prevent the damage of optical materials in the beam path of high-energy or high-peak-power lasers. Secondly, one deliberately uses this damage for the sculpting of components. In this chapter, we introduce the reader to the mechanisms of incubation. We are going to look at the parameters controlling LID and highlight the peculiarity of the parameter "number of pulses". We will give an overview of the experimental work done in a variety of materials. There are several physical and chemical mechanisms proposed that govern incubation, and there are several mathematical models to describe the behavior of threshold fluence and ablation rate in dependence on the number of pulses. In a few cases, the two classes of mechanisms are even related to each other. Eventually, we will show the implications that incubation has on real-world laser machining.</description>

      <title>Mathematics of effective $q$-plate in polarization optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $q$-plate is a spatially inhomogeneous SU(2) birefringent optical element that has garnered significant interest due to its ability to mediate the spin-orbit interaction of light and facilitate the generation of optical vortices. The $q$-plate features a spatially varying fast axis orientation defined by two parameters: the topological charge $q$ and the offset angle $\alpha_0$. The notion of an effective waveplate arises when multiple waveplates, whether homogeneous or inhomogeneous, are aligned coaxially such that, under specific constraints, the composite system emulates the behavior of a single effective waveplate. This work presents a comprehensive mathematical formalism for realizing an effective waveplate through a cascaded configuration of three $q$-plates, each chosen as either a quarter-wave $q$-plate, a half-wave $q$-plate, or a combination thereof. This yields a total of eight distinct configurations. Some configurations result in an effective waveplate exhibiting a constant retardance, whereas others allow continuous modulation of the effective retardance over the full range from $0$ to $2\pi$ through the systematic variation of the relative offset angles between the constituent $q$-plates. This feature enables holonomic polarization transformations on the higher-order Poincar\'e sphere, making the concept of the effective waveplate applicable to topological index spaces. Moreover, tunable effective retardance holds significant potential for applications involving structured light corresponding to the higher-order Poincar\'{e} sphere, particularly in scenarios demanding controlled spatial modulation of polarization states or dynamic tailoring of polarization topologies.</description>

      <title>Color-Blind Image Sensors: Towards Digital Twin of Human Retina</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The human retina contains a complex arrangement of photoreceptors that convert light into visual information. Conventional image sensors mimic the trichromacy of the retina using periodic filter mosaics responsive to three primary colors. However, this is, at best, an approximation, as an actual retina exhibits a quasi-random spatial distribution of light-sensitive rod and cone photoreceptors, where the ratio of rods to cones and their concentrations vary across the retina. Hence, the periodic mosaics are limited to accurately simulate the properties of the eye. Here, we present an image sensor with similar distribution, spacing, ratios and spectral characteristics of an actual foveal mosaic for emulating eye-like sampling and mimicking color blindness. To perform image reconstruction, we use a fully convolutional U-Net neural network adopting the concept of receptive fields in the retinal circuitry. Our research will enable the development of digital twin of a retina to further understand color vision deficiencies.</description>

      <title>Timekeeping precision enhancements at constant power</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate precision enhancements in a timekeeping device at constant power and regardless of the operation frequency. Our timekeeping device is a laser-driven coupled-cavity system sustaining limit cycles. We quantify the precision of this device via the standard deviation of the limit cycle period, and demonstrate how it changes when varying the cavity length at constant laser power. Through a phase space analysis of the limit cycle fluctuations, we reveal how the proximity of different bifurcations determines the timekeeping precision of our device regardless of the input power and oscillation frequency. We expect that, as the miniaturization of computer clocks demands greater energy efficiency in the presence of strong fluctuations, our results can pave the way towards maximizing the precision of such clocks.</description>

      <title>A Unified Symmetry-Constrained Framework for Band Inversions in Photonic Crystals with $C_n$ Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The lack of a unified theoretical framework for characterizing band inversions across different crystal symmetries hinders the rapid development of topological photonic band engineering. To address this issue, we have constructed a framework constrained by symmetry $k \cdot p$ that universally models bands near high-symmetry points for symmetric photonic crystals $C_6$, $C_4$, $C_3$, and $C_2$. This framework enables a coefficient-free quantitative diagnosis of band topology. We have demonstrated the power of this framework by systematically engineering band inversions. In $C_6$ crystals, we induce a reopening of the linear gap at $\Gamma$. In $C_4$ systems, mirror symmetry enforces a characteristic quadratic coupling leading to distinct spectral features. Our analysis further reveals that a lone $E$ doublet prevents inversion at the $\Gamma$ point in $C_3$ symmetry, while $C_2$ symmetry facilitates a unique inversion of $Y$ pointsints with anisotropic gap. This symmetry-first, fit-free approach establishes a direct link between experimental band maps and the extraction of fundamental topological parameters. It offers a universal tool for inversion and coupling-order identification.</description>

      <title>Femtosecond low-threshold all-optical switching enabled by giant broadband optical nonlinearity from heteroatom doping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrafast all-optical switching (AOS) is pivotal for advancing integrated photonic devices, from high-speed photonic information processing to next generation all-optical computing and communication networks. However, conventional nonlinear materials suffer from sluggish response time, high power threshold, weak and narrow-bandwidth optical nonlinearities, critically limiting their viability. Here, we report a heteroatom engineering strategy to overcome these limitations by designing zero-dimensional nitrogen-doped carbon quantum dots (N-CQDs) with nonlinear optical performance far exceeding the state-of-the-art. Leveraging spatial self-phase modulation (SSPM) and ultrafast pump-probe technique, we first demonstrate an all-in-one AOS platform, where femtosecond laser pulses serve dual roles as control and signal beams. The AOS simultaneously realizes ultrafast response time (520 fs), ultralow threshold energy (2.2 Wcm-2), and giant nonlinear refraction indexes (10-5 cm2/W) in the wide spectral range (400-1064 nm), yielding performance surpassing state-of-the-art nonlinear carbon materials (i.e. carbon nanotube) by orders of magnitude. Spectroscopic and bandgap analyses attribute these exotic performances to enhanced n-pi interaction enabled by nitrogen doping, which amplifies nonlinear polarization dynamics. Crucially, ultrafast fluorescence spectroscopy reveals a large two-photon absorption cross-section of the N-CQDs, challenging the conventional cognition that broadband SSPM necessitates single-photon excitation. This discovery unveils a multi-channel AOS rooted in synergistic single-photon and two-photon processes.. This work demonstrates a new paradigm for achieving ultrafast, broadband, and energy-efficient AOS by heteroatom doping engineering.</description>

      <title>Release and Recapture of Silica Nanoparticles from an Optical Trap in Weightlessness</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.08666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optically trapped Silica nanoparticles are a promising tool for precise sensing of gravitational or inertial forces and fundamental physics, including tests of quantum mechanics at 'large' mass scales. This field, called levitated optomechanics can greatly benefit from an application in weightlessness. In this paper we demonstrate the feasibility of such setups in a microgravity environment for the first time. Our experiment is operated in the GraviTower Bremen that provides up to 2.5 s of free fall. System performance and first release-recapture experiments, where the particle is no longer trapped are conducted in microgravity. This demonstration should also be seen in the wider context of preparing space missions on the topic of levitated optomechanics.</description>

      <title>Anomalous vortex beam driven harmonic generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The generation and control of the properties of light beams carrying orbital angular momentum is fundamental to extend our understanding on the light-matter interaction process. In this letter, we investigate the use of anomalous and modified anomalous vortex beams for the generation of high-order harmonics (HHG) of the fundamental field. We demonstrate that by controlling the order and topological charge (TC) of the driving field, one can control the vortex beam size of the generated harmonics. A key outcome of this control is the ability to drive the HHG process with fundamental beams of higher TCs and consequently generating harmonics with higher TCs ($\approx 100$) while maintaining a compact beam size and nearly uniform divergence in the far-field across a wide range of harmonic orders.</description>

      <title>Above and beyond the laser induced anti Stokes broadband white light emission in rare earth manganese perovskites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Herein, an experimental and theoretical analysis of broadband laser-induced white light emission (LIWE) in lead-free perovskite under near-infrared excitation is reported. LIWE is a tunable emission influenced by excitation wavelength, power density, pressure, and temperature. The radiance profile presented in this work closely resembles the solar spectral distribution, suggesting potential for solid-state lighting and photovoltaic applications. Based on theoretical modelling, along with photophysical and photoconductivity characterisations, a mathematical description of the LIWE generation is presented. This model describes LIWE as a dynamical process that explains the supralinear dependence of the integrated emission intensity on laser power density, pressure, photophysical kinetics, and photocurrent associated with the emission phenomena under excitation at high laser power densities.</description>

      <title>Dynamic control of laser driven electron acceleration in a photonic structure using programmable optical pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Progress in optical techniques has made precision control of the phase profile in optical pulses common and accessible in scientific laboratories. Carefully shaping the field profile of a laser pulse can be used to master the dynamics of electrons traveling in photonic accelerating structures such as the ones obtained by precisely aligning two dielectric gratings. Here we show that by applying a liquid-crystal-mask to program the phase and amplitude of an infrared laser pulse in combination with a pulse front tilt scheme, it is possible to implement dynamic control on a laser accelerator. This results in a nearly limitless live tuning capability of the accelerator beam dynamics, allowing the demonstration software-based correction of structure and optical front imperfections, implementation of transverse focusing schemes, control of the energy and charge of the output beam, and ultimately optimization of the interaction length, leading to measured energy gains of up to 0.55 MeV.</description>

      <title>Cepstral Strain Mapping for Small Pixel-Count Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the decreasing sizes of integrated-circuit components, the semiconductor industry is in growing need of high-throughput strain mapping techniques that offer high precision and spatial resolution, with desired industry goals of 0.01-0.1% and 1 nm respectively. As the fundamental limitation on the measurement precision is set by the Poisson noise, pixel array detectors with high saturation current, high dynamic range and fast readout are ideally suited for this purpose. However, due to the limited pixel count on these detectors, they do not work well with traditional strain mapping algorithms that were optimized to work on datasets with a large pixel count. Here, we evaluate the cepstral transform that was designed to address this problem, with the precision determined by the convergence, collection angles and dose while remaining insensitive to the pixel count. We test the performance of our method on silicon wedges and Si-SiGe multilayers, and using datasets collected at different conditions, we show how the measured strain precision scales as a function of dose, aperture size and sample thickness. Using precession gives a further improvement in precision by about 1.5-2x, whereas energy filtering does not have a significant impact on the cepstral method for device-relevant sample thickness ranges.</description>

      <title>Realizing the Haldane Model in Thermal Atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08411v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological materials hold great promise for developing next-generation devices with transport properties that remain resilient in the presence of local imperfections. However, their susceptibility to thermal noise has posed a major challenge. In particular, the Haldane model, a cornerstone in topological physics, generally requires cryogenic temperatures for experimental realization, limiting both the investigation of topologically robust quantum phenomena and their practical applications. In this work, we demonstrate a room-temperature realization of the Haldane model using atomic ensembles in momentum-space superradiance lattices, a platform intrinsically resistant to thermal noise. The topological phase transition is revealed through the superradiant emission contrast between two timed Dicke states in the lattice. Crucially, the thermal resilience of this platform allows us to access a deep modulation regime, where topological transitions to high Chern number phases emerge -- going beyond the traditional Haldane model. Our results not only deepen the understanding of exotic topological phases, but also offer a robust, reconfigurable, and room-temperature-compatible platform that connects quantum simulation to real-world quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Observation of tunable chiral spin textures with nonlinear optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08513v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chiral spin textures, such as spin spirals and skyrmions, are key to advancing spintronics by enabling ultrathin, energy-efficient memory, and high-density data storage and processing. However, their realization remains hindered by the scarcity of suitable host materials and the formidable experimental challenges associated with the characterization of these intricate chiral magnetic states. Here, we report the observation of tunable chiral magnetic textures in van der Waals magnet CrPS$_4$ with nonlinear optics. These tunable textures exhibit strong chiral third-order nonlinear optical responses, driven by interlayer and intralayer spin couplings under varying magnetic fields and temperatures. These pronounced chiral nonlinear optical responses highlight the potency and high sensitivity of the nonlinear optical readout for probing non-collinear magnetic orders. Moreover, our findings position van der Waals magnets and their heterostructures as an exceptional platform for reconfigurable spin-photonics and spintronics, unifying optical, electrical, and magnetic properties through unique intralayer and interlayer spin coupling properties and effective spin interaction between photons and electrons.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity and Topology of Exceptional Rings in Nonlinear Non-Hermitian Planar Optical Microcavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07099v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian systems hosting exceptional points (EPs) exhibit enhanced sensitivity and unconventional mode dynamics. Going beyond isolated EPs, here we report on the existence of exceptional rings (ERs) in planar optical resonators with specific form of circular dichroism and TE-TM splitting. Such exceptional rings possess intriguing topologies as discussed earlier for condensed matter systems, but they remain virtually unexplored in presence of nonlinearity, for which our photonic platform is ideal. We find that when Kerr-type nonlinearity (or saturable gain) is introduced, the linear ER splits into two concentric ERs, with the larger-radius ring being a ring of third-order EPs. Transitioning from linear to nonlinear regime, we present a rigorous analysis of spectral topology and report enhanced and adjustable perturbation response in the nonlinear regime. Whereas certain features are specific to our system, the results on non-Hermitian spectral topology and nonlinearity-enhanced perturbation response are generic and equally relevant to a broad class of other nonlinear non-Hermitian systems, providing a universal framework for engineering ERs and EPs in nonlinear non-Hermitian systems.</description>

      <title>A tunable FP Perot coupling interferometer on thin-film lithium niobate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05763v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We experimentally show an electro-optic tunable Fabry-Perot cavity on thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN). Instead of tuning the cavity phase and thus resonant frequency, we demonstrate modulation of the FP cavity by tuning the cavity mirrors via the electro-optic effect in the couplers. We enable full tuning of a low-Q FP cavity with only 3.5 V Vpi and a very short 3.5 mm long Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) mirror.</description>

      <title>Role of the Direct-to-Indirect Bandgap Crossover in the 'Reverse' Energy Transfer Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13318v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Energy transfer (ET) is a dipole-dipole interaction, mediated by the virtual photon. Traditionally, ET happens from the higher (donor) to lower bandgap (acceptor) material. However, in some rare instances, a 'reverse' ET can happen from the lower-to-higher bandgap material, depending on the strong overlap between the acceptor photoluminescence (PL) and the donor absorption spectra. In this work, we report a reverse ET process from the lower bandgap MoS2 to the higher bandgap WS2, due to a near 'resonant' overlap between the MoS2 B and WS2 A excitonic levels. Changing the MoS2 bandgap from direct to indirect by increasing the layer number results in a reduced ET rate, evidenced by the quenching of the WS2 PL emission. Our work shows at 300 K, the ET timescale of ~33 fs is faster than the reported thermalization of the MoS2 excitonic intervalley scattering (K to K') time and competing with the ultrafast charge transfer timescale. Thus, allowing to open a new direction in understanding the competing inter/intralayer processes.</description>

      <title>Quantum sensing of electron beams using solid-state spins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13112v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scattering experiments with energetic particles, such as free electrons, have been historically used to reveal the quantum structure of matter. However, realizing coherent interactions between free-electron beams and solid-state quantum systems has remained out of reach, owing to their intrinsically weak coupling. Realizing such coherent control would open up opportunities for hybrid quantum platforms combining free electrons and solid-state qubits for coincident quantum information processing and nanoscale sensing. Here, we present a framework that employs negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy centers (NV-) in diamond as quantum sensors of a bunched electron beam. We develop a Lindblad master equation description of the magnetic free-electron--qubit interactions and identify spin relaxometry as a sensitive probe of the interaction. Experimentally, we integrate a confocal fluorescence microscopy setup into a microwave-bunched electron beam line. We monitor charge-state dynamics and assess their impact on key sensing performance metrics (such as spin readout contrast), defining safe operating parameters for quantum sensing experiments. By performing $T_1$ relaxometry under controlled electron beam exposure, we establish an upper bound on the free-electron--spin coupling strength. Our results establish NV- centers as quantitative probes of free electrons, providing a metrological benchmark for free-electron--qubit coupling under realistic conditions, and chart a route toward solid-state quantum control with electron beams.</description>
