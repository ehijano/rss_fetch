      <title>Sequential Scoring Rule Evaluation for Forecast Method Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09090v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper shows that sequential statistical analysis techniques can be generalised to the problem of selecting between alternative forecasting methods using scoring rules. A return to basic principles is necessary in order to show that ideas and concepts from sequential statistical methods can be adapted and applied to sequential scoring rule evaluation (SSRE). One key technical contribution of this paper is the development of a large deviations type result for SSRE schemes using a change of measure that parallels a traditional exponential tilting form. Further, we also show that SSRE will terminate in finite time with probability one, and that the moments of the SSRE stopping time exist. A second key contribution is to show that the exponential tilting form underlying our large deviations result allows us to cast SSRE within the framework of generalised e-values. Relying on this formulation, we devise sequential testing approaches that are both powerful and maintain control on error probabilities underlying the analysis. Through several simulated examples, we demonstrate that our e-values based SSRE approach delivers reliable results that are more powerful than more commonly applied testing methods precisely in the situations where these commonly applied methods can be expected to fail.</description>

      <title>Debiased Inference for Dynamic Nonlinear Panels with Multi-dimensional Heterogeneities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.03134v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a generic class of dynamic nonlinear heterogeneous parameter models that incorporate individual and time fixed effects in both the intercept and slope. These models are subject to the incidental parameter problem, in that the limiting distribution of the point estimator is not centered at zero, and that test statistics do not follow their standard asymptotic distributions as in the absence of the fixed effects. To address the problem, we develop an analytical bias correction procedure to construct a bias-corrected likelihood. The resulting estimator follows an asymptotic normal distribution with mean zero. Moreover, likelihood-based tests statistics -- including likelihood-ratio, Lagrange-multiplier, and Wald tests -- follow the limiting chi-squared distribution under the null hypothesis. Simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed correction method, and an empirical application on the labor force participation of single mothers underscores its practical importance.</description>

      <title>Improved Semi-Parametric Bounds for Tail Probability and Expected Loss: Theory and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02400v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many management decisions involve accumulated random realizations for which only the first and second moments of their distribution are available. The sharp Chebyshev-type bound for the tail probability and Scarf bound for the expected loss are widely used in this setting. We revisit the tail behavior of such quantities with a focus on independence. Conventional primal-dual approaches from optimization are ineffective in this setting. Instead, we use probabilistic inequalities to derive new bounds and offer new insights. For non-identical distributions attaining the tail probability bounds, we show that the extreme values are equidistant regardless of the distributional differences. For the bound on the expected loss, we show that the impact of each random variable on the expected sum can be isolated using an extension of the Korkine identity. We illustrate how these new results open up abundant practical applications, including improved pricing of product bundles, more precise option pricing, more efficient insurance design, and better inventory management. For example, we establish a new solution to the optimal bundling problem, yielding a 17% uplift in per-bundle profits, and a new solution to the inventory problem, yielding a 5.6% cost reduction for a model with 20 retailers.</description>

      <title>Hypothesis testing on invariant subspaces of non-symmetric matrices with applications to network statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.18233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.18233v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend the inference procedure for eigenvectors of Tyler (1981), which assumes symmetrizable matrices to generic invariant and singular subspaces of non-diagonalisable matrices to test whether $\nu \in \mathbb{R}^{p \times r}$ is an element of an invariant subspace of $M \in \mathbb{R}^{p \times p}$. Our results include a Wald test for full-vector hypotheses and a $t$-test for coefficient-wise hypotheses. We employ perturbation expansions of invariant subspaces from Sun (1991) and singular subspaces from Liu et al. (2007). Based on the former, we extend the popular Davis-Kahan bound to estimations of its higher-order polynomials and study how the bound simplifies for eigenspaces but attains complexity for generic invariant subspaces.</description>

      <title>Quantifying world geography as seen through the lens of Soviet propaganda</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15938v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cultural data typically contains a variety of biases. In particular, geographical locations are unequally portrayed in media, creating a distorted representation of the world. Identifying and measuring such biases is crucial to understand both the data and the socio-cultural processes that have produced them. Here we suggest to measure geographical biases in a large historical news media corpus by studying the representation of cities. Leveraging ideas of quantitative urban science, we develop a mixed quantitative-qualitative procedure, which allows us to get robust quantitative estimates of the biases. These biases can be further qualitatively interpreted resulting in a hermeneutic feedback loop. We apply this procedure to a corpus of the Soviet newsreel series 'Novosti Dnya' (News of the Day) and show that city representation grows super-linearly with city size, and is further biased by city specialization and geographical location. This allows to systematically identify geographical regions which are explicitly or sneakily emphasized by Soviet propaganda and quantify their importance.</description>

      <title>Estimation of large approximate dynamic matrix factor models based on the EM algorithm and Kalman filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04112v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper considers an approximate dynamic matrix factor model that accounts for the time series nature of the data by explicitly modelling the time evolution of the factors. We study estimation of the model parameters based on the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm, implemented jointly with the Kalman smoother which gives estimates of the factors. We establish the consistency of the estimated loadings and factor matrices as the sample size $T$ and the matrix dimensions $p_1$ and $p_2$ diverge to infinity. We then illustrate two immediate extensions of this approach to: (a) the case of arbitrary patterns of missing data and (b) the presence of common stochastic trends. The finite sample properties of the estimators are assessed through a large simulation study and two applications on: (i) a financial dataset of volatility proxies and (ii) a macroeconomic dataset covering the main euro area countries.</description>
