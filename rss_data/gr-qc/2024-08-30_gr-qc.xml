      <title>Galactic black hole immersed in a dark halo with its surrounding thin accretion disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By considering the analytic, static and spherically symmetric solution for the Schwarzschild black holes immersed in dark matter fluid with non-zero tangential pressure \cite{Jusufi:2022jxu} and Hernquist-type density profiles \cite{Cardoso}, we compute the luminosity of accretion disk. We study the circular motion of test particles in accretion disk and calculate the radius of the innermost stable circular orbits. Using the steady-state Novikov-Thorne model we also compute the observational characteristics of such black hole's accretion disk and compare our results with the usual Schwarzschild black hole in the absence of dark matter fluid. We find that the tangential pressure plays a significant role in decreasing the size of the innermost stable circular orbits and thus increases the luminosity of black hole's accretion disk.</description>

      <title>The consequence of higher-order curvature-based constraints on $ f(R, L_m) $ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this investigation, we perform an observational statistical analysis in the theory of $ f(R, L_m) $ gravity. The proposed theoretical model is based on the Ricci scalar's non-linear contribution. We use a distinct parameterization for the deceleration parameter and constrain the model parameters by using various observational data. To determine the best-fit model for the cosmological parameters, we use different observational datasets such as the Hubble Space Telescope, the Pantheon Supernova Survey, the Gold dataset, the Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB), and the Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO). Furthermore, we study the late-time cosmic evolution of the Universe in detail and examine the implications of the constraint values on cosmological parameters. Additionally, we conduct a thorough comparison with the standard cosmological model $ \Lambda $CDM and other standard models obtained by Odintsov et al. \cite{Odintsov:2023cli, Odintsov:2024lid} to examine the validity of our proposed model in the low-redshift regimes. Finally, we find that the proposed model encapsulates an intriguing transition from early deceleration at high redshift to acceleration at low redshift, a quintessence dark energy scenario, and convergence towards the well-established $ \Lambda $CDM model in late-time Universe's evolution.</description>

      <title>Forward Ray Tracing and Hot Spots in Kerr Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hotspots, often characterized as point-like emissions, frequently manifest near black holes, displaying significantly increased luminosity compared to the surrounding accretion flow. It is noteworthy that these hotspots regularly occur outside the black hole at the center of the Milky Way. Light rays emitted from these sources follow complex trajectories around the black hole, ultimately arriving at distinct locations on the observer's image plane. To extract precise spacetime information, including the black hole mass, spin, and inclination angle, it is crucial to accurately resolve both the direct emission and its higher-order images, despite the latter's intensity suppression. To enhance the accuracy and efficiency of modeling and analyzing these hotspots, we introduce a forward ray tracing method, a departure from the traditional backward ray tracing approach. By utilizing conserved quantities in Kerr spacetime, this method initiates geodesics from a specified emission point near the black hole and terminates them at a distant observer, effectively capturing multiple images. By introducing perturbations to these geodesics, we map finite-size emissions to distinct regions on the image plane, allowing for the quantification of image shapes and amplification rates. This approach facilitates efficient spacetime tomography and hotspot localization, leveraging observations from the Event Horizon Telescope and its next-generation upgrades.</description>

      <title>Accurate quasinormal modes of the analogue black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the quasinormal modes of the spherically-symmetric $(2+1)$-dimensional analogue black hole, modeled by the ``draining bathtub'' fluid flow, and the $(3+1)$-dimensional canonical acoustic black hole. In the both cases the emphasis is on the accuracy. Formally, the radial equation describing perturbations of the $(2+1)$-dimensional black hole is a special case of the general master equation of the 5-dimensional Tangherlini black hole. Similarly, the $(3+1)$-dimensional equation can be obtained from the master equation of the 7-dimensional Tangherlini black hole. For the $(2+1)$-dimensional analogue black hole we used three major techniques: the higher-order WKB method with the Pad\'e summation, the Hill-determinant method and the continued fraction method, the latter two with the convergence acceleration. In the $(3+1)$-dimensional case, we propose the simpler recurrence relations and explicitly demonstrate that both recurrences, i.e., the eight-term and the six-term recurrences yield identical results. Since the application of the continued-fraction method require five (or three) consecutive Gauss eliminations, we decided not to use this technique in the $(3+1)$-dimensional case. Instead, we used the Hill-determinant method in the two incarnations and the higher-order WKB. We accept the results of our calculations if at least two (algorithmically) independent methods give the same answer to some prescribed accuracy. Our results correct and extend the results existing in the literature and we believe that we approached assumed accuracy of 9 decimal places. In most cases, there is perfect agreement between all the methods; however, in a few cases, the performance of the higher-order WKB method is slightly worse.</description>

      <title>Concept Study of a Storage Ring-based Gravitational Wave Observatory: Gravitational Wave Strain and Synchrotron Radiation Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work for the first time addresses the feasibility of measuring millihertz gravitational waves (mHz GWs) with a storage ring-based detector. While this overall challenge consists of several partial problems, here we focus solely on quantifying design limitations imposed by the kinetic energy and radiated power of circulating ions at relativistic velocities. We propose an experiment based on the measurement of the time-of-flight signal of an ion chain. One of the dominant noise sources inherent to the measurement principle for such a GW detector is the shot noise of the emitted synchrotron radiation. We compute the noise amplitude of arrival time signals obtained by analytical estimates and simulations of ions with different masses and velocities circulating in a storage ring with the circumference of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Thereby, we show that our experiment design could reduce the noise amplitude due to the synchrotron radiation in the frequency range $10^{-4} - 10^{-2}$ Hz to one or two orders of magnitude below the expected GW signals from of astrophysical sources, such as super-massive binary black holes or extreme mass-ratio inspirals. Other key requirements for building a working storage ring-based GW detector include the generation and acceleration of heavy ion chains with the required energy resolution, their injection and continued storage, as well as the detection method to be used for the determination of the particle arrival time. However, these are not the focus of the work presented here, in which we instead concentrate on the definition of a working principle in terms of ion type, kinetic energy, and ring design, which will later serve as a starting point when addressing a more complete experimental setup.</description>

      <title>How can an extra dimension affect compact star observables in the Klauza-Klein model?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A theoretical framework for calculating the mass-radius curve of compact stars in the Kaluza-Klein space-time is introduced, with one additional compact spatial dimension. Static, spherically symmetric solutions are considered, with the equation of state provided by a zero temperature, interacting multidimensional Fermi gas. To model the strong force between baryons, a repulsive potential is introduced, which is linear in the particle number density. The maximal mass of compact stars is calculated for different model parameters, and with a physical parameter choice, it satisfies observational data, meaning that it is possible to model simple, realistic objects within this framework. Based on this comparison, a limiting size for the observational regime of extra dimensions in compact stars is provided, with $r_c \gtrsim 0.2$~fm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we revise the concept of foliation and related aspects that are crucial when formulating the Hamiltonian evolution for various theories beyond General Relativity. In particular, we show the relation between the kinematic characteristics of timelike congruences (observers) and the existence of foliations orthogonal to them. We then explore how local Lorentz transformations acting on observers affect the existence of transversal foliations, provide examples and discuss about the implications of these results for the 3+1 formulation of tetrad modified theories of gravity.</description>

      <title>Normal bound states out of massive complex ghosts degrees of freedom in superrenormalizable quantum gravity theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the remarkable differences between renormalizable quantum gravity with four-derivative action and its superrenormalizable polynomial generalizations is that the latter admit a more sophisticated particle mass spectrum. Already in the simplest superrenormalizable case, the theory has a six-derivative Lagrangian, admitting either a real or complex spectrum of masses. In the case of a real spectrum, there are the graviton, massive unphysical ghosts, and normal particles with masses exceeding the ones of the ghosts. It is also possible to have pairs of complex conjugate massive ghost-like particles. We show that in both cases, these theories do not admit a K\"all\'en-Lehmann representation and do not satisfy the positivity criterium of consistency. In the main part of the work, using a relatively simple Euclidean scalar toy model, we show that the theory with complex spectrum forms bound states confining unphysical massive excitations into a normal composite particle. Finally, we discuss the cosmological implications of such a ghost confinement.</description>

      <title>Static Planck stars from effective loop quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective loop quantum gravity dynamics are derived for spherically symmetric spacetimes with a perfect fluid matter content. For homogeneous spacetimes, the effective dynamics agree with the standard results of loop quantum cosmology, while the equations for static solutions give an effective Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation. There exist solutions to the effective Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation that have a mass of the order of the Planck mass, a Planckian radius, and no horizon; these miniature stars could potentially contribute to dark matter, and could be an end state for an evaporating black hole.</description>

      <title>A new approach in classical Klein-Gordon cosmology: "Small Bangs", inflation and Dark Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we analyze the cosmological model in which the expansion is driven by a classical, free Klein-Gordon field on a flat, four-dimensional Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker spacetime. The model allows for arbitrary mass, non-zero cosmological constant and coupling to curvature. We find that there are strong restrictions to the parameter space, due to the requirement for the reality of the field values. At early cosmological times, we observe Big Bang singularities, solutions where the scale factor asymptotically approaches zero, and Small Bangs. The latter are solutions for which the Hubble parameter diverges at a finite value of the scale factor. They appear generically in our model for certain curvature couplings. An early inflationary era is observed for a specific value of the curvature coupling without further assumptions (unlike in many other inflationary models). A late-time Dark Energy period is present for all solutions with positive cosmological constant, numerically suggesting that a "cosmic no-hair" theorem holds under more general assumptions than the original Wald version which relies on classical energy conditions. The classical fields in consideration can be viewed as resembling one-point functions of a semiclassical model, in which the cosmological expansion is driven by a quantum field.</description>

      <title>Post-innermost stable circular orbit ringdown of a rapidly spinning black hole: mass ratio dependence of higher harmonic quasi-normal mode excitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a binary merger with a small mass ratio, as the secondary body approaches the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) of the primary black hole, the motion transitions from the adiabatic inspiral to the plunge governed by the geodesic equation. The plunge orbit is expected to excite the ringdown gravitational wave, which encodes information about the primary black hole's geometry. The details of the transition regime depend on the binary's mass ratio through radiation fluxes, which in turn influence the initial conditions for the plunge. As such, the mass ratio affects the post-ISCO ringdown gravitational wave excitation. In this study, we numerically investigate the mass ratio dependence of higher harmonic quasi-normal mode excitations in the post-ISCO gravitational waves of rapidly spinning black holes, based on the Teukolsky-Sasaki-Nakamura formalism. We consider the effect of mass ratio on the gravitational waves by accounting for the energy and angular momentum losses during the transition regime following the Ori-Thorne procedure. We examine two mass ratio scenarios: the intermediate mass ratio (IMR) and the extreme mass ratio (EMR). Our main finding is that higher harmonic quasi-normal modes are significantly excited in an IMR merger involving a highly spinning primary black hole. This implies that detecting an IMR merger involving such a primary black hole with space-based gravitational wave interferometers can provide valuable opportunities to infer black hole properties or test general relativity with excellent precision.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A variety of high-energy events can take place in the seconds leading up to a binary neutron-star merger. Mechanisms involving tidal resonances, electrodynamic interactions, or shocks in mass-loaded wakes have been proposed as instigators of these precursors. With a view of gravitational-wave and multimessenger astrophysics more broadly, premerger observations and theory are reviewed emphasising how gamma-ray precursors and dynamical tides can constrain the neutron-star equation of state, thermodynamic microphysics, and evolutionary pathways. Connections to post-merger phenomena, notably gamma-ray bursts, are discussed together with how magnetic fields, spin and misalignment, crustal elasticity, and stratification gradients impact observables.</description>

      <title>On one-loop corrections to the Bunch-Davies wavefunction of the universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the loop corrections to cosmological observables is of paramount importance for having control on the quantum consistency of a theory in an expanding universe as well as for phenomenological reasons. In the present work, we begin with a systematic study of such corrections in the context scalar toy models whose perturbative Bunch-Davies wavefunction enjoys an intrinsic definition in terms of cosmological polytopes, focusing on one-loop graphs. Owing to the underlying twisted period integral representation they admit, their combinatorial structure along with their vector space structure, emerging from polynomial ideals algebra and intersection theory, are exploited to set-up and analyse the differential equations that the two- and three-site one-loop corrections have to satisfy upon variation of the external kinematic variables. We find that, while the two-site contribution can be written in terms of multiple-polylogarithms, this is no longer true for the three-site case, for which elliptic structures appear. As a non-trivial check, we consider the scattering amplitude limit, recovering the known result in terms of polylogarithms only.</description>

      <title>Efficient Compression of Redshift-Space Distortion Data for Late-Time Modified Gravity Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current cosmological observations allow for deviations from the standard growth of large-scale structures in the universe. These deviations could indicate modifications to General Relativity on cosmological scales or suggest the dynamical nature of dark energy. It is important to characterize these departures in a model-independent manner to understand their significance objectively and explore their fundamental causes more generically across a wider spectrum of theories and models. In this paper, we compress the information from redshift-space distortion data into 2-3 parameters $\mu_i$, which control the ratio between the effective gravitational coupling in Poisson's equation and Newton's constant in several redshift bins in the late universe. We test the efficiency of this compression using mock final-year data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) and considering three different models within the class of effective field theories of dark energy. The constraints on the parameters of these models, obtained from both the direct fit to the data and the projection of the compressed parameters onto the parameters of the models, are fully consistent, demonstrating the method's good performance. Then, we apply it to current data and find hints of a suppressed matter growth in the universe at $\sim 2.7\sigma$ C.L., in full accordance with previous works in the literature. Finally, we perform a forecast with DESI data and show that the uncertainties on the parameters $\mu_1$ at $z&lt;1$ and $\mu_2$ at $1&lt;z&lt;3$ are expected to decrease by approximately $40\%$ and $20\%$, respectively, compared to those obtained with current data. Additionally, we project these forecasted constraints onto the parameters of the aforesaid models.</description>

Abstract: We propose a gauge singlet scalar with mass around $1-10$ TeV as a thermal heavy dark matter candidate along with a dilaton as a Higgs portal mediator in a dimensionless scalar extension of the Standard Model. We demonstrate analytically that such a model gives rise to very strong first-order electroweak phase tyransition through supercooling. We calculate the corresponding gravitational wave signals due to bubble collisions during the phase transition. The produced gravitational waves can detected by future space-based gravitational wave detectors in the frequency range from $10^{-4}$ Hz to $0.1$ Hz.</description>

      <title>Nonsmooth d'Alembertian for Lorentz distance functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16525v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We refine a recent distributional notion of d'Alembertian of a signed Lorentz distance function to an achronal set in a metric measure spacetime obeying the timelike measure contraction property. We show precise representation formulas and comparison estimates (both upper and lower bounds). Under a condition we call "infinitesimally strict concavity" (known for infinitesimally Minkowskian structures and established here for Finsler spacetimes), we prove the associated distribution is a signed measure certifying the integration by parts formula. This treatment of the d'Alembertian using techniques from metric geometry expands upon its recent elliptic interpretation; even in the smooth case, our formulas seem to pioneer its exact shape across the timelike cut locus. Two central ingredients our contribution unifies are the localization paradigm of Cavalletti-Mondino and the Lorentzian Sobolev calculus of Beran et al.
  In the second part of our work, we present several applications of these insights. First, we show the equivalence of the timelike curvature-dimension condition with a Bochner-type inequality. Second, we set up synthetic mean curvature (and barriers for CMC sets) exactly. Third, we prove volume and area estimates of Heintze-Karcher-type, which enable us to show several synthetic volume singularity theorems.</description>

      <title>Tight bound on neutron-star radius with quasiperiodic oscillations in short gamma-ray bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16534v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quasiperiodic oscillations (QPOs) have been recently discovered in the short gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) 910711 and 931101B. Their frequencies are consistent with those of the radial and quadrupolar oscillations of binary neutron star merger remnants, as obtained in numerical relativity simulations. These simulations reveal quasiuniversal relations between the remnant oscillation frequencies and the tidal coupling constant of the binaries. Under the assumption that the observed QPOs are due to these postmerger oscillations, we use the frequency-tide relations in a Bayesian framework to infer the source redshift, as well as the chirp mass and the binary tidal deformability of the binary neutron star progenitors for GRBs 910711 and 931101B. We further use this inference to estimate bounds on the mass-radius relation for neutron stars. By combining the estimates from the two GRBs, we find a 68\% credible range $R_{1.4}=12.48^{+0.41}_{-0.41}$~km for the radius of a neutron star with mass $M=1.4$~M$_\odot$, which is one of the tightest bounds to date.</description>

      <title>On the Schwinger effect during axion inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16538v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pair-creation of charged particles in a strong gauge-field background - the renowned Schwinger effect - can strongly alter the efficiency of gauge-field production during axion inflation. It is therefore crucial to have a clear understanding and proper description of this phenomenon to obtain reliable predictions for the physical observables in this model. In the present work, we revisit the problem of Schwinger pair-production during axion inflation in the presence of both electric and magnetic fields and improve on the state of the art in two ways: (i) taking into account that the electric- and magnetic-field three-vectors are in general noncollinear, we derive the vector decomposition of the Schwinger-induced current in terms of these fields and determine the corresponding effective electric and magnetic conductivities; (ii) by identifying the physical momentum scale associated with the pair-creation process, we incorporate Schwinger damping of the gauge field in a scale-dependent fashion in the relevant equations of motion. Implementing this new description in the framework of the gradient-expansion formalism, we obtain numerical results in a benchmark scenario of axion inflation and perform a comprehensive comparison with earlier results in the literature. In some cases, the resulting energy densities of the produced gauge fields differ from the old results by more than one order of magnitude, which reflects the importance of taking the new effects into account.</description>

      <title>Galilean fluids from non-relativistic gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $1/c$-expansion of general relativity appropriately sourced by matter can be used to derive an action principle for Newtonian gravity. The gravitational part of this action is known as non-relativistic gravity (NRG). It is possible to source NRG differently and in such a way that one can construct solutions that are not described by Newtonian gravity (as they do not admit a notion of absolute time). It is possible to include a negative cosmological constant such that NRG admits a non-relativistic AdS solution. This non-relativistic AdS vacuum has Killing vectors that form the Galilean conformal algebra and a boundary that admits a conformal class of Newton-Cartan geometries. This begs the question of whether there exists an analogue of the fluid/gravity correspondence for NRG. In this paper we derive a non-relativistic AdS brane solution of NRG and confirm that it corresponds to the $1/c^2$-expansion of the AdS black brane geometry. We perform a Galilean boost of the non-relativistic AdS brane and derive the associated boundary energy-momentum tensor. We then show that this is the energy-momentum tensor of a massless Galilean fluid and explain how this is linked to the conformal isometries of the boundary. Along the way, we also present several new results for the theory of non-relativistic gravity itself. In particular we present a rewriting that greatly shortens and simplifies the equations of motion of the NRG action.</description>

      <title>Bounds on the minimum sound speed above neutron star densities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16738v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the existence of massive neutron stars and asymptotic freedom of QCD place robust upper bounds on the lowest sound speed of the ultra-dense matter unattainable in neutron stars. Our approach does not rely on explicitly representing the equation of state in the density range $\sim 2-40 n_0$, and does not require probabilistic interpretations. The upper limit decreases rapidly when the maximum mass of neutron stars is greater than about $2.5M_\odot$. Discovery of $\sim 3 M_\odot$ neutron stars would strongly support first-order phase transitions at high baryon densities</description>

      <title>On the first test of the Weak Equivalence Principle in low Earth orbit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.06400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.06400v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Weak Equivalence Principle is the founding pillar of General Relativity and as such should be verified as precisely as possible. The Microscope experiment tested it in low Earth orbit, finding that Pt and Ti test masses fall toward Earth with the same acceleration to about 1e-15, an improvement of about two orders of magnitude over ground tests. Space missions, even if small, are expensive and hard to replicate; yet, the essence of physics is repeatability. This work is an assessment of the Microscope results based on the laws of physics and knowledge from previous experiments, focusing on the limiting thermal noise and the treatment of acceleration outliers. Thermal noise reveals anomalies that we explain by stray sub-microVolt potentials caused by patch charges, giving rise to an unstable zero. The measurements were affected by numerous acceleration spikes occurring at the synodic frequencies relative to the Earth (the signal frequency) and the Sun, which we interpret as evidence of a thermal origin. In Microscope authors' analysis, the spikes were removed and the resulting gaps replaced with artificial data (up to 35, 40 per cent of the sessions data), which retain memory of the gaps and may simulate or cancel an effect (signal or systematic). An alternative approach based exclusively on real measured data would avoid any ambiguity. The lessons of Microscope are crucial to any futures improved mission.</description>

Abstract: We study the quantum field theory (QFT) of a scalar field in the Schr\"odinger picture in the functional formulation.
  We derive a formula for the evolution kernel in a flat expanding metric. We discuss a transition between Riemannian and pseudoRiemannian metrics (signature inversion). We express the real time Schr\"odinger evolution by the Brownian motion . We discuss the Feynman integral for a scalar field in a radiation background. We show that the unitary Schr\"odinger evolution for positive time can go over for negative time into a dissipative evolution described by diffusive paths.</description>

      <title>Gradient conformal stationarity and the CMC condition in LRS spacetimes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.07605v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the existence of gradient conformal Killing vectors (CKVs) in the class of locally rotationally symmetric (LRS) spacetimes which generalizes spherically symmetric spacetimes, and investigate some implications for the evolutionary character of marginally outer trapped surfaces. We first study existence of gradient CKVs via the obtention of a relationship between the Ricci curvature and the gradient of the divergence of the CKV. This provides an alternative set of equations, for which the integrability condition is obtained, to analyze the existence of gradient CKVs. A uniqueness result is obtained in the case of perfect fluids, where it is demonstrated that the Robertson-Walker solution is the unique perfect fluid solution with a nonvanishing pressure, admitting a timelike gradient CKV. The constant mean curvature condition for LRS spacetimes is also obtained, characterized by three distinct conditions which are specified by a set of three scalars. Linear combinations of these scalars, whose vanishing define the constant mean curvature condition, turn out to be related to the evolutions of null expansions of 2-spheres along their null normal directions. As such, some implications for the existence of black holes and the character of the associated horizons are obtained. It is further shown that dynamical black holes of increasing area, with a non-vanishing heat flux across the horizon, will be in equilibrium, with respect to the frame of the conformal observers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13112v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Singularity theorems demonstrate the inevitable breakdown of the concept of continuous, classical spacetime under highly general conditions. Quantum gravity is expected to intervene to avoid singularities and models so far hint towards several regularized geometries, in which limited spacetime regions requiring full quantum gravitational description can be safely covered by an extension of some suitable spacetime geometry. Motivated by these premises, in recent years, a systematic, quantum gravity agnostic, study has been carried out to catalogue all the conceivable non-singular, continuous, and globally hyperbolic geometries arising from evading Penrose's focusing theorem in gravitational collapse. In this study, we extend this inquiry by systematically examining all potential non-singular, continuous, and globally hyperbolic extensions into the past of Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metrics. As in the black hole case, our investigation reveals a remarkably limited set of alternative scenarios. The stringent requisites of homogeneity and isotropy drastically restrict the viable singularity-free geometries to merely three discernible non-singular cosmological spacetimes: a bouncing universe (where the scale factor reaches a minimum in the past before re-expanding), an emergent universe (where the scale factor reaches and maintains a constant value in the past), and an asymptotically emergent universe (where the scale factor diminishes continually, asymptotically approaching a constant value in the past). We also discuss the implications of these findings for the initial conditions of our universe, and the arrow of time.</description>

Abstract: Equatorial circular geodesic orbits of neutral test particles in the exterior spacetime of a charged rotating disc of dust are analyzed in dependence of its specific charge and a relativity parameter. The charged rotating disc of dust is an axisymmetric, stationary solution of the Einstein-Maxwell equations in terms of a post-Newtonian expansion. In particular, photon, marginally bound and marginally stable orbits are discussed. It turns out that general formulae in closed form for angular velocity, specific energy and specific angular momentum of the test particles can be derived, which hold for any (exterior) asymptotically flat, axisymmetric, stationary and reflection symmetric (electro-)vacuum spacetime. Furthermore, circular motion in the exterior spacetime of the charged rotating disc of dust is qualitatively very similar to that around a Kerr-Newman black hole for sufficiently large radii, but differs strongly in the respective closer vicinity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09095v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using numerical methods, we examine, under a Gowdy symmetry assumption, the dynamics of nonlinearly perturbed FLRW fluid solutions of the Einstein-Euler-scalar field equations in the contracting direction for linear equations of state $p = K\rho$ and sound speeds $0\leq K&lt;1/3$. This article builds upon the numerical work from \cite{BMO:2023} in which perturbations of FLRW solutions to the Einstein-Euler equations with positive cosmological constant in the expanding time direction were studied. The numerical results presented here confirm that the instabilities observed in \cite{BMO:2023,MarshallOliynyk:2022} for $1/3&lt;K&lt;1$, first conjectured to occur in the expanding direction by Rendall in \cite{Rendall:2004}, are also present in the contracting direction over the complementary parameter range $0\leq K&lt;1/3$. Our numerical solutions show that the fractional density gradient of the nonlinear perturbations develop steep gradients near a finite number of spatial points and become unbounded towards the big bang. This behaviour, and in particular the characteristic profile of the fractional density gradient near the big bang, is strikingly similar to what was observed in the expanding direction near timelike infinity in the article \cite{BMO:2023}.</description>

Abstract: In order to investigate the potential observational signals of different regularization ambiguities in loop quantum cosmological models, we systematically compute and compare the primordial scalar power spectra and the resulting angular power spectra in the standard loop quantum cosmology (LQC) and its Thiemann regularized versions -- modified LQC-I/II (mLQC-I/II), using both the dressed metric and the hybrid approaches. All three loop quantum cosmological models yield a non-singular bounce with a post-bounce physics that converges rapidly in a few Planck seconds. Using Starobinsky potential and the initial conditions for the background dynamics chosen to yield the same inflationary e-foldings, which are fixed to be $65$ in all three LQC models, we require that all three models result in the same scale-invariant regime for the primordial power spectrum with a relative difference of less than one percent. This permits us to explore the differences resulting from the deep Planck regime in the angular power spectrum. For the adiabatic states, our results demonstrate that the angular power spectrum predicted by the hybrid approach has a smaller deviation from the angular power spectrum predicted by the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model at large angles in comparison with the dressed metric approach for all three models. The angular power spectrum predicted by mLQC-I in both the hybrid and the dressed metric approaches shows the smallest deviation from the one predicted by the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model at large angular scales, except for the case of fourth order adiabatic initial states in the hybrid approach. On the contrary, mLQC-II results in the largest deviations for the amplitude of the angular power spectrum at large angles and is most disfavored.</description>

Abstract: We present a generalization of the quantum volume operator quantifying the volume in curved three-dimensional discrete geometries. In its standard form, the quantum volume operator is constructed from tetrahedra whose faces are endowed with irreducible representations of $\mathrm{SU}(2)$. Here, we show two equivalent constructions that allow general objects in fusion categories as degrees of freedom. First, we compute the volume operator for ribbon fusion categories. This includes the important class of modular tensor categories (such as quantum doubles), which are the building blocks of anyon models. Second, we further generalize the volume operator to spherical fusion categories by relaxing the categorical analog of the closure constraint (known as tetrahedral symmetry). In both cases, we obtain a volume operator that is Hermitian, provided that the input category is unitary. As an illustrative example, we consider the case of $\mathrm{SU}(2)_k$ and show that the standard $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ volume operator is recovered in the limit $k\rightarrow\infty$.</description>

Abstract: Numerical simulations of the Cauchy problem for self-interacting massive vector fields often face instabilities and apparent pathologies. We explicitly demonstrate that these issues, previously reported in the literature, are actually due to the breakdown of the well-posedness of the initial-value problem. This is akin to shortcomings observed in scalar-tensor theories when derivative self-interactions are included. Building on previous work done for k-essence, we characterize the well-posedness breakdowns, differentiating between Tricomi and Keldysh-like behaviors. We show that these issues can be avoided by ``fixing the equations'', enabling stable numerical evolutions in spherical symmetry. Additionally, we show that for a class of vector self-interactions, no Tricomi-type breakdown takes place. Finally, we investigate initial configurations for the massive vector field which lead to gravitational collapse and the formation of black holes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11150v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite their success, General Relativity (GR) and the Standard Model (SM) are currently understood as effective field theories only valid up to some energy (length) scale, where new physics is expected to appear. We review the framework of extended relativity (ER) in Clifford spaces (C-spaces), summarizing some of its concepts, methods and results. We also discuss likely links of this approach with other relativities (OR), beyond GR and SM theories, recent ideas from emergent spacetime (ES) and quantum entanglement (QE), in search for quantum gravity (QG) and unification (U). Finally, we explore and expose the need to go even beyond ER, and the challenges it poses, from both experimental and theoretical sides.</description>

      <title>Black hole event horizons are cosmologically coupled</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14549v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is shown that an exactly static and spherically symmetric black hole event horizon cannot be embedded in a time-dependent geometry. Forcing it to do so results in a naked null singularity at the would-be horizon. Therefore, since the universe is expanding, black holes must couple to the cosmological expansion, which was suggested as the growth mechanism for supermassive black holes in galaxies, with implications for the dark energy puzzle.</description>

      <title>Constraining Spacetime Dimensions in Quantum Gravity by Scale Invariance and Electric-Magnetic Duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.15161v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a low energy effective theory of $p$-branes in a $D$-dimensional spacetime, and impose two conditions: 1) the theory is scale invariant, and 2) the electric-magnetic dual $(D-p-4)$-branes exist and they obey the same type of interactions to the $p$-branes. (We also assume other natural conditions such as Lorentz invariance but not string theory, supersymmetry, supergravity and so on.) We then ask what $p$ and $D$ are consistent with these conditions. Using simple dimensional analysis, we find that only two solutions are possible: $(p,D)=(2,11)$ and $(p,D)=(2n-1,4n+2)$, ($n=1,2,3,\cdots$). The first solution corresponds to M-theory, and the second solutions at $n=1$ and $n=2$ correspond to self-dual strings in little string theory and D3-branes in type IIB superstring theory, respectively, while the second solutions for $n \ge 3$ are unknown but would be higher spin theories. Thus, quantum gravity (massless spin two theory) satisfying our two conditions would only be superstring theories, and the conditions would be strong enough to characterize superstring theories in quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Birefringence by Dark Photon</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.14798v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the kinetic mixing between the cosmic microwave background (CMB) photon and the birefringent dark photon. These birefringent dark photon may exist in parity-violating dark sector, for example, through the coupling to axion field. We show that the birefringence of the dark photon propagates to the CMB photon, but the resulting birefringence may not be isotropic over the sky, but will be anisotropic in general. Moreover, our investigation sheds light on the essential role played by kinetic mixing in the generation of two fundamental characteristics of the CMB: circular polarization and spectral distortion.</description>

      <title>Entanglement dynamics in $\kappa$-deformed spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.08135v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We treat two identical and mutually independent two-level atoms that are coupled to a quantum field as an open quantum system. The master equation that governs their evolution is derived by tracing over the degree of freedom of the field. With this, we compare the entanglement dynamics of the two atoms moving with different trajectories in $\kappa$-deformed and Minkowski spacetimes. Notably, when the environment-induced interatomic interaction does not exist, the entanglement dynamics of two static atoms in $\kappa$-deformed spacetime are reduced to that in Minkowski spacetime in the case that the spacetime deformation parameter $\kappa$ is sufficiently large as theoretically predicted. However, if the atoms undergo relativistic motion, regardless of whether inertial or non-inertial, their entanglement dynamics in $\kappa$-deformed spacetime behave differently from that in Minkowski spacetime even when $\kappa$ is large. We investigate various types of entanglement behavior, such as decay and generation, and discuss how different relativistic motions, such as uniform motion in a straight line and circular motion, amplify the differences in the entanglement dynamics between the $\kappa$-deformed and Minkowski spacetime cases. In addition, when the environment-induced interatomic interaction is considered, we find that it may also enhance the differences in the entanglement dynamics between these two spacetimes. Thus, in principle, one can tell whether she/he is in $\kappa$-deformed or Minkowski spacetime by checking the entanglement behavior between two atoms in certain circumstances.</description>

      <title>Stochastic gravitational wave background detection using NANOGrav 15-year data set in the context of massive gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.03932v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Convincing evidence of a stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background has been found by the NANOGrav Collaboration in the 15-year data set. From this signal, we can evaluate the possibility of its source being from the early Universe through the tensor perturbations induced by a massive spin-2 graviton field. We consider a time-dependent model of the minimal theory of massive gravity and find values of the graviton mass, mass cutoff time, and Hubble rate of inflation that amplify the energy spectra of primordial GWs sufficiently to reproduce the signal from the NANOGrav data within 1-3 standard deviation. However, a suppression mechanism for high-frequency modes must be introduced to conservatively obey the big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) bound. While there are regions of the parameter space that reproduce the signal, it remains a challenge to simultaneously respect the BBN and cosmic microwave background bounds without making the graviton mass cutoff time too deep into the matter-dominated era.</description>

      <title>Neural Simulation-Based Inference of the Neutron Star Equation of State directly from Telescope Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00287v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neutron stars provide a unique opportunity to study strongly interacting matter under extreme density conditions. The intricacies of matter inside neutron stars and their equation of state are not directly visible, but determine bulk properties, such as mass and radius, which affect the star's thermal X-ray emissions. However, the telescope spectra of these emissions are also affected by the stellar distance, hydrogen column, and effective surface temperature, which are not always well-constrained. Uncertainties on these nuisance parameters must be accounted for when making a robust estimation of the equation of state. In this study, we develop a novel methodology that, for the first time, can infer the full posterior distribution of both the equation of state and nuisance parameters directly from telescope observations. This method relies on the use of neural likelihood estimation, in which normalizing flows use samples of simulated telescope data to learn the likelihood of the neutron star spectra as a function of these parameters, coupled with Hamiltonian Monte Carlo methods to efficiently sample from the corresponding posterior distribution. Our approach surpasses the accuracy of previous methods, improves the interpretability of the results by providing access to the full posterior distribution, and naturally scales to a growing number of neutron star observations expected in the coming years.</description>

      <title>On the cosmological abundance of magnetic monopoles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04926v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that Debye shielding cannot be employed to constrain the cosmological abundance of magnetic monopoles, contrary to what is stated in the previous literature. Current model-independent bounds on the monopole abundance are then revisited for unit Dirac magnetic charge. We find that the Andromeda Parker bound can be employed to set an upper limit on the monopole flux at the level of $F_M\lesssim 5.3\times 10^{-19}\,\text{cm}^{-2}\text{s}^{-1}\text{sr}^{-1}$ for a monopole mass $10^{13}\,\text{GeV}/c^2\lesssim m\lesssim 10^{16}\,\text{GeV}/c^2$, which is more stringent than the MACRO direct search limit by two orders of magnitude. This translates into stringent constraints on the monopole density parameter $\Omega_M$ at the level of $10^{-7}-10^{-4}$ depending on the mass. For larger monopole masses the scenarios in which magnetic monopoles account for all or the majority of dark matter are disfavored.</description>

      <title>Reassessing constant-roll Warm Inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00340v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Departing from standard slow-roll conditions is one way of putting the inflationary paradigm to test, and constraining the dynamics of the inflaton field with a constant-rate of roll of the inflaton field, a.k.a. the constant-roll scenario, is one way of exploring such deviation from the standard slow-roll dynamics. In this manuscript we explore such a possibility in a variant inflationary scenario, known as Warm Inflation. We construct and derive the conditions for having constant-roll WI models where inflation lasts at least for 60 $e-$folds, gracefully exits the constant-roll inflation phase, and maintains near thermal equilibrium of the system which is an essential feature of WI in the slow-roll regime. We show that while certain models of WI (the ones with dissipative coefficient as a function of temperature alone) can accommodate constant-roll dynamics, others (with dissipative coefficient as a function of temperature and the inflaton field both) fail to maintain thermal equilibrium once the constant-roll condition is imposed and hence cannot produce a constant-roll WI phase.</description>

      <title>Upper Bounds on the Mass of Fundamental Fields from Primordial Universe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18435v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the fluctuations in the vacuum zero point energy associated to quantum fields and their statistical distributions during inflation. It is shown that the perturbations in the vacuum zero point energy have large amplitudes which are highly non-Gaussian. The effects of vacuum zero point fluctuations can be interpreted as the loop corrections in primordial power spectrum and bispectrum. Requiring that the primordial curvature perturbation to remain nearly Gaussian and the loop corrections to be under perturbative control impose strong upper bounds on the mass of fundamental fields during inflation. We show that the fundamental fields can not be much heavier than the Hubble scale during inflation, otherwise their vacuum zero point fluctuations induce large non-Gaussianities in primordial perturbations. Considering the observational upper bound on tensor to scalar ratio, we conclude that all fundamental fields are lighter than $10^{14}$ GeV.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06055v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We employ holography to calculate the quantum complexity of $T\bar{T}$-deformation, utilizing the complexity equals volume (CV) and the complexity equals action (CA) proposals within the bulk spacetime with a finite radius cutoff. We find that the complexity of the deformed theory differs from the renormalized complexity of the original theory by a geometric functional: the bending (Willmore) energy of the time-constant slice of the base manifold. We use this result to propose an unambiguous scheme for calculating holographic quantum complexity through the CA proposal.</description>

      <title>String Scattering and Evolution of Ryu-Takayanagi Surface</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12495v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, our aim is to illustrate that the process of open string scattering corresponds to the evolution of the entanglement wedge, where the width of the scattering cross-section is identified as the entanglement wedge cross-section. Moreover, open-closed string scattering, specifically the disk-disk interaction, works for the evolution of the reflected entanglement wedge, with the circumference of the scattering cross-section equating to the reflected entropy. It therefore provides evidence for the deep connections between the string worldsheet and the Ryu-Takayanagi surface. The validity of this result arises from the fact that the bulk dual of entanglement entropy and the string vertices both are intrinsic hyperbolic.</description>
