      <title>Aggregating Epigenetic Clocks to Study Human Capital Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Epigenetics is the study of how people's behavior and environments influence the way their genes are expressed, even though their DNA sequence is itself unchanged. By aggregating age-related epigenetic markers, epigenetic 'clocks' have become the leading tool for studying biological aging. We make an important contribution by developing a novel, integrated measure of epigenetic aging--the Multi EpiGenetic Age (MEGA) clock--which combines several existing epigenetic clocks to reduce measurement error and improve estimation efficiency. We use the MEGA clock in three empirical contexts to show that: i) accelerated epigenetic aging in adolescence is associated with worse educational, mental-health, and labor market outcomes in early adulthood; ii) exposure to child maltreatment before adolescence is associated with half a year higher epigenetic aging; and iii) that entering school one year later accelerates epigenetic aging by age seven, particularly among disadvantaged children. The MEGA clock is robust to alternative methods for constructing it, providing a flexible and interpretable approach for incorporating epigenetic data into a wide variety of settings.</description>

      <title>Are Final Market Prices Sufficient for Information Aggregation? Evidence from Last-Minute Dynamics in Parimutuel Betting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most betting market models employ static frameworks that condition decisions on final odds. Using a unique dataset of interim odds from Japanese horse racing, this study examines the validity of such static analyses by asking whether there is a systematic relationship between expected returns and the trajectory of odds. We find that returns are negatively related to last-minute changes in odds, and that these late movements attenuate the favorite-longshot bias by weakening the correlation between final odds and returns. These patterns suggest that informed bettors place wagers at the final stage based on private signals, leaving surprises in final odds.</description>

      <title>Paradoxes of the public sector productivity measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper critically investigates standard total factor productivity (TFP) measurement in the public sector, where output information is often incomplete or distorted. The analysis reveals fundamental paradoxes under three common output measurement conventions. When cost-based value added is used as the aggregate output, measured TFP may paradoxically decline as a result of genuine productivity-enhancing changes such as technical progress and improved allocative and scale efficiencies, as well as reductions in real input prices. We show that the same problems carry over to the situation where the aggregate output is constructed as the cost-share weighted index of outputs. In the case of distorted output prices, measured TFP may move independently of any productivity changes and instead reflect shifts in pricing mechanisms. Using empirical illustrations from the United Kingdom and Finland, we demonstrate that such distortions are not merely theoretical but are embedded in widely used public productivity statistics. We argue that public sector TFP measurement requires a shift away from cost-based aggregation of outputs and toward non-market valuation methods grounded in economic theory.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Artificial Intelligence as a Strategic Growth Catalyst for Small and Medium-sized Enterprises</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14532v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) has transitioned from a futuristic concept reserved for large corporations to a present-day, accessible, and essential growth lever for Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs). For entrepreneurs and business leaders, strategic AI adoption is no longer an option but an imperative for competitiveness, operational efficiency, and long-term survival. This report provides a comprehensive framework for SME leaders to navigate this technological shift, offering the foundational knowledge, business case, practical applications, and strategic guidance necessary to harness the power of AI. The quantitative evidence supporting AI adoption is compelling; 91% of SMEs using AI report that it directly boosts their revenue. Beyond top-line growth, AI drives profound operational efficiencies, with studies showing it can reduce operational costs by up to 30% and save businesses more than 20 hours of valuable time each month. This transformation is occurring within the context of a seismic economic shift; the global AI market is projected to surge from $233.46 Billion in 2024 to an astonishing $1.77 Trillion by 2032. This paper demystifies the core concepts of AI, presents a business case based on market data, details practical applications, and lays out a phased, actionable adoption strategy.</description>

      <title>Machines are more productive than humans until they aren't, and vice versa</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14057v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the growth of artificial skills, organizations may increasingly confront with the problem of optimizing skill policy decisions guided by economic principles. This paper addresses the underlying complexity of this challenge by developing an in-silico framework based on Monte Carlo simulations grounded in empirical realism to analyze the economic impact of human and machine skills, individually or jointly deployed, in the execution of tasks presenting varying levels of complexity. Our results provide quantitative support for the established notions that automation tends to be the most economically-effective strategy for tasks characterized by low-to-medium generalization difficulty, while automation may struggle to match the economic utility of human skills in more complex scenarios. Critically, our simulations highlight that combining human and machine skills can be the most effective strategy when a high level of generalization is required, but only if genuine augmentation is achieved. In contrast, when failing to realize this synergy, the human-machine policy is severely penalized by the inherent costs of its dual skill structure, causing it to destroy value and becoming the worst choice from an economic perspective. The takeaway for decision-makers is unambiguous: in contexts requiring high generalization capabilities, simply allocating human and machine skills to a task is insufficient, and a human-machine skill policy is neither a silver-bullet solution nor a low-risk compromise. Rather, it is a critical opportunity to boost competitiveness that demands a strong organizational commitment to enabling augmentation. Also, our findings show that improving the cost-effectiveness of machine skills over time, while useful, does not replace the fundamental need to focus on achieving augmentation.</description>
