      <title>A metapopulation model for the spread of cholera</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a metapopulation model of cholera describing explicitly the movement of individuals and contaminated water between locations as well as a simple vaccination mechanism. The global stability of the disease-free equilibrium point when the location-specific reproduction numbers are all less than unity is established. We then conduct some numerical investigation of the model.</description>

      <title>Educational programs and crime: a compartmental model approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17831v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a mathematical model to describe the temporal evolution of delinquent behavior, treating it as a socially transmitted phenomenon influenced by peer interactions, thus similar to an epidemic. We consider a compartmental framework involving three ordinary differential equations to describe the dynamics among the three population groups: individuals not incarcerated (susceptible), incarcerated offenders, and incarcerated offenders participating in an educational program. Transitions between the groups are governed by interaction-based mechanisms that capture the influence of peer effects in the spread of criminal behavior. The model revealed three equilibrium states: a delinquence free equilibrium, an equilibrium where no criminals attend an educational program, and a coexistence equilibrium. The basic reproduction number, $R_0$, was derived, and a sensitivity analysis revealed the key parameters that influence the system's stability. The model thus provides a quantitative basis for evaluating the effectiveness of rehabilitation strategies in correctional settings. Numerical simulations and an empirical application illustrate the qualitative properties of the model and show how parameter variations influence system behavior.</description>

      <title>A multi-season epidemic model with random genetic drift and transmissibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a model for an influenza-like disease, in which, between seasons, the virus makes a random genetic drift $\delta$, (reducing immunity by the factor $\delta$) and obtains a new random transmissibility $\tau$ (closely related to $R_0$). Given the immunity status at the start of season $k$: $\textbf{p}^{(k)}$, describing community distribution of years since last infection, and their associated immunity levels $\boldsymbol{\iota}^{(k)}$, the outcome of the epidemic season $k$, characterized by the effective reproduction number $R_e^{(k)}$ and the fractions infected in the different immunity groups $\textbf{z}^{(k)}$, is determined by the random pair $(\delta_k, \tau_k)$. It is shown that the immunity status $(\textbf{p}^{(k)}, \boldsymbol{\iota}^{(k)})$, is an ergodic Markov chain, which converges to a stationary distribution $\bar \pi (\cdot) $. More analytical progress is made for the case where immunity only lasts for one season. We then characterize the stationary distribution of $p_1^{(k)}$, being identical to $z^{(k-1)}$. Further, we also characterize the stationary distribution of $(R_e^{(k)}, z^{(k)})$, and the conditional distribution of $z^{(k)}$ given $R_e^{(k)}$. The effective reproduction number $R_e^{(k)}$ is closely related to the initial exponential growth rate $\rho^{(k)}$ of the outbreak, a quantity which can be estimated early in the epidemic season. As a consequence, this conditional distribution may be used for predicting the final size of the epidemic based on its initial growth and immunity status.</description>

      <title>Stochastic agent-based Monte Carlo simulations for reaction-diffusion models, population dynamics, and epidemic spreading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18145v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a succinct overview of the implementation of Monte Carlo algorithms based on Markovian stochastic dynamics to study interacting and reacting many-particle systems away from thermal equilibrium. Such agent-based computer simulations constitute an effective tool to introduce undergraduate and beginning graduate students to current frontier research without requiring much prior knowledge or experience: Starting from direct visualization of simulation data, students may gain immediate insight into emerging macroscopic features of a complex model system and subsequently apply more sophisticated data analysis to quantitatively characterize its often rich dynamical properties, both in stationary and transient regimes. We utilize numerical investigations of paradigmatic reaction-diffusion systems, as well as stochastic models for population dynamics and epidemic spreading, to exemplify how interdisciplinary computational research can be effectively utilized in bottom-up undergraduate and graduate education through learning by doing. In addition, we give helpful hints for the practical setup of Monte Carlo simulation algorithms, provide sample codes, explain some typical data analysis tools, and describe various potential error sources and pitfalls, with tips for avoiding them.</description>
