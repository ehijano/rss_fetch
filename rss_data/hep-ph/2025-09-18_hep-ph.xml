      <title>$D_N$-Orthogonal Freedom in the Canonical Seesaw: Flavor Invariants and Physical Non-Equivalence of F-Classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work is a companion to our previous papers showing that the data-favored $\mu$-$\tau$ modulus relation $|U_{\mu i}|=|U_{\tau i}|$ does not imply the ''minimal'' condition $R=PR^*$ and exhibiting six right-multiplications $F$ of the heavy-light block $R$ with $(RF)D_N(RF)^{T}=R D_N R^{T}$, leaving $m_\nu$ unchanged. Here we give a complete classification and basis-invariant diagnostics that distinguish inequivalent completions with the same $m_\nu$. We prove all $m_\nu$-preserving right multiplications form the $D_N$-orthogonal group $\mathcal{G}\equiv\{F\in GL(3,\mathbb{C})\mid F D_N F^{T}=D_N\}=D_N^{1/2}O(3,\mathbb{C})D_N^{-1/2}$, with $H=D_N^{-1/2}F D_N^{1/2}\in O(3,\mathbb{C})$. Although $F\in\mathcal{G}$ leaves $m_\nu$ unchanged, we construct weak-basis invariants that separate classes inside $\mathcal{G}$. Quantities built only from $h_\nu=m_\nu m_\nu^\dagger$ (e.g., $\mathrm{Tr} h_\nu$, $\mathrm{Tr} h_\nu^2$, $\det h_\nu$) are class-blind, while invariants involving the heavy-light/Dirac sectors are class-sensitive: $\mathrm{Tr}\eta$, $\mathrm{Tr}\eta^2$, the alignment $\mathrm{Tr}([\eta,h_\nu]^2)$, and a CP-odd leptogenesis invariant $\mathcal{I}^{(1)}_{\rm CP}$. We rigorously prove flavor invariance and show analytically that $\det\eta=\tfrac18\det(D\nu)\det(D_N^{-1})$ is class-independent. Using the six representatives as benchmarks, the class-sensitive invariants separate completions by orders of magnitude and may flip sign (for $\mathcal{I}^{(1)}_{\rm CP}$), while class-blind set is identical. We also analyze heavy-mass degeneracies, which enlarge $\mathcal{G}$ and suppress unflavored CP-odd traces, motivating flavored variants. Phenomenologically, this yields basis-invariant fingerprints and identifies non-unitarity, charged-lepton flavor violation, and leptogenesis as decisive probes constraining $O(3,\mathbb{C})$ sectors at fixed $(U,D_\nu,D_N)$.</description>

      <title>Coherently enhanced decoherence and cloud substructure of atom interferometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study how coherent scattering of a background gas off an atom (or other matter) interferometer can lead to enhanced signals from phase shifts and contrast loss. We focus on the inclusion of realistic features of atom interferometers such as finite temperature, cloud substructure, and time-dependent cloud radii. The inclusion of these effects, extending beyond the previously considered point-like cloud approximation, naturally allow us to study the smooth transition between the coherent and incoherent scattering regimes. We discuss how the formalism presented herein can be tested in the lab (with near-infrared photons or an eV-scale electron gun), and discuss an application for the detection of dark matter interacting via long-range forces.</description>

      <title>A new perspective on the CMSSM: Yukawa Unification, DM and the SUSY scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: What does third family ($t$-$b$-$\tau$) Yukawa unification, a typical prediction from embedding the Standard Model (SM) fermions in 16-plets of a $\mathrm{SO}(10)$ GUT, imply for the scale of the supersymmetric (SUSY) partners? Which neutralino dark matter (DM) candidate can be realized, and how large is the DM relic density? In this work, we address these questions in a simplified SUSY-breaking framework: the Constrained Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (CMSSM). To this end, we recast the parameter space of the CMSSM in a way that for all parameter points the SM-like Higgs mass is correctly reproduced. Considering fixed $\tan\beta$ and $\mathrm{sgn}(\mu)$, for every point in the $(x:=\frac{M_{1/2}}{m_0},y:=\frac{A_0}{m_0})$ parameter plane ranges for all observables are predicted. This provides a new perspective on where in parameter space different types of DM are realized, and which value of the SUSY scale is required in order to explain the observed mass of the SM Higgs boson. In our analysis we consider and compare two strategies: grid scans over the $(x,y,\tan\beta)$ parameter region and MCMC sampling. We find both techniques yield similar results. For $t$-$b$-$\tau$ unification within $5\,\%$ or $10\,\%$, we find $\mu&lt;0$, the SUSY spectrum showing a characteristic pattern, and the SUSY scale around $\mathcal{O}(10)\,\mathrm{TeV}$. The extra MSSM Higgses are the lowest lying new states at $\sim 2\div 3\,\mathrm{TeV}$ (with discovery potential at the HL-LHC), the $\mathcal{O}(10)\,\mathrm{TeV}$ stops and gluino are in reach of a possible FCC-hh, while bino DM has a mass above $2.5\,\mathrm{TeV}$, is overabundant, and effectively unobservable in planned direct and indirect detection experiments. The DM relic density requires a dilution factor of $10&lt;\mathcal{D}&lt;1000$, implying non-standard cosmology that could leave its imprints in the stochastic gravitational wave background.</description>

      <title>NNLO QCD corrections to $\gamma \gamma \rightarrow Q\bar{Q}$ from Local Unitarity combined with Coulomb resummation and NLO EW effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Local Unitarity formalism provides a constructive, integrand-level realisation of the Kinoshita-Lee-Nauenberg theorem, by combining loop and phase-space integrals appearing in scattering cross-sections in such a way that their final-state infrared singularities cancel before integration. Supplemented with localised ultraviolet renormalisation, it enables the direct Monte Carlo integration of (differential) cross sections at arbitrary perturbative order in four-dimensional spacetime. In this paper, we present its application to the Next-to-Next-to-Leading Order (NNLO) QCD cross sections for heavy-quark pair production in direct photon fusion, involving the contribution from 138 distinct forward-scattering diagrams where external photons couple only to heavy quarks. By combining NNLO QCD with Next-to-Leading Order (NLO) ElectroWeak (EW) corrections and Next-to-Leading Power (NLP) Coulomb resummation, we obtain state-of-the-art predictions for top-, bottom-, and charm-quark production in ultraperipheral hadron collisions and at $e^+ e^-$ colliders.</description>

      <title>Revisiting radiative transitions of charmonium states in covariant confined quark model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the amplitudes and branching fractions of $\chi_{cJ}$, $h_c$, $J/\psi$, and $\psi(2S)$ radiative decays in the framework of the covariant confined quark model. First, we explicitly show that all calculated amplitudes are gauge invariant. Next, we use experimental data for three decay channels $J/\psi\to \eta_c\gamma$, $\chi_{c0}\to J/\psi\gamma$, and $\psi(2S)\to \chi_{c0}\gamma$ to fit the model parameters including the charm quark mass and the meson size parameter. Finally, we use the obtained parameters to predict the branching fractions of the decays $h_c\to\eta_c\gamma$, $\chi_{c1(c2)}\to J/\psi\gamma$, and $\psi(2S)\to\chi_{c1(c2)}\gamma$. Our predictions agree well with experimental data.</description>

      <title>The Spin-Spin Dynamics of Glueballs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The masses of pure gauge glueballs are calculated with the use of relativistic string Hamiltonian without fitting parameters. The string tension $\sigma_f=0.184$~GeV$^2$ in fundamental representation is fixed, using the Necco-Sommer lattice data, and to calculate the vector coupling $\alpha_{\rm V}(r)$ the value of $\Lambda_{\overline{MS}}^0=238$~MeV ($N_f=0$) is taken. The spin-spin potential, defined via the vacuum correlation function, is shown to produce a screening effect and decrease a hyperfine splittings between tensor and scalar glueballs. The masses of first and second $0^{++}$, $2^{++}$ excitations are predicted. For the ground states the masses $M(0^{++})=1508$~MeV, $M(2^{++})=2292$~MeV (in case A), in agreement with those of $f_0(1500),~f_2(2300)$ are obtained, and the first excitation mass $M(0^{++})=2613$~MeV is predicted. In case B $M(0^{++})=1.669$~MeV, $M(2^{++})=2212$~MeV are obtained.</description>

      <title>ANATAR: AN Automated Tool for higher-order Amplitude geneRation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new Mathematica package that provides a platform to perform multi-loop computations. ANATAR integrates several existing tools designed for higher-order computations. In particular, it uses QGRAF to generate Feynman diagrams and relies on FORM to perform the Dirac and colour algebras. This makes it very efficient without compromising user-friendliness and flexibility. In addition, ANATAR is equipped with functionalities to manipulate the generated amplitudes and to extract scalar form factors. The resulting expressions can be mapped to integral families that can subsequently be reduced to master integrals via dedicated interfaces to codes for integration-by-parts reduction. Support for large classes of BSM models with the same gauge group as the SM is provided, and in particular, ANATAR is optimised for computations in effective field theories. We review and introduce the main functionalities of ANATAR and illustrate its use for phenomenological applications.</description>

      <title>Transverse momentum asymmetry in the semi-inclusive electron positron annihilation process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hadronization, a non-perturbative process, cannot be calculated from first principles. It can be investigated either by phenomenological models or by examining the behavior of produced hadrons or through fragmentation functions. These fragmentation functions are non-perturbative quantities whose determination relies entirely on experimental data. However, higher-twist fragmentation functions present significant challenges for their determination due to power suppression. In this paper, we propose an asymmetry to study twist-3 fragmentation functions. This asymmetry is defined as the transverse momentum asymmetry of the fragmenting quark and/or the produced jet with respect to the observed hadron direction within the semi-inclusive electron positron annihilation process. As a twist-3 effect, this asymmetry is sensitive to the distribution of the jet relative to the produced hadron direction during hadronization. Furthermore, it is closely related to twist-3 transverse momentum dependent fragmentation functions and provides a set of measurable quantities for their determination.</description>

      <title>Long-Lived Particles from Meson and Muon Decays at Rest at Spallation Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a systematic survey of spallation sources around the world and their potential to search for new light particles. We study the sensitivity of existing neutrino detectors to the decay in flight of light particles produced in the decay at rest of pions, muons, and kaons. At J-PARC, we show that the magnetized gaseous argon detectors of ND280 could place leading limits on light particles decaying to $e^+e^-$ and that the liquid-scintillator detectors of the J-PARC Sterile Neutrino Search at the JSNS (JSNS$^2$) experiment can exploit double- and triple-coincidence signals from $\mu^+\mu^-$ and $\pi^+\pi^-$ to place new limits on particles produced in kaon decay. We find that the Coherent Captain Mills detector at Los Alamos and the suite of COHERENT detectors at Oak Ridge, despite their smaller size, would also have a promising sensitivity to particles produced in pion and muon decays, depending on background levels. Spallation sources have the potential to explore more than an order of magnitude beyond current constraints in some new physics models, encouraging further study on data acquisition and background rejection by experimental collaborations.</description>

      <title>Thermal-nonthermal transition of the charged particle production in pp collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We determine the internal energy of charged particle production in minimum bias pp collisions using a thermostatistical approach by analyzing the $p_\text{T}$ spectrum reported by the ALICE Collaboration across LHC energies. To do this, we define temperature as the slope of the $p_\text{T}$ spectrum at low $p_\text{T}$ values and Shannon's entropy as the system's entropy, calculated considering the normalized $p_\text{T}$ spectrum. We found that the internal energy for the Hagedorn and Tricomi functions behaves linearly with temperature at low temperatures but becomes nonlinear at LHC energies, showing a thermal-nonthermal transition in the production of charged particles in pp collisions. Our estimation of the transition center of mass energy is $\sqrt{s^*}=27(11)\text{ keV}$ at baryon chemical potential $\mu_B=0$, which explains why the production of high $p_\text{T}$ hadrons has always been observed, even in earlier experiments, which may also encompass other experiments colliding e$^-$p or e$^+$e$^-$.</description>

      <title>Gluon generalized transverse momentum dependent parton distributions and Wigner functions of the Proton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a calculation of the leading-twist (twist-2) generalized transverse momentum distributions (GTMDs) for unpolarized and longitudinally polarized gluons in the proton, using a recently developed light-front gluon spectator model inspired by the soft-wall AdS/QCD prediction. We calculate the gluon GTMDs for non-zero skewness, using overlaps in terms of light-front wave functions. We also compute the gluon Wigner distributions for various polarization configurations of the proton target, including unpolarized, longitudinally polarized, and transversely polarized states. We present these Wigner distributions and the associated spin densities in both the transverse momentum plane and the transverse impact parameter plane. Furthermore, we evaluate the gluon orbital angular momentum and spin-orbit correlations, and extract the generalized parton distribution and transverse momentum-dependent distribution limits of the GTMDs.</description>

      <title>An Open System Approach to Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03103v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Several major open problems in cosmology, including the nature of inflation, dark matter, and dark energy, share a common structure: they involve spacetime-filling media with unknown microphysics, and can be probed so far only through their gravitational effects. This observation motivates a systematic open-system approach to cosmology, in which gravity evolves in the presence of a generic, unobservable environment. In this work, we develop a general framework for open gravitational dynamics based on general relativity and the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism, carefully addressing the nontrivial constraints imposed by diffeomorphism invariance. At the quantum level, our path integral formulation computes the gravitational density matrix in perturbation theory around a semi-classical spacetime.
  As illustrative applications, we study inflation and the propagation of gravitational waves in classical regimes where environmental interactions are non-negligible. In the inflationary context, our framework reproduces the known Open Effective Field Theory of Inflation in the decoupling limit and extends it to include gravitational interactions. For gravitational waves, we derive the most general conservative and dissipative corrections to propagation. Remarkably, we find that the leading-order gravitational birefringence is dissipative in nature, whereas conservative birefringence appears only at higher derivative order, opposite to the electromagnetic case. Our results pave the way to modeling dissipative effects in the late universe.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend analytic formulas for the gravitational-wave (GW) spectrum from first-order phase transitions to include cosmic expansion under the thin-wall and envelope approximations. We demonstrate that even for strongly supercooled transitions the GW amplitude is bounded from above. Moreover, the spectral shape, amplitude, and peak frequency remain largely unaffected by the details of the nucleation rate once expressed in terms of the comformal variables.</description>

      <title>Primordial black holes in Randall-Sundrum: Cosmological signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We reconsider primordial black hole physics in Randall-Sundrum Type-II universes, focusing on constraints from cosmological and astrophysical observables. We pay particular attention to scenarios that allow the entirety of dark matter to be in the form of higher-dimensional primordial black holes. This is possible for a range of AdS radii and black hole masses. Observable constraints are generally modified due to the changes in the higher-dimensional gravitational sector, and come from low-energy $e^{\pm}$ emission, microlensing, and possibly from contributions to unresolved radiation backgrounds. We discuss constraints from the cosmic microwave background due to injection of Hawking quanta into the intergalactic medium. Finally, we comment on recent discussions on the compatibility of higher-dimensional black holes and the KM3-230213A event.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear evolution of the spin-2 black hole superradiant instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13488v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Massive spin-2 fields, which arise in proposed extensions of the standard model of particle physics and general relativity, give rise to a superradiant instability around spinning black holes. We study the nonlinear evolution of this instability in quadratic gravity, where quadratic curvature terms are added to the Einstein-Hilbert action. We find that as the massive spin-2 field grows, the black hole's spin increases, accelerating the growth rate, and eventually leading to a superextremal horizon. This sharply contrasts with the spin-down and eventual saturation that occurs due to the backreaction of the superradiant instability of a minimally coupled massive spin-0 or spin-1 field.</description>

      <title>Dark matter annihilation signals from the Large Magellanic Cloud and its impact on the Milky Way</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13540v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the dark matter (DM) annihilation signals from the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and the impact of the LMC on the DM annihilation signals from the Milky Way (MW) halo, using a MW-LMC analogue from the Auriga magneto-hydrodynamical simulations. We find that the gamma-ray signals from DM annihilation from the LMC rises above the MW foreground by a factor of greater than 100 for the s-wave velocity-independent annihilation model, as well as for the Sommerfeld, p-wave, and d-wave velocity-dependent models. We derive upper limits on the annihilation cross section of DM particles in the LMC using Fermi-LAT data for all velocity-dependent cross section models. Bounds for d-wave annihilation are more stringent by $\sim 4-6$ orders of magnitude relative to previous bounds from dwarf galaxies, and for p-wave emission our bounds are $\sim 2-3$ orders of magnitude more stringent. We also demonstrate that the impact of the LMC on the DM annihilation signals from the MW halo is greatest for the p-wave and d-wave models towards the outer MW halo, while the impact is minimal for Sommerfeld and s-wave models. The LMC boosts the DM density and velocity distribution in the outer MW halo, both by bringing in high-speed DM particles and by accelerating the DM particles of the MW, affecting the DM annihilation signals from the MW for the p-wave and d-wave models.</description>

      <title>$\Delta(1232)$ production in the $\gamma p \to \phi\pi p$ reaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, the production of baryon resonances in the $\gamma p \to \phi \pi p$ reaction near threshold is investigated within an effective Lagrangian approach. incorporates intermediate resonances, including $\Delta(1232)$, $N(1440)$, $N(1520)$, and $N(1535)$, alongside non-resonant background contributions. The results indicate that the reaction is dominated by the $\Delta(1232)$ excitation near threshold. A key focus of this study is the exploration of the $a_0(980)$ meson exchange in the $\Delta(1232)$ production, as this reaction offers a unique opportunity to probe the poorly known $\Delta(1232)N a_0$ coupling. We demonstrate that the parity asymmetry ($P_\sigma$), accessible through the $\phi$-meson's spin density matrix elements, serves as a suitable experimental observable to identify the contribution from the $a_0(980)$ exchange.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.13828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the chiral symmetry breaking effects of helical magnetic fields in a simple bottom up AdS/CFT model. We explore the instability of the chirally symmetric solution in the presence of the B field and see how it switches off as the wave vector of the helix, k, rises, resulting in a first order transition. At low energies the model averages over the helix and the magnetic field is not seen. We show that other sources of chiral symmetry breaking are not directly effected by the helical B field. We provide examples of both magnetic catalysis and inverse magnetic catalysis which switch off at large k.</description>

      <title>MEC-induced two-nucleon emission in neutrino-nucleus scattering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.13915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Meson-exchange currents (MEC) play a crucial role in the nuclear response to a leptonic probe, inducing the emission of two nucleons, the so-called 2p2h excitations. Here we report the results of our recent work \cite{Belocchi:2025eix}, in which we evaluated the 2p2h contribution to the $(\nu_\mu,\mu^-p)$ neutrino cross section off a carbon target, which involves the simultaneous detection the outgoing muon and a proton in the final state. This process has recently been measured in long-baseline neutrino experiments, but no truly microscopic calculation for the 2p2h channel existed to be compared with these data until now. The calculation employs fully relativistic two-body currents and is carried out within the Relativistic Fermi Gas framework. It provides a generalization to the weak sector of the electromagnetic inclusive model developed in Ref.~\cite{DePace:2003spn} and an extension of the calculation to enable semi-inclusive predictions. A selection of our results for the semi-inclusive cross section versus the emitted proton variables is presented, both at fixed neutrino energy and folded with the T2K muon-neutrino flux.</description>

      <title>Double Slit Experiment from Nano to Femto Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13924v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The evolution of light theories began with Isaac Newton's corpuscular model, which explained reflection and refraction but could not account for diffraction and interference. In contrast, Christiaan Huygens proposed a wave theory, explaining light's behavior through an ether-based medium, supported by his principle that each point in a wavefront acts as a secondary source. This idea was experimentally supported in the early nineteenth century when Thomas Young's double-slit experiment revealed an interference pattern, affirming light's wave nature. Later, James Clerk Maxwell unified electricity and magnetism, establishing light as an electromagnetic wave and extending the electromagnetic spectrum beyond visible light. In the twentieth century, Einstein's photoelectric effect introduced the concept of wave-particle duality, demonstrating that light behaves as discrete photons. Soon after, Louis de Broglie extended the idea of wave-particle duality to matter, a prediction confirmed in 1927 when Clinton Davisson and Lester Germer observed electron diffraction from a crystal and, independently, G.P. Thomson demonstrated electron diffraction through thin films, both proving that electrons also exhibit wave-like properties. This concept was dramatically visualized by Claus Jonsson's 1961 electron double-slit experiment. Recently, the ALICE collaboration observed quantum interference patterns at the femtometer scale in ultra-relativistic nuclear collisions, pushing quantum interference studies to new frontiers.</description>

      <title>A Geometric View on Crossing-Symmetric Dispersion Relations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.14170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a general framework for constructing dispersion relations using crossing-symmetric variables, leading to infinitely many distinct representations of the 2-to-2 scattering amplitude of identical scalars. Classical formulations such as the Auberson-Khuri crossing-symmetric dispersion relations (CSDRs), the Mahoux-Roy-Wanders relations, and the local CSDR, as well as fixed-t dispersion relations emerge as special cases. Within this setting we re-derive the null constraints from a geometric perspective. Finally, we present, for the first time, an explicit extension of Roy-like equations that remain valid at arbitrarily high energies, relying only on the rigorously established analyticity domain of scattering amplitudes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.02187v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform a comprehensive analysis of baryon number violation during an electroweak phase transition (EWPT) within the framework of a scalar electroweak multiplet extension of the Standard Model. We classify the multiplet representations, topological properties, and corresponding thermal histories. Sphaleron or monopole topological field solutions emerge during the EWPT depending on the stage of the phase transition and the hypercharge of the new scalar multiplet. Furthermore, the monopole field solution pertains when the neutral component of the additional scalar multiplet is a viable dark matter candidate. We further analyze other formal considerations, including the construction of the \lq\lq sphaleron matrix\rq\rq\, for higher dimensional representations, computation of the sphaleron and monopole masses, and the choice of boundary conditions when solving the field equations of motion. We apply these considerations to the computation of sphaleron energy and monopole mass within the context of a multi-step EWPT, employing the SU(2)$_L$ septuplet scalar extension to the Standard Model (SM) as a case of study from the minimal dark matter paradigm. For the first step of a two-step EWPT, we delineate the relationship between the monopole mass and the parameters relevant to dark matter phenomenology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08896v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Collective neutrino flavor instabilities are believed to be prevalent in core-collapse supernovae and neutron star mergers. This work establishes two points related to instability, both in the spirit of developing a more fundamental understanding of collective flavor dynamics. First, a conservation law related to lepton number implies that spectral crossings are necessary for instability. Second, the most permissive application of the ergodic hypothesis to neutrino flavor evolution implies that spectral crossings are in fact sufficient for instability. We also discuss flavor thermalization and energy conservation in relation to ergodicity.</description>

      <title>The influence of the scalar unparticle and polarization on the exclusive W boson hadronic decays in the final state at muon colliders in the Randall-Sundrum model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10025v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An attempt is made to present the effect of unparticle physics and polarization on the exclusive decays of W boson at high energy colliders in the Randall-Sundrum (RS) model. By using Feynman diagram techniques we have evaluated the influence of the scalar unparticle and polarization on the exclusive W boson hadronic decays of $W^{\pm} \rightarrow \pi^{\pm}\gamma$, $W^{\pm} \rightarrow K^{\pm}\gamma$ and $W^{\pm} \rightarrow \rho^{\pm}\gamma$ at the high energy muon colliders in the RS model. The result shows that with fixed collision energies, the total cross-section for hadronic productions in the final state depends strongly on the parameters of the unparticle physics and muon beam polarizes. With a center-of-mass energy of 10 TeV, the total cross-sections achieve the maximum value when the benchmark background as $(\Lambda_{U}, d_{U})$ $= (1 TeV, 1.9)$ and the polarization coefficient as $(P_{\mu^{-}}, P_{\mu^{+}} )= (1,1)$. The numerical evaluation for the statistical significance is given in detail which indicates that the effect can be detected in the future experiments with moderately high energy colliders.</description>

Abstract: Measurements from the LHCb experiment and $B$ factories have revealed several discrepancies in angular observables of rare semileptonic $B$ decays involving the quark-level transition $b \to s \ell^+ \ell^-$. In this work, we conduct a model-independent comparative analysis of the rare semileptonic decays of baryons $\Lambda_b$, $\Sigma_b$ and $\Xi_b$, exploring various new physics scenarios. Our analysis includes predictions for branching ratios and angular observables, including forward-backward asymmetry, longitudinal polarization fractions, and lepton flavor universality ratios, both within the Standard Model and across six distinct new physics scenarios. Notably, we find that certain new physics scenarios significantly affect the observables in the $(\Lambda_b, \Sigma_b, \Xi_b) \to (\Lambda, \Sigma, \Xi) \mu^+ \mu^-$ processes.</description>

Abstract: We present a tool to compute the sensitivity of the Future Circular Electron--Positron Collider (FCC-ee) to the interactions of new, heavy particles via publicly available extensions to the smelli and flavio computer programs. We parameterize new particles' effects without any flavor assumptions and take into account the projected experimental and correlated theoretical uncertainties of various electroweak and Higgs observables at the proposed collider. We illustrate a use of the tool by estimating the sensitivity of the FCC-ee to a $Z^\prime$ model with flavor-specific couplings which explains anomalies inferred from present-day measurements and Standard Model predictions of observables that involve the $b \rightarrow s \ell^+ \ell^-$ transition.</description>

      <title>Production of Dark Photons through Higher Electromagnetic Moments at LDMX: Simulations and Model Discrimination</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13635v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend the projected sensitivity of LDMX for sub-GeV dark matter (DM) to the case of dark photons produced through higher order electromagnetic moments. These moments arise from loop diagrams involving portal matter fields, along with the gauge fields of new symmetry groups. Due to the Lorentz structures, in particular the momentum dependence, of these additional interactions, the kinematic distributions expected at missing momentum/energy experiments vary with model in addition to dark photon mass. By considering four additional types of interactions -- magnetic and electric dipole, charge radius, and anapole moment -- we show that LDMX Phase-II is expected to probe the relic target of these additional dark photon models. We compare the analytic with the numerical methods for calculating the dark bremsstrahlung cross section, and compute the kinematic distributions for each model. The potential for model discrimination in the scenario of non-zero signal events at LDMX is discussed. We find that there is a degeneracy between the dark photon mass and model, which can be partially broken by considering both the energy and the transverse momentum of the recoil electron.</description>

We find that both freeze-in and thermal freeze-out through a symmetric tensor mediator can create scalar dark matter. The required tensor masses for freeze-in are much larger than for freeze-out for the same dark-matter mass, in agreement with the nonthermalization assumption in freeze-in scenarios.</description>

      <title>Shedding light on the nature of $\phi(2170)$ state in the $e^+e^- \to \phi \pi^+\pi^-$ reaction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.12552v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the production of $\phi(2170)$ state in the $e^+e^- \to \phi \pi^+\pi^-$ reaction with the effective Lagrangian approach. In addition to the tree level contributions from the $\phi(1680)$ meson and a possible X(1750) state, we consider also the $K_1$-$K$-$\bar{K}$ intermediate state process from the perspective of triangular singularity. Based on the one-photon exchange approximation, a pair of $K_1 \bar{K}$ mesons was firstly produced, and then the $K_1$ meson subsequently decays into $\phi$ and $K$, and the $K\bar{K}$ pair produce the $\pi^+ \pi^-$ through the final state interactions, in which the scalar meson $f_0(980)$ is dynamically generated. We show that the inclusion of the triangle loop diagrams leads to a good description of the new BESIII measurements, especially for the structure of $\phi(2170)$. This provides a novel interpretation of the $\phi(2170)$ state, offering new insights into its fundamental nature which is still unclear. Furthermore, it is found that these measurements on the $e^+e^- \to \phi \pi^+\pi^-$ reaction can be used to determine some of the properties of two $K_1$ mesons with masses around 1610 MeV and 1895 MeV, which are crucial to reproduce the experimental data.</description>

      <title>On the structure of the large-$N$ expansion in SU($N$) Yang-Mills theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09312v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, we have computed the short-distance asymptotics of the generating functional of Euclidean correlators of single-trace twist-$2$ operators in the large-$N$ expansion of SU($N$) Yang-Mills (YM) theory to the leading-nonplanar order. Remarkably, it has the structure of the logarithm of a functional determinant, but with the sign opposite to the one that would follow from the spin-statistics theorem for the glueballs. In order to solve this sign puzzle, we have reconsidered the proof in the literature that in the 't Hooft topological expansion of large-$N$ YM theory the leading-nonplanar contribution to the generating functional consists of the sum over punctures of $n$-punctured tori. We have discovered that for twist-$2$ operators it contains -- in addition to the $n$-punctured tori -- the normalization of tori with $1 \leq p \leq n$ pinches and $n-p$ punctures. Once the existence of the new sector is taken into account, the violation of the spin-statistics theorem disappears. Moreover, the new sector contributes trivially to the nonperturbative $S$ matrix because -- for example -- the $n$-pinched torus represents nonperturbatively a loop of $n$ glueball propagators with no external leg. This opens the way for an exact solution limited to the new sector that may be solvable thanks to the vanishing $S$ matrix.</description>

      <title>Extracting the Speed of Sound in Heavy-Ion Collisions: A Study of Quantum-Initiated Fluctuations and Thermalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02777v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The thermalization of quark-gluon plasma created in heavy-ion collisions is crucial for understanding its behavior as a relativistic fluid and the thermodynamic properties of the Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). This study investigates the role of fluctuations in the relationship between transverse momentum and particle multiplicity, with a particular focus on their impact on extracting the QCD speed of sound. In a thermalized quark-gluon plasma, these fluctuations mostly originate from quantum fluctuations in the colliding nuclei, and exhibit a Gaussian distribution as a consequence of their independence from thermodynamic response. In contrast, non-thermalized systems display non-Gaussian fluctuations, reflecting the breakdown of thermalization. By leveraging the Gaussianity condition of quantum-initiated fluctuations, the physical value of the speed of sound can be extracted statistically, even in the presence of significant event-by-event fluctuations. This framework provides a robust diagnostic tool for probing thermalization and extracting thermodynamic properties in both large and small collision systems.</description>

      <title>On the Analysis Dependence of DESI Dynamical Dark Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19029v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We continue scientific scrutiny of the DESI dynamical dark energy (DE) claim by explicitly demonstrating that the result depends on the analysis pipeline. Concretely, we define a likelihood that converts the $w_0 w_a$CDM model back into the (flat) $\Lambda$CDM model, which we fit to DESI constraints on the $\Lambda$CDM model from DR1 Full-Shape (FS) modelling and BAO. We further incorporate CMB constraints. Throughout, we find that $w_0$ and $w_a$ are within $1 \sigma$ of the $\Lambda$CDM model. Our work makes it explicit that, in contrast to DR1 and DR2 BAO, there is no dynamical DE signal in FS modelling, even when combined with BAO and CMB. Moreover, one confirms late-time accelerated expansion today $(q_0 &lt; 0)$ at $ \gtrsim 3.4 \sigma$ in FS modelling + BAO. On the contrary, DR1 and DR2 BAO fail to confirm $q_0 &lt; 0$ under similar assumptions. Our analysis highlights the fact that trustable scientific results should be independent of the analysis pipeline.</description>

      <title>Testing strong-field QED with the avalanche precursor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02832v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A two-beam high-power laser facility is essential for the study of one of the most captivating phenomena predicted by strong-field quantum electrodynamics (QED) and yet unobserved experimentally: the avalanche-type cascade. In such a cascade, the energy of intense laser light can be efficiently transformed into high-energy radiation and electron-positron pairs. The future 50-petawatt-scale laser facility NSF OPAL will provide unique opportunities for studying such strong-field QED effects, as it is designed to deliver two ultra-intense, tightly focused laser pulses onto the interaction point. In this work, we investigate the potential of such a facility for studying elementary particle and plasma dynamics deeply in the quantum radiation-dominated regime, and the generation of QED avalanches. With 3D particle-in-cell simulations, we demonstrate that QED avalanche precursors can be reliably triggered under realistic laser parameters and layout (namely, focusing $f/2$, tilted optical axes, and non-ideal co-pointing) with the anticipated capabilities of NSF OPAL. We demonstrate that seed electrons can be efficiently injected into the laser focus by using targets of three types: a gas of heavy atoms, an overcritical plasma, and a thin foil. A strong positron and high-energy photon signal is generated in all cases. The cascade properties can be identified from the final particle distributions, which have a clear directional pattern. At increasing laser field intensity, such distributions provide signatures of the transition, first, to the radiation-dominated interaction regime, and then to a QED avalanche. Our findings can also be used for designing related future experiments.</description>

      <title>Supersymmetric Horizons at the Edge of Effective Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18107v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: What if supersymmetry is not something to be hidden, but something to be reached?
  We introduce the Supersymmetric Horizon Stabilization (SHS): a conceptually unified and analytically controlled framework for embedding metastable de Sitter vacua and trans-Planckian inflation within effective $\mathcal{N}=1$ supergravity. Built from a logarithmic K\"ahler potential modified by nilpotent constraints, SHS yields a framework that connects the early universe's inflationary phase, intermediate metastable acceleration, and a final supersymmetric fixed point.
  We classify viable models by enforcing four essential criteria: absence of ghosts, de Sitter metastability, smooth Minkowski transitions, and asymptotic supersymmetry. The resulting scalar dynamics exhibit exponential field-space profiles, $\tau(\varphi) \sim e^{-\Delta\varphi}$, allowing trans-Planckian excursions with bounded moduli. This structure leads to finite geodesic distance and a stabilized gravitino mass, conditionally avoiding towers of light states and remaining consistent with the Gravitino and Swampland Distance Conjectures. At the same time, the divergent Euclidean cost of reaching the supersymmetric endpoint realizes the AdS and Generalized Swampland Distance Conjectures, situating the infrared boundary at infinite dynamical distance.
  From this behavior emerges the Supersymmetric Horizon Conjecture: that consistent gravitational EFTs may begin and end with supersymmetry -- both at the origin and the asymptotic edge of cosmic evolution -- not as a fine-tuned remnant, but as a geometric boundary condition. SHS also supports localized features that transiently enhance scalar fluctuations, enabling efficient production of primordial black holes with masses far exceeding those in conventional inflationary scenarios.</description>

      <title>Stability of universal properties against perturbations of the Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18561v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We numerically investigate the stability of universal properties at continuous phase transitions against perturbations of the Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm used to simulate the system. We consider the three dimensional XY model as test bed, and both local (single site Metropolis) and global (single cluster) updates, introducing deterministic truncation-like perturbations and stochastic perturbations in the acceptance probabilities. In (almost) all the cases we find a remarkable stability of the universal properties, even against large perturbations of the Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm, with critical exponents and scaling curves consistent with those of the standard XY model within statistical uncertainties. Only for the single cluster update with very large truncation error does something different happen, but large scaling corrections prevent us from precisely assessing the critical properties of the transition, and, in particular, to understand whether the critical behavior observed corresponds to a known universality class.</description>

      <title>Superradiant Axionic Black-Hole Clouds as Seeds for Graviton Squeezing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01689v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is shown that both, standard general relativity (GR) and Chern-Simons (CS) gravity, the latter containing chiral gravitational anomaly terms, seed the production of pairs of entangled gravitons in a multi-mode squeezed state. This involves the interaction of gravitons with the axionic cloud surrounding a superradiant Kerr (rotating) black hole background. The order of magnitude of the squeezing effect, specifically the number of graviton excitations in the squeezed vacuum, is estimated in the non-relativistic limit, relevant for the superradiance process. It is found analytically that the squeezing from the GR process of annihilation of two axions into two gravitons, dominates, by many orders of magnitude, that coming from the axion decay into two gravitons, induced by the higher-derivative CS term. It is also shown that significant squeezing effects are produced in the case of long-lived axionic clouds, whose lifetimes are much longer than the timescale for which superradiance is effective.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Wavelength Survey of Transient Lensing Opportunities for Primordial Black Hole Searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06688v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational lensing of short astrophysical transients provides a uniquely direct avenue for searching for primordial black holes (PBHs) across a vast range of masses. While past search efforts have focused on particular source classes-such as fast radio bursts (FRBs) and gamma-ray burst spikes-no systematic, multi-wavelength assessment has compared their relative potential for PBH discovery. We present here a broad assessment of transient lensing search opportunities, spanning more than twenty decades in photon frequency and over twelve orders of magnitude in PBH mass. For each class, we determine the accessible PBH mass window by accounting for wave-optics suppression and time-delay resolution limits, and we estimate potential sensitivities to the PBH abundance using representative event rates, distances, and optical depths. Our survey includes low-frequency radio events (FRBs, pulsar giant pulses, planetary cyclotron bursts), optical/infrared signals, and high-energy phenomena (gamma-ray burst spikes, fast X-ray transients, TeV blazar flares). We synthesize these results in a unified mass-abundance diagram and comprehensive tables summarizing both physical reach and observational requirements. This work serves as a roadmap for optimizing future multi-wavelength lensing searches, guiding the design of instruments and strategies to explore the PBH dark matter hypothesis across its remaining viable parameter space.</description>

      <title>Disentangling the Origins of the NANOGrav Signal: Early Universe Models and $\Delta N_{eff}$ Bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15134v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate whether an Early-Universe stochastic gravitational-wave background (SGWB) can account for the common spectrum process reported by NANOGrav, while also being consistent with current and projected CMB measurements of extra radiation. We compute the contribution of effective number of relativistic species, $\Delta N_{eff}$, for a number of Early-Universe models proposed to explain the pulsar timing array (PTA) spectrum. We demonstrate that models predicting $\Delta N_{eff}$ above the CMB limit would be firmly excluded, implying that the NANOGrav signal in tension with these bounds must instead arise from astrophysical sources. We find that current NANOGrav 15-year dataset, sensitive up to 60 nHz, gives a negligible contribution to $\Delta N_{eff}$ and remains well below the present and future CMB detection threshold. However, when we project future PTA capabilities reaching upto 1 $\mu$Hz, even with our conservative estimate we find that Inflation, Scalar Induced Gravitational Waves (SIGW), and metastable cosmic strings can induce a $\Delta N_{eff}$ large enough for $&gt;3.5\sigma$ detection by the Simons Observatory.</description>

      <title>QCD Effective Lagrangian and Condensation of Chromomagnetic Flux Tubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11375v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vacuum polarisation effects induced by the sourceless solutions of the Yang-Mills equation are investigated. These solutions represent oppositely oriented chromomagnetic flux tubes permeating the space in all directions. We review and prove the gauge invariance of the effective Lagrangian on sourceless gauge fields and present a number of alternative methods allowing to compute the effective Lagrangian. We compute the effective Lagrangian on chromomagnetic flux tube solutions and demonstrate that the effective Lagrangian has a universal form that supports the stability of the chromomagnetic flux tubes condensation and indicates that the Yang-Mills vacuum state is highly degenerate. The stability is a result of the quartic nonlinear self-interaction of the negative mode completely eliminating the instability and the imaginary term from the effective Lagrangian in chromomagnetic field. It is suggested that the condensate of chromomagnetic flux tubes represents a dual analog of the Cooper pairs condensate in a superconductor.</description>
