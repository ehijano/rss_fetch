      <title>Research on Adverse Drug Reaction Prediction Model Combining Knowledge Graph Embedding and Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In clinical treatment, identifying potential adverse reactions of drugs can help assist doctors in making medication decisions. In response to the problems in previous studies that features are high-dimensional and sparse, independent prediction models need to be constructed for each adverse reaction of drugs, and the prediction accuracy is low, this paper develops an adverse drug reaction prediction model based on knowledge graph embedding and deep learning, which can predict experimental results. Unified prediction of adverse drug reactions covered. Knowledge graph embedding technology can fuse the associated information between drugs and alleviate the shortcomings of high-dimensional sparsity in feature matrices, and the efficient training capabilities of deep learning can improve the prediction accuracy of the model. This article builds an adverse drug reaction knowledge graph based on drug feature data; by analyzing the embedding effect of the knowledge graph under different embedding strategies, the best embedding strategy is selected to obtain sample vectors; and then a convolutional neural network model is constructed to predict adverse reactions. The results show that under the DistMult embedding model and 400-dimensional embedding strategy, the convolutional neural network model has the best prediction effect; the average accuracy, F_1 score, recall rate and area under the curve of repeated experiments are better than the methods reported in the literature. The obtained prediction model has good prediction accuracy and stability, and can provide an effective reference for later safe medication guidance.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Models for the Identification of Cardiovascular Diseases Using UK Biobank Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning models have the potential to identify cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) early and accurately in primary healthcare settings, which is crucial for delivering timely treatment and management. Although population-based CVD risk models have been used traditionally, these models often do not consider variations in lifestyles, socioeconomic conditions, or genetic predispositions. Therefore, we aimed to develop machine learning models for CVD detection using primary healthcare data, compare the performance of different models, and identify the best models. We used data from the UK Biobank study, which included over 500,000 middle-aged participants from different primary healthcare centers in the UK. Data collected at baseline (2006--2010) and during imaging visits after 2014 were used in this study. Baseline characteristics, including sex, age, and the Townsend Deprivation Index, were included. Participants were classified as having CVD if they reported at least one of the following conditions: heart attack, angina, stroke, or high blood pressure. Cardiac imaging data such as electrocardiogram and echocardiography data, including left ventricular size and function, cardiac output, and stroke volume, were also used. We used 9 machine learning models (LSVM, RBFSVM, GP, DT, RF, NN, AdaBoost, NB, and QDA), which are explainable and easily interpretable. We reported the accuracy, precision, recall, and F-1 scores; confusion matrices; and area under the curve (AUC) curves.</description>

      <title>Chemistry-informed Machine Learning Explains Calcium-binding Proteins Fuzzy Shape for Communicating Changes in the Atomic States of Calcium Ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Proteins' fuzziness are features for communicating changes in cell signaling instigated by binding with secondary messengers, such as calcium ions, associated with the coordination of muscle contraction, neurotransmitter release, and gene expression. Binding with the disordered parts of a protein, calcium ions must balance their charge states with the shape of calcium-binding proteins and their versatile pool of partners depending on the circumstances they transmit, but it is unclear whether the limited experimental data available can be used to train models to accurately predict the charges of calcium-binding protein variants. Here, we developed a chemistry-informed, machine-learning algorithm that implements a game theoretic approach to explain the output of a machine-learning model without the prerequisite of an excessively large database for high-performance prediction of atomic charges. We used the ab initio electronic structure data representing calcium ions and the structures of the disordered segments of calcium-binding peptides with surrounding water molecules to train several explainable models. Network theory was used to extract the topological features of atomic interactions in the structurally complex data dictated by the coordination chemistry of a calcium ion, a potent indicator of its charge state in protein. With our designs, we provided a framework of explainable machine learning model to annotate atomic charges of calcium ions in calcium-binding proteins with domain knowledge in response to the chemical changes in an environment based on the limited size of scientific data in a genome space.</description>

      <title>Optimization of breeding program design through stochastic simulation with evolutionary algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effective planning and allocation of resources in modern breeding programs is a complex task. Breeding program design and operational management have a major impact on the success of a breeding program and changing parameters such as the number of selected/phenotyped/genotyped individuals will impact genetic gain, genetic diversity, and costs. As a result, careful assessment and balancing of design parameters is crucial, considering the trade-offs between different breeding goals and associated costs. In a previous study, we optimized the resource allocation strategy in a dairy cattle breeding scheme via the combination of stochastic simulations and kernel regression, aiming to maximize a target function containing genetic gain and the inbreeding rate under a given budget. However, the high number of simulations required when using the proposed kernel regression method to optimize a breeding program with many parameters weakens the effectiveness of such a method. In this work, we are proposing an optimization framework that builds on the concepts of kernel regression but additionally makes use of an evolutionary algorithm to allow for a more effective and general optimization. The key idea is to consider a set of potential parameterizations of the breeding program, evaluate their performance based on stochastic simulations, and use these outputs to derive new parametrization to test in an iterative procedure. The evolutionary algorithm was implemented in a Snakemake pipeline to allow for efficient scaling on large distributed computing platforms. The algorithm achieved convergence to the same optimum with a massively reduced number of simulations. Thereby, the incorporation of class variables and accounting for a higher number of parameters in the optimization pipeline leads to substantially reduced computing time and better scaling for the desired optimization of a breeding program.</description>

      <title>A study of animal action segmentation algorithms across supervised, unsupervised, and semi-supervised learning paradigms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Action segmentation of behavioral videos is the process of labeling each frame as belonging to one or more discrete classes, and is a crucial component of many studies that investigate animal behavior. A wide range of algorithms exist to automatically parse discrete animal behavior, encompassing supervised, unsupervised, and semi-supervised learning paradigms. These algorithms -- which include tree-based models, deep neural networks, and graphical models -- differ widely in their structure and assumptions on the data. Using four datasets spanning multiple species -- fly, mouse, and human -- we systematically study how the outputs of these various algorithms align with manually annotated behaviors of interest. Along the way, we introduce a semi-supervised action segmentation model that bridges the gap between supervised deep neural networks and unsupervised graphical models. We find that fully supervised temporal convolutional networks with the addition of temporal information in the observations perform the best on our supervised metrics across all datasets.</description>

      <title>2D and 3D Deep Learning Models for MRI-based Parkinson's Disease Classification: A Comparative Analysis of Convolutional Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks, Convolutional Neural Networks, and Graph Convolutional Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Early and accurate diagnosis of Parkinson's Disease (PD) remains challenging. This study compares deep learning architectures for MRI-based PD classification, introducing the first three-dimensional (3D) implementation of Convolutional Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (ConvKANs), a new approach that combines convolution layers with adaptive, spline-based activations. We evaluated Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), ConvKANs, and Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) using three open-source datasets; a total of 142 participants (75 with PD and 67 age-matched healthy controls). For 2D analysis, we extracted 100 axial slices centred on the midbrain from each T1-weighted scan. For 3D analysis, we used the entire volumetric scans. ConvKANs integrate learnable B-spline functions with convolutional layers. GCNs represent MRI data as graphs, theoretically capturing structural relationships that may be overlooked by traditional approaches. Interpretability visualizations, including the first ConvKAN spline activation maps, and projections of graph node embeddings, were depicted. ConvKANs demonstrated high performance across datasets and dimensionalities, achieving the highest 2D AUROC (0.98) in one dataset and matching CNN peak 3D performance (1.00). CNN models performed well, while GCN models improved in 3D analyses, reaching up to 0.97 AUROC. 3D implementations yielded higher AUROC values compared to 2D counterparts across all models. ConvKAN implementation shows promise for MRI analysis in PD classification, particularly in the context of early diagnosis. The improvement in 3D analyses highlights the value of volumetric data in capturing subtle PD-related changes. While MRI is not currently used for PD diagnosis, these findings suggest its potential as a component of a multimodal diagnostic approach, especially for early detection.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Machine Learning Classification of Parkinsonian Disorders using Saccadic Eye Movements: A Development and Validation Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16063v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Discriminating between Parkinson's Disease (PD) and Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP) is difficult due to overlapping symptoms, especially early on. Saccades (rapid conjugate eye movements between fixation points) are affected by both diseases but conventional saccade analyses exhibit group level differences only. We hypothesized analyzing entire saccade raw time series waveforms would permit superior individual level discrimination between PD, PSP, and healthy controls (HC). 13,309 saccadic eye movements from 127 participants were analyzed using a novel, calibration-free waveform analysis and hierarchical machine learning framework. Individual saccades were classified based on which trained model could reconstruct each waveform with minimum error, indicating the most likely condition. A hierarchical classifier then predicted overall status (recently diagnosed and medication-naive 'de novo' PD, 'established' PD on antiparkinsonian medication, PSP, and healthy controls) by combining each participant's saccade results. This approach substantially outperformed conventional metrics, achieving high AUROCs distinguishing de novo PD from PSP (0.92-0.97), de novo PD from HC (0.72-0.89), and PSP from HC (0.90-0.95), while the conventional model showed limited performance (AUROC range: 0.45-0.75). This calibration-free waveform analysis sets a new standard for precise saccadic classification of PD, PSP, and HC, increasing potential for clinical adoption, remote monitoring, and screening.</description>

      <title>Learning a Patent-Informed Biomedical Knowledge Graph Reveals Technological Potential of Drug Repositioning Candidates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.03227v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Drug repositioning-a promising strategy for discovering new therapeutic uses for existing drugs-has been increasingly explored in the computational science literature using biomedical databases. However, the technological potential of drug repositioning candidates has often been overlooked. This study presents a novel protocol to comprehensively analyse various sources such as pharmaceutical patents and biomedical databases, and identify drug repositioning candidates with both technological potential and scientific evidence. To this end, first, we constructed a scientific biomedical knowledge graph (s-BKG) comprising relationships between drugs, diseases, and genes derived from biomedical databases. Our protocol involves identifying drugs that exhibit limited association with the target disease but are closely located in the s-BKG, as potential drug candidates. We constructed a patent-informed biomedical knowledge graph (p-BKG) by adding pharmaceutical patent information. Finally, we developed a graph embedding protocol to ascertain the structure of the p-BKG, thereby calculating the relevance scores of those candidates with target disease-related patents to evaluate their technological potential. Our case study on Alzheimer's disease demonstrates its efficacy and feasibility, while the quantitative outcomes and systematic methods are expected to bridge the gap between computational discoveries and successful market applications in drug repositioning research.</description>

      <title>SMDP: SARS-CoV-2 Mutation Distribution Profiler for rapid estimation of mutational histories of unusual lineages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11201v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: SARS-CoV-2 usually evolves at a relatively constant rate over time. Occasionally, however, lineages arise with higher-than-expected numbers of mutations given the date of sampling. Such lineages can arise for a variety of reasons, including selection pressures imposed by evolution during a chronic infection or exposure to mutation-inducing drugs like molnupiravir. We have developed an open-source web-based application (SMDP: SARS-CoV-2 Mutation Distribution Profiler; https://eringill.shinyapps.io/covid_mutation_distributions) that compares a list of user-submitted lineage-defining mutations with established mutation distributions including those observed during (1) the first nine months of the pandemic, (2) during the global transmission of Omicron, (3) during the chronic infection of immunocompromised patients, and (4) during zoonotic spillover from humans to deer. The application calculates the most likely distribution for the user's mutation list and displays log likelihoods for all distributions. In addition, the transition:transversion ratio of the user's list is calculated to determine whether there is evidence of exposure to a mutation-inducing drug such as molnupiravir and indicates whether the list contains mutations in the proofreading domain of nsp14 which could lead to a higher-than-expected mutation rate in the lineage. This tool will be useful for public health and researchers seeking to rapidly infer evolutionary histories of SARS-CoV-2 variants, which can aid risk assessment and public health responses.</description>
