      <title>Surface elevation errors in finite element Stokes models for glacier evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The primary data which determine the evolution of glaciation are the bedrock elevation and the surface mass balance. From this data, which we assume is defined over a fixed land region, the glacier's geometry solves a free-boundary problem which balances the surface velocity from the Stokes flow with the surface mass balance. A surface elevation function for this problem is admissible if it is above the bedrock topography, equivalently if the ice thickness is nonnegative. For an implicit time step, this free-boundary problem can be posed in weak form as a variational inequality. After some preparatory theory for the glaciological Stokes problem, we conjecture that the continuous-space, implicit time step problem for the surface elevation is well-posed. This conjecture is supported both by physical arguments and numerical evidence. We then prove a general theorem which bounds the error made by a finite element approximation of a nonlinear variational inequality in a Banach space. The bound is a sum of error terms of different types which are special to variational inequalities. In the case of the implicit-step glacier problem these terms are of three types: errors from discretizing the bed elevation, errors from numerically solving for the Stokes velocity, and finally an expected quasi-optimal finite element error in the surface elevation itself.</description>

      <title>Optimized filter functions for filtered back projection reconstructions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The method of filtered back projection (FBP) is a widely used reconstruction technique in X-ray computerized tomography (CT), which is particularly important in clinical diagnostics. To reduce scanning times and radiation doses in medical CT settings, enhancing the reconstruction quality of the FBP method is essential. To this end, this paper focuses on analytically optimizing the applied filter function. We derive a formula for the filter that minimizes the expected squared $\mathrm{L}^2$-norm of the difference between the FBP reconstruction, given infinite noisy measurement data, and the true target function. Additionally, we adapt our derived filter to the case of finitely many measurements. The resulting filter functions have a closed-form representation, do not require a training dataset, and, thus, provide an easy-to-implement, out-of-the-box solution. Our theoretical findings are supported by numerical experiments based on both simulated and real CT data.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel methodology for constructing arbitrarily high-order structure-preserving methods tailored for damped Hamiltonian systems. This method combines the idea of exponential integrator and energy-preserving collocation methods, effectively preserving the energy dissipation ratio introduced by the damping terms. We demonstrate the conservative properties of these methods and confirm their order of accuracy through numerical experiments involving the damped Burger's equation and Korteweg-de-Vries equation.</description>

      <title>Gaussian mixture Taylor approximations of risk measures constrained by PDEs with Gaussian random field inputs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work considers the computation of risk measures for quantities of interest governed by PDEs with Gaussian random field parameters using Taylor approximations. While efficient, Taylor approximations are local to the point of expansion, and hence may degrade in accuracy when the variances of the input parameters are large. To address this challenge, we approximate the underlying Gaussian measure by a mixture of Gaussians with reduced variance in a dominant direction of parameter space. Taylor approximations are constructed at the means of each Gaussian mixture component, which are then combined to approximate the risk measures. The formulation is presented in the setting of infinite-dimensional Gaussian random parameters for risk measures including the mean, variance, and conditional value-at-risk. We also provide detailed analysis of the approximations errors arising from two sources: the Gaussian mixture approximation and the Taylor approximations. Numerical experiments are conducted for a semilinear advection-diffusion-reaction equation with a random diffusion coefficient field and for the Helmholtz equation with a random wave speed field. For these examples, the proposed approximation strategy can achieve less than $1\%$ relative error in estimating CVaR with only $\mathcal{O}(10)$ state PDE solves, which is comparable to a standard Monte Carlo estimate with $\mathcal{O}(10^4)$ samples, thus achieving significant reduction in computational cost. The proposed method can therefore serve as a way to rapidly and accurately estimate risk measures under limited computational budgets.</description>

      <title>Strang splitting structure-preserving high-order compact difference schemes for nonlinear convection diffusion equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a class of high-order and efficient compact difference schemes for nonlinear convection diffusion equations, which can preserve both bounds and mass. For the one-dimensional problem, we first introduce a high-order compact Strang splitting scheme (denoted as HOC-Splitting), which is fourth-order accurate in space and second-order accurate in time. Then, by incorporating the Lagrange multiplier approach with the HOC-Splitting scheme, we construct two additional bound-preserving or/and mass-conservative HOC-Splitting schemes that do not require excessive computational cost and can automatically ensure the uniform bounds of the numerical solution. These schemes combined with an alternating direction implicit (ADI) method are generalized to the two-dimensional problem, which further enhance the computational efficiency for large-scale modeling and simulation. Besides, we present an optimal-order error estimate for the bound-preserving ADI scheme in the discrete $L_2$ norm. Finally, ample numerical examples are presented to verify the theoretical results and demonstrate the accuracy, efficiency, and effectiveness in preserving bounds or/and mass of the proposed schemes.</description>

      <title>Quasi-Monte Carlo Beyond Hardy-Krause</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06475v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The classical approaches to numerically integrating a function $f$ are Monte Carlo (MC) and quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) methods. MC methods use random samples to evaluate $f$ and have error $O(\sigma(f)/\sqrt{n})$, where $\sigma(f)$ is the standard deviation of $f$. QMC methods are based on evaluating $f$ at explicit point sets with low discrepancy, and as given by the classical Koksma-Hlawka inequality, they have error $\widetilde{O}(\sigma_{\mathsf{HK}}(f)/n)$, where $\sigma_{\mathsf{HK}}(f)$ is the variation of $f$ in the sense of Hardy and Krause. These two methods have distinctive advantages and shortcomings, and a fundamental question is to find a method that combines the advantages of both.
  In this work, we give a simple randomized algorithm that produces QMC point sets with the following desirable features: (1) It achieves substantially better error than given by the classical Koksma-Hlawka inequality. In particular, it has error $\widetilde{O}(\sigma_{\mathsf{SO}}(f)/n)$, where $\sigma_{\mathsf{SO}}(f)$ is a new measure of variation that we introduce, which is substantially smaller than the Hardy-Krause variation. (2) The algorithm only requires random samples from the underlying distribution, which makes it as flexible as MC. (3) It automatically achieves the best of both MC and QMC (and the above improvement over Hardy-Krause variation) in an optimal way. (4) The algorithm is extremely efficient, with an amortized $\widetilde{O}(1)$ runtime per sample.
  Our method is based on the classical transference principle in geometric discrepancy, combined with recent algorithmic innovations in combinatorial discrepancy that besides producing low-discrepancy colorings, also guarantee certain subgaussian properties. This allows us to bypass several limitations of previous works in bridging the gap between MC and QMC methods and go beyond the Hardy-Krause variation.</description>

      <title>Operator Learning Using Random Features: A Tool for Scientific Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Supervised operator learning centers on the use of training data, in the form of input-output pairs, to estimate maps between infinite-dimensional spaces. It is emerging as a powerful tool to complement traditional scientific computing, which may often be framed in terms of operators mapping between spaces of functions. Building on the classical random features methodology for scalar regression, this paper introduces the function-valued random features method. This leads to a supervised operator learning architecture that is practical for nonlinear problems yet is structured enough to facilitate efficient training through the optimization of a convex, quadratic cost. Due to the quadratic structure, the trained model is equipped with convergence guarantees and error and complexity bounds, properties that are not readily available for most other operator learning architectures. At its core, the proposed approach builds a linear combination of random operators. This turns out to be a low-rank approximation of an operator-valued kernel ridge regression algorithm, and hence the method also has strong connections to Gaussian process regression. The paper designs function-valued random features that are tailored to the structure of two nonlinear operator learning benchmark problems arising from parametric partial differential equations. Numerical results demonstrate the scalability, discretization invariance, and transferability of the function-valued random features method.</description>

      <title>Implicit-explicit Runge-Kutta for radiation hydrodynamics I: gray diffusion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.05452v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Radiation hydrodynamics are a challenging multiscale and multiphysics set of equations. To capture the relevant physics of interest, one typically must time step on the hydrodynamics timescale, making explicit integration the obvious choice. On the other hand, the coupled radiation equations have a scaling such that implicit integration is effectively necessary in non-relativistic regimes. A first-order Lie-Trotter-like operator split is the most common time integration scheme used in practice, alternating between an explicit hydrodynamics step and an implicit radiation solve and energy deposition step. However, such a scheme is limited to first-order accuracy, and nonlinear coupling between the radiation and hydrodynamics equations makes a more general additive partitioning of the equations non-trivial. Here, we develop a new formulation and partitioning of radiation hydrodynamics with gray diffusion that allows us to apply (linearly) implicit-explicit Runge-Kutta time integration schemes. We prove conservation of total energy in the new framework, and demonstrate 2nd-order convergence in time on multiple radiative shock problems, achieving error 3--5 orders of magnitude smaller than the first-order Lie-Trotter operator split at the hydrodynamic CFL, even when Lie-Trotter applies a 3rd-order TVD Runge-Kutta scheme to the hydrodynamics equations.</description>

      <title>One-sweep moment-based semi-implicit-explicit integration for gray thermal radiation transport</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.04285v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thermal radiation transport (TRT) is a time dependent, high dimensional partial integro-differential equation. In practical applications such as inertial confinement fusion, TRT is coupled to other physics such as hydrodynamics, plasmas, etc., and the timescales one is interested in capturing are often much slower than the radiation timescale. As a result, TRT is treated implicitly, and due to its stiffness and high dimensionality, is often a dominant computational cost in multiphysics simulations. Here we develop a new approach for implicit-explicit (IMEX) integration of gray TRT in the deterministic S$_N$ setting, which requires only one sweep per stage, with the simplest first-order method requiring only one sweep per time step. The partitioning of equations is done via a moment-based high-order low-order formulation of TRT, where the streaming operator and first two moments are used to capture the asymptotic stiff regimes of the streaming limit and diffusion limit. Absorption-reemission is treated explicitly, and although stiff, is sufficiently damped by the implicit solve that we achieve stable accurate time integration without incorporating the coupling of the high order and low order equations implicitly. Due to nonlinear coupling of the high-order and low-order equations through temperature-dependent opacities, to facilitate IMEX partitioning and higher-order methods, we use a semi-implicit integration approach amenable to nonlinear partitions. Results are demonstrated on thick Marshak and crooked pipe benchmark problems, demonstrating orders of magnitude improvement in accuracy and wallclock compared with the standard first-order implicit integration typically used.</description>

Abstract: We propose a two-scale neural network method for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) with small parameters using physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). We directly incorporate the small parameters into the architecture of neural networks. The proposed method enables solving PDEs with small parameters in a simple fashion, without adding Fourier features or other computationally taxing searches of truncation parameters. Various numerical examples demonstrate reasonable accuracy in capturing features of large derivatives in the solutions caused by small parameters.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty quantification analysis of bifurcations of the Allen--Cahn equation with random coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04639v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we consider the Allen--Cahn equation, a prototypical model problem in nonlinear dynamics that exhibits bifurcations corresponding to variations of a deterministic bifurcation parameter. Going beyond the state-of-the-art, we introduce a random coefficient in the linear reaction part of the equation, thereby accounting for random, spatially-heterogeneous effects. Importantly, we assume a spatially constant, deterministic mean value of the random coefficient. We show that this mean value is in fact a bifurcation parameter in the Allen--Cahn equation with random coefficients. Moreover, we show that the bifurcation points and bifurcation curves become random objects. We consider two distinct modelling situations: (i) for a spatially homogeneous coefficient we derive analytical expressions for the distribution of the bifurcation points and show that the bifurcation curves are random shifts of a fixed reference curve; (ii) for a spatially heterogeneous coefficient we employ a generalized polynomial chaos expansion to approximate the statistical properties of the random bifurcation points and bifurcation curves. We present numerical examples in 1D physical space, where we combine the popular software package Continuation Core and Toolboxes (CoCo) for numerical continuation and the Sparse Grids Matlab Kit for the polynomial chaos expansion. Our exposition addresses both, dynamical systems and uncertainty quantification, highlighting how analytical and numerical tools from both areas can be combined efficiently for the challenging uncertainty quantification analysis of bifurcations in random differential equations.</description>

      <title>Uniform observable error bounds of Trotter formulae for the semiclassical Schr\"odinger equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.07957v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Known as no fast-forwarding theorem in quantum computing, the simulation time for the Hamiltonian evolution needs to be $O(\|H\| t)$ in the worst case, which essentially states that one can not go across the multiple scales as the simulation time for the Hamiltonian evolution needs to be strictly greater than the physical time. We demonstrated in the context of the semiclassical Schr\"odinger equation that the computational cost for a class of observables can be much lower than the state-of-the-art bounds. In the semiclassical regime (the effective Planck constant $h \ll 1$), the operator norm of the Hamiltonian is $O(h^{-1})$. We show that the number of Trotter steps used for the observable evolution can be $O(1)$, that is, to simulate some observables of the Schr\"odinger equation on a quantum scale only takes the simulation time comparable to the classical scale. In terms of error analysis, we improve the additive observable error bounds [Lasser-Lubich 2020] to uniform-in-$h$ observable error bounds. This is, to our knowledge, the first uniform observable error bound for semiclassical Schr\"odinger equation without sacrificing the convergence order of the numerical method. Based on semiclassical calculus and discrete microlocal analysis, our result showcases the potential improvements taking advantage of multiscale properties, such as the smallness of the effective Planck constant, of the underlying dynamics and sheds light on going across the scale for quantum dynamics simulation.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, Lie symmetry analysis method is applied to the (2+1)-dimensional time fractional Kadomtsev-Petviashvili (KP) equation with the mixed derivative of Riemann-Liouville time-fractional derivative and integer-order $x$-derivative. We obtained all the Lie symmetries admitted by the KP equation and used them to reduce the (2+1)-dimensional fractional partial differential equation with Riemann-Liouville fractional derivative to some (1+1)-dimensional fractional partial differential equations with Erd\'{e}lyi-Kober fractional derivative or Riemann-Liouville fractional derivative, thereby getting some exact solutions of the reduced equations. In addition, the new conservation theorem and the generalization of Noether operators are developed to construct the conservation laws for the equation studied.</description>

      <title>Control of Instability in a Vlasov-Poisson System Through an External Electric Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15008v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Plasma instabilities are a major concern in plasma science, for applications ranging from particle accelerators to nuclear fusion reactors. In this work, we consider the possibility of controlling such instabilities by adding an external electric field to the Vlasov--Poisson equations. Our approach to determining the external electric field is based on conducting a linear analysis of the resulting equations. We show that it is possible to select external electric fields that completely suppress the plasma instabilities present in the system when the equilibrium distribution and the perturbation are known. In fact, the proposed strategy returns the plasma to its equilibrium with a rate that is faster than exponential in time. We further perform numerical simulations of the nonlinear two-stream and bump-on-tail instabilities to verify our theory and to compare the different strategies that we propose in this work.</description>
