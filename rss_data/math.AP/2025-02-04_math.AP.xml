      <description>arXiv:2502.00184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a Brunn-Minkowski type inequality for the first (nontrivial) Dirichlet eigenvalue of the weighted $p$-operator \[ -\Delta_{p,\gamma}u=-\text{div}(|\nabla u|^{p-2} \nabla u)+(x,\nabla u)|\nabla u|^{p-2}, \] where $p&gt;1$, in the class of bounded Lipschitz domains in $\mathbb{R}^n$. We also prove that any corresponding positive eigenfunction is log-concave if the domain is convex.</description>

      <title>Semilinear wave equations on extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om black holes revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit global existence and decay for small-data solutions of semilinear wave equations on extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole backgrounds satisfying the classical null condition, a problem which was previously addressed by the first author in joint work with Aretakis and Gajic (Ann. of PDE, 2020). In this paper, we develop a new approach based on propagating a significantly weaker set of estimates, which allows for a simpler and more streamlined proof. Our proof does not require tracking sharp estimates for the solution in the near-horizon region, which means that it is compatible with, but does not imply, the non-decay and growth hierarchy of derivatives of the solution along the event horizon expected from the Aretakis instability. In particular, this approach is in principle compatible with other settings where stronger horizon instabilities are expected, such as nonlinear charged scalar fields on extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om, or nonlinear waves on extremal Kerr. We also sketch how our proof applies to semilinear problems on spacetimes settling down to extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om, such as those constructed in our joint work with Kehle (arXiv:2410.16234, 2024).</description>

      <title>On the global solvability of the generalised Navier-Stokes system in critical Besov spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the global solvability of the Navier-Stokes system with fractional Laplacian $(-\Delta)^{\alpha}$ in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ for $n\geq2$, where the convective term has the form $(|u|^{m-1}u)\cdot\nabla u$ for $m\geq1$. By establishing the estimates for the difference $|u_{1}|^{m-1}u_{1}-|u_{2}|^{m-1}u_{2}$ in homogeneous Besov spaces, and employing the maximal regularity property of $(-\Delta)^{\alpha}$ in Lorentz spaces, we prove global existence and uniqueness of the strong solution of the Navier-Stokes in critical Besov spaces for both $m=1$ and $m&gt;1$</description>

      <title>Thin-film limit of the Cahn-Hilliard equation in a curved thin domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Cahn-Hilliard equation with Neumann boundary conditions in a three-dimensional curved thin domain around a given closed surface. When the thickness of the curved thin domain tends to zero, we show that the weighted average in the thin direction of a weak solution to the thin-domain problem converges on the limit surface in an appropriate sense. Moreover, we rigorously derive a limit problem, which is the surface Cahn-Hilliard equation with weighted Laplacian, by characterizing the limit function as a unique weak solution to the limit problem. The proof is based on a detailed analysis of the weighted average and the use of Sobolev inequalities and elliptic regularity estimates on the curved thin domain with constants explicitly depending on the thickness. This is the first result on a rigorous thin-film limit of nonlinear fourth order equations in general curved thin domains.</description>

      <title>On the local analyticity for the Euler equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the existence and uniqueness of solutions to the Euler equations with initial conditions that exhibit analytic regularity near the boundary and Sobolev regularity away from it. A key contribution of this work is the introduction of the diamond-analyticity framework, which captures the spatial decay of the analyticity radius in a structured manner, improving upon uniform analyticity approaches. We employ the Leray projection and a nonstandard mollification technique to demonstrate that the quotient between the imaginary and real parts of the analyticity radius remains unrestricted, thus extending the analyticity persistence results beyond traditional constraints. Our methodology combines analytic-Sobolev estimates with an iterative scheme which is nonstandard in the Cauchy-Kowalevskaya framework, ensuring rigorous control over the evolution of the solution. These results contribute to a deeper understanding of the interplay between analyticity and boundary effects in fluid equations. They might have implications for the study of the inviscid limit of the Navier-Stokes equations and the role of complex singularities in fluid dynamics.</description>

      <title>M-dissipative generalized impedance boundary conditions, discrete spectra, and pointwise multipliers between fractional Sobolev spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper studies properties of acoustic operators in bounded Lipschitz domains $\Omega$ with m-dissipative generalized impedance boundary conditions. We prove that such acoustic operators have a compact resolvent if and only if the impedance operator from the trace space $H^{1/2} (\partial \Omega)$ to the other trace space $H^{-1/2} (\partial \Omega)$ is compact. This result is applied to the question of the discreteness of the spectrum and to the particular cases of damping and impedance boundary conditions. The method of the paper is based on abstract results written in terms of boundary tuples and is applicable to other types of wave equations.</description>

      <title>Stabilizability of 2D and 3D Navier-Stokes equations with memory around a non-constant steady state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we investigate the stabilizability of the two- and three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations with memory effects around a non-constant steady state using a localized interior control. The system is first linearized around a non-constant steady state and then reformulated into a coupled system by introducing a new variable to handle the integral term. Due to the presence of variable coefficients in the linear operator, the rigorous computation of eigenvalues and eigenfunctions becomes infeasible. Therefore, we concentrate on the principal operator, and investigate its analyticity and spectral properties. We establish a feedback stabilization result for the principal system, ensuring a specific decay rate. Using the feedback operator derived from this analysis, we extend the approach to the full system, constructing a closed-loop system. By proving a suitable regularity result and applying a fixed-point argument, we ultimately demonstrate the stabilizability of the full system. We also discuss the stabilizability of the corresponding vorticity equation around a non-constant steady state.</description>

      <title>Global well-posedness and relaxation limit for relaxed compressible Navier-Stokes-Fourier equations in bounded domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates an initial boundary value problem for the relaxed one-dimensional compressible Navier-Stokes-Fourier equations. By transforming the system into Lagrangian coordinates, the resulting formulation exhibits a uniform characteristic boundary structure. We first construct an approximate system with non-characteristic boundaries and establish its local well-posedness by verifying the maximal nonnegative boundary conditions. Subsequently, through the construction of a suitable weighted energy functional and careful treatment of boundary terms, we derive uniform a priori estimates, thereby proving the global well-posedness of smooth solutions for the approximate system. Utilizing these uniform estimates and standard compactness arguments, we further obtain the existence and uniqueness of global solutions for the original system. In addition, the global relaxation limit is established. The analysis is fundamentally based on energy estimates.</description>

      <title>Fractional anisotropic Calder\'on problem with external data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we solve the fractional anisotropic Calder\'on problem with external data in the Euclidean space, in dimensions two and higher, for smooth Riemannian metrics that agree with the Euclidean metric outside a compact set. Specifically, we prove that the knowledge of the partial exterior Dirichlet--to--Neumann map for the fractional Laplace-Beltrami operator, given on arbitrary open nonempty sets in the exterior of the domain in the Euclidean space, determines the Riemannian metric up to diffeomorphism, fixing the exterior. We provide two proofs of this result: one relies on the heat semigroup representation of the fractional Laplacian and a pseudodifferential approach, while the other is based on a variable-coefficient elliptic extension interpretation of the fractional Laplacian.</description>

      <title>Singular and regular analysis for the free boundaries of two-phase inviscid fluids in gravity field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a free boundary problem of two-phase inviscid incompressible fluid in gravity field. The presence of the gravity field induces novel phenomena that there might be some stagnation points on free surface of the two-phase flow, where the velocity field of the fluid vanishes. From the mathematical point of view, the gradient of the stream function degenerates near the stagnation point, leading to singular behaviors on the free surface. The primary objective of this study is to investigate the singularity and regularity of the two-phase free surface, considering their mutual interaction between the two incompressible fluids in two dimensions. More precisely, if the two fluids meet locally at a single point, referred to as the possible two-phase stagnation point, we demonstrate that the singular side of the two-phase free surface exhibits a symmetric Stokes singular profile, while the regular side near this point maintains the $C^{1,\alpha}$ regularity. On the other hand, if the free surfaces of the two fluids stick together and have non-trivial overlapping common boundary at the stagnation point, then the interaction between the two fluids will break the symmetry of the Stokes corner profile, which is attached to the $C^{1,\alpha}$ regular free surface on the other side. As a byproduct of our analysis, it's shown that the velocity field for the two fluids cannot vanish simultaneously on the two-phase free boundary.
  Our results generalize the significant works on the Stokes conjecture in [V$\check{a}$rv$\check{a}$ruc$\check{a}$-Weiss, Acta Math., 206, (2011)] for one-phase gravity water wave, and on regular results on the free boundaries in [De Philippis-Spolaor-Velichkov, Invent. Math., 225, (2021)] for two-phase fluids without gravity.</description>

      <title>Periodic FPU system: Continuum limit to KdV via regularization and Fourier analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Fermi-Pasta-Ulam (FPU) system, initially introduced by Fermi for numerical simulations, models vibrating chains with fixed endpoints, where particles interact weakly, nonlinearly with their nearest neighbors. Contrary to the anticipated ergodic behavior, the simulation revealed nearly periodic (quasi-periodic) motion of the solutions, a phenomenon later referred to as the FPU paradox. A partial but remarkable explanation was provided by Zabusky and Kruskal [36], who formally derived the continuum limit of the FPU system, connecting it to the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation. This formal derivation was later rigorously justified by Bambusi and Ponno [4].
  In this paper, we revisit the problem studied in [4], specifically focusing on the continuum limit of the periodic FPU system for a broader class of initial data, as the number of particles N tends to infinity within a fixed domain. Unlike the non-periodic case discussed in [15], periodic FPU solutions lack a (local) smoothing effect, posing a significant challenge in controlling one derivative in the nonlinearity. This control is crucial not only for proving the (uniform in N) well-posedness for rough data but also for deriving the continuum limit. The main strategies to resolve this issue involve deriving L4-Strichartz estimates for FPU solutions, analogous to those previously derived for KdV solutions in [7], and regularizing the system via the normal form method introduced in [1].</description>

      <title>Weak-Strong Uniqueness and the d'Alembert Paradox</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove conditional weak-strong uniqueness of the potential Euler solution for external flow around a smooth body in three space dimensions, within the class of viscosity weak solutions with the same initial data. Our sufficient condition is the vanishing of the streamwise component of the skin friction in the inviscid limit, somewhat weaker than the condition of Bardos-Titi in bounded domains. Because global-in-time existence of the smooth potential solution leads back to the d'Alembert paradox, we argue that weak-strong uniqueness is not a valid criterion for "relevant" notions of generalized Euler solution and that our condition is likely to be violated in the inviscid limit. We prove also that the Drivas-Nguyen condition on uniform continuity at the wall of the normal velocity component implies weak-strong uniqueness within the general class of admissible weak Euler solutions in bounded domains.</description>

      <title>Direct inversion scheme of time-domain fluorescence diffuse optical tomography by asymptotic analysis of peak time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a direct inversion scheme for fluorescence diffuse optical tomography (FDOT) to reconstruct the location of a point target using the measured peak time of the temporal response functions. A sphere is defined for the target, with its radius determined by the peak time, indicating that the target lies on the sphere. By constructing a tetrahedron with edges determined by the radii, we identify the location of the target as the vertex of the tetrahedron. Asymptotically, we derive the relationship between the radius of the sphere and the peak time. Several numerical tests are implemented to demonstrate the accuracy and performance of the asymptotic relationship and the inversion scheme.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the asymptotic stability of a composition of rarefaction and shock waves for the one-dimensional barotropic compressible fluid of Korteweg type, called the Navier-Stokes-Korteweg(NSK) system. Precisely, we show that the solution to the NSK system asymptotically converges to the composition of the rarefaction wave and shifted viscous-dispersive shock wave, under certain smallness assumption on the initial perturbation and strength of the waves. Our method is based on the method of $a$-contraction with shift developed by Kang and Vasseur \cite{KV16}, successfully applied to obtain contraction or stability of nonlinear waves for hyperbolic systems.</description>

      <title>Ideal MHD. Part II: Rigidity from infinity for ideal Alfv\'en waves in 3D thin domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper concerns the rigidity from infinity for Alfv\'en waves governed by ideal incompressible magnetohydrodynamic equations subjected to strong background magnetic fields along the $x_1$-axis in 3D thin domains $\Omega_\delta=\mathbb{R}^2\times(-\delta,\delta)$ with $\delta\in(0,1]$ and slip boundary conditions. We show that in any thin domain $\Omega_\delta$, Alfv\'en waves must vanish identically if their scattering fields vanish at infinities. As an application, the rigidity of Alfv\'en waves in $\Omega_{\delta}$, propagating along the horizontal direction, can be approximated by the rigidity of Alfv\'en waves in $\mathbb{R}^2$ when $\delta$ is sufficiently small. Our proof relies on the uniform (with respect to $\delta$) weighted energy estimates with a position parameter in weights to track the center of Alfv\'en waves. The key issues in the analysis include dealing with the nonlinear nature of Alfv\'en waves and the geometry of thin domains.</description>

      <title>Regularity and positivity of solutions of the Consensus-Based Optimization equation: unconditional global convergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Introduced in 2017 \cite{B1-pinnau2017consensus}, Consensus-Based Optimization (CBO) has rapidly emerged as a significant breakthrough in global optimization. This straightforward yet powerful multi-particle, zero-order optimization method draws inspiration from Simulated Annealing and Particle Swarm Optimization. Using a quantitative mean-field approximation, CBO dynamics can be described by a nonlinear Fokker-Planck equation with degenerate diffusion, which does not follow a gradient flow structure.
  In this paper, we demonstrate that solutions to the CBO equation remain positive and maintain full support. Building on this foundation, we establish the { unconditional} global convergence of CBO methods to global minimizers. Our results are derived through an analysis of solution regularity and the proof of existence for smooth, classical solutions to a broader class of drift-diffusion equations, despite the challenges posed by degenerate diffusion.</description>

      <title>On the transmission eigenvalues for scattering by a clamped planar region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a new transmission eigenvalue problem derived from the scattering by a clamped cavity in a thin elastic material. Scattering in a thin elastic material can be modeled by the Kirchhoff--Love infinite plate problem. This results in a biharmonic scattering problem that can be handled by operator splitting. The main novelty of this transmission eigenvalue problem is that it is posed in all of $\mathbb{R}^2$. This adds analytical and computational difficulties in studying this eigenvalue problem. Here, we prove that the eigenvalues can be recovered from the far field data as well as discreteness of the transmission eigenvalues. We provide some numerical experiments via boundary integral equations to demonstrate the theoretical results. We also conjecture monotonicity with respect to the measure of the scatterer from our numerical experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Klein, Majda, and Damodaran have previously developed a formalized asymptotic motion law describing the evolution of nearly parallel vortex filaments within the framework of the three-dimensional Euler equations for incompressible fluids. In this study, we rigorously justify this model for two configurations: the central configuration consisting of regular polygons of $N$ helical-filaments rotating with constant speed, and the central configurations of $N+1$ vortex filaments, where an $N$-polygonal central configuration surrounds a central straight filament.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we study the Hodge wave equation on a compact orientable manifold. We present the necessary differential geometry language to treat Sobolev spaces of differential forms and use these tools to identify a boundary triplet for the problem.
  We use this boundary triplet to determine a class of boundary conditions for which the problem is well-posed.</description>

      <title>Superharmonic functions in the upper half space with a nonlocal boundary condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the existence of positive superharmonic functions $u$ in $\mathbb{R}^N_+=\mathbb{R}^{N-1}\times (0, \infty)$, $N\geq 3$, in the sense $-\Delta u=\mu$ for some Radon measure $\mu$, so that $u$ satisfies the nonlocal boundary condition $$ \frac{\partial u}{\partial n}(x',0)=\lambda \int\limits_{\mathbb{R}^{N-1}}\frac{u(y',0)^p}{|x'-y'|^k}dy' \quad\mbox{ on }\partial \mathbb{R}^N_+, $$ where $p,\lambda&gt;0$ and $k\in (0, N-1)$. First, we show that no solutions exist if $0&lt;k\leq 1$. Next, if $1&lt;k&lt;N-1$, we obtain a new critical exponent given by $p^*=\frac{N-1}{k-1}$ for the existence of such solutions. If $\mu\equiv 0$ we construct an exact solution for $p&gt;p^*$ and discuss the existence of regular solutions, case in which we identify a second critical exponent given by $p^{**}=2\cdot \frac{N-1}{k-1}-1$. Our approach combines various integral estimates with the properties of the newly introduced $\alpha$-lifting operator and fixed point theorems.</description>

      <title>A definition of the mass aspect function for weakly regular asymptotically hyperbolic manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00125v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In contrast to the well-known and unambiguous notion of ADM mass for asymptotically Euclidean manifolds, the notion of mass for asymptotically hyperbolic manifolds admits several interpretations. Historically, there are two approaches to defining the mass in the asymptotically hyperbolic setting: the mass aspect function of Wang defined on the conformal boundary at infinity, and the mass functional of Chru\'sciel and Herzlich which may be thought of as the closest asymptotically hyperbolic analogue of the ADM mass. In this paper we unify these two approaches by introducing an ADM-style definition of the mass aspect function that applies to a broad range of asymptotics and in very low regularity. Additionally, we show that the mass aspect function can be computed using the Ricci tensor. Finally, we demonstrate that this function exhibits favorable covariance properties under changes of charts at infinity, which includes a proof of the asymptotic rigidity of hyperbolic space in the context of weakly regular metrics.</description>

      <title>Bounds for quasimodes with polynomially narrow bandwidth on surfaces of revolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00143v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a compact surface of revolution with Laplace-beltrami operator $\Delta$, we consider the spectral projector $P_{\lambda,\delta}$ on a polynomially narrow frequency interval $[\lambda-\delta,\lambda + \delta]$, which is associated to the self-adjoint operator $\sqrt{-\Delta}$. For a large class of surfaces of revolution, and after excluding small disks around the poles, we prove that the $L^2 \to L^{\infty}$ norm of $P_{\lambda,\delta}$ is of order $\lambda^{\frac{1}{2}} \delta^{\frac{1}{2}}$ up to $\delta \geq \lambda^{-\frac{1}{32}}$. We adapt the microlocal approach introduced by Sogge for the case $\delta = 1$, by using the Quantum Completely Integrable structure of surfaces of revolution introduced by Colin de Verdi\`ere. This reduces the analysis to a number of estimates of explicit oscillatory integrals, for which we introduce new quantitative tools.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00216v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article we introduce the notion of Floer function which has the property that the Hessian is a Fredholm operator of index zero in a scale of Hilbert spaces. Since the Hessian has a complicated transformation under chart transition, in general this is not an intrinsic condition. Therefore we introduce the concept of Floerfolds for which we show that the notion of Floer function is intrinsic.</description>

      <title>Effects and biological consequences of the predator-mediated apparent competition I: ODE models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00410v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to investigating the effects and biological consequences of the predator-mediated apparent competition based on a two prey species (one is native and the other is invasive) and one predator model with Holling type I and II functional response functions. Through the analytical results and case studies alongside numerical simulations, we find that the initial mass of the invasive prey species, capture rates of prey species, and the predator's mortality rate are all important factors determining the success/failure of invasions and the species coexistence/extinction. The global dynamics can be completely classified for the Holling type I functional response function, but can only be partially determined for the Holling type II functional response function. For the Holling type I response function, we find that whether the invasive prey species can successfully invade to promote the predator-mediated apparent competition is entirely determined by the capture rates of prey species. If the Holling type II response function is applied, then the dynamics are more complicated. First, if two prey species have the same ecological characteristics, then the initial mass of the invasive prey species is the key factor determining the success/failure of the invasion and hence the effect of the predator-mediated apparent competition. Whereas if two prey species have different ecological characteristics, say different capture rates, then the success of the invasion no longer depends on the initial mass of the invasive prey species, but on the capture rates. In all cases, if the invasion succeeds, then the predator-mediated apparent competition's effectiveness essentially depends on the predator's mortality rate.</description>

      <title>Fractional differential equations of a reaction-diffusion SIR model involving the Caputo-fractional time-derivative and a nonlinear diffusion operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00509v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The main aim of this study is to analyze a fractional parabolic SIR epidemic model of a reaction-diffusion, by using the nonlocal Caputo fractional time-fractional derivative and employing the $p$-Laplacian operator. The immunity is imposed through the vaccination program, which is regarded as a control variable. Finding the optimal control pair that reduces the number of sick people, the associated vaccination, and treatment expenses across a constrained time and space is our main study. The existence and uniqueness of the nonnegative solution for the spatiotemporal SIR model are established. It is also demonstrated that an optimal control exists. In addition, we obtain a description of the optimal control in terms of state and adjoint functions. Then, the optimality system is resolved by a discrete iterative scheme that converges after an appropriate test, similar to the forward-backward sweep method. Finally, numerical approximations are given to show the effectiveness of the proposed control program, which provides meaningful results using different values of the fractional order and $p$, respectively the order of the Caputo derivative and the $p$-Laplacian operators.</description>

      <title>A normalized Ricci flow on surfaces with boundary towards the complete hyperbolic metric</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $(\overline{M},g_0)$ be a $2$-D compact surface with boundary $\partial M$ and its interior $M$. We show that for a large class of initial and boundary data, the initial-boundary value problem of the normalized Ricci flow $(1.10)-(1.12)$, with prescribed geodesic curvature $\psi$ on $\partial M$, has a unique solution for all $t&gt;0$, and it converges to the complete hyperbolic metric locally uniformly in $M$. Here the natural condition that $\psi&gt;0$ causes the main difficulty in the a priori estimates in the corresponding initial-boundary problem $(1.15)-(1.17)$ of the parabolic equations, for which an auxiliary Cauchy-Dirichlet problem is introduced. We also provide examples of the boundary data $\psi$ which fits well with the natural asymptotic behavior of the geodesic curvature, but the solution to $(1.10)-(1.12)$ fails to converge to the complete hyperbolic metric.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method for solving H(curl)-elliptic hemivariational inequalities. By selecting an appropriate numerical flux, we construct an Interior Penalty Discontinuous Galerkin (IPDG) scheme. A comprehensive numerical analysis of the IPDG method is conducted, addressing key aspects such as consistency, boundedness, stability, and the existence, uniqueness, uniform boundedness of the numerical solutions. Building on these properties, we establish a priori error estimates, demonstrating the optimal convergence order of the numerical solutions under suitable solution regularity assumptions. Finally, a numerical example is presented to illustrate the theoretically predicted convergence order and to show the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

Abstract: We investigate stochastic parabolic evolution equations with time-dependent random generators and locally Lipschitz continuous drift terms. Using pathwise mild solutions, we construct an infinite-dimensional stationary Ornstein-Uhlenbeck type process, which is shown to be tempered in suitable function spaces. This property, together with a bootstrapping argument based on the regularizing effect of parabolic evolution families, is then applied to prove the global well-posedness and the existence of a random attractor for reaction-diffusion equations with random non-autonomous generators and nonlinearities satisfying certain growth and dissipativity assumptions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01274v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We systematically introduce an approach to the analysis and (numerical) solution of a broad class of nonlinear unconstrained optimal control problems, involving ordinary and distributed systems. Our approach relies on exact representations of the increments of the objective functional, drawing inspiration from the classical Weierstrass formula in Calculus of Variations. While such representations are straightforward to devise for state-linear problems (in vector spaces), they can also be extended to nonlinear models (in metric spaces) by immersing them into suitable linear "super-structures". We demonstrate that these increment formulas lead to necessary optimality conditions of an arbitrary order. Moreover, they enable to formulate optimality conditions of "infinite order", incorporating a kind of feedback mechanism. As a central result, we rigorously apply this general technique to the optimal control of nonlocal continuity equations in the space of probability measures.</description>

Abstract: Every convex optimization problem has a dual problem. The $p$-Dirichlet problem in metric measure spaces is an optimization problem whose solutions are $p$-harmonic functions. What is its dual problem? In this paper, we give an answer to this problem in the following form. We give a generalized modulus problem whose solution is the gradient of the $p$-harmonic function for metric measure spaces. Its dual problem is an optimization problem for measures on curves and we show exact duality and the existence of minimizers for this dual problem under appropriate assumptions. When applied to $p$-harmonic functions the minimizers of this dual problem are supported on gradient curves, yielding a natural concept associated to such functions that has yet to be studied. This process defines a natural dual metric current and proves the existence of gradient curves. These insights are then used to construct a counter example answering the old ``sheaf problem'' on metric spaces: in contrast to Euclidean spaces, in general metric spaces being $p$-harmonic is not strictly speaking a local property.</description>

      <title>A coupling approach to Lipschitz transport maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01353v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this note, we propose a probabilistic approach to bound the (dimension-free) Lipschitz constant of the Langevin flow map on $\mathbb{R}^d$ introduced by Kim and Milman (2012). As example of application, we construct Lipschitz maps from a uniformly $\log$-concave probability measure to $\log$-Lipschitz perturbations as in Fathi, Mikulincer, Shenfeld (2024). Our proof is based on coupling techniques applied to the stochastic representation of the family of vector fields inducing the transport map. This method is robust enough to relax the uniform convexity to a weak asymptotic convexity condition and to remove the bound on the third derivative of the potential of the source measure.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate properties of entropy-penalized Wasserstein barycenters introduced by Bigot, Cazelles and Papadakis (2019) as a regularization of Wasserstein barycenters first presented by Agueh and Carlier (2011). After characterizing these barycenters in terms of a system of Monge-Amp\`ere equations, we prove some global moment and Sobolev bounds as well as higher regularity properties. We finally establish a central limit theorem for entropic-Wasserstein barycenters.</description>

      <title>Weighted Gagliardo-Nirenberg inequalities via Optimal Transport Theory and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.09051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.09051v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove Gagliardo-Nirenberg inequalities with three weights -- verifying a joint concavity condition -- on open convex cones of $\mathbb R^n$. If the weights are equal to each other the inequalities become sharp and we compute explicitly the sharp constants. For a certain range of parameters we can characterize the class of extremal functions; in this case, we also show that the sharpness in the main three-weighted Gagliardo-Nirenberg inequality implies that the weights must be equal up to some constant multiplicative factors. Our approach uses optimal mass transport theory and a careful analysis of the joint concavity condition of the weights. As applications we establish sharp weighted $p$-log-Sobolev, Faber-Krahn and isoperimetric inequalities with explicit sharp constants.</description>

      <title>Controllability and Stabilizability of the Linearized Compressible Navier-Stokes System with Maxwell's Law</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.14686v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the control properties of the linearized compressible Navier-Stokes system with Maxwell's law around a constant steady state $(\rho_s, u_s, 0), \rho_s&gt;0, u_s&gt;0$ in the interval $(0, 2\pi)$ with periodic boundary data. We explore the exact controllability of the coupled system by means of a localized interior control acting in any of the equations when time is large enough. We also study the boundary exact controllability of the linearized system using a single control force when the time is sufficiently large. In both cases, we prove the exact controllability of the system in the space $L^2(0,2\pi)\times L^2(0, 2\pi)\times L^2(0, 2\pi)$. We establish the exact controllability results by proving an observability inequality with the help of an Ingham-type inequality. Moreover, we prove that the system is exactly controllable at any time if the control acts everywhere in the domain in any of the equations. Next, we prove the small time lack of controllability of the concerned system.
  Further, using a Gramian-based approach demonstrated by Urquiza, we prove the exponential stabilizability of the corresponding closed-loop system with an arbitrary prescribed decay rate using boundary feedback control law.</description>

      <title>A variational approach to the Navier-Stokes equations with shear-dependent viscosity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.03546v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a variational approach for the construction of Leray-Hopf solutions to the non-Newtonian Navier-Stokes system. Inspired by the work [42] on the corresponding Newtonian problem, we minimise certain stabilised Weighted Inertia-Dissipation-Energy (WIDE) functionals and pass to the limit of a vanishing parameter in order to recover a Leray-Hopf solution of the non-Newtonian Navier-Stokes equations. The investigation of the non-Newtonian Navier-Stokes system via this variational approach is particularly well suited to gain insights into weak, respectively strong convergence properties of approximating sequences for different flow-behaviour exponents. With this analysis we extend the results of [4] to power-law exponents $\tfrac{2d}{d+2} &lt; p &lt; \tfrac{3d+2}{d+2}$, where weak solutions do not satisfy the energy equality and the involved convergence is genuinely weak. Key of the argument is to pass to the limit in the nonlinear viscosity term in the time-dependent setting. For this we provide an elliptic-parabolic solenoidal Lipschitz truncation that might be of independent interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17723v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article we establish fine results on the boundary behavior of solutions to nonlocal equations in $C^{k,\gamma}$ domains which satisfy local Neumann conditions on the boundary. Such solutions typically blow up at the boundary like $v \asymp d^{s-1}$ and are sometimes called large solutions. In this setup we prove optimal regularity results for the quotients $v/d^{s-1}$, depending on the regularity of the domain and on the data of the problem. The results of this article will be important in a forthcoming work on nonlocal free boundary problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06730v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The nonlinear Hartree equation (NLH) in the Heisenberg picture admits steady states of the form $\gamma_f=f(-\Delta)$ representing quantum states of infinitely many particles. In this article, we consider the time evolution of perturbations from a large class of such steady states via the three-dimensional NLH. We prove that if the interaction potential $w$ has finite measure and initial states have finite relative entropy, then solutions preserve the relative free energy, and they exist globally in time. This result extends the important work of Lewin and Sabin [arXiv:1310.0603] to singular interaction cases.</description>

Abstract: We prove that bounded weak solutions to degenerate parabolic double-phase equations of $p$-Laplace type are locally H\"older continuous. The proof is based on phase analysis and methods for the $p$-Laplace equation. In particular, the phase analysis determines whether the double-phase equation is locally similar to the $p$-Laplace or the $q$-Laplace equation.</description>

      <title>On location of maximal gradient of torsion function over some non-symmetric planar domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04790v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the location of the maximal gradient of the torsion function on some non-symmetric planar domains. First, by establishing uniform estimates for narrow domains, we prove that as a planar domain bounded by two graphs of functions becomes increasingly narrow, the location of the maximal gradient of its torsion function tends toward the endpoint of the longest vertical line segment, with smaller curvature among them. This shows that the Saint-Venant's conjecture on the location of fail points is valid for asymptotically narrow domains. Second, for triangles, we show that the maximal gradient of the torsion function always occurs on the longest sides, lying between the foot of the altitude and the midpoint of that side. Moreover, via nodal line analysis and the continuity method, we demonstrate that restricted on each side, the critical point of the gradient of the torsion function is unique and non-degenerate. Furthermore, by perturbation and barrier argument, we prove that for a class of nearly equilateral triangles, the critical point is closer to the midpoint than to the foot of the altitude, and the norm of the gradient of the torsion function has a larger value at the midpoint than at the foot of the altitude. Third, using the reflection method, we prove that for a non-concentric annulus, the maximal gradient of torsion always occurs at the point on the inner ring closest to the center of the outer ring.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we consider the $N$-dimensional Euclidean Onofri inequality proved by del Pino and Dolbeault for smooth compactly supported functions in $\mathbb{R}^N$, $N \geq 2$. We extend the inequality to a suitable weighted Sobolev space, although no clear connection with standard Sobolev spaces on $\mathbb{S}^N$ through stereographic projection is present, except for the planar case. Moreover, in any dimension $N \geq 2$, we show that the Euclidean Onofri inequality is equivalent to the logarithmic Moser-Trudinger inequality with sharp constant proved by Carleson and Chang for balls in $\mathbb{R}^N$.</description>

      <title>Radial 3D Focusing Energy Critical INLS equations with defocusing perturbation: Ground states, Scattering, and Blow-up</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14161v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the following inhomogeneous nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation in the radial regime, featuring a focusing energy-critical nonlinearity and a defocusing perturbation: $$
  i\partial_t u +\Delta u =|x|^{-a} |u|^{p-2} u - |x|^{-b} |u|^{4-2b}u \quad \mbox{in} \,\, \mathbb{R}_t \times \mathbb{R}_x^3, $$ where $0&lt;a$, $b&lt;2$ and $2+\frac{4-2a}{3}&lt; p\leq 6-2a$.
  First, we establish the existence and nonexistence of ground states, along with their quantitative properties. Subsequently, we analyze the dichotomy between scattering and blow-up for solutions with energy below the ground-state energy threshold.
  An intriguing feature of this equation is the lack of scaling invariance, which arises from the competing effects of the inhomogeneous nonlinearities. Additionally, the presence of singular weights breaks translation invariance in the spatial variable, introducing further complexity to the analysis.
  To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first comprehensive study of the inhomogeneous nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with a leading-order focusing energy-critical inhomogeneous nonlinearity and a defocusing perturbation. Our results provide new insights into the interplay between these competing nonlinearities and their influence on the dynamics of solutions.</description>

      <title>Boundary value problems and Hardy spaces for singular Schr\"odinger equations with block structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17563v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We obtain Riesz transform bounds and characterise operator-adapted Hardy spaces to solve boundary value problems for singular Schr\"odinger equations $-\mathrm{div}(A\nabla u)+aVu=0$ in the upper half-space $\mathbb{R}^{1+n}_{+}$ with boundary dimension $n\geq 3$. The coefficients $(A,a,V)$ are assumed to be independent of the transversal direction to the boundary, and consist of a complex-elliptic pair $(A,a)$ that is bounded and measurable with a certain block structure, and a non-negative singular potential $V$ in the reverse H\"older class $\mathrm{RH}^{q}(\mathbb{R}^{n})$ for $q\geq \max\{\frac{n}{2},2\}$. This block structure is significant because it allows for coefficients that are not symmetric but for which $\mathrm{L}^{2}(\mathbb{R}^{n})$-solvability persists due to recently obtained Kato square root type estimates. We find extrapolation intervals for exponents $p$ around $2$ on which the Dirichlet problem is well-posed for boundary data in $\mathrm{L}^{p}(\mathbb{R}^{n})$, and the associated Regularity problem is well-posed for boundary data in Sobolev spaces $\dot{\mathcal{V}}^{1,p}(\mathbb{R}^{n})$ that are adapted to the potential $V$, when $p&gt;1$. The well-posedness of these Dirichlet problems and related estimates then allow us to solve the corresponding Neumann problem with boundary data in $\mathrm{L}^{p}$. The results permit boundary data in the Dziuba\`{n}ski--Zienkiewicz Hardy space $\mathrm{H}^{1}_{V}(\mathbb{R}^{n})$ and adapted Hardy--Sobolev spaces $\dot{\mathrm{H}}^{1,p}_{V}(\mathbb{R}^{n})$ when $p\leq 1$. We also obtain comparability of square functions and nontangential maximal functions for the solutions with their boundary data.</description>

      <title>Regularity properties of a generalized Oseen evolution operator in exterior domains, with applications to the Navier-Stokes initial value problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19711v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider a generalized Oseen evolution operator in 3D exterior domains, that is generated by a non-autonomous linearized system arising from time-dependent rigid motions. This was found by Hansel and Rhandi, and then the theory was developed by the second author, however, desired regularity properties such as estimate of the temporal derivative as well as the Hoelder estimate have remained open. The present paper provides us with those properties together with weighted estimates of the evolution operator. The results are then applied to the Navier-Stokes initial value problem, so that a new theorem on existence of a unique strong Lq-solution locally in time is proved.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13487v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we mainly consider large time behavior for the classical free wave equation $u_{tt}-\Delta u=0$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$. We derive some large time optimal estimates for the quantity of solution $\|u(t,\cdot)\|_{L^2}$ with initial data belonging to $L^2$ or with additional weighted $L^1$ integrabilities. Particularly, some thresholds are discovered for the (local or global in time) stabilization of this quantity. We also apply these results to the wave equation with scale-invariant terms, the undamped $\sigma$-evolution equation, the critical Moore-Gibson-Thompson equation, and the linearized compressible Euler system.</description>

      <title>On asymptotic stability of stable Good Boussinesq solitary waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13649v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the generalized Good-Boussinesq (GB) model in one dimension, with subcritical power nonlinearity $1&lt;p&lt;5$ and data in the energy space $H^1\times L^2$. This model has solitary waves with speeds $c\in (-1,1)$. If $c^2&gt;\frac{p-1}{4}$, Bona and Sachs showed the orbital stability of such waves. Previously, one of us proved that unstable GB standing waves can be perturbed with particular odd-even data in a suitable submanifold of the energy space, leading to the asymptotic stability property if $p\ge 2$. In this paper we prove that stable GB solitary waves are asymptotically stable in the case of general initial data placed in the energy space for any $p\ge 2$ and speeds $|c|&gt;c_+(p)\geq \sqrt{\frac{p-1}{4}}$. The proof involves the introduction of a new set of virial estimates specifically adapted to the GB system in a moving setting. In particular, a new virial estimate with mixed variables is considered to treat arbitrary scaling and shift modulations. Another new ingredient is the understanding the corresponding linear matrix operator under mixed orthogonality conditions, a feature absent in our previous works.</description>

      <title>Hypoelliptic Regularization in the Obstacle Problem for the Kolmogorov Operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14146v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the obstacle problem associated with the Kolmogorov operator $\Delta_v - \partial_t - v\cdot\nabla_x$, which arises from the theory of optimal control in Asian-American options pricing models.
  Our first main contribution is to improve the known regularity of solutions, from $C^{0,1}_t \cap C^{0,2/3}_x \cap C^{1,1}_v$ to $C^{0,1}_{t,x} \cap C^{1,1}_v$. The previous result in the literature, which has been called optimal, corresponds to $C^{1,1}$ regularity with respect to the Kolmogorov distance. This is the expected regularity for solutions to obstacle problems. Our unexpected improvement of regularity in the $x$ variable is obtained using Bernstein's technique and an approach drawing on ideas from Evans-Krylov theory.
  We then use this improvement in regularity of the solution to prove the first known free boundary regularity result. We show that under a standard thickness condition, the free boundary is a $C^{0,1/2}_{t,x} \cap C^{0,1}_v$ regular surface. This result constitutes the first step in the program of free boundary regularity. Critically, our arguments rely on a new monotonicity formula and a commutator estimate that are only made possible by the solution's enhanced regularity in $x$.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness &amp; Weak-BV Stability in the Large for Isothermal Gas Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16244v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For the $1$-d isothermal Euler system, we consider the family of entropic BV solutions with possibly large, but finite, total variation. We show that these solutions are stable with respect to large perturbations in a class of weak solutions to the system which may not even be BV. The method is based on the construction of a modified front tracking algorithm, in which the theory of $a$-contraction with shifts for shocks is used as a building block. The main contribution is to construct the weight in the modified front tracking algorithm in a large-BV setting.</description>

      <title>Global martingale solutions for stochastic Shigesada-Kawasaki-Teramoto population models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.12602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.12602v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The existence of global nonnegative martingale solutions to cross-diffusion systems of Shigesada-Kawasaki-Teramoto type with multiplicative noise is proven. The model describes the stochastic segregation dynamics of an arbitrary number of population species in a bounded domain with no-flux boundary conditions. The diffusion matrix is generally neither symmetric nor positive semidefinite, which excludes standard methods for evolution equations. Instead, the existence proof is based on the entropy structure of the model, a novel regularization of the entropy variable, higher-order moment estimates, and fractional time regularity. The regularization technique is generic and is applied to the population system with self-diffusion in any space dimension and without self-diffusion in two space dimensions.</description>

      <title>Efficient approximation of high-frequency Helmholtz solutions by Gaussian coherent states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.04851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.04851v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce new finite-dimensional spaces specifically designed to approximate the solutions to high-frequency Helmholtz problems with smooth variable coefficients in dimension $d$. These discretization spaces are spanned by Gaussian coherent states, that have the key property to be localised in phase space. We carefully select the Gaussian coherent states spanning the approximation space by exploiting the (known) micro-localisation properties of the solution. For a large class of source terms (including plane-wave scattering problems), this choice leads to discrete spaces that provide a uniform approximation error for all wavenumber $k$ with a number of degrees of freedom scaling as $k^{d-1/2}$, which we rigorously establish. In comparison, for discretization spaces based on (piecewise) polynomials, the number of degrees of freedom has to scale at least as $k^d$ to achieve the same property. These theoretical results are illustrated by one-dimensional numerical examples, where the proposed discretization spaces are coupled with a least-squares variational formulation.</description>

      <title>Wasserstein medians: robustness, PDE characterization and numerics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.01765v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the notion of Wasserstein median as an alternative to the Wasserstein barycenter, which has become popular but may be sensitive to outliers. In terms of robustness to corrupted data, we indeed show that Wasserstein medians have a breakdown point of approximately $\frac{1}{2}$. We give explicit constructions of Wasserstein medians in dimension one which enable us to obtain $L^p$ estimates (which do not hold in higher dimensions). We also address dual and multimarginal reformulations. In convex subsets of $\mathbb{R}^d$, we connect Wasserstein medians to a minimal (multi) flow problem \`a la Beckmann and a system of PDEs of Monge-Kantorovich-type, for which we propose a $p$-Laplacian approximation. Our analysis eventually leads to a new numerical method to compute Wasserstein medians, which is based on a Douglas-Rachford scheme applied to the minimal flow formulation of the problem.</description>

      <title>Linear-Quadratic Mean Field Games in Hilbert spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14935v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper represents the first attempt to develop a theory for linear-quadratic mean field games in possibly infinite dimensional Hilbert spaces. As a starting point, we study the case, considered in most finite dimensional contributions on the topic, where the dependence on the distribution enters just in the objective functional through the mean. This feature allows, similarly to the finite dimensional case, to reduce the usual mean field game system to a Riccati equation and a forward-backward coupled system of abstract evolution equations. Such system is completely new in infinite dimension and no results have been proved on it so far. We show existence and uniqueness of solutions for such system, applying a delicate approximation procedure. We apply the results to a production output planning problem with delay in the control variable.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of unknown monotone nonlinear operators in semilinear elliptic models using optimal inputs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12153v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Physical models often contain unknown functions and relations. The goal of our work is to answer the question of how one should excite or control a system under consideration in an appropriate way to be able to reconstruct an unknown nonlinear relation. To answer this question, we propose a greedy reconstruction algorithm within an offline-online strategy. We apply this strategy to a two-dimensional semilinear elliptic model. Our identification is based on the application of several space-dependent excitations (also called controls). These specific controls are designed by the algorithm in order to obtain a deeper insight into the underlying physical problem and a more precise reconstruction of the unknown relation. We perform numerical simulations that demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach which is not limited to the current type of equation. Since our algorithm provides not only a way to determine unknown operators by existing data but also protocols for new experiments, it is a holistic concept to tackle the problem of improving physical models.</description>

      <title>Scalable diffusion posterior sampling in infinite-dimensional inverse problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15643v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Score-based diffusion models (SDMs) have emerged as a powerful tool for sampling from the posterior distribution in Bayesian inverse problems. However, existing methods often require multiple evaluations of the forward mapping to generate a single sample, resulting in significant computational costs for large-scale inverse problems. To address this issue, we propose a scalable diffusion posterior sampling (SDPS) method to bypass forward mapping evaluations during sampling by shifting computational effort to an offline training phase, where a task-dependent score is learned based on the forward mapping. Crucially, the conditional posterior score is then derived from this trained score using affine transformations, ensuring no conditional score approximation is needed. The approach is shown to generalize to infinite-dimensional diffusion models and is validated through rigorous convergence analysis and high-dimensional CT imaging experiments.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05754v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work investigates the online machine learning problem of prediction with expert advice in an adversarial setting through numerical analysis of, and experiments with, a related partial differential equation. The problem is a repeated two-person game involving decision-making at each step informed by $n$ experts in an adversarial environment. The continuum limit of this game over a large number of steps is a degenerate elliptic equation whose solution encodes the optimal strategies for both players. We develop numerical methods for approximating the solution of this equation in relatively high dimensions ($n\leq 10$) by exploiting symmetries in the equation and the solution to drastically reduce the size of the computational domain. Based on our numerical results we make a number of conjectures about the optimality of various adversarial strategies, in particular about the non-optimality of the COMB strategy.</description>
