      <title>Parameter conditioned interpretable U-Net surrogate model for data-driven predictions of convection-diffusion-reaction processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a combined numerical and data-driven workflow for efficient prediction of nonlinear, instationary convection-diffusion-reaction dynamics on a two-dimensional phenotypic domain, motivated by macroscopic modeling of cancer cell plasticity. A finite-difference solver, implemented in C++, is developed using second-order spatial discretizations and a step-size controlled Runge-Kutta time integrator. A mesh refinement study confirms the second-order convergence for the spatial discretizations error. Based on simulated input-output pairs and corresponding parameterizations for the diffusion, advection, and reaction mechanisms, we train a parameter-conditioned U-Net surrogate to approximate the fixed-horizon solution map. The surrogate incorporates Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) for parameter conditioning, coordinate encoding to incorporate spatial location information, and residual blocks to enable multiscale representation learning in combination with the U-Nets skip connections. The trained model achieves low prediction error on held-out test data and provides favorable prediction times due to the GPU based parallelization. Generalization is analyzed using a factorial test dataset, separating initial conditions from parameter conditioning. The results reveal that approximation difficulty varies primarily with the conditioning vector (i.e., the induced PDE regime), rather than with the initial conditions.</description>

      <title>Omni-fMRI: A Universal Atlas-Free fMRI Foundation Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-supervised fMRI foundation models have shown promising transfer performance, yet most rely on predefined region-level parcellations that discard fine-grained voxel information and introduce atlas-dependent biases. We propose Omni-fMRI, an atlas-free foundation model that operates directly on voxel-level signals. To enable scalable pretraining on 49,497 fMRI sessions across nine datasets, Omni-fMRI introduces a dynamic patching mechanism that substantially reduces computational cost while preserving informative spatial structure. To support reproducibility and fair comparison, we establish a comprehensive benchmark suite spanning 11 datasets and a diverse set of resting-state and task-based fMRI tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that Omni-fMRI consistently outperforms existing foundation models, providing a scalable and reproducible framework for atlas-free brain representation learning. Code and logs are available.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models for Patent Classification: Strengths, Trade-offs, and the Long Tail Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Patent classification into CPC codes underpins large scale analyses of technological change but remains challenging due to its hierarchical, multi label, and highly imbalanced structure. While pre Generative AI supervised encoder based models became the de facto standard for large scale patent classification, recent advances in large language models (LLMs) raise questions about whether they can provide complementary capabilities, particularly for rare or weakly represented technological categories. In this work, we perform a systematic comparison of encoder based classifiers (BERT, SciBERT, and PatentSBERTa) and open weight LLMs on a highly imbalanced benchmark dataset (USPTO 70k). We evaluate LLMs under zero shot, few shot, and retrieval augmented prompting, and further assess parameter efficient fine tuning of the best performing model. Our results show that encoder based models achieve higher aggregate performance, driven by strong results on frequent CPC subclasses, but struggle on rare ones. In contrast, LLMs achieve relatively higher performance on infrequent subclasses, often associated with early stage, cross domain, or weakly institutionalised technologies, particularly at higher hierarchical levels. These findings indicate that encoder based and LLM based approaches play complementary roles in patent classification. We additionally quantify inference time and energy consumption, showing that encoder based models are up to three orders of magnitude more efficient than LLMs. Overall, our results inform responsible patentometrics and technology mapping, and motivate hybrid classification approaches that combine encoder efficiency with the long tail coverage of LLMs under computational and environmental constraints.</description>

      <title>TCBench: A Benchmark for Tropical Cyclone Track and Intensity Forecasting at the Global Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: TCBench is a benchmark for evaluating global, short to medium-range (1-5 days) forecasts of tropical cyclone (TC) track and intensity. To allow a fair and model-agnostic comparison, TCBench builds on the IBTrACS observational dataset and formulates TC forecasting as predicting the time evolution of an existing tropical system conditioned on its initial position and intensity. TCBench includes state-of-the-art dynamical (TIGGE) and neural weather models (AIFS, Pangu-Weather, FourCastNet v2, GenCast). If not readily available, baseline tracks are consistently derived from model outputs using the TempestExtremes library. For evaluation, TCBench provides deterministic and probabilistic storm-following metrics. On 2023 test cases, neural weather models skillfully forecast TC tracks, while skillful intensity forecasts require additional steps such as post-processing. Designed for accessibility, TCBench helps AI practitioners tackle domain-relevant TC challenges and equips tropical meteorologists with data-driven tools and workflows to improve prediction and TC process understanding. By lowering barriers to reproducible, process-aware evaluation of extreme events, TCBench aims to democratize data-driven TC forecasting.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Interplay of Parameterization and Optimizer in Gradient-Free Topology Optimization: A Cantilever Beam Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22241v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gradient-free black-box optimization (BBO) is widely used in engineering design and provides a flexible framework for topology optimization (TO), enabling the discovery of high-performing structural designs without requiring gradient information from simulations. Yet, its success depends on two key choices: the geometric parameterization defining the search space and the optimizer exploring it.
  This study investigates this interplay through a compliance minimization problem for a cantilever beam subject to a connectivity constraint. We benchmark three geometric parameterizations, each combined with three representative BBO algorithms: differential evolution, covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy, and heteroscedastic evolutionary Bayesian optimization, across 10D, 20D, and 50D design spaces.
  Results reveal that parameterization quality has a stronger influence on optimization performance than optimizer choice: a well-structured parameterization enables robust and competitive performance across algorithms, whereas weaker representations increase optimizer dependency. Overall, this study highlights the dominant role of geometric parameterization in practical BBO-based TO and shows that algorithm performance and selection cannot be fairly assessed without accounting for the induced design space.</description>

      <title>SCALAR: Quantifying Structural Hallucination, Consistency, and Reasoning Gaps in Materials Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models are increasingly applied to materials science reasoning, yet their behavior under physically structured distribution shifts remains poorly understood. We introduce SCALAR (Structural Consistency And Logic Across Regimes), a benchmark for evaluating geometric scale generalization and its connection to structural hallucination, consistency, and reasoning in materials foundation models. Given canonical crystal representations, models must reason about derived nanoparticle structures obtained through supercell expansion and geometric truncation across length scales spanning a few atoms to over 18,000 atoms, totaling $\approx$100,000 structures from DFT-validated unit cells. SCALAR defines three tasks. (i) CIF to property prediction. (ii) A Chain-of-Thought variant with explicit physics-grounded reasoning. (iii) Inverse retrieval identifying crystals from candidates given target properties. Outputs are evaluated via structured metrics capturing numeric error, hallucination, cross-prompt consistency, monotonic reasoning, output validity, and retrieval regret. Experiments across diverse foundation models reveal large, model-dependent shifts under explicit reasoning, often reducing hallucination and error, but frequently destabilizing consistency or validity. These results demonstrate that geometric scale generalization cannot be inferred from accuracy alone.

      <title>Studying the Soupability of Documents in State Space Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24033v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate whether hidden states from Structured State Space Models (SSMs) can be merged post hoc to support downstream reasoning. Inspired by model souping, we study document souping, a strategy where documents are encoded independently, and their representations are pooled, via simple operations like averaging, into a single context state. This approach enables modular encoding and reuse without reprocessing the full input for each query. We demonstrate that finetuned Mamba2 models with souped representations achieve competitive or superior performance across multi-hop QA, sparse retrieval, and long-document reasoning tasks compared to the standard monolithic encoding approach. For example, on the RACE and QuALITY benchmarks for long document question answering, this method substantially outperforms a traditional concatenation approach. Crucially, this modular design scales to hundreds of documents while delivering substantial savings in inference cost, unlocking new possibilities for large-scale corpus reasoning.</description>

      <title>InstructPLM-mu: 1-Hour Fine-Tuning of ESM2 Beats ESM3 in Protein Mutation Predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03370v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multimodal protein language models deliver strong performance on mutation-effect prediction, but training such models from scratch demands substantial computational resources. In this paper, we propose a fine-tuning framework called InstructPLM-mu and try to answer a question: \textit{Can multimodal fine-tuning of a pretrained, sequence-only protein language model match the performance of models trained end-to-end? } Surprisingly, our experiments show that fine-tuning ESM2 with structural inputs can reach performance comparable to ESM3. To understand how this is achieved, we systematically compare three different feature-fusion designs and fine-tuning recipes. Our results reveal that both the fusion method and the tuning strategy strongly affect final accuracy, indicating that the fine-tuning process is not trivial. We hope this work offers practical guidance for injecting structure into pretrained protein language models and motivates further research on better fusion mechanisms and fine-tuning protocols.</description>
