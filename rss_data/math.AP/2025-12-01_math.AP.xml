      <title>Homogenization and linearization in magnetoelasticity under small elastic response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform a simultaneous homogenization and linearization analysis for a magnetoelastic energy functional featuring a mixed Eulerian-Lagrangian structure. Neglecting Zeeman and anisotropic contributions, we characterize the asymptotic behavior in the sense of Gamma-convergence for the sum of a nonlinear magnetoelastic energy, a symmetric exchange term defined on the actual configuration, and for the associated magnetostatic self-energy. After establishing compactness of displacements and magnetizations with equibounded energy, we identify the limiting energy functional as the sum of a quadratic homogenized magnetoelastic contribution with a limiting homogenized exchange and magnetostatic term. This is, to the authors' knowledge, the first homogenization result for manifold-valued mixed Eulerian-Lagrangian energies.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolic $O (N)$ linear sigma model and its mean-field limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study large $N$ limits of the hyperbolic $O(N)$ linear sigma model ($\text{HLSM}_N$) on the two-dimensional torus $\mathbb T^2$, namely, a system of $N$ interacting stochastic damped nonlinear wave equations (SdNLW) with coupled cubic nonlinearities. After establishing (pathwise) global well-posedness of $\text{HLSM}_N$ and the limiting equation, called the mean-field SdNLW, we first establish convergence of $\text{HLSM}_N$ to the mean-field SdNLW with general initial data (under a suitable assumption). In particular, for the local-in-time convergence, we obtain a convergence rate of order $N^{- \frac 12 + \varepsilon}$ for any $ \varepsilon &gt; 0$. We then show that the invariant Gibbs dynamics for $\text{HLSM}_N$) converges to that for the mean-field SdNLW with a convergence rate of order $N^{- \frac 12 + \varepsilon}$ on any large time intervals.</description>

      <title>Sharp non-uniqueness for the Boussinesq equation with fractional dissipation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on the $d$-dimensional ($d\geq2$) Boussinesq equation with fractional dissipation $(-\Delta)^{\alpha}$ on the torus. We show that the uniqueness property breaks down within the function space $L^p_tL^\infty_x$ for any $p&lt;\frac{2\alpha}{2\alpha-1}$ when $1\leq\alpha&lt;\frac{d+1}{2}$ and the function space $L^\frac{2\alpha}{2\alpha-1}_tL^q_x$ for any $q&lt;\infty$ when $1&lt;\alpha&lt;\frac{d+1}{2}$. Moreover, the weak solutions we construct are smooth outside a set of singular times with Hausdorff dimension arbitrarily small. This result is sharp, as weak-strong uniqueness holds in the space $L^{\frac{2\alpha}{2\alpha-1}}_TL^\infty_x$.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the Chern-Simons Higgs models for p-Laplacian on a connected finite graph, employing topological degree theory as our main tool. Notably, we overcome the difficulties arising from the nonlinearity of p-Laplacian operator and calculate the corresponding topological degree through a more general approach.</description>

      <title>Anelastic approximation for the degenerate compressible Navier--Stokes equations revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we revisit the joint low-Mach and low-Frode number limit for the compressible Navier-Stokes equations with degenerate, density-dependent viscosity. Employing the relative entropy framework based on the concept of $\kappa$-entropy, we rigorously justify the convergence of weak solutions toward the generalized anelastic system in a three-dimensional periodic domain for well-prepared initial data. For general ill-prepared initial data, we establish a similar convergence result in the whole space, relying essentially on dispersive estimates for acoustic waves. Compared with the work of Fanelli and Zatorska [Commun. Math. Phys., 400 (2023), pp. 1463-1506], our analysis is conducted for the standard isentropic pressure law, thereby eliminating the need for the cold pressure term that played a crucial role in the previous approach. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first rigorous singular limit result for the compressible Navier-Stokes equations with degenerate viscosity that requires no additional regularization of the system.</description>

      <title>Dimension reduction for a coupled electro-elastic saddle-point problem at finite strains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the finite deformation of a thin, elastically heterogeneous sheet subject to electrostatic coupling. The interaction between mechanics and electrostatics is formulated as a saddle-point problem involving the deformation and the electrostatic potential. Starting from a three-dimensional electro-elastic model with prestrain in the elastic energy, we rigorously derive a reduced plate model in the bending regime. To perform the dimension reduction, that is, to derive the energy of a thin object by taking a suitable limit as its thickness tends to zero, we apply $\Gamma$-convergence-type methods to the underlying saddle-point problem. In the case of bivariate functionals, this convergence is understood in an adapted epi/hypo-convergence sense. In this concept, we demonstrate the convergence of the rescaled electro-elastic problems to an effective two-dimensional bending model coupled to electric effects. We verify that cluster points of saddle points are saddle points for the limit.</description>

      <title>3D Modeling of Solar Oscillations with Hybridizable Discontinuous Galerkin Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With increasing quantity and quality of solar observations, it becomes essential to account for three-dimensional heterogeneities in wave modeling for seismic data interpretation. In this context, we present a 3D solver of the time-harmonic adiabatic stellar oscillation equations without background flows on a domain consisting of the Sun and its photosphere. The background medium consists of 3D heterogeneities on top of a radial strongly-stratified standard solar model. The oscillation equations are solved with the Hybridizable Discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) method, considering a first-order formulation in terms of the vector displacement and the pressure perturbation. This method combines the high-order accuracy and the parallelism of DG methods while yielding smaller linear systems. These are solved with a direct solver, with block low-rank compression and mixed-precision arithmetic to reduce memory footprint. The trade-off between compression and solution accuracy is investigated, and our 3D solver is validated by comparing with resolution under axial symmetry for solar backgrounds. The capacity of the solver is illustrated with wave speed heterogeneities characteristic of two physical phenomena: active regions and convection. We show the importance of global 3D gravito-acoustic wave simulations, in particular when the amplitudes of the perturbations are strong and their effect on the wavefield cannot be estimated by linear approximations.</description>

Abstract: We study an elliptic equation, with homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions, driven by a mixed type operator (the sum of the Laplacian and the fractional Laplacian), involving a parametric reaction and an undetermined source term. Applying a recent abstract critical point theorem of Ricceri, we prove existence of a solution for a convenient source and small enough parameters.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the existence and regularity of weak solutions to the following quasilinear elliptic system: \[ \begin{cases}
  -\mathrm{div}(A_k(x, u_k) |\nabla u_k|^{p_k - 2} \nabla u_k) + \dfrac{1}{p_k} D_s A_k(x, u_k) |\nabla u_k|^{p_k} = g_k(x, u) \quad \text{in } \Omega,
  u_k = 0 \quad \text{on } \partial\Omega, \qquad k=1,\dots,d, \end{cases} \] where $ \Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^N $ is a bounded domain with $ N \geq 2 $, $ \boldsymbol{p} = (p_1, \dots, p_d) $, $ p_k &gt; 1 $. Using tools from nonsmooth critical point theory, we prove the existence of infinitely many weak solutions in $ W_0^{1,\boldsymbol{p}}(\Omega) \cap L^\infty(\Omega; \mathbb{R}^d) $, where $W_0^{1,\boldsymbol p}(\Omega)=W_0^{1,p_1}(\Omega)\times\dots\times W_0^{1,p_d}(\Omega)$.</description>

      <title>Fractional higher differentiability of solutions to the stationary Orlicz-Stokes system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work concerns the stationary Stokes system subject to Orlicz type growth conditions. Fractional regularity properties of the symmetric gradient of local solutions are established, depending on a balance between the nonlinearity of the differential operator and the degree of integrability of the right-hand side in Orlicz spaces. This regularity is described via the membership of a non linear expression of the symmetric gradient in Besov spaces. The fractional regularity of the pressure term is also exhibited and is formulated in terms of Orlicz-Besov spaces. Parallel results for the symmetric gradient of local solutions to the associated plain elliptic system are also offered. A new version of a Poincar\'e-Sobolev inequality in Orlicz spaces, in modular form, on domains with finite measure plays a role in the proofs.</description>

      <title>Multiplicity of solutions for semilinear Robin problems involving sign-changing nonlinearities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we investigate the existence and multiplicity of solutions to the Robin problem \begin{equation*}
  \begin{cases}
  -\Delta u = \lambda f(u) &amp; \text{in } \Omega,
  \frac{\partial u}{\partial \nu} + \gamma u=0 &amp; \text{on } \partial\Omega,
  \end{cases} \end{equation*} where $\Omega\subset \mathbb{R}^N$ ($N\geq 1$) is a smooth bounded domain, and $\lambda, \gamma&gt;0$. Our main assumption is that $f\colon \mathbb{R}\to \mathbb{R}$ is a locally Lipschitz function, possibly sign-changing, such that $f(s)&gt;0$ for every $s\in (\alpha,\beta)$, where $0&lt;\alpha&lt;\beta$ are two zeros of $f$. Without any further conditions, we establish the existence of two nonnegative solutions whose maximum lies in $(\alpha,\beta)$ for sufficiently large $\lambda$.
  Moreover, we analyse the limiting behaviour of the solution set of this Robin problem, showing that it degenerates into that of the associated Neumann problem as $\gamma\to 0$ and into that of the associated Dirichlet problem as $\gamma\to\infty$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish necessary and sufficient conditions for the closedness of the range of a class of first-order differential operators associated with an involutive structure on $M\times\mathbb{T}^m$, where $M$ is a non-compact manifold satisfying suitable geometric assumptions and $\mathbb{T}^m$ is the $m$-dimensional torus. In addition, we prove that a weaker notion of global hypoellipticity ensures the closedness of the range for differential operators on smooth paracompact manifolds, thereby extending to the non-compact setting a result previously obtained by G.~Ara\'ujo, I.~Ferra, and L.~Ragognette [J. Anal. Math. 148, No. 1, 85-118, 2022] for compact manifolds.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the three-dimensional fluid-structure interaction system modeling a system consisting of a viscous incompressible fluid and an elastic plate forming its moving upper boundary. The fluid is described by the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations with a free upper boundary that evolves according to the motion of the structure, coupled via the velocity- and stress-matching conditions. We show that under a rather general condition on the initial data, there exists a global-in-time weak solution of the system. In particular, there is no contact between the plate and the bottom boundary.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building on the free-probability stochastic control framework introduced in arXiv:2502.17329, we connect optimal control problems for $n \times n$ random matrix ensembles with their infinite-dimensional, free-probability analogues. Under natural convexity hypotheses, we prove that the non-commutative value function captures the large-$n$ limit of the corresponding finite-matrix control problems. As an application, we give a new perspective on the Laplace principle for convex functionals in the theory of large deviations for random matrices.</description>

      <title>Resolving Sharp Gradients of Unstable Singularities to Machine Precision via Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent work introduced a robust computational framework combining embedded mathematical structures, advanced optimization, and neural network architecture, leading to the discovery of multiple unstable self-similar solutions for key fluid dynamics equations, including the Incompressible Porous Media (IPM) and 2D Boussinesq systems. While this framework confirmed the existence of these singularities, an accuracy level approaching double-float machine precision was only achieved for stable and 1st unstable solutions of the 1D C\'ordoba-C\'ordoba-Fontelos model. For highly unstable solutions characterized by extreme gradients, the accuracy remained insufficient for validation. The primary obstacle is the presence of sharp solution gradients. Those gradients tend to induce large, localized PDE residuals during training, which not only hinder convergence, but also obscure the subtle signals near the origin required to identify the correct self-similar scaling parameter lambda of the solutions. In this work, we introduce a gradient-normalized PDE residual re-weighting scheme to resolve the high-gradient challenge while amplifying the critical residual signals at the origin for lambda identification. Coupled with the multi-stage neural network architecture, the PDE residuals are reduced to the level of round-off error across a wide spectrum of unstable self-similar singularities previously discovered. Furthermore, our method enables the discovery of new highly unstable singularities, i.e. the 4th unstable solution for IPM equations and a novel family of highly unstable solitons for the Nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations. This results in achieving high-gradient solutions with high precision, providing an important ingredient for bridging the gap between numerical discovery and computer-assisted proofs for unstable phenomena in nonlinear PDEs.</description>

      <title>Non-radiative solutions and long-time dynamics of 5D focusing energy-critical wave equation in the radial case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we discuss the long-time dynamics of the radial solutions to the focusing energy-critical wave equation in 5-dimensional space. We give some details about the asymptotic behaviour, topological structure and time evolution of the non-radiative solutions to this equation. As an application we prove a quantitative version of soliton resolution theorem for solutions defined for all time $t&gt;0$, which immediately verifies the soliton resolution conjecture in the radial case, without a priori boundedness assumption on the energy norm of solution as time tends to infinity. The main tool of this work is the radiation theory of wave equations and the major observation of this work is a correspondence between the radiation and the soliton collision behaviour of solutions.</description>

      <title>Results of Fractional Rough Burgers equation in $H^s$ space and its application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the well-posedness of Fractional Rough Burgers equation driven by space-time noise in $H^s(\m T)$ space. For the higher dissipation $\gamma\in(\frac{4}{3},2]$, we establish local well-posedness. Global well-posedness is further obtained when $\gamma$ is restricted to the interval $(\frac{3}{2}, 2]$. For the lower dissipation $\gamma\in(\frac{5}{4},\frac{4}{3}]$, we use the regularity analysis derivation the para-controlled solution.</description>

      <title>Entropic Chaos of Mixed Mean-Field Jump Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies a class of mixed mean-field jump processes on an abstract state space $\Pi$, together with their associated $N$-particle systems. The dynamics consist of the superposition of an independent Markovian component and a bounded mean-field jump interaction; in particular, piecewise deterministic Markov processes (PDMPs) with mean-field interactions are covered by this framework. Under a second-order bounded difference condition on the mean-field jump kernel, we establish entropic propagation of chaos as $N \to \infty$. In particular, we obtain an explicit qualitative bound on the relative entropy between the law of the $N$-particle system and the product measure induced by the mean-field limit. The proof relies on the second-order concentration inequality introduced in G\"otze and Sambale, 2020.</description>

      <title>A limsup fast dynamo on $\mathbb{T}^3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a time-dependent, incompressible, and uniformly-in-time Lipschitz continuous velocity field on $\mathbb{T}^3$ that produces exponential growth of the magnetic energy along a subsequence of times, for every positive value of the magnetic diffusivity. Because this growth is not uniform in time but occurs only along a diverging sequence of times, we refer to the resulting mechanism as a limsup fast dynamo. Our construction is based on suitably rescaled Arnold-Beltrami-Childress (ABC) flows, each supported on long time intervals. The analysis employs perturbation theory to establish continuity of the exponential growth rate with respect to both the initial data and the diffusivity parameter. This proves the weak form of the fast dynamo conjecture formulated by Childress and Gilbert on $\mathbb{T}^3$, but the considerably more challenging version proposed by Arnold on $\mathbb{T}^3$ remains an open problem.</description>

      <title>Infinite-dimensional nonlinear stationary Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove existence of a probability solution to the nonlinear stationary Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov equation on an infinite dimensional space with a centered Gaussian measure $\gamma$ with a unit diffusion operator and a drift of the form $-x+v(p,x)$, where $v$ is a bounded mapping with values in the Cameron-Martin space $H$ of $\gamma$ and $v$ is defined on the space $E\times X$, where is $E$ is the subset of $L^2(\gamma)$ consisting of probability densities. The equation has the form $L_{b(p,\bullet)} ^*(p\cdot \gamma)=0$ with $L_{b(p,\bullet)}\varphi =\Delta_H \varphi + (b(p,\bullet) , D_{_H}\varphi)_{_H}$, so that the drift coefficient depends on the unknown solution, which makes the equation nonlinear. This dependence is assumed to satisfy a suitable continuity condition. This result is applied to drifts of Vlasov type defined by means of the convolution of a vector field with the solution. In addition, we consider a more general situation where only the components of $v$ are uniformly bounded and prove the existence of a probability solution under some stronger continuity condition on the drift.</description>

      <title>An extension to Banach stackings of the Brezis--Pazy semigroup-convergence theorem, with applications to $\lambda$-convex gradient flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A 1972 theorem by Brezis and Pazy establishes the uniform convergence of nonlinear semigroups generated by $\omega$-accretive operators on a Banach space. Our goal is to expand the setting of this theorem to include nonlinear semigroups that are acting on different Banach spaces. This is useful, for example, to prove discrete-to-continuum convergence for graph-based gradient flows. We name the general setting in which our theorem holds a Banach stacking.
  We give three main applications of the extended theorem that are of independent interest. The first establishes uniform convergence of semigroups in a Banach stacking if the generators of the semigroups converge pointwise. The second is a proof of uniform convergence for gradient flows of $\Gamma$-converging $\lambda$-convex functions on a Banach stacking of Hilbert spaces; the third a proof of uniform convergence for gradient flows of $\Gamma$-converging functions that satisfy a convexity condition that was formulated by B\'enilan and Crandall in a 1991 publication (and which we term `$P_0$-convexity') on a Banach stacking of $L^p$ spaces, corresponding to the $TL^p$ space introduced by Garc\'ia Trillos and Slep\v{c}ev in a 2016 paper.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.23250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a stationary drift-diffusion system with ionic charge carriers and external generation of electron and hole charge carriers. This system arises, among other applications, in the context of semiconductor modeling for perovskite solar cells. Thanks to truncation techniques and iterative energy estimates, we show the existence and uniform upper and lower bounds on the solutions. The dependency of the bounds on the various parameters of the model is investigated numerically on physically relevant test cases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.23270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the HED Method for the Mullins-Sekerka evolution in the plane. We identify a natural notion of distance, intrinsic to the interface itself. Using this distance, the energy, and the dissipation, we develop natural assumptions on the flow and, assuming existence of a solution satisfying these conditions, establish not just the algebraic rate (previously derived by Chugreeva, Otto, and M. G. Westdickenberg) but also the sharp leading order constant for the convergence to the flat limiting interface.</description>

We then study the associated parabolic problem, proving local and global existence, uniqueness and global behavior such as stabilization, finite time extinction and blow up.</description>

      <title>Wasserstein-{\L}ojasiewicz inequalities and asymptotics of McKean-Vlasov equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.23361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove convergence to equilibrium for solutions to the McKean-Vlasov (granular media) equation on the flat torus in a genuinely nonconvex setting. Our approach is based on a Wasserstein-{\L}ojasiewicz gradient inequality for the associated free energy, established under mild analyticity assumptions on the confinement and interaction potentials; this yields convergence of the corresponding Wasserstein gradient flow without any convexity assumptions and without postulating log-Sobolev related functional inequalities. We expect this strategy to extend to more general nonconvex Wasserstein gradient flows; in the present work we develop it in the McKean-Vlasov setting, with the Keller-Segel chemotaxis model on the torus as a key application.</description>

      <title>Convergence and front position for an FKPP-type free boundary problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The free boundary problem\[ \begin{cases} \partial_tu=\frac{1}{2}\Delta u+u,\quad &amp;t&gt;0, \, x&gt;L_t,\\ u(t,x)=0,\quad &amp;t&gt;0,\, x\le L_t,\\ \int_{L_t}^{\infty}u(t,y)dy=1,\quad &amp;t&gt; 0,\\ u(t,x)dx \to u_0(dx)&amp;\text{weakly as }t\to 0, \end{cases}\] has long been conjectured to be in the universality class of the so-called FKPP reaction-diffusion equation. It appears naturally as the hydrodynamic limit of a branching-selection particle system, the $N$-BBM. In the present work, we show that for any initial condition $u_0(dx)$ that decays fast enough as $x\to\infty$, the solution of the free boundary problem converges to the minimal travelling wave solution. We further show how the decay of the initial condition precisely determines the position of the free boundary $L_t$ at large times $t$, mirroring the celebrated results of Bramson \cite{Bramson1983} in the context of the FKPP equation. Our conditions for convergence to the minimal travelling wave, and for $L_t$ to have the Bramson asymptotics \[ L_t=\sqrt{2}t-\frac{3}{2\sqrt{2}}\log t+c+o(1)\quad\text{as }t\to\infty,\] are necessary and sufficient. We also apply our results to a more general free boundary problem that depends on a parameter $\beta$, where we see a transition from \emph{pulled} to \emph{pushed} behaviour (with \emph{pushmi-pullyu} behaviour at the critical value of $\beta$). We obtain analogous sharp conditions for convergence to the minimal travelling wave, along with precise asymptotics for the front position, in each of these regimes. To our knowledge, such necessary and sufficient conditions had not previously been established in the pushmi-pullyu or pushed regimes, even for classical monostable reaction-diffusion equations. Our results prove and extend non-rigorous predictions in the physics literature of the first author, Brunet and Derrida.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.21943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the stability of Minkowski inequality for nearly spherical domains that are $C^1$ close to the ball. We show the stability inequalities between the positive part of the $\sigma_k$ curvature integrals for $C^1$ perturbations of a ball; we also establish the stability inequalities for axially symmetric $C^1$ perturbations of a ball. Finally, we construct a counterexample, illustrating that the inequalities become invalid if we do not compensate the integral with the negative part of the curvature. Our work generalizes Glaudo's results on the mean curvature integral to the fully nonlinear cases.</description>

      <title>A Novel $J_M$-Based Method for Interpolation in Metric Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new interpolation method for metric spaces, termed the \emph{$J_M^{\prime}$-interpolated metric space}. Building on previous work where two interpolation methods were developed in analogy with Peetre's classical $K$ and $J$ methods, this approach introduces a distinct construction based on approximating sequences in the intersection space $X_0 \cap X_1$ equipped with the metric $J_M(1)$. The method defines a relative completion within the union space $X_0 \cup X_1$, yielding a well-defined interpolated metric space with controllable relationships between the $J_M$ and $K_M$ metrics. While we do not compare this method to the previously developed approaches nor explore its correspondence with classical interpolation functors in normed spaces, the construction enriches the set of tools available for metric-space interpolation theory. Furthermore, as expected, these methods still preserve the Lipschitz property of an operator between two interpolated spaces.
  Potential applications include general Nonlinear Analysis and Wasserstein-type spaces where the sequence-based nature of the method may provide practical advantages.</description>

      <title>Minimal jointly uniform attractor for nonautonomous random dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a notion of minimal uniform attractor for nonautonomous random dynamical systems, which depends jointly on time and on a random parameter. Several examples are provided to illustrate the concept and to compare it with existing notions of uniform attractors in the literature. We further apply the abstract theory to nonautonomous random differential equations with a non-compact symbol space. In particular, we develop a method to compactify the symbol space, by adapting techniques from the theory of deterministic nonautonomous differential equations. We also establish the stability of the minimal jointly uniform attractor by exploiting the relationship between deterministic and random dynamics. Finally, we show that such structures arise naturally in stochastic differential equations whose noise terms carry additional time dependence, by establishing a topological conjugacy between the resulting stochastic flows and suitable random differential equations.</description>

      <title>Maz'ya--Shaposhnikova Representation of Quasi-Norms of Ball Quasi-Banach Function Spaces on Spaces of Homogeneous Type with Weak Reverse Doubling Property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22960v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $Y(\mathcal{X})$ be a ball quasi-Banach function space on the space of homogeneous type $(\mathcal{X},\rho,\mu)$ satisfying some mild additional assumptions, $q\in(0,\infty)$, and $\dot{W}^{s,q}_Y(\mathcal{X})$ with $s\in(0,1)$ be the homogeneous fractional Sobolev space associated with $Y(\mathcal{X})$. In this article, we show that, for any $f\in Y(\mathcal{X})\cap\bigcup_{s\in(0,1)} \dot{W}^{s,q}_Y(\mathcal{X})$, \begin{align*} \|f\|_{Y(\mathcal{X})} &amp;\lesssim\varliminf_{s \to 0^+} s^{\frac{1}{q}}\left\| \left\{\int_{\mathcal{X}} \frac{|f(\cdot)-f(y)|^q}{U(\cdot,y)[\rho(\cdot,y)]^{sq}} \, d\mu(y) \right\}^{\frac{1}{q}}\right\|_{{Y(\mathcal{X})}}\\ &amp;\leq \varlimsup_{s \to 0^+} s^{\frac{1}{q}}\left\|\left\{\int_{\mathcal{X}} \frac{|f(\cdot)-f(y)|^q}{U(\cdot,y)[\rho(\cdot,y)]^{sq}} \, d\mu(y) \right\}^{\frac{1}{q}}\right\|_{{Y(\mathcal{X})}} \lesssim\|f\|_{Y(\mathcal{X})}, \end{align*} where $U(x,y):=\min\{\mu(B(x,\rho(x,y))),\,\mu(B(y,\rho(x,y)))\}$ for any $x,y\in\mathcal{X}$ and the implicit positive constants are independent of $f$, which is applied to ten specific ball quasi-Banach function spaces and hence is of wide generality. In particular, when $Y(\mathcal{X})=L^q(\mathbb{R}^n)$ with $q\in[1,\infty)$, the above formula is closely related to the celebrated result of Maz'ya and Shaposhnikova in 2002. We also establish the above representation formula on domains of $\mathcal{X}$. The main novelty lies in proposing two new concepts, namely the weak reverse doubling condition (for $\mathcal{X}$) and the weak measure density condition (for domains of $\mathcal{X}$), which are proved to be necessary in some sense. In addition, we find an interesting fact that, when the underlying space under consideration is bounded, the above Maz'ya--Shaposhnikova-type limit always tends to zero.</description>

Abstract: We consider Riemannian manifolds $(M^n,g_0)$, $(M^n,h)$, where $(M^n,h)$ is smooth, complete, with curvature bounded in absolute value by $K_0 &lt; \infty$, and $(1-\varepsilon_0(n)) h \leq g_0 \leq (1+\varepsilon_0(n)) h$ for some small $\varepsilon_0(n)&gt;0$. It was shown by Simon (2002) that a Ricci-DeTurck flow solution $g(t)_{t \in (0,T)}$ related to $g_0$ exists for some $T=T(n,K_0)&gt;0$. If $g_0 \in L^2_{\mathrm{loc}}$ or $g_0 \in W^{1,2+2\sigma}_{\mathrm{loc}}$, $\sigma \in (0,\frac{1}{4})$, respectively, we show that $g(t) \to g_0$ in the $L^2_{\mathrm{loc}}$- or $W^{1,2+\sigma}_{\mathrm{loc}}$-sense, respectively. If $M$ is closed, $g_0 \in W^{1,2+\sigma}(M)$ for some $\sigma&gt;0$, and the distributional scalar curvature of Lee-LeFloch (2015) is not less than $b \in \mathbb{R}$, then we show that $g(t)$ has scalar curvature not less than $b$ in the smooth sense for all $t&gt;0$.</description>

      <title>Linear and nonlinear late-time tails on dynamical black hole spacetimes via time integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove the global leading-order late-time asymptotic behaviour of solutions to inhomogeneous wave equations on dynamical black hole exterior backgrounds that settle down to Schwarzschild backgrounds with arbitrarily small decay rates. In particular, we show that for non-spherically symmetric solutions arising from compactly supported initial data, the late-time decay deviates from Price's law -- governing the decay for stationary black hole backgrounds -- by exhibiting slower time decay by exactly one additional power.
  Our proof is based around the observation that the emergence of late-time "tails", featuring inverse-polynomial decay in time, is intimately connected to conformal irregularity properties in space (towards future null infinity) of time integrals of the solutions. This relationship is exploited through a purely physical-space approach based around energy estimates, in which the dynamical wave operator is treated as a Schwarzschild wave operator with an inhomogeneous term. Going from almost-sharp decay to global asymptotics is achieved by exploiting this relation for the difference between the solution and a carefully chosen global tail function.
  We further apply our method to several examples of nonlinear wave equations and comment on its robustness to more general settings, such as dynamical spacetimes converging to sub-extremal Kerr spacetimes and higher-dimensional wave operators with even or odd spacetime dimensions.</description>

      <title>Convergence rates of self-repelling diffusions on Riemannian manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a class of self-repelling diffusions on compact Riemannian manifolds whose drift is the gradient of a potential accumulated along their trajectory. When the interaction potential admits a suitable spectral decomposition, the dynamics and its environment are equivalent to a finite-dimensional degenerate diffusion. We show that this diffusion is a second-order lift of an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process whose invariant law corresponds to the Gaussian invariant measure of the environment, and immediately obtain a general upper bound on the rate of convergence to stationarity using the framework of second-order lifts. Furthermore, using a flow Poincar\'e inequality, we develop lower bounds on the convergence rate. We show that, in the periodic case, these lower bounds improve upon those of Bena\"im and Gauthier (Probab. Theory Relat. Fields, 2016), and even match the order of the upper bound in some cases.</description>

      <title>Two energy methods for distributed port-Hamiltonian systems and their application to stability analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23336v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop two local energy methods for distributed parameter port-Hamiltonian (pH) systems on one-dimensional spatial domains. The methods are applied to derive a characterization of exponential stability directly in terms of the energy passing through the boundary over a given time horizon. The resulting condition is verified for a network of vibrating strings where existing sufficient conditions cannot be applied. Moreover, we use a local energy method to study the short-time behavior of pH systems with boundary damping which was recently studied in the context of hypocoercivity.</description>

Abstract: We establish global-in-time well-posedness of the one-dimensional hydrodynamic Gross-Pitaevskii equations in the absence of vacuum in $(1 + H^s) \times H^{s-1}$ with $s \geq 1$. We achieve this by a reduction via the Madelung transform to the previous global-in-time well-posedness result for the Gross-Pitaevskii equation in arXiv:1801.08386v2 [math.AP] and arXiv:2204.06293v1 [math.AP]. Our core result is a local bilipschitz equivalence between the relevant function spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06534v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optimal transport has found numerous applications across data science, many of which require differentiating the optimal transport map with respect to the underlying probability densities in the Fr\'echet sense. In this work, we show that when the reference measure $Q$ is sufficiently regular in space and the curve of target measures $\{P_t\}_{t\in I}$ is both spatially regular and $\mathcal{C}^1$ in time, then the associated curve of optimal transport maps $\{\nabla \phi_t\}_{t\in I}$ pushing $Q$ toward $P_t$ is itself a $\mathcal{C}^1$ curve. Moreover, we identify its time derivative as the solution to the \emph{linearized Monge--Amp\`ere equation}, a second-order elliptic PDE with strictly oblique boundary conditions and a vanishing zero-order term. Our proof relies on applying the implicit function theorem to the Monge--Amp\`ere equation with natural boundary conditions. As consequences, we establish regularity of the transport-based quantile regressor with respect to the covariates and derive a central limit theorem for smooth optimal transport maps.</description>

Abstract: We consider initial-boundary value problems (IBVPs) on a finite interval for the system of the energy balance equation and Guyer-Krumhansl constitutive equation. Boundary conditions comprise various models of behavior of a physical system at the boundaries, including boundary conditions describing Newton's law, which states that the heat flux at the boundary is directly proportional to the difference in the temperature of the physical system and ambient temperature. In this case the boundary conditions express the relationship of unknown functions (temperature or internal energy and heat flux) with each other. To solve the problems, we apply the Fokas unified transform method. To illustrate the final formulae, we consider a numerical example for a special case in which heat exchange at one of the boundaries obeys Newton's law.</description>

Abstract: We study the singular limit of Fokker-Planck equation of polymers density as the dominant time-scale of small scale component of turbulent flow goes to zero. Here, we complete the study of Flandoli-Tahraoui[arXiv:2410.00520] about scaling limit as the space-scale of small scale component of turbulent flow goes to zero by using stochastic modeling of turbulence. Depending on certain parameters related to turbulence modeling, the limit density has generalized Cauchy distribution for the end-to-end vector. We discuss also the limit when we don't have a probability density limit. Our approach is based on the derivation of an appropriate estimates on $L^2$ with appropriate weight and investigate the convergence.</description>

      <title>The effects of pressure loads in the dimension reduction of elasticity models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15864v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the dimensional reduction from three to two dimensions in hyperelastic materials subject to a live load, modeled as a constant pressure force. Our results demonstrate that this loading has a significant impact in higher-order scaling regimes, namely those associated with von K\'arm\'an-type theories, where a nontrivial interplay arises between the elastic energy and the pressure term. In contrast, we rigorously show that in lower-order bending regimes, as described by Kirchhoff-type theories, the pressure load does not influence the minimizers. Finally, after identifying the corresponding $\Gamma$-limit, we conjecture that a similar independence from the pressure term persists in the most flexible membrane regimes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.12232v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish the global existence of higher-order Sobolev solutions for a non-local integrable evolution equation arising in the study of pseudospherical surfaces and non-linear wave propagation. Under a natural assumption on the initial momentum, we prove that the solution remains globally regular in arbitrary finite-order Sobolev spaces. The proof relies on an inductive energy method involving a hierarchy of functional estimates and applies to both the periodic and non-periodic settings. We determine a criterion for the existence of blow-up solutions. The consequences of these qualitative properties of the solutions on Riemannian surfaces determined by the solutions of the equation are investigated.</description>

Abstract: We study finite-time blow-up for the one-dimensional nonlinear wave equation with a quadratic time-derivative nonlinearity, \[ u_{tt}-u_{xx}=(u_t)^2,\qquad (x,t)\in\mathbb R\times[0,T). \] Building on the work of Ghoul, Liu, and Masmoudi \cite{ghoul2025blow} on the spatial-derivative analogue, we establish the non-existence of smooth, exact self-similar blow-up profiles. Instead we construct an explicit family of \emph{generalised self-similar} solutions, bifurcating from the ODE blow-up, that are smooth within the past light cone and exhibit type-I blow-up at a prescribed point \((x_0,T)\). We further prove asymptotic stability of these profiles under small perturbations in the energy topology.</description>

      <title>Intermittent Solutions of the Stationary 2D Surface Quasi-Geostrophic Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16583v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we construct non-trivial solutions to the stationary dissipative surface quasi-geostrophic equation on the two dimensional torus which lie strictly below the critical regularity threshold of $\dot{B}^{-1/2}_{\infty,\infty}(\mathbb{T}^2)$. Specifically, for any $\alpha &lt; 1/2$ and any dissipation exponent $0 &lt; \gamma \leq 2$ we construct non-trivial solutions such that
  $$
  u,\theta \in \dot{B}^{\alpha-1}_{\infty,\infty}(\mathbb{T}^2) \cap \dot{B}^{\alpha-1}_{2,2}(\mathbb{T}^2).
  $$
  Due to the fact our solutions do not lie in $\dot{H}^{-1/2}(\mathbb{T}^2)$, this requires reinterpreting the notion of a solution. This leads us to formulate the notion of a weak paraproduct solution for the stationary SQG equation. The main new ingredient is the incorporation of intermittency into the construction of the solutions. This allows us to demonstrate non-trivial integrability results for certain fractional derivatives of our solutions. In particular, for highly intermittent solutions, we are able to conclude $u$ and $\theta$ are $L^1(\mathbb{T}^2)$.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the following Robin eigenvalue problem \begin{equation*} \left\{ \begin{array}{ll} -\Delta u=\mu u\,\, &amp;\text{in}\,\, B,\\ \partial_\texttt{n} u+\alpha u=0 &amp;\text{on}\,\, \partial B \end{array} \right. \end{equation*} on the unit ball of $\mathbb{R}^N$. We obtain the complete spectral structure of this problem. In particular, for $\alpha&gt;0$, the first eigenvalue is $k_{\nu,1}^2$ and the second eigenvalue is $k_{\nu+1,1}^2$, where $k_{\nu+l,m}$ is the $m$th positive zero of $kJ_{\nu+l+1}(k)-(\alpha+l) J_{\nu+l}(k)$. Moreover, when $\alpha\in(-l,1-l)$ with any $l\in \mathbb{N}$, one has $l$ negative (strictly increasing) eigenvalues $-\widehat{k}_{\nu+i,1}^2$ with $i\in\{0,\ldots,l-1\}$ where $\widehat{k}_{\nu+l,1}$ denotes the unique zero of $\alpha I_{\nu+l}(k)+lI_{\nu+l}(k)+kI_{\nu+l+1}(k)$; while, for $\alpha=-l$, besides $l$ negative (increasing) eigenvalues, $0$ is also an eigenvalue.</description>

Abstract: We study the existence and multiplicity of positive normalized solutions with prescribed $L^{2}$-norm for the Sobolev critical Schr\"odinger equation $-\Delta U + V(x) U = \lambda U + |U|^{2^*-2} U$ in $\mathbb{R}^N$, $\int_{\mathbb{R}^N} U^2\,dx = \rho^2$, where $N \ge 3$, $V\ge 0$ is a trapping potential, $\lambda \in \mathbb{R}$ and $2^*=\frac{2N}{N-2}$. Our first result is that the existence of local minimum solutions for $\rho \in (0, \rho^*)$, for some suitable $\rho^* &gt; 0$, under appropriate assumptions on the potential. These solutions correspond to ground states. Our second result concerns the existence of mountain pass solutions, under the same assumptions.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, by adapting the perturbation method, we study normalized standing wave solutions for the following nonlinear Schr\"odinger-Bopp-Podolsky system:
  - Delta u + q(x) phi u = omega u + f(u) in Omega, - Delta phi + a^2 Delta^2 phi = q(x) u^2 in Omega,
  where Omega is a smooth bounded domain in R^3, a &gt; 0, and omega is the Lagrange multiplier associated with the L^2 mass constraint integral over Omega of u^2 equals mu, and f: R -&gt; R is a continuous function satisfying some technical conditions. In particular, we prove the existence of normalized solutions for all masses mu in an interval (0, mu_0), under either Navier or Neumann boundary conditions for phi. Moreover, when f is odd, we obtain multiplicity of normalized solutions; and if Omega is star-shaped, we further obtain a normalized ground state solution.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study a phase field model for a tumor growth model of Cahn--Hilliard type in which the often assumed parabolic relaxation of the chemical potential is replaced by a hyperbolic one. We show that the resulting initial-boundary value problem is well posed and that its solutions depend continuously on two given functions: one appearing in the mass balance equation and one in the nutrient equation, representing, respectively, sources of drugs (e.g. chemotherapy) and antiangiogenic therapy. We also discuss regularity properties of the solutions. Moreover, in the case of a constant proliferation function, we rigorously analyze the asymptotic behavior as the coefficient of the inertial term tends to zero, establishing convergence to the corresponding viscous Cahn--Hilliard tumor growth model. Our results apply to a broad class of double-well potentials, including nonsmooth ones.</description>

      <title>Late-time asymptotics for geometric wave equations with inverse-square potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.15838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.15838v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new, physical-space-based method for deriving the precise leading-order late-time behaviour of solutions to geometric wave equations on asymptotically flat spacetime backgrounds and apply it to the setting of wave equations with asymptotically inverse-square potentials on Schwarzschild black holes. This provides a useful toy model setting for introducing methods that are applicable to more general linear and nonlinear geometric wave equations, such as wave equations for electromagnetically charged scalar fields, wave equations on extremal Kerr black holes and geometric wave equations in even space dimensions, where existing proofs for deriving precise late-time asymptotics might not apply. The method we introduce relies on exploiting the spatial decay properties of time integrals of solutions to derive the existence and precise genericity properties of asymptotic late-time tails and obtain sharp, uniform decay estimates in time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.18112v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a construction of the fractional $\Phi^4$ Euclidean quantum field theory on $\mathbb{R}^3$ in the full subcritical regime via parabolic stochastic quantisation. Our approach is based on the use of a truncated flow equation for the effective description of the model at sufficiently small scales and on coercive estimates for the non-linear stochastic partial differential equation describing the interacting field. The measure is invariant under translations, reflection positive and has quartic exponential tails.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15050v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given two H\"older potentials $\phi_+$ and $\psi_-$ for the unilateral shift, we define anisotropic Banach spaces of distributions on the bilateral shift space with a finite alphabet. On these spaces, the transfer operator for the bilateral shift is quasicompact with a spectral gap, and the unique Gibbs state associated with $\phi_+$ spans its $1$-eigenspace. This result allows us to establish exponential decay of correlations for H\"older observables and a wide range of measures on the bilateral shift space.</description>

      <title>Reproving Friedlander's inequality with the de Rham complex</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03369v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inequalities between Dirichlet and Neumann eigenvalues of the Laplacian and of other differential operators have been intensively studied in the past decades. The aim of this paper is to introduce differential forms and the de Rham complex in the study of such inequalities. We show how differential forms lie hidden at the heart of the work of Rohleder on inequalities between Dirichlet and Neumann eigenvalues for the Laplacian on planar domains. Moreover, we extend the ideas of Rohleder to a new proof of Friedlander's inequality for any bounded Lipschitz domain.</description>

      <title>On the long-time limit of the mean curvature flow in closed manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03475v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article we show that generally almost regular flows, introduced by Bamler and Kleiner, in closed 3-manifolds will either go extinct in finite time or flow to a collection of smooth embedded minimal surfaces, possibly with multiplicity. Using a perturbative argument then we construct piecewise almost regular flows which either go extinct in finite time or flow to a stable minimal surface, possibly with multiplicity. We apply these results to construct minimal surfaces in 3-manifolds in a variety of circumstances, mainly novel from the point of the view that the arguments are via parabolic methods.</description>

      <title>Nonlocal perimeters and variations: Extremality and decomposability for finite and infinite horizons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05149v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the extremality and decomposability properties with respect to two types of nonlocal perimeters available in the literature, the Gagliardo perimeter based on the eponymous seminorms and the nonlocal distributional Caccioppoli perimeter, both with finite and infinite interaction ranges. A nonlocal notion of indecomposability associated to these perimeters is introduced, and we prove that in both cases it can be characterized solely in terms of the interaction range or horizon $\varepsilon$. Utilizing this, we show that it is possible to uniquely decompose a set into its $\varepsilon$-connected components, establishing a nonlocal analogue of the decomposition theorem of Ambrosio, Caselles, Masnou and Morel. Moreover, the extreme points of the balls induced by the Gagliardo and nonlocal total variation seminorm are identified, which naturally correspond to the two nonlocal perimeters. Surprisingly, while the extreme points in the former case are normalized indicator functions of $\varepsilon$-simple sets, akin to the classical TV-ball, in the latter case they are instead obtained from a nonlocal transformation applied to the extreme points of the TV-ball. Finally, we explore the nonlocal-to-local transition via a $\Gamma$-limit as $\varepsilon \rightarrow 0$ for both perimeters, recovering the classical Caccioppoli perimeter.</description>

      <title>On the zero-noise limit for SDE's singular at the initial time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22905v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the zero-noise limit for SDE's driven by Brownian motion with a divergence-free drift singular at the initial time and prove that a unique probability measure concentrated on the integral curves of the drift is selected. More precisely, we prove uniqueness of the zero-noise limit for divergence-free drifts in $L^1_{loc}((0,T];BV(\mathbb{T}^d;\mathbb{R}^d))\cap L^q((0,T);L^p(\mathbb{T}^d;\mathbb{R}^d))$ where $p$ and $q$ satisfy a Prodi-Serrin condition. The vector field constructed by Depauw [C. R. Acad. Sci. Paris, 2003] lies in this class and we show that for almost every intial datum, the zero-noise limit selects a probability measure concentrated on several distinct integral curves of this vector field.</description>

      <title>SDEs with critical general distributional drifts: sharp solvability and blow-ups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09244v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish weak well-posedness for SDEs having discontinuous diffusion coefficients and general distributional drifts that may introduce local blow up effects. Our drifts satisfy minimal assumptions, i.e.\,we assume only that the Cauchy problem for the Kolmogorov backward equation is well-posed in the standard Hilbert triple $W^{1,2} \hookrightarrow L^2 \hookrightarrow W^{-1,2}$. By a result of Mazya and Verbitsky, these assumptions are precisely those drifts that can be represented as the sum of a form-bounded component (encompassing, for example, Morrey or Chang-Wilson-Wolff drifts) and a divergence-free distributional component in the ${\rm BMO}^{-1}$ space of Koch and Tataru.
  We apply our results to finite particle systems with strong attracting interactions immersed in a turbulent flow. This includes particle systems of Keller-Segel type. Crucially, in dimensions $d \geq 3$, we cover almost the entire admissible range of attraction strengths, reaching nearly to the blow-up threshold.
  As a further application of our results for SDEs and of the theory of Bessel processes, we obtain an improved upper bound on the constant in the many-particle Hardy inequality. Consequently, the lower bound previously derived by Hoffmann-Ostenhof, Hoffmann-Ostenhof, Laptev, and Tidblom is shown to be close to optimal.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20376v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that it is impossible to quantify the decay rate of a semi-uniformly stable operator semigroup based on sole knowledge of the spectrum of its infinitesimal generator. More precisely, given an arbitrary positive function $r$ vanishing at $\infty$, we construct a Banach space $X$ and a bounded semigroup $ (T(t))_{t \geq 0}$ of operators on it whose infinitesimal generator $A$ has empty spectrum $\sigma(A)=\varnothing$, but for which, for some $x \in X$, $$ \limsup_{t\to\infty} \frac{\|T(t)A^{-1}x\|_{X}}{r(t)}=\infty. $$</description>
