      <title>Evidence for Supermassive Black Hole Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review the state of the evidence for the existence and observational appearance of supermassive black hole binaries. Such objects are expected from standard hierarchical galaxy evolution to form after two galaxies, each containing a supermassive black hole, have merged, in the centre of the merger remnant. A complex interaction is predicted to take place with stars and gas in the host galaxy, leading to observable signatures in weakly as well as actively accreting phases. Direct observational evidence is available and shows examples of dual active galactic nuclei from kpc scales down to parsec scales. Signatures of possibly closer supermassive black hole binaries may be seen in jetted black holes. The interaction with stars and gas in a galaxy significantly affects the hardening of the binary and hence contributes to uncertainties of the expected gravitational wave signal. The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) should in the future detect actual mergers. Before the launch of LISA, pulsar timing arrays may have the best chance to detect a gravitational wave signal from supermassive black hole binaries. The first signs of the combined background of inspiralling objects might have been seen already.</description>

      <title>XRISM/Resolve observations of Hercules X-1: vertical structure and kinematics of the disk wind</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: X-ray binary accretion disk winds can carry away a significant fraction of the originally infalling matter and hence strongly affect the accretion flow and the long-term evolution of the binary system. However, accurate measurements of their mass outflow rates are challenging due to uncertainties in our understanding of the 3D wind structure. Most studies employ absorption line spectroscopy that only gives us a single sightline through the wind streamlines. Hercules X-1 is a peculiar X-ray binary which allows us to avoid this issue, as its warped, precessing accretion disk naturally presents a range of sightlines through the vertical structure of its disk wind. Here we present the first results from a large, coordinated campaign on Her X-1 led by the new XRISM observatory and supported by XMM-Newton, NuSTAR and Chandra. We perform a time-resolved analysis and constrain the properties of the wind vertical structure. Thanks to the precision spectroscopy of XRISM/Resolve, we directly detect the Her X-1 orbital motion in the evolution of the outflow velocity. After correcting for this effect, we observe an increase in velocity from 250 km/s to 600 km/s as the wind rises to greater heights above the disk. The wind column density decreases with height, as expected, but its ionization parameter only evolves weakly, and is consistent with freezing out as the wind expands away. Additionally, we detect a new orbital dependence of the wind properties, revealing a likely second wind component that appears only briefly after the eclipse of Her X-1 by the secondary star.</description>

      <title>Two Possible Optical--X-Ray Anti-Correlations of PSR J1023+0038</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: X-ray emission is generally believed to be one of the major heating sources for the optical modulation in redback pulsar binaries as we have seen similar phenomena in many low mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs). While, e.g., MeV/GeV gamma-rays from the neutron stars are also possible heating sources, X-ray observations are currently much more sensitive, and therefore, joint optical--X-ray data are observationally unique on the irradiation mechanism investigation. Using 18 X-ray/B-band simultaneous XMM-Newton observations (717 ks in total) of the redback system PSR J1023+0038 taken during the LMXB state, we find a general trend that the amplitude of the B-band orbital modulation was lower when the observed X-ray flux was higher. Depending on the analysis method adopted, the statistical significance of the anti-correlation can be from 1.7sigma to 3.1sigma. We also extended the analysis to the GeV gamma-ray band using the Fermi-LAT data, but the result is insignificant to claim any relations. Moreover, another X-ray/optical correlation regarding the low modes of the system was found in some of the \textit{XMM-Newton} observations, and the astrophysical reason behind is currently unclear yet. These anti-correlations likely suggest that the irradiation is generally stronger when the X-ray flux is in a fainter state, indicating that there is a more dominant irradiation source than the X-ray emission.</description>

      <title>GPU-Accelerated X-ray Pulse Profile Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pulse-profile modeling (PPM) of thermal X-ray emission from rotation-powered millisecond pulsars enables simultaneous constraints on the mass $M$, radius $R$, and hence the equation of state of cold, dense matter. However, Bayesian PPM has faced a hard accuracy-speed bottleneck: current production resolutions used to keep inference tractable can under-resolve extreme hotspot geometries and bias the waveform computation, whereas the higher resolutions that remove this bias push forward models to minutes per evaluation, making inference impractical. We break this trade-off with, to our knowledge, the first public GPU-accelerated X-ray PPM framework that matches established benchmarks to within $\sim10^{-3}$ relative accuracy even for extreme geometries, while collapsing minutes-long high-fidelity computations to $2$--$5$ ms on an RTX 4080 ($10^{3}$--$10^{4}\times$ speedups), enabling posterior exploration at resolutions and complexities previously out of reach. We further uncover a bias near the interpolation boundaries of atmosphere lookup tables, demonstrate it with two diagnostic tests, and counter it with a mixed-order interpolator. Together, these advances enlarge the feasible hotspot model space and reduce key systematics in PPM, strengthening inferences for current and future X-ray missions.</description>

      <title>Spin-Orbit Misalignments of Eccentric Black Hole Mergers in AGN Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The disks of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) provide a natural environment where stellar-mass black holes (BHs) can dynamically pair, undergo repeated interactions, and eventually merge. It is commonly assumed that gas accretion will both efficiently spin up disk-embedded black holes and align the orbits of embedded binaries with the disk plane, leading to mergers with preferentially positive effective spin parameters ($\chi_{\mathrm{eff}}$). Such predictions have motivated the use of $\chi_{\mathrm{eff}}$ as a diagnostic for identifying candidate AGN-embedded mergers in the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA gravitational-wave catalog. In this work, we perform post-Newtonian $N$-body simulations of nearly planar binary-single encounters and apply an empirically motivated, gas-driven alignment prescription to characterize the expected $\chi_{\mathrm{eff}}$-eccentricity correlations of AGN-embedded mergers. By comparing the alignment and gravitational-wave inspiral timescales, we identify the regions of parameter space, across both disk location and binary properties, where full disk-spin-orbit alignment is effective and where it is not. We find that quasi-circular binaries typically align by the time they merge, supporting the standard picture of spin-orbit aligned orientations. By contrast, eccentric binaries (with in-band eccentricity $e_{10\mathrm{Hz}}\gtrsim 0.1$) typically inspiral too quickly for gas torques to act, preserving the post-encounter spin-orbit misalignments and yielding more isotropic $\chi_{\mathrm{eff}}$ distributions when disk densities and torque efficiencies are modest. This interplay naturally establishes a correlation between binary eccentricity and $\chi_{\mathrm{eff}}$ in AGN disks, highlighting a new key observable of the AGN channel and a potential explanation for massive events such as GW190521 and GW231123.</description>

      <title>Acceleration of Ultrahigh Energy Particles from Fast Radio Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two extreme events in the universe, fast radio bursts (FRBs) and cosmic rays (CRs), could be corelated, where FRBs with extreme field strength near their sources may contribute to CRs. This study investigates localized particle acceleration driven by FRB-like ultra-relativistic electromagnetic pulses. It is found ultra-high energy neutral plasma sheets form constantly via the front erosion of an FRB pulse. There are two ion acceleration regimes depending upon the field strength and the plasma density: the wakefield regime dominated by charge separation fields, and the piston regime driven by the $\mathbf{V}\times\mathbf{B}$ force of the pulses. The predicted energy scalings align well with particle-in-cell simulations. A power-law energy spectrum naturally arises with an index close to the CRs during FRB diffusion outward. Joint observations of FRBs and CRs may provide an opportunity to understand these extreme events and advance the development of multi-messenger astronomy.</description>

      <title>Explanation of the Mass Distribution of Binary Black Hole Mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational wave detectors are observing an increasing number of binary black hole (BBH) mergers, revealing a bimodal mass distribution of BBHs, which hints at diverse formation histories for these systems. Using the rapid binary population synthesis code MOBSE, we simulate a series of population synthesis models that include chemically homogeneous evolution (CHE). By considering metallicity-specific star formation and selection effects, we compare the intrinsic merger rates and detection rates of each model with observations. We find that the observed peaks in the mass distribution of merging BBHs at the low-mass end (10\msun) and the high-mass end (35\msun) are contributed by the common envelope channel or stable mass transfer channel (depending on the stability criteria for mass transfer) and the CHE channel, respectively, in our model. The merger rates and detection rates predicted by our model exhibit significant sensitivity to the choice of physical parameters. Different models predict merger rates ranging from 15.4 to $96.7\,\rm{Gpc^{-3}yr^{-1}}$ at redshift $z$ = 0.2, and detection rates ranging from 22.2 to 148.3$\mathrm{yr^{-1}}$ under the assumption of a detectable redshift range of $z \le$ 1.0.</description>

      <title>The very high energy view of gamma-ray bursts with the MAGIC telescopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are one of the main targets for the observations of the MAGIC telescopes. As a result of the effort in improving the sensitivity of the instrument and the automatic follow-up strategy, MAGIC detected two GRBs in the very-high-energy (VHE, $E&gt;100$ GeV) range, namely GRB 190114C and GRB 201216C. In GRB 190114C ($z=0.42$), the data collected by MAGIC revealed a new emission component at sub-TeV energies in the afterglow of the GRB. The very rich multi-wavelength dataset, spanning 17 orders of magnitude in energy, allowed to perform a detailed modelling of the broadband emission. The multi-wavelength data could be modelled within a one-zone synchrotron-self Compton scenario with internal $\gamma-\gamma$ absorption, where the model parameters are compatible with those found in previous GRB afterglow studies below GeV energies. Similarly, GRB 201216C broadband emission could be explained using the same model, although the amount of simultaneous multi-wavelength data is reduced with respect to GRB 190114C. In particular, GRB 201216C challenged the current MAGIC detection potential, as its redshift was determined to be $z=1.1$, strongly reducing the observed gamma-ray flux but making it the most distant source detected at VHE. These two detections, accompanied by evidence of VHE emission from a few more GRBs, opened up new questions such as the presence of sub-TeV emission in different classes and phases of GRBs. In this contribution we will present the status of the MAGIC GRB follow-up program, with an highlight on its detected GRBs. Moreover we will show the results on the GRBs observed by MAGIC from 2013 to 2019 with no evidence of VHE emission, in particular for those with simultaneous X-ray observations and redshift $z&lt;2$. We will discuss the implications of these results for GRB physics and the challenges and prospects for future GRB observations with MAGIC.</description>

      <title>A broadband study of FRB20240114A with the Effelsberg 100-m radio telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Effelsberg 100-m telescope observations of the hyperactive repeating fast radio burst source FRB 20240110A, discovered by CHIME/FRB in January 2024. Using the Ultra BroadBand (UBB) receiver, spanning 1.3-6.0 GHz, we detected over 700 unique bursts across four observing epochs. A comprehensive analysis of their temporal and spectral properties reveals four distinct spectro-temporal morphologies, including simple, complex and frequency-drifting structures. No bursts were detected across the full UBB band, confirming the band-limited emission typical of repeating FRBs. We find modest frequency evolution in burst widths but constant fractional bandwidths, and strong variability in burst rates that may be influenced by scintillation. The waiting-time distributions indicate predominantly independent burst events, with occasional clustering suggesting a characteristic emission timescale of $\sim$10 ms. Additionally, this study presents a multi-frequency analysis of waiting-time distributions, offering new insights into the complex frequency drifts commonly observed in repeating FRBs. These broadband observations provide a detailed view of the frequency-dependent burst behavior of FRB 20240110A and offer insights into the variability and temporal structure of repeating FRB emission.</description>

      <title>AT 2018cow at ~5 years: additional evidence for a tidal disruption origin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Luminous Fast Blue Optical Transient (LFBOT) AT 2018cow is the prototype of its class with an extensive set of multi-wavelength observations. Despite a rich data set there is, still, no consensus about the physical nature and origin of this event. AT 2018cow remained UV bright 2-4 years after the explosion, which points at an additional energy injection source, most likely from an accretion disk. We present additional late time UV data obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope, to show there is no significant fading in the optical since the last epoch and only marginal fading in the UV. The new UV data points match the predictions of previously published accretion disk models, where the disk is assumed to form from the tidal disruption of a low mass star by an intermediate mass black hole. This consistency provides evidence that AT 2018cow could indeed be a tidal disruption event. The marginal decay is in contrast with the predictions of light curves produced by interacting supernovae. The difference between expectations for disc emission and interacting supernovae will further increase with time, making data at even later times a route to robustly rule out interaction between supernova ejecta and circumstellar material.</description>

      <title>Gamma-Ray Spectra of $R$-Process Nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The radioactive decay of unstable nuclei created in the rapid neutron capture process release a large amount of $\gamma$-rays. When the ejecta is optically thick, these $\gamma$-rays may contribute to an associated kilonova. Once transparent, prominent spectral features will be directly observable in current and future $\gamma$-ray detectors. In this work, we study and compare the $\gamma$-ray spectra of a limited, weak, strong, and extended $r$-process across a broad timescale, identifying the nuclei which significantly contribute. We discuss these findings in the context of observability, noting that there are several practical challenges to connecting observed signatures to specific nuclei. However, if these challenges can be overcome, direct observation of $\gamma$-rays from $r$-process sites can provide insight into the fundamental physics underpinning the $r$-process.</description>

      <title>Neutrinos from stars in the Milky Way</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07399v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutrinos are produced during stellar evolution by means of thermal and thermonuclear processes. We model the cumulative neutrino flux expected at Earth from all stars in the Milky Way: the Galactic stellar neutrino flux (GS$\nu$F). We account for the star formation history of our Galaxy and reconstruct the spatial distribution of Galactic stars by means of a random sampling procedure based on Gaia Data Release 2. We use the stellar evolution code $\texttt{MESA}$ to compute the neutrino emission for a suite of stellar models with solar metallicity and zero-age-main-sequence mass between $0.08M_\odot$ and $100\ M_\odot$, from their pre-main sequence phase to their final fates. We then reconstruct the evolution of the neutrino spectral energy distribution for each stellar model in our suite. The GS$\nu$F lies between $\mathcal{O}(1)$ keV and $\mathcal{O}(10)$ MeV, with thermal (thermonuclear) processes responsible for shaping neutrino emission at energies smaller (larger) than $0.1$ MeV. Stars with mass larger than $\mathcal{O}(1\ M_\odot)$, located in the thin disk of the Galaxy, provide the largest contribution to the GS$\nu$F. Moreover, most of the GS$\nu$F originates from stars distant from Earth about $5-10$ kpc, implying that a large fraction of stellar neutrinos can reach us from the Galactic Center. Solar neutrinos and the diffuse supernova neutrino background have energies comparable to those of the GS$\nu$F, challenging the detection of the latter. However, directional information of solar neutrino and GS$\nu$F events, together with the annual modulation of the solar neutrino flux, could facilitate the GS$\nu$F detection; this will kick off a new era for low-energy neutrino astronomy, also providing a novel probe to discover New Physics.</description>

      <title>Good things always come in 3s: trimodality in the binary black-hole chirp-mass distribution supports bimodal black-hole formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07573v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The latest GWTC-4 release from the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) collaboration nearly doubles the known population of double compact object mergers and reveals a new trimodal structure in the chirp-mass distribution of merging binary black holes (BBHs) below 30 Msun. Recent detailed stellar evolution models show that features in the pre-collapse cores of massive stars produce a bimodal black hole (BH) mass distribution, which naturally extends to a trimodal BBH chirp-mass distribution. Both distributions depend only weakly on metallicity, implying universal structural features which can be tested with LVK observations. Using a new compact-remnant mass prescription derived from these models, we perform rapid population synthesis simulations to test the robustness of the predicted chirp-mass structure against uncertainties in binary evolution and cosmic star formation history, and compare these results with the current observational data. The trimodal chirp-mass distribution emerges as a robust outcome of the new remnant-mass model, persisting across variations in binary and cosmic physics. In contrast, traditional BH formation models lacking a bimodal BH mass spectrum fail to reproduce the observed trimodality. The updated models also predict lower BBH merger rates by a factor of a few, in closer agreement with LVK constraints. Intriguingly, the central chirp-mass peak, dominated by unequal-mass BBHs, originates from a previously underappreciated formation pathway in which strong luminous blue variable winds suppress binary interaction before the first BH forms. If isolated binary evolution dominates BBH formation below 30 Msun, the relative heights of the three chirp-mass peaks offer powerful observational constraints on core collapse, BH formation, binary evolution, and cosmic star formation. These universal structural features may also serve as standard sirens for precision cosmology.</description>

      <title>The influence of the mean anomaly on the dynamical quantities of binary black hole mergers in eccentric orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In studies of binary black hole (BBH) mergers in eccentric orbits, the mean anomaly, traditionally regarded as less significant than eccentricity, has been thought to encode only the orbital phase, leading to the assumption that it exerts minimal influence on the dynamics of eccentric mergers. In a previous investigation, we identified consistent oscillations in dynamical quantities peak luminosity $L_{\text{peak}}$, remnant mass $M_{\text{rem}}$, spin $\alpha_{\text{rem}}$, and recoil velocity $V_{\text{rem}}$ in relation to the initial eccentricity $e_0$. These oscillations are associated with integer orbital cycles within a phenomenological framework. In this paper, we aim to explore the underlying physical nature of these oscillations through gravitational waveforms. Our examination of remnant mass and spin reveals that while the initial ADM mass $M_{\mathrm{ADM}}$ and orbital angular momentum $L_0$ exhibit gradual variations with $e_0$, the radiated energy $E_{\text{rad}}$ and angular momentum $L_{\text{rad}}$ display oscillatory patterns akin to those observed in $M_{\text{rem}}$ and $\alpha_{\text{rem}}$. By decomposing the waveforms into three distinct phases inspiral, late inspiral to merger, and ringdown, we demonstrate that these oscillations persist across all phases, suggesting a common origin. Through a comparative analysis of $E_{\text{rad}}$ and $L_{\text{rad}}$ derived from numerical relativity (NR), post-Newtonian (PN) waveforms, and orbital-averaged PN fluxes during the inspiral phase, we identify the initial mean anomaly $l_0$ as the source of the observed oscillations. ...</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Holes, Charge, and Dark Matter: Rethinking Evaporation Limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Limits on the dark matter fraction of small mass primordial black holes from Hawking radiation are predominantly derived from the assumption of a Schwarzschild black hole evaporating. However, astrophysical black holes are usually much more realistically modelled by the rotating Kerr black hole solution. Meanwhile, electromagnetically charged black holes are astrophysically of little importance due to their fast neutralisation in the present universe. Dark matter is not just a possible solution to issues of astrophysics and cosmology, but also to issues of the standard model of particle physics. Extensions of this model thus can lead to charges present in the early universe which remain preserved in the charge of primordial black holes - even when the corresponding particles have disappeared from the particle content of the present epoch of the universe. Here, we report on a thorough proof-of-concept that such charges can greatly change evaporation limits for primordial black hole dark matter. Special emphasis is placed on (near-)extremal black holes, for which this effect is especially pronounced.</description>

      <title>Effects of dark dipole radiation on eccentric supermassive black hole binary inspirals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The final-parsec problem has long posed a central challenge in understanding the merger of supermassive black hole binaries. In this paper, we investigate a scenario in which a dark scalar or vector field is sourced by eccentric binaries, leading to accelerated mergers through additional dipole radiation, and thereby extending the range of masses for which the binary merges within a Hubble time. The radiation fluxes from an eccentric charged Keplerian binary are derived using general results for localized periodic sources in flat spacetime. We find that dipole radiation, although insufficient to fully resolve the final-parsec problem, can alter the low-frequency spectrum of the stochastic gravitational-wave background from supermassive black hole binary inspirals. We construct a simplified model for the spectrum and perform a Bayesian analysis using the current pulsar timing array data.</description>

      <title>Auto- and cross-correlations for multiple images of corotating hotspots in accretion disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22343v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Due to the short gravitational timescale of Sgr A*, variable emissions near the galactic center are expected in the Very-long-baseline interferometry observations. Phenomenologically, the high-flux variable emissions could be interpreted as occasional events from hotspots within accretion disks. It provides a probe of black hole (BH) geometry and accretion matter in the strong-field regime of gravity. In this study, we find that light curve profile alone is not proper for distinguishing BH geometries, as our results show that the profiles, even including those from higher-order images, are dependent on hotspot shapes, which are known in practice as amorphous. To alleviate this situation, we examine the spatial-temporal correlations between multiple images of the corotating hotspots. Our results find that the correlations, particularly those from higher-order images, could serve as a robust observable to reflect the inclination angles and BH geometries, because i) the correlated band structure is independent of the hotspot shapes, and ii) the correlations from higher-order images could encode BH geometries and exhibit no overlap with observational signatures from the lower-order ones. We present a comprehensive study on correlations from primary the eighth-order images with various orbital configurations and inclination angles, and show its observational signatures. It is expected that BH geometries can be inferred via the spatial-temporal correlation analysis.</description>

      <title>Modeling Tidal Disruptions with Dynamical Tides</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16025v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tidal disruption events (TDEs) occur when stars pass close enough to supermassive black holes to be torn apart by tidal forces. Traditionally, these events are studied with computationally intensive hydrodynamical simulations. In this paper, we present a fast, physically motivated two-stage model for TDEs. In the first stage, we model the star's tidal deformation using linear stellar perturbation theory, treating the star as a collection of driven harmonic oscillators. When the tidal energy exceeds a fraction $\gamma$ of the star's gravitational binding energy (with $\gamma \sim \mathcal O(1)$), we transition to the second stage, where we model the disrupted material as free particles. The parameter $\gamma$ is determined with a one-time calibration to the critical impact parameter obtained in hydrodynamical simulations. This method enables fast computation of the energy distribution ${\rm d} M/{\rm d}E$ and fallback rate ${\rm d} M/{\rm d} T$, while offering physical insight into the disruption process. We apply our model to MESA-generated profiles of middle-age main-sequence stars. Our code is available on GitHub.</description>

      <title>The construction and use of dephasing prescriptions for environmental effects in gravitational wave astronomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09513v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the first part of this work, we provide a curated overview of the theoretical framework necessary for incorporating dephasing due to environmental effects (EE) in gravitational wave (GW) templates. We focus in particular on the relationship between orbital perturbations in the time-domain and the resulting dephasing in both time and frequency domain, elucidating and resolving some inconsistencies present in the literature. We discuss how commonly studied binary environments often result in several sources of dephasing that affect the GW signal at the same time. This work synthesizes insights from two decades of literature, offering a unified conceptual narrative alongside a curated reference of key formulas, illustrative examples and methodological prescriptions. It can serve both as a reference for researchers in the field as well as a modern introduction for those who wish to enter it. In the second part, we derive novel aspects of dephasing for eccentric GW sources and lay the foundations for consistently treating the full problem. Importantly, we demonstrate that the detectability of EEs can be significantly enhanced in the presence of eccentricity, even for $e_\mathrm{10Hz}\lesssim0.2$, substantially increasing the prospects for detection in ground based detectors. Our results highlight the unique potential of modeling and searching for EE in eccentric binary sources of GWs.</description>

      <title>Ultra High Energy Neutrino Event KM3-230213A as a Signal of Electroweak Vacuum Turbulence in Merging Black Hole Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23387v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent detection of the ultra-high-energy neutrino event KM3-230213A ($\sim$220 PeV) by KM3NeT telescope poses a challenge to conventional astrophysical models, particularly in light of the absence of similar $\gtrsim$100 PeV events in IceCube data, despite its larger exposure. We propose a novel mechanism in which binary black hole mergers act as transient neutrino sources via gravitationally induced electroweak vacuum instability. In this scenario, the extreme spacetime curvature near the horizons during the final inspiral phase destabilizes the Higgs vacuum, triggering nucleation of true-vacuum bubbles. Collisions between these bubbles produce microscopic black holes that rapidly evaporate via Hawking radiation, emitting intense, short-lived bursts of neutrinos with energies exceeding 100 PeV. The resulting neutrino fluence follows a heavy-tailed distribution, allowing rare but highly luminous sources to account for events like KM3-230213A while remaining consistent with IceCube's non-detections. This framework links gravitational wave sources to ultra-high-energy neutrino production and suggests that future multi-messenger observations may detect electromagnetic signatures from microscopic black hole evaporation.</description>

      <title>Cosmic-Ray Mass Composition around the Knee via Principal Component Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01396v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we apply Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to experimental data recorded by the KASCADE experiment to reconstruct the mass composition of cosmic rays around the \textit{knee} region. A set of four extensive air shower parameters sensitive to the primary particle mass ($LCm$, $N_{\mu}$, $N_{e}$, and lateral shower $age$) was considered, whose coordinates were transformed into a new orthogonal basis that maximally captures the data variance. Based on the experimental distributions of the first two principal components (PCA0 vs.\ PCA1) and full Monte Carlo simulations of the KASCADE array considering five types of primary particles (p, He, C, Si, and Fe) and three hadronic interaction models (EPOS-LHC, QGSjet-II-04, and SIBYLL~2.3d), we obtained the evolution of the abundance of each primary species as a function of energy, as well as the evolution of the mean logarithmic mass with energy. We found that the reconstruction of the mass composition resulting from this comprehensive analysis significantly reduces dependence on the hadronic interaction model used in the simulation process, even though the initial input parameters are model-dependent. Moreover, the results support the idea that around the \textit{knee} region, the abundance of the light component (protons) decreases, while the heavy component shows a slight increase. The evolution of $\langle \ln (A) \rangle$ as a function of energy derived from this analysis shows excellent agreement with recent results from the LHAASO--KM2A experiment and aligns very well with the predictions of the data-driven GSF model.</description>

      <title>Inferring the neutron star equation of state with nuclear-physics informed semiparametric models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03232v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Over the past decade, an abundance of information from neutron-star observations, nuclear experiments and theory has transformed our efforts to elucidate the properties of dense matter. However, at high densities relevant to the cores of neutron stars, substantial uncertainty about the dense matter equation of state (EoS) remains. In this work, we present a semiparametric EoS framework aimed at better integrating knowledge across these domains in astrophysical inference. We use a Meta-model at low densities, and Gaussian Process extensions at high densities. Comparisons between our semiparametric framework to fully nonparametric EoS representations show that imposing nuclear theoretical and experimental constraints through the Meta-model up to nuclear saturation density results in constraints on the pressure up to twice nuclear saturation density. We show that our Gaussian Process trained on EoS models with nucleonic, hyperonic, and quark compositions extends the range of EoS explored at high density compared to a piecewise polytropic extension schema, under the requirements of causality of matter and of supporting the existence of heavy pulsars. We find that maximum TOV masses above $3.2 M_{\odot}$ can be supported by causal EoS compatible with nuclear constraints at low densities. We then combine information from existing observations of heavy pulsar masses, gravitational waves from binary neutron star mergers, and X-ray pulse profile modeling of millisecond pulsars within a Bayesian inference scheme using our semiparametric EoS prior. With current astrophysical observations, we find a favored pressure at two times nuclear saturation density of $P(2\rho_{\rm nuc}) = 1.98^{+2.13}_{-1.08}\times10^{34}$ dyn/cm$^{2}$, a radius of a $1.4 M_{\odot}$ neutron star value of $R_{1.4} = 11.4^{+0.98}_{-0.60}$\;km, and $M_{\rm max} = 2.31_{-0.23}^{+0.35} M_{\odot}$ at the 90\% credible level.</description>

      <title>All-sky neutrino point-source search with IceCube combined track and cascade data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07275v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite extensive efforts, discovery of high-energy astrophysical neutrino sources remains elusive. We present an event-level simultaneous maximum likelihood analysis of tracks and cascades using IceCube data collected from 04/06/2008 to 05/23/2022 to search the whole sky for neutrino sources and, using a source catalog, for coincidence of neutrino emission with gamma-ray emission. This is the first time a simultaneous fit of different detection channels is used to conduct a time-integrated all-sky scan with IceCube. Combining all-sky tracks, with superior pointing-power and sensitivity in the northern sky, with all-sky cascades, with good energy-resolution and sensitivity in the southern sky, we have developed the most sensitive point-source search to date by IceCube which targets the entire sky. The most significant point in the northern sky aligns with NGC 1068, a Seyfert II galaxy, which, from the catalog search, shows a 3.5$\sigma$ excess over background after accounting for trials. The most significant point in the southern sky does not align with any source in the catalog and is not significant after accounting for trials. A search for the single most significant Gaussian flare at the locations of NGC 1068, PKS 1424+240, and the southern highest significance point shows results consistent with expectations for steady emission. Notably, this is the first time that a flare shorter than four years has been excluded as being responsible for NGC 1068's emergence as a neutrino source. Our results show that combining tracks and cascades when conducting neutrino source searches improves sensitivity and can lead to new discoveries.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamical modeling of SN 2025kg associated with the Fast X-ray Transient EP250108a</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20457</link>

Abstract: Supernovae (SNe) associated with X-Ray Flashes (XRFs) are extremely rare. Therefore, the discovery of each new object in this class offers a unique opportunity to improve our understanding about their origins and potential connection with other high-energy phenomena. SN 2025kg is one of the most recent events discovered in this category, and exhibits a double-peaked light curve, with an initial cooling phase followed by the main peak. Here, we investigate the possible mechanisms powering its bolometric light curve and expansion velocities, using numerical calculations to simulate the explosion. We found that low ejecta masses (Mej ~ 2 Msun) and moderate explosion energies (E ~ 2e51 erg) are required to reproduce the data. Our models also show that a large amount of nickel (M_Ni = 0.85 Msun) is needed to achieve the high luminosity of SN 2025kg, which makes this scenario difficult to sustain. As an alternative, we explore a model in which a millisecond magnetar serves as the primary energy source. A magnetar with a spin period of 3 ms, approximately, and a magnetic field of 28e14 G gives an adequate match to the data. To account for the early cooling phase, we assume the presence of a dense circumstellar material surrounding the progenitor, with a mass of 0.27 Msun and an extension of 500 Rsun. A comparison and modeling of a select group of SNe--SN 2006aj, SN 2020bvc and SN 2023pel--is also presented. A remarkable similarity emerges between SN 2025kg and SN 2023pel. As SN 2023pel was recently proposed to be powered by a magnetar, this further supports the magnetar scenario for SN 2025kg.</description>

      <title>Tidal disruption events in active galactic nuclei: on orbital inclination and Schwarzschild apsidal precession</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07535v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tidal disruption events (TDEs) in active galactic nuclei (AGNs) mark a regime where traditional vacuum models fail to capture the full dynamics, especially due to interaction between stellar debris and pre-existing accretion disks. We perform meshless hydrodynamic simulations incorporating both general relativistic (GR) effects and radiative cooling to study TDEs in AGNs with different orbital inclinations ($\theta_{\rm inc}$) of the disrupted star, ranging from projected prograde to retrograde orbits. We post-process the simulations to derive multi-wavelength light curves and identify several distinct features in the light curves, including a precursor flare from early debris-disk collision and a major flare driven by fallback. The dynamics of the stellar debris and accretion disk, and subsequently the light curve features, are strongly affected by $\theta_{\rm inc}$ and GR effects. Retrograde orbits ($\theta_{\rm inc}=135^\circ$) yield a more luminous, shorter major flare and a more prominent precursor than prograde ones ($\theta_{\rm inc}=22.5^\circ$). During fallback, prograde cases ($\theta_{\rm inc} = 22.5^\circ$, $45^\circ$) develop a central cavity with spirals in the inner region of the AGN disk, leading to transient UV/X-ray suppression accompanied by oscillations, while higher inclinations ($\theta_{\rm inc}=90^\circ$, $135^\circ$) form a gradually tilting inner disk, potentially causing UV/X-ray dips via geometric effects at certain viewing angles. Relativistic apsidal precession alters stream collisions, producing structural differences in the inner disk, outer disk, and debris compared to Newtonian cases, and drives quasi-periodic signals in prograde configurations. These results provide predictive diagnostics for identifying AGN TDEs and interpreting observed light-curve diversity.</description>

      <title>Combining the second data release of the European Pulsar Timing Array with low-frequency pulsar data</title>

Abstract: Low-frequency radio data improve the sensitivity of pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) to propagation effects such as dispersion measure (DM) variations, enabling better noise characterization essential for detecting the stochastic gravitational wave background (GWB). We combined LOFAR (100-200 MHz) and NenuFAR (30-90 MHz) observations with the recent European and Indian PTA release (DR2new+) into a new dataset, DR2low, spanning ~11 years for 12 pulsars. DR2low allows updated noise models, increasing PTA sensitivity to the GWB. Using Libstempo and Enterprise, we applied standard noise models including red noise (RN) and time-variable DM (DMv) as power laws, and performed Bayesian model selection over RN, DMv, and an additional chromatic noise term (CN4). Compared to DR2new+, DR2low improves DM constraints and separates DM and RN contributions. We found that the RN is required in the final model for 10 out of 12 pulsars, compared to only 5 in the DR2new+ dataset. The improved sensitivity to plasma effects provided by DR2low also favors the identification of significant CN4 in eight pulsars, while none showed such evidence in DR2new+. The analysis also reveals unmodelled solar wind effects, particularly near solar conjunction, with residual delays absorbed into the DM component, highlighting the importance of accurately modelling the solar wind in PTA datasets.</description>

      <title>Hunting Very High-Energy ($&gt;$100 GeV) Emitting High-Synchrotron Peaked Blazars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06017v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Very-high energy (VHE; $&gt;$100 GeV) $\gamma$-ray emission originates via some of the most extreme particle acceleration processes in the universe. Considering beamed active galactic nuclei, i.e., blazars, only a small fraction, mainly high synchrotron peak BL Lacs, have been detected in the VHE band with the ground-based Cherenkov telescopes. We utilized $\sim$16 years of Fermi-Large Area Telescope (LAT) observations in the 0.1$-$2 TeV energy range to systematically search for potential VHE emitters in a sample of high synchrotron peaked ($\nu^{\rm peak}_{\rm syn}&gt;10^{15}$ Hz) BL Lac sources. We identified, for the first time, 92 VHE emitting blazars at $\geq 5\sigma$ confidence level. A significant VHE emission was also detected from 52 objects, which have been previously reported to be a VHE blazar. Comparing with the general blazar population, these VHE emitting blazars are found to be located at low redshifts (mean $z=0.2 \pm 0.1$) and exhibit bright synchrotron emission ($\log F^{\rm peak}_{\rm syn}=-11.2 \pm 0.4$, in erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$). We also investigated the coincidence of VHE photon arrivals with the source activity states and found that Fermi-LAT has detected VHE photons during both quiescent and elevated activity epochs. These VHE emitting blazars represent promising targets for current and next-generation ground-based Cherenkov telescopes, and provide valuable laboratories for probing particle acceleration in relativistic jets, testing multi-messenger connections, and constraining extragalactic background light models.</description>

      <title>Are all Binary Black Holes Detected by LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Following the Universal Time-Delay Distributions? Probably Not</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.06352v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The delay time distribution (DTD) of binary black hole (BBH) mergers encodes the evolutionary link between the formation history and gravitational-wave (GW) emission. We present a non-parametric reconstruction of the mass-dependent DTD using the BBHs from the GWTC-4 that avoids restrictive assumptions of only power-law forms. Our analysis reveals for the first time the signature for mass-dependent evolutionary pathways: lower-mass systems ($20$-$40\,M_\odot$) are consistent with a scale-invariant DTD, whereas higher-mass BBHs ($40$-$100\,M_\odot$) provide the first direct tentative evidence of DTD that deviate from simple power laws, with a pronounced preference for rapid mergers around $2-6$ Gyrs. These findings reveal the advantage of the non-parametric technique in reconstructing the mass-dependent DTD and discovering for the first-time the presence of a potential time-scale associated with high-mass GW events.</description>

      <title>Prolonged fallback and late-time rebrightening episodes in stellar tidal disruptions as imprints of a galactic environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07026v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend the classical Keplerian framework of existing analytic TDE models by incorporating the gravitational potential of a spherically symmetric galactic mass distribution. We then demonstrate that this broader structure imprints light curve features beyond the predictive scope of traditional models, such as phases of shallower-than-standard decay and late-time rebrightening episodes. Importantly, our framework predicts the occurrence of environment-induced rebrightenings but only on very long timescales, unless the host environment is unrealistically ultra-compact. This means the early evolution of TDEs occurring in typical galaxies is essentially untouched by the host potential, which explains why Keplerian models have been so successful in describing the first few years after disruption. To illustrate, we applied our model to the TDE candidate eRASSt J133157.9-324321 (J1331), the event with the longest reported rebrightening interval, and find that even matching its ${\sim}$30-year rebrightening would demand an implausibly dense host. This demonstrates the limits of environmental effects as an explanation for early rebrightenings reported in the literature. More broadly, our work shows that while the host galaxy leaves TDEs nearly Keplerian at early times, it actively shapes their long-term evolution and can drive departures from the canonical $t^{-5/3}$ decay law. These delayed signals give us a testable way to see how the host galaxy shapes the event, and they may even offer clues about the galaxy's underlying structure.</description>

      <title>Getting More Out of Black Hole Superradiance: a Statistically Rigorous Approach to Ultralight Boson Constraints from Black Hole Spin Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10337v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Black hole (BH) superradiance can provide strong constraints on the properties of ultralight bosons (ULBs). While most of the previous work has focused on the theoretical predictions, here we investigate the most suitable statistical framework to constrain ULB masses and self-interactions using BH spin measurements. We argue that a Bayesian approach based on a simple timescales analysis provides a clear statistical interpretation, deals with limitations regarding the reproducibility of existing BH analyses, incorporates the full information from BH data, and allows us to include additional nuisance parameters or to perform hierarchical modelling with BH populations in the future. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach using mass and spin posterior samples for the X-ray binary BH M33 X-7 and, for the first time in this context, the supermassive BH IRAS 09149-6206. We explain the differences to existing ULB constraints in the literature and illustrate the effects of various assumptions about the superradiance process (equilibrium regime vs cloud collapse, higher occupation levels). As a result, our procedure yields the most statistically rigorous ULB constraints available in the literature, with important implications for the QCD axion and axion-like particles. We encourage all groups analysing BH data to publish likelihood functions or posterior samples as supplementary material to facilitate this type of analysis, and for theory developments to compress their findings to effective timescale modifications.</description>

Abstract: We present a novel approach to investigating axions and axion-like particles (ALPs) by studying their potential conversion into X-rays within the Sun's atmospheric magnetic field. Utilizing high-sensitivity data from the Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR) collected during the 2020 solar minimum, along with advanced solar atmospheric magnetic field models, we establish a new limit on the axion-photon coupling strength $g_{a\gamma}\lesssim 7.3\times 10^{-12}$~GeV$^{-1}$ at 95\% CL for axion masses $m_a\lesssim 4\times 10^{-7}$\,eV. This constraint surpasses current ground-based experimental limits, studying previously unexplored regions of the axion-photon coupling parameter space up to masses of $m_a\lesssim 3.4\times 10^{-4}$\,eV. These findings mark a significant advancement in our ability to probe axion properties and strengthen indirect searches for dark matter candidates.</description>

      <title>Tidal heating in binary inspiral of strange quark stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07659v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate tidal heating associated with the binary inspiral of strange quark stars and its impact on the resulting gravitational wave signal. Tidal heating during the merger of neutron stars composed of nuclear matter may be considered negligible, but it has been demonstrated recently that the presence of hyperons at high densities could significantly enhance the dissipation during inspiral. In this work, we evaluate the bulk viscosity arising from non-leptonic weak processes involving quarks and show that it can be several orders of magnitude higher than the viscosity of nuclear matter at temperatures relevant to the inspiral phase of the merger of strange stars. We model strange quark matter in the normal phase using a non-ideal bag model including electrons and ensure compatibility with astrophysical constraints. By analysing equal-mass binary systems with component masses ranging from 1.4 to 1.8 $\, M_{\odot}$, we find that temperatures close to 0.1 MeV are reached by the end of the inspiral phase. We also estimate the effect on the gravitational waveform and conclude that the additional phase shift could range from $0.1$ to $0.5$ radians for strange quark masses of 200 MeV, making it potentially detectable by next-generation gravitational wave detectors. Given that tidal heating from hyperons is dominant only for very massive neutron stars having masses 1.8 to 2.0 $\, M_{\odot}$, a successful detection of this phase shift during the inspiral of binary systems with relatively low masses of 1.4 to 1.6 $\, M_{\odot}$ could be a smoking gun signature for the existence of strange quark stars.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02448v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The momentum-dependent interaction (MDI) model, which has been widely used in microscopic transport models for heavy-ion collisions (HICs), is extended to include three different momentum-dependent terms and three zero-range density-dependent terms, dubbed as MDI3Y model. Compared to the MDI model, the single-nucleon potential in the MDI3Y model exhibits more flexible momentum-dependent behaviors. Furthermore, the inclusion of three zero-range density-dependent interactions follows the idea of Fermi momentum expansion, allowing more flexible variation for the largely uncertain high-density behaviors of nuclear matter equation of state (EOS), especially the symmetry energy. Moreover, we also obtain the corresponding Skyrme-like energy density functional through density matrix expansion of the finite-range exchange interactions. Based on the MDI3Y model, we construct four interactions with the same symmetry energy slope parameter $L=35$ MeV but different momentum dependence of $U_{\mathrm{sym}}$, by fitting the empirical nucleon optical potential, the empirical properties of symmetric nuclear matter, the microscopic calculations of pure neutron matter EOS and the astrophysical constraints on neutron stars. In addition, two interactions with $L=55$ and $75$ MeV are also constructed for comparison. Using these MDI3Y interactions, we study the properties of nuclear matter and neutron stars. These MDI3Y interactions, especially those with non-monotonic momentum dependence of $U_{\mathrm{sym}}$, will be potentially useful in transport model analyses of HICs data to extract nuclear matter EOS and the isospin splitting of nucleon effective masses.</description>

      <title>Love beyond Einstein: Metric reconstruction and Love number in quadratic gravity using WEFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02785v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study tidal Love numbers of static black holes in four-dimensional quadratic theory of gravity, extending the result of GR. We use worldline effective field theory (WEFT) methods to compute metric perturbations from one-point functions, treating the higher-derivative terms perturbatively. We show that insertions of scalar fields on the worldline induce non-zero tidal tails, and the corresponding Love number displays no RG running. The same conclusion holds for the insertions of tensor fields. Furthermore, for scalar dipole perturbations, we derive a Yukawa-deformed Frobenius solution and match the asymptotic behavior to fix the UV charge, finding agreement with EFT predictions of Wilson coefficients. Our work demonstrates that quadratic higher-curvature corrections induce non-zero but scale-independent tidal responses, offering a robust EFT framework to test deviations from GR in gravitational wave observations.</description>

      <title>Tidal disruption of a neutron star near naked singularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26108v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the tidal disruption of a neutron star (NS) near a black hole (BH), and for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, near a naked singularity (NaS). For a BH with a mass greater than about $10 M_{\odot}$, the tidal disruption of NS should occur within the event horizon, and hence neither can the stellar material escape nor a distant observer observe the disruption. Since NaS does not have an event horizon, a significant portion of the NS's material can escape, and the tidal disruption can be observed by a distant observer. One could identify such an event from the observed emission from the disrupted NS's material and the decay of the light curve of the disruption event. The escape of a significant fraction of the NS's material may also have implications for the heavy elements in the universe. Moreover, observing such an event can be useful for confirming a NaS, probing its spacetime, and studying the motion of matter in such a geometry. This may help constrain the NS parameters and equation of state models. As a first step in this direction, we calculate here the tidal disruption radius and other parameters for a specific type (Joshi-Malafarina-Narayan type 1) of NaS and compare our results with observations.</description>

      <title>GW231123: extreme spins or microglitches?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07228v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recently reported binary black hole merger, GW231123, has unusual properties that make it hard to explain astrophysically. Parameter estimation studies are consistent with maximally spinning black holes and the dimensionless spin of the more massive component is constrained to be $\chi_1\gtrsim 0.8$. Analysis of data also revealed potential systematics that could not be fully replicated with simulated studies. We explore the possibility that these measurements are biased due to unmodeled non-Gaussian noise in the detectors, and that the actual black hole spins are more modest. We present evidence for a population of \textit{microglitches} in LIGO gravitational-wave strain data that can lead to biases in the parameter estimation of short-duration signals such as GW231123. Using simulated data of a massive event like GW231123, we demonstrate how microglitches can bias our measurements of black hole spins toward $\chi\approx1$ with negligible posterior support for the true value of $\chi\approx0.7$. We develop a noise model to account for microglitches and show that this model successfully reduces biases in the recovery of signal parameters. We characterize the microglitch population in real interferometer data surrounding GW231123 and find a single detector glitch duty cycle of $0.57_{-0.19}^{+0.21}$, which implies nearly a $100\%$ probability that at least one event through the fourth gravitational wave transient catalog coincides with microglitches in two detectors. We argue that further investigations are required before we can have a confident picture of the astrophysical properties of GW231123.</description>
