      <title>An Exact Solution for the Kinetic Ising Model with Non-Reciprocity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A wide range of non-equilibrium phenomena in nature involve non-reciprocal interactions. To understand the novel behaviors that can emerge in such systems, finding tractable models is essential. With this goal, we introduce a non-reciprocal generalization of the kinetic Ising model in one dimension and solve it exactly. Our solution uncovers novel properties driven by non-reciprocity, such as underdamped phases, critically damped phases where a system of size $N$ is described by an $N^{th}$-order exceptional point, and wave phenomena influenced by the parity of $N$. Additionally, we examine the low-energy behavior of these systems in various limits, demonstrating that non-reciprocity leads to unique scaling behavior at zero temperature.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional ASEP model to study density profiles in CVD growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growth of two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides using chemical vapor deposition has been an area of intense study, primarily due to the scalability requirements for potential device applications. One of the major challenges of such growths is the large-scale thickness variation of the grown film. To investigate the role of different growth parameters computationally, we use a 2D asymmetric simple-exclusion process (ASEP) model with open boundaries as an approximation to the dynamics of deposition on the coarse-grained lattice. The variations in concentration of particles (growth profiles) at the lattice sites in the grown film are studied as functions of parameters like injection and ejection rate of particles from the lattice, time of observation, and the right bias (difference between the hopping probabilities towards right and towards left) imposed by the carrier gas. In addition, the deposition rates at a given coarse-grained site is assumed to depend on the occupancy of that site. The effect of the maximum deposition rate, i.e., the deposition rate at a completely unoccupied site on the substrate, has been explored. The growth profiles stretch horizontally when either the evolution time or the right bias is increased. An increased deposition rate leads to a step-like profile, with the higher density region close to the left edge. In 3D, the growth profiles become more uniform with the increase in the height of the precursor with respect to the substrate surface. These results qualitatively agree with the experimental observations.</description>

      <title>Geometric properties of the additional third-order transitions in the two-dimensional Potts model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00423v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the canonical ensemble framework, this paper investigates the presence of higher-order transition signals in the q-state Potts model (for q&gt;3), using two geometric order parameters: isolated spins number and the average perimeter of clusters. Our results confirm that higher-order transitions exist in the Potts model, where the number of isolated spins reliably indicates third-order independent transitions. This signal persists regardless of the system's phase transition order, even at higher values of q. In contrast, the average perimeter of clusters, used as an order parameter for detecting third-order dependent transitions, shows that for q = 6 and q = 8, the signal for third-order dependent transitions disappears, indicating its absence in systems undergoing first-order transitions. These findings are consistent with results from microcanonical inflection-point analysis, further validating the robustness of this approach.</description>

      <title>Diffusion with preferential relocation in a confining potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the relaxation of a diffusive particle confined in an arbitrary external potential and subject to a non-Markovian resetting protocol. With a constant rate $r$, a previous time $\tau$ between the initial time and the present time $t$ is chosen from a given probability distribution $K(\tau,t)$, and the particle is reset to the position that was occupied at time $\tau$. Depending on the shape of $K(\tau,t)$, the particle either relaxes toward the Gibbs-Boltzmann distribution or toward a non-trivial stationary distribution that breaks ergodicity and depends on the initial position and the resetting protocol. From a general asymptotic theory, we find that if the kernel $K(\tau,t)$ is sufficiently localized near $\tau=0$, i.e., mostly the initial part of the trajectory is remembered and revisited, the steady state is non-Gibbs-Boltzmann. Conversely, if $K(\tau,t)$ decays slowly enough or increases with $\tau$, i.e., recent positions are more likely to be revisited, the probability distribution of the particle tends toward the Gibbs-Boltzmann state at large times. However, the temporal approach to the stationary state is generally anomalously slow, following for instance an inverse power-law or a stretched exponential, if $K(\tau,t)$ is not too strongly peaked at the current time $t$. These findings are verified by the analysis of several exactly solvable cases and by numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Latent heat estimation with machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00733v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We set out to explore the possibility of investigating the critical behavior of systems with first-order phase transition using deep machine learning. We propose a machine learning protocol with ternary classification of instantaneous spin configurations using known values of disordered phase energy and ordered phase energy. The trained neural network is used to predict whether a given sample belong to one or the other phase of matter. This allows us to estimate the probability that configurations with a certain energy belong to the ordered phase, mixed phase and, disordered phase. From these probabilities, we obtained estimates of the values of the critical energies and the latent heat for the Potts model with 10 and 20 components, which undergoes a strong discontinuous transition. We also find that the probabilities can reflect geometric transitions in the mixed phase.</description>

      <title>Pair Approximating the Action For Molecular Rotations in Path Integral Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Typical path integral Monte Carlo approaches use the primitive approximation to compute the probability density for a given path. In this work, we develop the pair Discrete Variable Representation (pair-DVR) approach to study molecular rotations. The pair propagator, which was initially introduced to study superfluidity in condensed Helium, is naturally well-suited for systems interacting with a pair-wise potential. Consequently, paths sampled using the pair action tend to be closer to the exact paths (compared to primitive Trotter paths) for such systems leading to convergence with less imaginary time steps. Therefore, our approach relies on using the pair factorization approach in conjunction with a discretized Path Integral Ground State (PIGS) paradigm to study a chain of planar rotors interacting with a pair-wise dipole interaction. We first use the Wigner-Kirkwood density expansion to analyze the asymptotics of the pair propagator in imaginary time. Then, we exhibit the utility of the pair factorization scheme via convergence studies comparing the pair and primitive propagators. Finally, we compute energetic and structural properties of this system including the correlation function and Binder ratio as functions of the coupling strength to examine the behaviour of the pair-DVR method near criticality. Density Matrix Renormalization Group results are used for benchmarking throughout.</description>

      <title>Transmission of mobility via cooperative mechanisms in soft active matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When supercooled, liquids viscosity increases dramatically as the glass transition temperature is approached. While the physical origin of this behavior is still not understood, it is now well established that the addition of a few activated particles is able to reverse that increase in viscosity. Here we further raise the question of a limit in that fluidization process and of the differences between the fluidized liquid and its viscous counterpart. Results show that a few percent active molecules are enough to trigger a phase transition leading to diffusion coefficients typical of liquids while the medium retains cooperative properties of the viscous phase. The similarity between cooperative properties of the active and non active molecules suggests that the mobility of active molecules is transmitted to inactive ones via the medium cooperative mechanisms, a result in agreement with facilitation theories. This result is then confirmed by the compared behavior of the distinct van hove correlation functions of most mobile active and non active molecules. Interestingly enough, in our simulations the cooperative mechanisms are not induced or related to a decrease of the excitation concentration.</description>

      <title>A Dynamical Equation for the Lorenz Curve: Dynamics of incomplete moments of probability distributions arising from Fokker-Planck equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fokker-Planck equations (forward Kolmogorov equations) evolve probability densities in time from an initial condition. For distributions over the real line, these evolution equations can sometimes be transformed into dynamics over the incomplete zeroth and first moments. We call this perspective the Lorenz dynamics of the system after the Lorenz curve description of distributions of wealth. This offers the benefit of presenting the dynamics over a compact domain. The integral transformation is motivated and then stated for a general class of Fokker-Planck equations. Following this, the transformed equation is solved for the heat equation and some variants thereof. Finally, some equations arising from the application of kinetic theory to idealized economic systems are transformed and analyzed in this new light.</description>

      <title>A model of random sequential adsorption on a ladder graph</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.02747v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In random sequential adsorption (RSA), objects are deposited on a substrate randomly, irreversibly, and sequentially. Attempts of deposition that lead to an overlap with previously deposited objects are discarded. The process continues until the system reaches a jammed state when no further additions are possible. We analyze a class of RSA models on a two-row square ladder graph in which landing on an empty site in a graph is allowed when at least $b$ neighboring sites in the graph are unoccupied ($b \in \mathbb{N}$). In this paper we complement this typical way of studying RSA models by analyzing also the structure of the set of all jammed states in a static way, disregarding the dynamics that led to a particular jammed state. In both considered settings (dynamic and static) we provide explicit expressions for key statistics that describe the average proportion of the substrate covered by deposited objects, and then we comment on significant differences between the two settings. We illustrate all of our findings through a toy model for ensembles of trapped Rydberg atoms with blockade range $b$.</description>

      <title>Siegmund duality for physicists: a bridge between spatial and first-passage properties of continuous and discrete time stochastic processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10537v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a generic one-dimensional stochastic process $x(t)$, or a random walk $X_n$, which describes the position of a particle evolving inside an interval $[a,b]$, with absorbing walls located at $a$ and $b$. In continuous time, $x(t)$ is driven by some equilibrium process $\mathbf{\theta}(t)$, while in discrete time, the jumps of $X_n$ follow a stationary process that obeys a time reversal property. An important observable to characterize its behaviour is the exit probability $E_b(x,t)$, which is the probability for the particle to be absorbed first at the wall $b$, before or at time $t$, given its initial position $x$. In this paper we show that the derivation of this quantity can be tackled by studying a dual process $y(t)$ very similar to $x(t)$ but with hard walls at $a$ and $b$. More precisely, we show that the quantity $E_b(x,t)$ for the process $x(t)$ is equal to the probability $\tilde \Phi(x,t|b)$ of finding the dual process inside the interval $[a,x]$ at time $t$, with $y(0) =b$. This is known as Siegmund duality in mathematics. Here we show that this duality applies to various processes which are of interest in physics, including models of active particles, diffusing diffusivity models, a large class of discrete and continuous time random walks, and even processes subjected to stochastic resetting. For all these cases, we provide an explicit construction of the dual process. We also give simple derivations of this identity both in the continuous and in the discrete time setting, as well as numerical tests for a large number of models of interest. Finally, we use simulations to show that the duality is also likely to hold for more complex processes such as fractional Brownian motion.</description>

      <title>Fluctuating hydrodynamics of an autophoretic particle near a permeable interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.01572v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the autophoretic motion of a spherical active particle interacting chemically and hydrodynamically with its fluctuating environment in the limit of rapid diffusion and slow viscous flow. Then, the chemical and hydrodynamic fields can be expressed in terms of integrals. The resulting boundary-domain integral equations provide a direct way of obtaining the traction on the particle, requiring the solution of linear integral equations. An exact solution for the chemical and hydrodynamic problems is obtained for a particle in an unbounded domain. For motion near boundaries, we provide corrections to the unbounded solutions in terms of chemical and hydrodynamic Green's functions, preserving the dissipative nature of autophoresis in a viscous fluid for all physical configurations. Using this, we give the fully stochastic update equations for the Brownian trajectory of an autophoretic particle in a complex environment. First, we analyse the Brownian dynamics of particles capable of complex motion in the bulk. We then introduce a chemically permeable planar surface of two immiscible liquids in the vicinity of the particle and provide explicit solutions to the chemo-hydrodynamics of this system. Finally, we study the case of an isotropically phoretic particle hovering above an interface as a function of interfacial solute permeability and viscosity contrast.</description>

      <title>Jamming is a first-order transition with quenched disorder in amorphous materials sheared by cyclic quasistatic deformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01834v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Jamming is an athermal transition between flowing and rigid states in amorphous systems such as granular matter, colloidal suspensions, complex fluids and cells. The jamming transition seems to display mixed aspects of a first-order transition, evidenced by a discontinuity in the coordination number, and a second-order transition, indicated by power-law scalings and diverging lengths. Here we demonstrate that jamming is a first-order transition with quenched disorder in cyclically sheared systems with quasistatic deformations, in two and three dimensions. Based on scaling analyses, we show that fluctuations of the jamming density in finite-sized systems have important consequences on the finite-size effects of various quantities, resulting in a square relationship between disconnected and connected susceptibilities, a key signature of the first-order transition with quenched disorder. This study puts the jamming transition into the category of a broad class of transitions in disordered systems where sample-to-sample fluctuations dominate over thermal fluctuations, suggesting that the nature and behavior of the jamming transition might be better understood within the developed theoretical framework of the athermally driven random-field Ising model.</description>

      <title>Neural Network Matrix Product Operator: A Multi-Dimensionally Integrable Machine Learning Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23858v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A neural network-based machine learning potential energy surface (PES) expressed in a matrix product operator (NN-MPO) is proposed. The MPO form enables efficient evaluation of high-dimensional integrals that arise in solving the time-dependent and time-independent Schr\"odinger equation and effectively overcomes the so-called curse of dimensionality. This starkly contrasts with other neural network-based machine learning PES methods, such as multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs), where evaluating high-dimensional integrals is not straightforward due to the fully connected topology in their backbone architecture. Nevertheless, the NN-MPO retains the high representational capacity of neural networks. NN-MPO can achieve spectroscopic accuracy with a test mean absolute error (MAE) of 3.03 cm$^{-1}$ for a fully coupled six-dimensional ab initio PES, using only 625 training points distributed across a 0 to 17,000 cm$^{-1}$ energy range. Our Python implementation is available at https://github.com/KenHino/Pompon.</description>
