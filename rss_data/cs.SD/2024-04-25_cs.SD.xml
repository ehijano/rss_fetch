      <title>HybridVC: Efficient Voice Style Conversion with Text and Audio Prompts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce HybridVC, a voice conversion (VC) framework built upon a pre-trained conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) that combines the strengths of a latent model with contrastive learning. HybridVC supports text and audio prompts, enabling more flexible voice style conversion. HybridVC models a latent distribution conditioned on speaker embeddings acquired by a pretrained speaker encoder and optimises style text embeddings to align with the speaker style information through contrastive learning in parallel. Therefore, HybridVC can be efficiently trained under limited computational resources. Our experiments demonstrate HybridVC's superior training efficiency and its capability for advanced multi-modal voice style conversion. This underscores its potential for widespread applications such as user-defined personalised voice in various social media platforms. A comprehensive ablation study further validates the effectiveness of our method.</description>

      <title>Characteristics-Based Design of Multi-Exponent Bandpass Filters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop methods to design bandpass filters given desired characteristics such as peak frequency, bandwidth, and group delay. We develop this filter design method for filters we refer to as Generalized Auditory Filters (GAFs) which are represented as second order filters raised to non-unitary exponents and hence have three degrees of freedom. Our method for filter design accommodates specification of a trio of frequency-domain characteristics from amongst the peak frequency, convexity, 3dB, ndB quality factor, equivalent rectangular bandwidth, maximum group delay, and phase accumulation. To develop our characteristics-based design methods, we derive expressions for the filter constants directly in terms of filter characteristics. The parameterization of GAFs in terms of sets of characteristics allows for specifying magnitude-based characteristics (e.g. bandwidths) and phase-based characteristics (e.g. group delays) simultaneously. This enables designing sharply tuned filters without significant group delay, and is particularly important in filterbanks where frequency selectivity and synchronization are both important aspects of design. Using our methods, we directly dictate values for desired filter characteristics - unlike iterative filter design methods. This allows for more direct design of GAFs for phase-picking from seismic signals, cochlear implants, and rainbow sensors. The methods also directly apply to related bandpass and multi-band filters.</description>

      <title>Efficient Multi-Model Fusion with Adversarial Complementary Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Single-model systems often suffer from deficiencies in tasks such as speaker verification (SV) and image classification, relying heavily on partial prior knowledge during decision-making, resulting in suboptimal performance. Although multi-model fusion (MMF) can mitigate some of these issues, redundancy in learned representations may limits improvements. To this end, we propose an adversarial complementary representation learning (ACoRL) framework that enables newly trained models to avoid previously acquired knowledge, allowing each individual component model to learn maximally distinct, complementary representations. We make three detailed explanations of why this works and experimental results demonstrate that our method more efficiently improves performance compared to traditional MMF. Furthermore, attribution analysis validates the model trained under ACoRL acquires more complementary knowledge, highlighting the efficacy of our approach in enhancing efficiency and robustness across tasks.</description>

      <title>CLAD: Robust Audio Deepfake Detection Against Manipulation Attacks with Contrastive Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing prevalence of audio deepfakes poses significant security threats, necessitating robust detection methods. While existing detection systems exhibit promise, their robustness against malicious audio manipulations remains underexplored. To bridge the gap, we undertake the first comprehensive study of the susceptibility of the most widely adopted audio deepfake detectors to manipulation attacks. Surprisingly, even manipulations like volume control can significantly bypass detection without affecting human perception. To address this, we propose CLAD (Contrastive Learning-based Audio deepfake Detector) to enhance the robustness against manipulation attacks. The key idea is to incorporate contrastive learning to minimize the variations introduced by manipulations, therefore enhancing detection robustness. Additionally, we incorporate a length loss, aiming to improve the detection accuracy by clustering real audios more closely in the feature space. We comprehensively evaluated the most widely adopted audio deepfake detection models and our proposed CLAD against various manipulation attacks. The detection models exhibited vulnerabilities, with FAR rising to 36.69%, 31.23%, and 51.28% under volume control, fading, and noise injection, respectively. CLAD enhanced robustness, reducing the FAR to 0.81% under noise injection and consistently maintaining an FAR below 1.63% across all tests. Our source code and documentation are available in the artifact repository (https://github.com/CLAD23/CLAD).</description>

      <title>AV-RIR: Audio-Visual Room Impulse Response Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.00834v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate estimation of Room Impulse Response (RIR), which captures an environment's acoustic properties, is important for speech processing and AR/VR applications. We propose AV-RIR, a novel multi-modal multi-task learning approach to accurately estimate the RIR from a given reverberant speech signal and the visual cues of its corresponding environment. AV-RIR builds on a novel neural codec-based architecture that effectively captures environment geometry and materials properties and solves speech dereverberation as an auxiliary task by using multi-task learning. We also propose Geo-Mat features that augment material information into visual cues and CRIP that improves late reverberation components in the estimated RIR via image-to-RIR retrieval by 86%. Empirical results show that AV-RIR quantitatively outperforms previous audio-only and visual-only approaches by achieving 36% - 63% improvement across various acoustic metrics in RIR estimation. Additionally, it also achieves higher preference scores in human evaluation. As an auxiliary benefit, dereverbed speech from AV-RIR shows competitive performance with the state-of-the-art in various spoken language processing tasks and outperforms reverberation time error score in the real-world AVSpeech dataset. Qualitative examples of both synthesized reverberant speech and enhanced speech can be found at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTsKhviukAE.</description>

      <title>MuChin: A Chinese Colloquial Description Benchmark for Evaluating Language Models in the Field of Music</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09871v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapidly evolving multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) urgently require new benchmarks to uniformly evaluate their performance on understanding and textually describing music. However, due to semantic gaps between Music Information Retrieval (MIR) algorithms and human understanding, discrepancies between professionals and the public, and low precision of annotations, existing music description datasets cannot serve as benchmarks. To this end, we present MuChin, the first open-source music description benchmark in Chinese colloquial language, designed to evaluate the performance of multimodal LLMs in understanding and describing music. We established the Caichong Music Annotation Platform (CaiMAP) that employs an innovative multi-person, multi-stage assurance method, and recruited both amateurs and professionals to ensure the precision of annotations and alignment with popular semantics. Utilizing this method, we built a dataset with multi-dimensional, high-precision music annotations, the Caichong Music Dataset (CaiMD), and carefully selected 1,000 high-quality entries to serve as the test set for MuChin. Based on MuChin, we analyzed the discrepancies between professionals and amateurs in terms of music description, and empirically demonstrated the effectiveness of annotated data for fine-tuning LLMs. Ultimately, we employed MuChin to evaluate existing music understanding models on their ability to provide colloquial descriptions of music. All data related to the benchmark, along with the scoring code and detailed appendices, have been open-sourced (https://github.com/CarlWangChina/MuChin/).</description>

      <title>Golden Gemini is All You Need: Finding the Sweet Spots for Speaker Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.03620v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Previous studies demonstrate the impressive performance of residual neural networks (ResNet) in speaker verification. The ResNet models treat the time and frequency dimensions equally. They follow the default stride configuration designed for image recognition, where the horizontal and vertical axes exhibit similarities. This approach ignores the fact that time and frequency are asymmetric in speech representation. In this paper, we address this issue and look for optimal stride configurations specifically tailored for speaker verification. We represent the stride space on a trellis diagram, and conduct a systematic study on the impact of temporal and frequency resolutions on the performance and further identify two optimal points, namely Golden Gemini, which serves as a guiding principle for designing 2D ResNet-based speaker verification models. By following the principle, a state-of-the-art ResNet baseline model gains a significant performance improvement on VoxCeleb, SITW, and CNCeleb datasets with 7.70%/11.76% average EER/minDCF reductions, respectively, across different network depths (ResNet18, 34, 50, and 101), while reducing the number of parameters by 16.5% and FLOPs by 4.1%. We refer to it as Gemini ResNet. Further investigation reveals the efficacy of the proposed Golden Gemini operating points across various training conditions and architectures. Furthermore, we present a new benchmark, namely the Gemini DF-ResNet, using a cutting-edge model.</description>

      <title>Open Your Ears and Take a Look: A State-of-the-Art Report on the Integration of Sonification and Visualization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16558v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The research communities studying visualization and sonification for data display and analysis share exceptionally similar goals, essentially making data of any kind interpretable to humans. One community does so by using visual representations of data, and the other community employs auditory (non-speech) representations of data. While the two communities have a lot in common, they developed mostly in parallel over the course of the last few decades. With this STAR, we discuss a collection of work that bridges the borders of the two communities, hence a collection of work that aims to integrate the two techniques into one form of audiovisual display, which we argue to be "more than the sum of the two."
  We introduce and motivate a classification system applicable to such audiovisual displays and categorize a corpus of 57 academic publications that appeared between 2011 and 2023 in categories such as reading level, dataset type, or evaluation system, to mention a few. The corpus also enables a meta-analysis of the field, including regularly occurring design patterns such as type of visualization and sonification techniques, or the use of visual and auditory channels, showing an overall diverse field with different designs. An analysis of a co-author network of the field shows individual teams without many interconnections. The body of work covered in this STAR also relates to three adjacent topics: audiovisual monitoring, accessibility, and audiovisual data art. These three topics are discussed individually in addition to the systematically conducted part of this research. The findings of this report may be used by researchers from both fields to understand the potentials and challenges of such integrated designs while hopefully inspiring them to collaborate with experts from the respective other field.</description>

      <title>FlashSpeech: Efficient Zero-Shot Speech Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14700v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent progress in large-scale zero-shot speech synthesis has been significantly advanced by language models and diffusion models. However, the generation process of both methods is slow and computationally intensive. Efficient speech synthesis using a lower computing budget to achieve quality on par with previous work remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we present FlashSpeech, a large-scale zero-shot speech synthesis system with approximately 5\% of the inference time compared with previous work. FlashSpeech is built on the latent consistency model and applies a novel adversarial consistency training approach that can train from scratch without the need for a pre-trained diffusion model as the teacher. Furthermore, a new prosody generator module enhances the diversity of prosody, making the rhythm of the speech sound more natural. The generation processes of FlashSpeech can be achieved efficiently with one or two sampling steps while maintaining high audio quality and high similarity to the audio prompt for zero-shot speech generation. Our experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of FlashSpeech. Notably, FlashSpeech can be about 20 times faster than other zero-shot speech synthesis systems while maintaining comparable performance in terms of voice quality and similarity. Furthermore, FlashSpeech demonstrates its versatility by efficiently performing tasks like voice conversion, speech editing, and diverse speech sampling. Audio samples can be found in https://flashspeech.github.io/.</description>
