      <title>Minimal-doubling and single-Weyl Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a systematic Hamiltonian formulation of minimally doubled lattice fermions in (3+1) dimensions, derive their nodal structures (structures of zeros), and classify their symmetry patterns for both four-component Dirac and two-component Weyl constructions. Motivated by recent single-Weyl proposals based on Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) representation, we argue that the corresponding single-Weyl Hamiltonians are obtained from the minimal-doubling Hamiltonians supplemented by an appropriate species-splitting mass term, and we re-examine the non-onsite symmetry protecting the physical Weyl node in terms of a Ginsparg-Wilson-type relation. We then construct a one-parameter family of deformations that preserves all the symmetries and demonstrate that, once the parameter exceeds a critical value, additional Weyl nodes emerge and the system exits the single-node regime. This indicates that in interacting theories radiative corrections can generate symmetry-allowed counterterms, so maintaining the desired single-Weyl phase generically requires "moderate" parameter tuning.</description>

      <title>Precisely determining the ground state mass of Spin-3/2 $\Omega_{ccc}$ baryon from Lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the most precise determination to date of the ground-state masses of the triply charmed baryons with both parities, obtained by continuum extrapolation and fully addressing the systematic uncertainties. The calculations are performed on six $N_f=2+1+1$ HISQ ensembles, generated by the MILC collaboration, with two complementary setups for the valence charm action, one using the HISQ action and the other using the overlap fermion action. Our prediction for the mass of the lowest two triply charmed spin-3/2 baryons are: $M_{\Omega_{ccc}} (3/2^{+}) = 4793 (5) \left(^{+11}_{-8}\right)$ MeV, and $M_{\Omega_{ccc}} (3/2^{-}) = 5094 (12) \left(^{+19}_{-17}\right)$ MeV.</description>

      <title>Pion scattering at finite volume within the Inverse Amplitude Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the effect of a finite volume for pion-pion scattering within Chiral Perturbation Theory (ChPT) and the Inverse Amplitude Method (IAM) in a $L^3$ box (rest frame). Our full ChPT calculation takes into account the discretization not only in the $s$-channel loops but also in the $t,u$- channels and tadpole contributions. Hence, not only the unitarity right-hand cut but also the left-hand one continuum contributions are calculated in the finite volume. A proper extension of the standard Veltman-Pasarino identities is needed, as well as a suitable projection on the internal space spanned by the irreducible representations (irreps) of the octahedral group, based on either a finite set of cubic harmonics or the matrices which represent the irreps properly. From the ChPT we construct the IAM in the internal space, which provides the full volume dependence of the interacting energy levels of two-pions scattering in the finite volume. Our results for various low-energy constants sets show sizable corrections with respect to previous analyses in the literature for $ m_\pi L \lesssim 2$, being compatible with energy levels lattice data. We expect that our analysis and results will help to optimize the process of determination of energy levels and phase-shifts with higher accuracy.</description>

      <title>Spectral reconstruction based on dimensional reduction in high-temperature gauge theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a numerical spectral reconstruction workflow for high-temperature gauge theories that incorporates elements of semi-classical real-time evolution directly into standard lattice QCD simulations via high-temperature dimensional reduction, thus counteracting the deterioration of Euclidean-time correlators at high temperatures. With a moderate numerical cost, our method allows to estimate spectral functions with parametrically better frequency resolution as compared with spectral reconstruction methods based on Euclidean-time correlators alone. The method is tested on a simple (1+1)-dimensional Abelian gauge theory with fermions, where our method precisely reproduces the full quantum spectral functions calculated using exact numerical diagonalization in the high-temperature, weak-coupling regime. We also demonstrate the feasibility of our approach by applying it to light-quark meson correlators in lattice QCD deep in the deconfinement regime.</description>

      <title>Orbital angular momentum in the pion and kaon: rest-frame and light-front</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Orbital angular momentum (OAM) is not a Poincar\'e invariant quantity; so, its value is observer dependent. Notwithstanding that, in quantum chromodynamics, a Poincar\'e-invariant theory, OAM is part of every hadron wave function. Using continuum Schwinger function methods, we elucidate both the subjective character of in-hadron OAM and expose some of its impacts on pion and kaon structure and observables. For instance, working with light-front projections of their Bethe-Salpeter wave functions, it is found that the pion is a roughly 50/50 mix of light-front OAM zero and one components and the kaon is a 60/40 system. The overall picture is that (near) Nambu-Goldstone modes are complex bound states, each with significant intrinsic OAM, independent of the observer's reference frame. This feature must be accounted for in the calculation of observables. Inductively, the same is true for all hadrons.</description>

      <title>Simulating Fully Gauge-Fixed SU(2) Hamiltonian Dynamics on Digital Quantum Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum simulations of many-body systems offer novel methods for probing the dynamics of the Standard Model and its constituent gauge theories. Extracting low-energy predictions from such simulations rely on formulating systematically-improvable representations of lattice gauge theory Hamiltonians that are efficient at all values of the gauge coupling. One such candidate representation for SU(2) is the fully gauge-fixed Hamiltonian defined in the mixed basis. This work focuses on the quantum simulation of the smallest non-trivial system: two plaquettes with open boundary conditions. A mapping of the continuous gauge field degrees of freedom to qubit-based representations is developed. It is found that as few as three qubits per plaquette is sufficient to reach per-mille level precision on predictions for observables. Two distinct algorithms for implementing time evolution in the mixed basis are developed and analyzed in terms of quantum resource estimates. One algorithm has favorable scaling in circuit depth for large numbers of qubits, while the other is more practical when qubit count is limited. The latter algorithm is used in the measurement of a real-time observable on IBM's Heron superconducting quantum processor, ibm_fez. The quantum results match classical predictions at the percent-level. This work lays out a path forward for two- and three-dimensional simulations of larger systems, as well as demonstrating the viability of mixed-basis formulations for studying the properties of SU(2) gauge theories at all values of the gauge coupling.</description>

      <title>Gauge Symmetry in Quantum Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum simulation of non-Abelian gauge theories requires careful handling of gauge redundancy. We address this challenge by presenting universal principles for treating gauge symmetry that apply to any quantum simulation approach, clarifying that physical states need not be represented solely by gauge singlets. Both singlet and non-singlet representations are valid, with distinct practical trade-offs, which we elucidate using analogies to BRST quantization. We demonstrate these principles within a complete quantum simulation framework based on the orbifold lattice, which enables explicit and efficient circuit constructions relevant to real-world QCD. For singlet-based approaches, we introduce a Haar-averaging projection implemented via linear combinations of unitaries, and analyze its cost and truncation errors. Beyond the singlet-approach, we show how non-singlet approaches can yield gauge-invariant observables through wave packets and string excitations. This non-singlet approach is proven to be both universal and efficient. Working in temporal gauge, we provide explicit mappings of lattice Yang-Mills dynamics to Pauli-string Hamiltonians suitable for Trotterization. Classical simulations of small systems validate convergence criteria and quantify truncation and Trotter errors, showing concrete resource estimates and scalable circuit recipes for SU($N$) gauge theories. Our framework provides both conceptual clarity and practical tools toward quantum advantage in simulating non-Abelian gauge theories.</description>

      <title>Molecular states $J/\psi B_{c}^{+}$ and $\eta_{c}B_{c}^{\ast +} $</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hadronic molecules $\mathfrak{M}=J/\psi B_{c}^{+}$ and $\widetilde{\mathfrak{ M}}=\eta _{c}B_{c}^{\ast +}$ are investigated in the framework of QCD sum rule method. These particles with spin-parities $J^{\mathrm{P}}=1^+$ have the quark contents $cc \overline{c}\overline{b}$. We compute their masses and current couplings and find that they are numerically very close to each other. Because it is difficult to distinguish reliably the molecules $J/\psi B_{c}^{+}$ and $J/\psi B_{c}^{+}$, we treat them as identical structures, and consider in details the state $\mathfrak{M}$. Our prediction $m=(9740 \pm 70)~\mathrm{MeV}$ for its mass means that $\mathfrak{M}$ easily decays to pairs of ordinary mesons through strong interactions. There are two mechanisms responsible for transformations of $\mathfrak{M}$ to conventional mesons. The fall-apart mechanism generates the dominant decay channels $ \mathfrak{M} \to J/\psi B_{c}^{+}$ and $\mathfrak{M} \to \eta _{c}B_{c}^{\ast +}$. Annihilation of $\overline{c}c$ quarks triggers subdominant processes with various final-state $B$ and $D$ mesons: Six of such channels are explored in this work. The partial widths of all decays are computed using the three-point sum rule approach. The width $\Gamma[ \mathfrak{M}]=(121 \pm 17)~ \mathrm{MeV}$ of the hadronic axial-vector molecule $\mathfrak{M}$, as well as its mass are valuable for running and future experiments.</description>

      <title>Vector interaction bounds in NJL-like models from LQCD estimated curvature of the chiral crossover line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00653v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We obtain improved bounds on both the flavor-independent and -dependent vector interactions in a $2+1$-flavor Nambu\textendash Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model using the latest precise LQCD results of the curvature coefficients of the chiral crossover line. We find that these lattice estimated curvature coefficients allow for both attractive and repulsive types of interactions in both the cases. With this constrained ranges of vector interactions, we further predict the behavior of the second $(\kappa_2^B)$ and fourth $(\kappa_4^B)$ order curvature coefficients as a function of the strangeness chemical potential $(\mu_S)$. We observe that the flavor mixing effects, arising from the flavor-independent vector interaction as well as from the 't Hooft interaction, play an important role in $k_2^B$. We propose that the mixing effects due to the vector interaction can be separated from those arising from the 't Hooft interaction by analyzing the behavior of $k_2^B$ as a function of $\mu_S$. Finally, we locate the critical endpoint in the $T-\mu_B$ plane using the model-estimated ranges of vector interactions and find the model's predictions to be consistent with the latest LQCD bounds.</description>

      <title>Prompt diphoton production compared to measurements at 13 TeV in $k_t$-factorization: A comparative analysis of unintegrated PDF models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07599v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform an in-depth comparative analysis of unintegrated parton distribution function (UPDF) models for isolated prompt diphoton production in proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13$~TeV within the $k_t$-factorization framework. Predictions are obtained with three UPDF approaches: Parton Branching (PB), NLO-MRW, and Modified KMRW (MKMRW). Tree-level $q + \bar q\!\to\!\gamma +\gamma$, $q + \bar q\!\to\!\gamma + \gamma + g$, and $q + g\!\to\!\gamma +\gamma + q$ subprocesses are generated with \textsc{KaTie} using off-shell initial states; the loop-induced $g + g\!\to\!\gamma + \gamma$ channel is evaluated independently. We compare differential cross sections with ATLAS measurements across a broad set of observables, including the photon transverse momenta, diphoton invariant mass and transverse momentum, the Collins-Soper angle, acoplanarity, $\phi^*_\eta$, and a transverse thrust-related variable. This comparative study quantifies the impact of the UPDF choice on the diphoton spectra. We find that the PB model provides the most consistent agreement over all distributions, whereas NLO-MRW tends to overshoot in regions correlated with larger factorization scales and MKMRW generally undershoots due to stronger Sudakov suppression. With standard scale variations, our results indicate that $k_t$-factorization with PB UPDFs can accurately describe diphoton production, while fixed-order collinear predictions typically require higher-order corrections together with parton-shower effects to achieve a comparable description.</description>

      <title>Quantum State Preparation with Resolution Refinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14732v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a method called resolution refinement that allows one to bootstrap eigenstate preparation on a quantum computer. We first prepare an eigenstate of a low-resolution Hamiltonian using any method of choice. The eigenstate is then lifted to higher resolution and adiabatically evolved to produce the corresponding eigenstate of a higher-fidelity Hamiltonian. We give examples of resolution refinement applied to both single-particle basis states as well as a spatial lattice grid. For basis refinement, we compute few-body ground states of the Busch model for interacting particles in a harmonic trap in one dimension. For lattice refinement, we compute Hartree-Fock nuclear states for a central Woods-Saxon potential in three dimensions, and we compute bound states and continuum states in a multi-species Hubbard model of fermions in one dimension. In all cases, the method is efficient and requires an adiabatic evolution time that scales with the inverse of the energy gap times the square root of the system size. We show that this very favorable scaling arises from the fact that resolution refinement does not make large changes to the structure or energies of the low-energy eigenstates.</description>
