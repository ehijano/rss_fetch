      <title>Comment on "Time Crystal in a Single-mode Nonlinear Cavity"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I argue that a single driven quantum Van der Pol oscillator should not be considered a dissipative time crystal, contrary to previous claims. In particular, I show that its phase is prone to randomly drift when considering dephasing or additional nonlinearities, and hence its oscillations are not robust in that sense. The arguments I provide are applicable to many other models studied in the literature for which the limit of persistent oscillations coincides with the classical limit. I hope that this comment will spark a discussion about what should or should not be considered a time crystal (at least in the context of open quantum systems) and clarify it to a point.</description>

      <title>Quantum Correlations in One Parameter Mixed Quantum States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Munero et. al. developed one parameter family of mixed states $\rho^{l}$, which are more entangled than bipartite Werner state. The similar family of mixed states $\rho^{n}$ are developed by L. Derkacz et. al. with differed approach. Further the author extend $\rho^{n}$ to two parameter family of quantum states $\rho^{m}$ and characterized these states in terms of Bell inequality violation against their mixedness. In the present article, we investigate the comparative dynamics of all mixed states $(\rho^{l},\rho^{n},\rho^{m})$ under the bipartite Ising Hamiltonian exposed by the external magnetic field and investigate the dynamics of quantum correlations against the mixedness quantified by linear entropy</description>

      <title>Self-correcting GKP qubit in a superconducting circuit with an oscillating voltage bias</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a simple circuit architecture for a dissipatively error corrected Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) qubit. The device consists of a electromagnetic resonator with impedance $h/2e^2\approx 12.91\,{\rm k}\Omega$ connected to a Josephson junction with a voltage bias oscillating at twice the resonator frequency. For large drive amplitudes, the circuit is effectively described by the GKP stabilizer Hamiltonian, whose low-energy subspace forms the code space for a qubit protected against phase-space local noise. The GKP states in the codespace can be dissipatively stabilized and error corrected by coupling the resonator to a bath through a bandpass filter; a resulting side-band cooling effect stabilizes the system in the GKP code space, dissipatively correcting it against both bit and phase flip errors. Simulations show that this dissipative error correction can enhance coherence time by factor $\sim 1000$ with NbN-based junctions, for operating temperatures in the $\sim 100\,{\rm mK}$ range. The scheme can be used to stabilize both square- and hexagonal-lattice GKP codes. Finally, a Josephson current based readout scheme, and dissipatively corrected single-qubit Clifford gates are proposed.</description>

      <title>Entanglement asymmetry in periodically driven quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of entanglement asymmetry in periodically driven quantum systems. Using a periodically driven XY chain as a model for a driven integrable quantum system, we provide semi-analytic results for the behavior of the dynamics of the entanglement asymmetry, $\Delta S$, as a function of the drive frequency. Our analysis identifies special drive frequencies at which the driven XY chain exhibits dynamic symmetry restoration and displays quantum Mpemba effect over a long timescale; we identify an emergent approximate symmetry in its Floquet Hamiltonian which plays a crucial role for realization of both these phenomena. We follow these results by numerical computation of $\Delta S$ for the non-integrable driven Rydberg atom chain and obtain similar emergent-symmetry-induced symmetry restoration and quantum Mpemba effect in the prethermal regime for such a system. Finally, we provide an exact analytic computation of the entanglement asymmetry for a periodically driven conformal field theory (CFT) on a strip. Such a driven CFT, depending on the drive amplitude and frequency, exhibits two distinct phases, heating and non-heating, that are separated by a critical line. Our results show that for $m$ cycles of a periodic drive with time period $T$, $\Delta S \sim \ln mT$ [$\ln (\ln mT)$] in the heating phase [on the critical line] for a generic CFT; in contrast, in the non-heating phase, $\Delta S$ displays small amplitude oscillations around it's initial value as a function of $mT$. We provide a phase diagram for the behavior of $\Delta S$ for such driven CFTs as a function of the drive frequency and amplitude.</description>

      <title>Monogamy of entanglement inspired protocol to quantify bipartite entanglement using spin squeezing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum entanglement is an essential resource for several branches of quantum science and technology, however, entanglement detection can be a challenging task, specifically, if typical entanglement measures such as linear entanglement entropy or negativity are the metrics of interest. Here we propose a protocol to detect bipartite entanglement in a system of $N$ qubits inspired by the concept of monogamy of entanglement. We argue that given a total system with some bipartite entanglement between two subsystems, subsequent unitary evolution, and measurement of one of the individual subsystems might be used to quantify the entanglement between the two. To address the difficulty of detection, we propose to use spin squeezing to quantify the entanglement within the individual subsystem, knowing that the relation between spin squeezing and some entanglement measures is not one-to-one, we give some suggestions on how a clever choice of squeezing Hamiltonian can lead to better results in our protocol. For systems with a small number of qubits, we derive analytical results and show how our protocol can work optimally for GHZ states, moreover, for larger systems we show how the accuracy of the protocol can be improved by a proper choice of the squeezing Hamiltonian. Our protocol presents an alternative for entanglement detection in platforms where state tomography is inaccessible (in widely separated entangled systems, for example) or hard to perform, additionally, the ideas presented here can be extended beyond spin-only systems to expand its applicability.</description>

      <title>Characterising higher-order phase correlations in gain-switched laser sources with application to quantum key distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-photon emissions in laser sources represent a serious threat for the security of quantum key distribution (QKD). While the decoy-state technique allows to solve this problem, it requires uniform phase randomisation of the emitted pulses. However, gain-switched lasers operating at high repetition rates do not fully satisfy this requirement, as residual photons in the laser cavity introduce correlations between the phases of consecutive pulses. Here, we introduce experimental schemes to characterise the phase probability distribution of the emitted pulses, and demonstrate that an optimisation task over interferometric measures suffices in determining the impact of arbitrary order correlations, which ultimately establishes the security level of the implementation according to recent security proofs. We expect that our findings may find usages beyond QKD as well.</description>

      <title>Impact of the exciton fine structure splitting and measurement orientations on the robustness of cryptographic keys generated via the quantum protocol E91</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photons and optical circuits are among the most promising platforms for implementation of quantum technologies, because of its potential use in quantum computing, quantum cryptography and long-distance quantum communication. One of the main requirements to achieve reliable quantum communications are on-demand sources of highly entangled photon pairs, and semiconductor quantum dots have emerged as prominent candidates to satisfy the necessary conditions of brightness and entanglement fidelity. However, in most cases the biexciton-exciton-vacuum cascade produces a pair of maximally polarization-entangled photons with a dephasing, due to the exciton fine structure splitting. This work focuses on the performance of the E91 quantum key distribution protocol under the variation of two elements: first, the phase in the input state when the protocol is implemented using entangled photons generated via the radiative cascade, and second, the relative directions of the polarization analyzers. We obtain analytical expressions for the protocol's secret key rate and Bell's parameter as functions of the studied phase and angles. Then, we validate those expressions by means of a quantum computational implementation with the IBM's API Qiskit. Our results show that the performance of the quantum transmission is highly impacted by the product between the exciton lifetime and the quantum dot's fine structure splitting and that such an impact may be modulated through the orientation of the polarizers. These findings provide important insight for the scalable implementation of quantum key distribution protocols with quantum dots as entanglement sources.</description>

      <title>Quantum circuit and mapping algorithms for wavepacket dynamics: case study of anharmonic hydrogen bonds in protonated and hydroxide water clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The accurate computational study of wavepacket nuclear dynamics is considered to be a classically intractable problem, particularly with increasing dimensions. Here we present two algorithms that, in conjunction with other methods developed by us, will form the basis for performing quantum nuclear dynamics in arbitrary dimensions. For one algorithm, we present a direct map between the Born-Oppenheimer Hamiltonian describing the wavepacket time-evolution and the control parameters of a spin-lattice Hamiltonian that describes the dynamics of qubit states in an ion-trap quantum computer. This map is exact for three qubits, and when implemented, the dynamics of the spin states emulate those of the nuclear wavepacket. However, this map becomes approximate as the number of qubits grow. In a second algorithm we present a general quantum circuit decomposition formalism for such problems using a method called the Quantum Shannon Decomposition. This algorithm is more robust and is exact for any number of qubits, at the cost of increased circuit complexity. The resultant circuit is implemented on IBM's quantum simulator (QASM) for 3-7 qubits. In both cases the wavepacket dynamics is found to be in good agreement with the classical result and the corresponding vibrational frequencies obtained from the wavepacket density time-evolution, are in agreement to within a few tenths of a wavenumbers.</description>

      <title>On-Chip Enhanced Biphoton Generation with Incoherent Light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On-chip quantum photon sources are pivotal components in integrated photonics, driving significant advancements in quantum information technologies over recent decades. Traditionally, the coherence of the pump beam has been considered a critical property in ensuring the quality of the source. In this work, we produce a photon-pair source via spontaneous four-wave mixing pumped by temporally incoherent light in a standard silicon nanowire. Compared to a coherent laser, the incoherence improves pump utilization efficiency, which results in higher source brightness. Additionally, its spectrally uncorrelated nature of incoherent light is transferred to the generated photon source, allowing high-purity state preparation without the need for narrow filtering. Experimentally, we demonstrate the advantages using an amplified spontaneous emission source over a continuous-wave laser. With temporally incoherent pumping, the photon pair generation rate increases by 40%. The coincidence-to-accidental ratio and heralded second-order autocorrelation exhibit improved performance at low power. Our work expands the scope of incoherently pumped quantum states and provides a method for generating photon sources using a more readily accessible light.</description>

      <title>Clifford-Deformed Compass Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We can design efficient quantum error-correcting (QEC) codes by tailoring them to our choice of quantum architecture. Useful tools for constructing such codes include Clifford deformations and appropriate gauge fixings of compass codes. In this work, we find Clifford deformations that can be applied to elongated compass codes resulting in QEC codes with improved performance under noise models with errors biased towards dephasing commonly seen in quantum computing architectures. These Clifford deformations enhance decoder performance by introducing symmetries, while the stabilizers of compass codes can be selected to obtain more information on high-rate errors. As a result, the codes exhibit thresholds that increase with bias and display lower logical error rates. One of the Clifford deformations we explore yields QEC codes with better thresholds and logical error rates than those of the XZZX surface code at moderate biases.</description>

      <title>On the role of the unitary transformations in Bell inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The role of the unitary transformations in the Bell-CHSH inequality is highlighted, in both Quantum Mechanics and relativistic Quantum Field Theory. In the former case, we discuss, through a few examples, how the violation of the Bell-CHSH inequality can be encoded into unitary transformations acting on a given reference set of Bell's observables. In the latter case, the Bell-CHSH inequality for a real massive scalar field in the vacuum state is considered. After introducing suitable bounded Hermitian operators, we show that using unitary transformations can significantly improve our previous numerical algorithm, leading to an increase in the size of the violation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the growing number of satellite-based Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) payload launches, it becomes essential to ensure compatibility across different platforms for satellite tracking and quantum signal acquisition. In this paper, the Technology Innovation Institute (TII) presents the development of the Abu Dhabi Quantum Optical Ground Station (ADQOGS) for secure free-space optical communications. With the know-how of GA-Synopta's experienced engineering team, we have developed a versatile multi-wavelength quantum acquisition and tracking system tailored to support various upcoming space-based QKD missions, crucial for the practical implementation of global quantum communication networks. This system is capable of handling multiple wavelengths, ranging from 600 nm to 1560 nm for downlink beacons and 1530 nm to 1610 nm for uplink beacons. It includes a free-space quantum module adequate to detect QKD signals at $780\pm10$ nm and $850\pm3$ nm and offers spatial and spectral filtering capabilities along with a motorized polarization correction system.</description>

      <title>Squeezing and Entanglement Dynamics in Phase-Sensitive Non-Hermitian Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past decade, parity-time (PT) symmetry and anti-PT (APT) symmetry in various physical systems have been extensively studied, leading to significant experimental and theoretical advancements. However, physical systems that simultaneously exhibit both PT and APT symmetry have not yet been explored. In this study, we construct a phase-sensitive non-Hermitian wave mixing model that inherently possesses single-mode APT symmetry. By tuning the phase of the pump field, this model simultaneously exhibits two-mode quadrature-PT symmetry. Moreover, the APT phase transition is accompanied by the emergence of quantum entanglement from absence to presence. This remarkable quantum effect, quantum entanglement, which distinguishes itself from classical physics, is surprisingly linked to APT symmetry phase transition. Our work further explores the relationship between two-mode quantum entanglement and the phase of the pump field, offering deeper insight into the generation and evolution of entanglement in the corresponding nonlinear system. This provides a new perspective on quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>A robust quantum nonlinear solver based on the asymptotic numerical method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing offers a promising new avenue for advancing computational methods in science and engineering. In this work, we introduce the quantum asymptotic numerical method, a novel quantum nonlinear solver that combines Taylor series expansions with quantum linear solvers to efficiently address nonlinear problems. By linearizing nonlinear problems using the Taylor series, the method transforms them into sequences of linear equations solvable by quantum algorithms, thus extending the convergence region for solutions and simultaneously leveraging quantum computational advantages. Numerical tests on the quantum simulator Qiskit confirm the convergence and accuracy of the method in solving nonlinear problems. Additionally, we apply the proposed method to a beam buckling problem, demonstrating its robustness in handling strongly nonlinear problems and its potential advantages in quantum resource requirements. Furthermore, we perform experiments on a superconducting quantum processor from Quafu, successfully achieving up to 98% accuracy in the obtained nonlinear solution path. We believe this work contributes to the utility of quantum computing in scientific computing applications.</description>

      <title>The Mpemba effect in quantum oscillating and two-level systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Empemba effect (ME) is investigated in the context of ubiquitous quantum oscillating and two-level systems (TLS) using a novel approach (DOI 10.1088/1402-4896/ad97f1). Exact reduced density matrices for various initial states are derived. The temporal behavior of the trace distance for these initial states is calculated analytically and presented. For a dissipative quantum oscillating system, it is demonstrated that number states $|N\ra$ intersect with coherent states $|\alpha\ra$, with this intersection occurring earlier for smaller values of $N$. Additionally, thermal states intersect with coherent states for specific values of $|\alpha|$, leading to the occurrence of the ME in these two scenarios. A weaker version of the ME is also observed for thermal and number states. In the case of a quantum TLS, it is shown that the ME effect occurs, and the potential for its realization and experimental observation is discussed, with reference to the Jaynes-Cummings model (JCM) involving a decaying time-dependent coupling function.</description>

      <title>Calibration of cascaded phase shifters using pairwise scan method in silicon photonics integrated chip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cascaded phase shifters (CPSs) based on silicon photonics integrated chips play important roles in quantum information processing tasks. Owing to an increase in the scale of silicon photonics chips, the time required to calibrate various CPSs has increased. We propose a pairwise scan method for rapidly calibrating CPSs by introducing equivalent Mach Zehnder Interferometer structures and a reasonable constraint of the initial relative phase. The calibration can be nearly completed when the scanning process is finished, and only a little calculation is required. To achieve better performance, the key components, thermal optical phase shifter and 2 * 2 50/50 multimode interference coupler, were simulated and optimized to prevent thermal crosstalk and ensure a good balance. A 6-CPSs structure in a packaged silicon photonics chip under different temperature was used to verify the rapid pairwise scan method, and a fidelity of 99.97% was achieved.</description>

      <title>Utilizing redundancies in Qubit Hilbert Space to reduce entangling gate counts in the Unitary Vibrational Coupled-Cluster Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new method for state preparation using the Unitary Vibrational Coupled-Cluster (UVCC) technique. Our approach utilizes redundancies in the Hilbert space in the direct mapping of vibrational modes into qubits. By eliminating half of the qubit controls required in the Trotterized UVCC ansatz, our method achieves up to a 50% theoretical reduction in the entangling gate count compared to other methods and up to a 28% reduction compared practically useful approaches. This improvement enhances the fidelity of UVCC state preparation, enabling more efficient and earlier implementation of complex quantum vibrational structure calculations on near-term quantum devices. We experimentally demonstrate our method on Quantinuum's H1-1 quantum hardware, achieving significantly higher fidelities for 6- and 8-qubit systems compared to existing implementations. For fault-tolerant architectures, eliminating half of the control qubits in multi-controlled rotations incurs an additional Toffoli gate overhead elsewhere in the circuit. Thus, the overall performance gain depends on the specific decomposition method used for multi-controlled gates.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we propose a novel quantum regression model by extending the Real-Part Quantum SVM. We apply our model to the problem of stability limit prediction in milling processes, a key component in high-precision manufacturing. To train our model, we use a custom data set acquired by an extensive series of milling experiments using different spindle speeds, enhanced with a custom feature map. We show that the resulting model predicts the stability limits observed in our physical setup accurately, demonstrating that quantum computing is capable of deploying ML models for real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of Enhanced Qubit Readout via Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measurement is an essential component for robust and practical quantum computation. For superconducting qubits, the measurement process involves the effective manipulation of the joint qubit-resonator dynamics, and should ideally provide the highest quality for qubit state discrimination with the shortest readout pulse and resonator reset time. Here, we harness model-free reinforcement learning (RL) together with a tailored training environment to achieve this multi-pronged optimization task. We demonstrate on the IBM quantum device that the measurement pulse obtained by the RL agent not only successfully achieves state-of-the-art performance, with an assignment error of $(4.6 \pm 0.4)\times10^{-3}$, but also executes the readout and the subsequent resonator reset almost 3x faster than the system's default process. Furthermore, the learned waveforms are robust against realistic parameter drifts and follow a generalized analytical form, making them readily implementable in practice with no significant computation overhead. Our results provide an effective readout strategy to boost the performance of superconducting quantum processors and demonstrate the prowess of RL in providing optimal and experimentally informed solutions for complex quantum information processing tasks.</description>

      <title>Super-Poissonian Squeezed Light in the Deep Strong Regime of the Quantum Rabi Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By analytically solving the quantum Rabi model, we investigate the photonic properties of its ground eigenstate. In particular, we find that in the deep strong coupling regime, where the coupling strength $g$ exceeds the mode frequency $\omega$, the photonic state is effectively squeezed in one of its quadratures. The squeezing reaches its maximum at the curve corresponding to the quantum phase transition of the quantum Rabi system, and decreases rapidly on both sides of the phase transition. Notably, for $g/\omega\approx 3$, which is experimentally testable in existing trapped-ion platforms, the achievable squeezing parameter can reach approximately $r\approx 0.8$. Intriguingly, the photonic state is squeezed while its number distribution follows a super-Poissonian distribution, with the largest deviation from Poissonian behavior occurring at the phase transition between the normal and superradiant phases. In other words, the ground state of the quantum Rabi model contains super-Poissonian quantum squeezed photons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit an argument proposed by Hardy concerning local realistic theories, but in terms of probability currents in standard quantum mechanics and of the trajectories obtained from its flux lines. We emphasize surprising properties of the trajectories in configuration space, in particular their (quasi) discontinuous variations when the context (the experimental setup) is changed. This occurs in both Galilean and Einsteinian relativity. In the latter case, discontinuous variations also appear without changing the setup, when the Lorentzian reference frame is changed.</description>

      <title>Frequency-tunable biphoton generation via spontaneous four-wave mixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present experimental results on tuning biphoton frequency by introducing a detuned coupling field in spontaneous four-wave mixing (SFWM), and examine its impact on the pairing ratio. This tunability is achieved by manipulating the inherent electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) effect in the double-$\Lambda$ scheme. Introducing a detuned coupling field degrades the efficiency of EIT-based stimulated four-wave mixing, which in turn reduces the biphoton pairing ratio. However, this reduction can be mitigated by increasing the optical power of the coupling field. Additionally, we observe that blue- and red-detuning the biphoton frequency results in distinct temporal profiles of biphoton wavepackets due to phase mismatch. These findings provide insights into the mechanisms of frequency-tunable biphoton generation via SFWM, and suggest potential optimizations for applications in quantum communication and information processing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and analyze an active steering protocol designed to target multipartite entangled states. The protocol involves multiple qubits subjected to weak Bell pair measurements with active feedback, where the feedback operations are optimized to maximize the Quantum Fisher Information. Our scheme efficiently reaches a genuinely entangled one-parameter state manifold. Numerical simulations for systems with up to 20 qubits suggest that the protocol is scalable and allows high multipartite entanglement across the system.</description>

      <title>Pruning qLDPC codes: Towards bivariate bicycle codes with open boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum low-density parity-check codes are promising candidates for quantum error correcting codes as they might offer more resource-efficient alternatives to surface code architectures. In particular, bivariate bicycle codes have recently gained attention due to their 2D-local structure, high encoding rate, and promising performance under simulation. In this work, we will explore how one can transform bivariate bicycle codes defined on lattices with periodic boundary conditions to codes with the same locality properties on a 2D lattice with open boundary conditions. For this, we introduce the concept of pruning quantum codes. We explain how pruning bivariate bicycle codes is always possible when the codes are hypergraph products of two classical cyclic codes. We also indicate that this might be possible for more general bivariate bicycle codes by constructing explicit examples. Finally, we investigate fault-tolerant quantum computation using the constructed pruned codes by describing fold-transversal gates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum entanglement, a fundamental feature of quantum mechanics, has become a powerful tool impacting various areas of physics. In this proceeding, we investigate the presence of quantum entanglement within the Higgs to ZZ* (HZZ*) interaction at the ATLAS experiment. Utilizing quantum tomography techniques, we extract the complete spin density matrix characterizing the HZZ* interaction from ATLAS Standard Monte Carlo (MC) HZZ* 4l Run2 samples. We then evaluate the presence of quantum entanglement in the system using the derived spin density matrix. Our investigation sheds light on the entanglement properties within the HZZ* interaction, which offers valuable insights into its quantum characteristics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the standard semiclassical theory of Exited-State Quantum Phase Transitions (ESQPTs), based on a classification of stationary points in the classical Hamiltonian, to constrained systems. We adopt the method of Lagrange multipliers to find all stationary points and their properties directly from the Hamiltonian constrained by an arbitrary number of integrals of motion, and demonstrate the procedure on an algebraic u(3) boson model with two independent constraints. We also elaborate the Holstein-Primakoff (HP) mapping, used to eliminate one degree of freedom in bosonic systems constrained by a conserved number of excitations, and address the fact that this mapping leads, in the classical limit, to a compact phase space with singular behaviour that conceals some stationary points at the phase space boundary. It is shown that the HP method reveals all ESQPTs only after constructing a complete atlas of different HP mappings.</description>

      <title>Multipartite entanglement distribution in Bell-pair networks without Steiner trees and with reduced gate cost</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multipartite entangled states, particularly Greenberger--Horne--Zeilinger (GHZ) and other graph states, are important resources in multiparty quantum network protocols and measurement-based quantum computing. We consider the problem of generating such states from networks of bipartite entangled (Bell) pairs. Although an optimal protocol (in terms of time steps and consumed Bell pairs) for generating GHZ states in Bell-pair networks has been identified in [Phys. Rev. A 100, 052333 (2019)], it makes use of at most $O(N^2)$ gates, where $N$ is the number of nodes in the network. It also involves solving the NP-hard Steiner tree problem as an initial step. Reducing the gate cost is an important consideration now and into the future, because both qubits and gate operations are noisy. To this end, we present a protocol for producing GHZ states in arbitrary Bell-pair networks that provably requires only $O(N)$ gates, and we present numerical evidence that our protocol indeed reduces the gate cost on real-world network models, compared to prior work. Notably, the gate cost of our protocol depends only on the number of nodes and is independent of the topology of the network. At the same time, our protocol maintains nearly the optimal number of consumed Bell pairs, and it avoids finding a Steiner tree or solving any other computationally hard problem by running in polynomial time with respect to $N$. By considering the number of gates as a figure of merit, our work approaches entanglement distribution from the perspective that, in practice, unlike the traditional information-theoretic setting, local operations and classical communications are not free.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A full understanding of open quantum systems requires the characterization of both system and environmental properties. However, the complexity of the environmental statistics in the presence of strong system-bath hybridization and long memory effects usually prevents effective non-perturbative methods from going beyond the analysis of the reduced system dynamics. Here we present a model consisting of purified auxiliary bosonic modes to describe, alongside properties of the system, the dynamics of environmental observables for bosonic baths prepared in non-Gaussian initial states. We numerically exemplify this method by simulating non-Markovian multi-photon transfer processes on a coupled cavity waveguide system in the large time delay regime.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a method for partial state reconstruction of multiphoton states in multimode ($N$-photon $M$-mode) linear optical networks (LONs) employing only two bucket photon-number-resolving (PNR) detectors. The reconstructed Heisenberg-Weyl-reduced (HW-reduced) density matrix captures quantum coherence and symmetry with respect to HW operators. Employing deterministic quantum computing with one qubit (DQC1) circuits, we reduce the detector requirement from $M$ to $2$, while the requirement on measurement configurations are retained $\mathcal{O}(M^{\max(3,N)})$. To ensure physicality, maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) is incorporated into the DQC1 reconstruction process, with numerical simulations demonstrating the robustness and efficiency of our approach. This method offers a resource-efficient solution for state characterization in large-scale LONs to advance photonic quantum technologies.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The eigenstates of a chaotic system can be enhanced along underlying unstable periodic orbits in so-called quantum scars, making it more likely for a particle launched along one such orbits to be found still there at long times. Unstable periodic orbits are however a negligible part of the phase space, and a question arises regarding the structure of the wavefunction elsewhere. Here, we address this question and show that a weakly-dispersing dynamics of a localized wavepacket in phase space leaves a "quantum trail" on the eigenstates, that is, makes them vary slowly when moving along a trajectories in phase space, even if not periodic. The quantum trails underpin a remarkable dynamical effect: for a system initialized in a localized wavepacket, the long-time phase-space distribution is enhanced along the short-time trajectory, which can result in ergodicity breaking. We provide the general intuition for these effects and prove them in the stadium billiard, for which an unwarping procedure allows to visualize the phase space on the two-dimensional space of the page.</description>

      <title>Clustering-induced localization of quantum walks on networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum walks on networks are a paradigmatic model in quantum information theory. Quantum-walk algorithms have been developed for various applications, including spatial-search problems, element-distinctness problems, and node centrality analysis. Unlike their classical counterparts, the evolution of quantum walks is unitary, so they do not converge to a stationary distribution. However, it is important for many applications to understand the long-time behavior of quantum walks and the impact of network structure on their evolution. In the present paper, we study the localization of quantum walks on networks. We demonstrate how localization emerges in highly clustered networks that we construct by recursively attaching triangles, and we derive an analytical expression for the long-time inverse participation ratio that depends on products of eigenvectors of the quantum-walk Hamiltonian. Building on the insights from this example, we then show that localization also occurs in Kleinberg navigable small-world networks and Holme--Kim power-law cluster networks. Our results illustrate that local clustering, which is a key structural feature of networks, can induce localization of quantum walks.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Quantum Amplitude Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum amplitude estimation is a fundamental routine that offers a quadratic speed-up over classical approaches. The original QAE protocol is based on phase estimation. The associated circuit depth and width, and the assumptions of fault tolerance, are unfavorable for near-term quantum technology. Subsequent approaches attempt to replace the original protocol with hybrid iterative quantum-classical strategies. In this work, we introduce BAE, a noise-aware Bayesian algorithm for QAE that combines quantum circuits with a statistical inference backbone. BAE can dynamically characterize device noise and adapt to it in real-time. Problem-specific insights and approximations are used to keep the problem tractable. We further propose an annealed variant of BAE, drawing on methods from statistical inference, to enhance statistical robustness. Our proposal is parallelizable in both quantum and classical components, offers tools for fast noise model assessment, and can leverage preexisting information. Additionally, it accommodates experimental limitations and preferred cost trade-offs. We show that BAE achieves Heisenberg-limited estimation and benchmark it against other approaches, demonstrating its competitive performance in both noisy and noiseless scenarios.</description>

      <title>Multi-Screen Entanglement in Tensorial Quantum Mechanics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we present an invariant-objective formalization of multi screen-entanglement grounded on Tensorial Quantum Mechanics (TQM) [12]. This new tensorial formulation of the theory of quanta -- basically, an extension of Heisenberg's matrix mechanics -- allows not only to escape the many problems present in the current account of multi-partite entanglement grounded on the Dirac-Von Neumann Standard formulation of Quantum Mechanics (SQM) but, more importantly, to consistently represent entanglement phenomena when considering a multiplicity of different screens and detectors.</description>

      <title>Boosting quantum annealing performance through direct polynomial unconstrained binary optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum annealing aims at solving optimization problems of practical relevance using quantum computing hardware. Problems of interest are typically formulated in terms of quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) Hamiltonians. However, many optimization problems are much more naturally formulated in terms of polynomial unconstrained binary optimization (PUBO) functions of higher order. As we show with various problem examples, leveraging the PUBO formulation can bring considerable savings in terms of required number of qubits. Moreover, in numerical benchmarks for the paradigmatic 3-SAT problem, we find scenarios where the scaling of the minimal gap during the optimization sweep differs significantly, suggesting the possibility of an exponentially faster annealing time when using the PUBO as compared to the QUBO formulation. This advantage persists even when considering the overhead in implementing the higher-order interactions necessary for PUBO cost Hamiltonians. As an interesting side effect, the analysis on minimum energy gaps of different 3-SAT instance generators reveals different degrees of hardness, which will be of interest also for classical benchmark calculations. Our findings show a promising path to improving the resource efficiency and sweeping speed of quantum annealing, important prerequisites when aiming at solving larger optimization problems with relevance to industry.</description>

      <title>From Magic State Distillation to Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magic State Distillation (MSD) has been a research focus for fault-tolerant quantum computing due to the need for non-Clifford resource in gaining quantum advantage. Although many of the MSD protocols so far are based on stabilizer codes with transversal $T$ gates, there exists quite several protocols that don't fall into this class. We propose a method to map MSD protocols to iterative dynamical systems under the framework of stabilizer reduction. With our mapping, we are able to analyze the performance of MSD protocols using techniques from dynamical systems theory, easily simulate the distillation process of input states under arbitrary noise model and visualize it using flow diagram. We apply our mapping to common MSD protocols for $\ket{T}$ state and find some interesting properties: The $[[15, 1, 3]]$ code may distill states corresponding to $\sqrt{T}$ gate and the $[[5, 1, 3]]$ code can distill the magic state for corresponding to the $T$ gate. Besides, we examine the exotic MSD protocols that may distill into other magic states proposed in [Eur. Phys. J. D 70, 55 (2016)] and identify the condition for distillable magic states. We also study new MSD protocols generated by concatenating different codes and numerically demonstrate that concatenation can generate MSD protocols with various magic states. By concatenating efficient codes with exotic codes, we can reduce the overhead of the exotic MSD protocols. We believe our proposed method will be a useful tool for simulating and visualization MSD protocols for canonical MSD protocols on $\ket{T}$ as well as other unexplored MSD protocols for other states.</description>

      <title>Emergent unitary designs for encoded qubits from coherent errors and syndrome measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unitary $k$-designs are distributions of unitary gates that match the Haar distribution up to its $k$-th statistical moment. They are a crucial resource for randomized quantum protocols. However, their implementation on encoded logical qubits is nontrivial due to the need for magic gates, which can require a large resource overhead. In this work, we propose an efficient approach to generate unitary designs for encoded qubits in surface codes by applying local unitary rotations ("coherent errors") on the physical qubits followed by syndrome measurement and error correction. We prove that under some conditions on the coherent errors (notably including all single-qubit unitaries) and on the error correcting code, this process induces a unitary transformation of the logical subspace. We numerically show that the ensemble of logical unitaries (indexed by the random syndrome outcomes) converges to a unitary design in the thermodynamic limit, provided the density or strength of coherent errors is above a finite threshold. This "unitary design" phase transition coincides with the code's coherent error threshold under optimal decoding. Furthermore, we propose a classical algorithm to simulate the protocol based on a "staircase" implementation of the surface code encoder and decoder circuits. This enables a mapping to a 1+1D monitored circuit, where we observe an entanglement phase transition (and thus a classical complexity phase transition of the decoding algorithm) coinciding with the aforementioned unitary design phase transition. Our results provide a practical way to realize unitary designs on encoded qubits, with applications including quantum state tomography and benchmarking in error correcting codes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the achievement of single-qubit gates with sub-part-per-million error rates, in a trapped-ion $^{43}$Ca$^{+}$ hyperfine clock qubit. We explore the speed/fidelity trade-off for gate times $4.4\leq t_{g}\leq35~\mu$s, and benchmark a minimum error of $1.5(4) \times 10^{-7}$. Gate calibration errors are suppressed to $&lt; 10^{-8}$, leaving qubit decoherence ($T_{2}\approx 70$ s), leakage and measurement as the dominant error contributions. The ion is held above a microfabricated surface-electrode trap which incorporates a chip-integrated microwave resonator for electronic qubit control; the trap is operated at room temperature without magnetic shielding.</description>

      <title>Negative refraction of light in an atomic medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03622v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quest to manipulate light propagation in ways not possible with natural media has driven the development of artificially structured metamaterials. One of the most striking effects is negative refraction, where the light beam deflects away from the boundary normal. However, due to material characteristics, the applications of this phenomenon, such as lensing that surpasses the diffraction limit, have been constrained. Here, we demonstrate negative refraction of light in an atomic medium without the use of artificial metamaterials, employing essentially exact simulations of light propagation. High transmission negative refraction is achieved in atomic arrays for different level structures and lattice constants, within the scope of currently realised experimental systems. We introduce an intuitive description of negative refraction based on collective excitation bands, whose transverse group velocities are antiparallel to the excitation quasi-momenta. We also illustrate how this phenomenon is robust to lattice imperfections and can be significantly enhanced through subradiance.</description>

      <title>Gauge-invariant projector calculus for quantum state geometry and applications to observables in crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03637v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The importance of simple geometrical invariants, such as the Berry curvature and quantum metric, constructed from the Bloch states of a crystal has become well-established over four decades of research. More complex aspects of geometry emerge in properties linking multiple bands, such as optical responses. In the companion work [arXiv:2409.16358], we identified novel multi-state geometrical invariants using an explicitly gauge-invariant formalism based on projection operators, which we used to clarify the relation between the shift current and the theory of electronic polarization among other advancements for second-order non-linear optics. Here, we provide considerably more detail on the projector formalism and the geometrical invariants arising in the vicinity of a specific value of crystal momentum. We combine the introduction to multi-state quantum geometry with broadly relevant algebraic relationships and detailed example calculations, enabling extensions toward future applications to topological and geometrical properties of insulators and metals.</description>

      <title>A solvable model for strongly interacting nonequilibrium excitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03641v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the driven-dissipative Bose-Hubbard model with all-to-all hopping and subject to incoherent pumping and decay, as is naturally probed in several recent experiments on excitons in WS2/WSe2 moir\'e systems, as well as quantum simulators. By positing a particular form of coupling to the environment, we derive the Lindblad jump operators and show that, in certain limits, the system admits a closed-form expression for the steady-state density matrix. Away from the exactly solvable regions, the steady-state can be obtained numerically for 100s-1000s of sites. We study the nonequilibrium phase diagram and phase transitions, which qualitatively matches the equilibrium phase diagram, agreeing with the intuition that increasing the intensity of the light is equivalent to changing the bosonic chemical potential. However, the steady-states are far from thermal states and the nature of the phase transitions is changed.</description>

      <title>Gauge fields induced by curved spacetime on a lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03647v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I found an extended duality (triality) between Dirac fermions in periodic spacetime metrics, nonrelativistic fermions in gauge fields (e.g., Harper-Hofstadter model), and in periodic scalar fields on a lattice (e.g., Aubry-Andr\'e model). This indicates an unexpected equivalence between spacetime metrics, gauge fields, and scalar fields on the lattice, which is understood as different physical representations of the same mathematical object, the quantum group $\mathcal{U}_q(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$. This quantum group is generated by the exponentiation of two canonical conjugate operators, namely a linear combination of position and momentum (periodic spacetime metrics), the two components of the gauge invariant momentum (gauge fields), position and momentum (periodic scalar fields). Hence, on a lattice, Dirac fermions in a periodic spacetime metric are equivalent to nonrelativistic fermions in a periodic scalar field after a proper canonical transformation. The three lattice Hamiltonians (periodic spacetime metric, Harper-Hofstadter, and Aubry-Andr\'e) share the same properties, namely fractal phase diagrams, self-similarity, topological invariants, flat bands, and topological quantized current in the incommensurate regimes.</description>

      <title>The Diagonal Approximation for Holographic R\'{e}nyi Entropies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently Dong, Rath and Kudler-Flam proposed a modified cosmic brane prescription for computing the R\'{e}nyi entropy $S_\alpha$ of a holographic system in the presence of multiple extremal surfaces. This prescription was found by assuming a diagonal approximation, where the R\'{e}nyi entropy is computed after first measuring the areas of all extremal surfaces. We derive this diagonal approximation and show that it accurately computes R\'{e}nyi entropies up to $O(\log G)$ corrections. For $\alpha&lt;1$, this allows us to derive the modified cosmic brane prescription, which differs from the original cosmic brane prescription at leading order in $G$. For $\alpha&gt;1$, it leads to the original cosmic brane prescription without needing to assume that replica symmetry is unbroken in the bulk.</description>

Abstract: While playing an important role in the foundations of quantum theory, Quantum Speed Limits (QSL) have no role in discussions about the search for quantum gravity. We fill this gap by analysing what QSL arises when superposing spherically symmetric masses in canonical quantum gravity. By this procedure, we find that the quantum mechanical Mandelstam-Tamm and Margolus-Levitin bounds can be improved by superposing a spherically symmetric, static and asymptotically flat spacetime between states with different ADM energies and mass densities. We discuss the feasibility and significance of measuring times via these superpositions.</description>

      <title>Nonuniform Parafermion Chains: Low-Energy Physics and Finite-Size Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nonuniform $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetric Kitaev chain, comprising alternating topological and normal regions, hosts localized states known as edge-zero modes (EZMs) at its interfaces. These EZMs can pair to form qubits that are resilient to quantum decoherence, a feature expected to extend to higher symmetric chains, i.e., parafermion chains. However, finite-size effects may impact this ideal picture. Diagnosing these effects requires first a thorough understanding of the low-energy physics where EZMs may emerge. Previous studies have largely focused on uniform chains, with nonuniform cases inferred from these results. While recent work [Narozhny, Sci. Rep. 7, 1447 (2017)] provides an insightful analytical solution for a nonuniform $\mathbb{Z}_2$ chain with two topological regions separated by a normal one, its complexity limits its applicability to chains with more regions or higher symmetries. Here, we present a new approach based on decimating the highest-energy terms, facilitating the scalable analysis of $\mathbb{Z}_n$ chains with any number of regions. We provide analytical results for both $\mathbb{Z}_2$ and$\mathbb{Z}_3$ chains, supported by numerical findings, and identify the critical lengths necessary to preserve well-separated EZMs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Several studies have emphasized the impact of long-range Coulomb interactions in lattice fermions, yet conventional Auxiliary Field Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods face limitations due to their reliance on positive definite interaction matrices. We address this by decomposing the interaction matrix into positive- and negative-definite components, allowing for QMC calculations with manageable sign properties. This technique enables effective simulations on large lattices. Applying it to a honeycomb lattice with an indefinite interaction matrix, we identify a semi-metal to charge density wave phase transition within the Gross-Neveu criticality class. Notably, the phase transition boundary aligns with regions where the average sign sharply decreases, providing new evidence to the increasingly compelling research on the relationship between phase transitions and the sign problem.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic Investigations of Multiple Environments in Er:CaWO4 through Charge Imbalance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a detailed spectroscopic study of the $^4\mathrm{I}_{13/2}$ and $^4\mathrm{I}_{15/2}$ Er$^{3+}$ multiplets of Er:CaWO$_4$ grown without a co-dopant. Using photoluminescence and photoluminescence excitation measurements, we find multiple environments into which the Erbium ions are incorporated in the crystal. For the four most prevalent environments, we provide a complete assignment of the $^4\mathrm{I}_{13/2}$ and $^4\mathrm{I}_{15/2}$ sublevel energies. Polarization-dependent absorption and emission spectroscopy allow us to identify the irreducible representations of the states and determine the dipole nature of transitions. In addition, we compare the different relaxation paths within $^4\mathrm{I}_{13/2}$ and $^4\mathrm{I}_{15/2}$ multiplets via line broadening and lifetime measurements. Finally, spectral, lifetime, and polarization measurements indicate similarities between the studied environments.</description>

Abstract: The spin and orbital are two basic degrees of freedom, which play significant roles in exploring exotic quantum phases in optical lattices with synthetic spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and high orbital bands, respectively. Here, we propose an orbital optical Raman lattice to study exotic high-orbital Bose condensates with Raman-induced SOC in a square lattice. We find that both the SOC and p-orbital interactions influence the condensed state of bosons. Their interplay results in two novel high-orbital many-body quantum phases: the uniform angular momentum superfluid phase, which features a global topological chiral orbital current, and the two-dimensional spin-orbital supersolid phase, which is characterized by the spin and orbital angular momentum density wave patterns. The former has topological Bogoliubov excitations characterized by a uniform Chern number, while the spin-orbital supersolid phase hosts topological excitations with opposite Chern numbers which respectively protect the chiral and antichiral edge modes in the neighboring supersolid clusters. Our findings may inspire a new avenue for exploring exotic SOC and high-orbital physics in optical lattices, and shall also advance the experimental progress of novel supersolids in higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Topological Aspects of Dirac Fermions in a Kagom\'e Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Dirac fermion with linear dispersion in the kagom\'e lattice governs the low-energy physics of different valleys at two inequivalent corners of hexagonal Brillouin zone. The effective Hamiltonian based on the cyclic permutation symmetry of sublattices is constructed to show that the topology of Dirac fermions at these two valleys is characterized by opposite winding numbers. For spinless fermions, the Dirac semimetal phase is unstable against the many-particle interactions due to the intervalley scattering, which spontaneously breaks the translation symmetry. The Dirac fermions acquire a mass term from the simultaneous charge and bond orderings. In this phase, the developed bond texture underlies a hollow-star-of-David pattern in a tripled Wigner-Seitz cell of kagom\'e lattice. It is further demonstrated that the twisting of Dirac mass with vorticity leads to zero Dirac modes at the vortex core, which are intimately related to the fractionalization. The hollow-star-of-David phase is shown to have a distinct $\mathbb{Z}_6$ Berry phase with its sign-change counterpart of Dirac mass, i.e. the hexagonal phase, shedding light on the topological origin of zero Dirac modes around the vortex core.</description>

      <title>Bound of Casimir Effect by Holography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04122v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the Kovtun-Son-Starinet bound, we propose that holography impose a lower bound on the Casimir effect. For simplicity, we focus on the Casimir effect between parallel planes for 3d conformal field theories and briefly comment on the generalizations to other boundary shapes and higher dimensions. Remarkably, the ghost-free holographic models impose a universal lower bound of the Casimir effect. We verify the holographic bound by free theories, Ising model, and $O(N)$ model with $N=2,3$ at critical points. Remarkably, the holographic bound is also obeyed by a general class of quantum field theories without conformal symmetries. It is interesting to find a field-theoretical proof or counterexample for the holographic bound of Casimir effect.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04133v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Matrix models, as quantum mechanical systems without explicit spatial dependence, provide valuable insights into higher-dimensional gauge and gravitational theories, especially within the framework of string theory, where they can describe quantum black holes via the holographic principle. Simulating these models allows for exploration of their kinematic and dynamic properties, particularly in parameter regimes that are analytically intractable. In this study, we examine the potential of tensor network techniques for such simulations. Specifically, we construct ground states as matrix product states and analyse features such as their entanglement structure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04152v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robust states emerging at the boundaries of a system are an important hallmark of topological matter. Here, using the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model and the Kitaev chain as examples, we study the impact of a type of experimentally realizable bond dissipation on topological systems by calculating the steady-state density matrix, and demonstrate that such dissipation applied near the system boundary can assist in preparing topological edge states of the parent Hamiltonian, irrespective of the initial state or filling. This effect stems from the matching between the phase distribution encoded in the topological edge states and the target state prepared through bond dissipation. This work provides new insights into the preparation of topological edge states, particularly in the context of Majorana zero modes.</description>

      <title>Quench dynamics of entanglement from crosscap states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04187v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The linear growth of entanglement after a quench from a state with short-range correlations is a universal feature of many body dynamics. It has been shown to occur in integrable and chaotic systems undergoing either Hamiltonian, Floquet or circuit dynamics and has also been observed in experiments. The entanglement dynamics emerging from long-range correlated states is far less studied, although no less viable using modern quantum simulation experiments. In this work, we investigate the dynamics of the bipartite entanglement entropy and mutual information from initial states which have long-range entanglement with correlation between antipodal points of a finite and periodic system. Starting from these crosscap states, we study both brickwork quantum circuits and Hamiltonian dynamics and find distinct patterns of behaviour depending on the type of dynamics and whether the system is integrable or chaotic. Specifically, we study both dual unitary and random unitary quantum circuits as well as free and interacting fermion Hamiltonians. For integrable systems, we find that after a time delay the entanglement experiences a linear in time decrease followed by a series of revivals, while, in contrast, chaotic systems exhibit constant entanglement entropy. On the other hand, both types of systems experience an immediate linear decrease of the mutual information in time. In chaotic systems this then vanishes, whereas integrable systems instead experience a series of revivals. We show how the quasiparticle and membrane pictures of entanglement dynamics can be modified to describe this behaviour, and derive explicitly the quasiparticle picture in the case of free fermion models which we then extend to all integrable systems.</description>

      <title>A minimal tensor network beyond free fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04216v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work proposes a minimal model extending the duality between classical statistical spin systems and fermionic systems beyond the case of free fermions. A Jordan-Wigner transformation applied to a two-dimensional tensor network maps the partition sum of a classical statistical mechanics model to a Grassmann variable integral, structurally similar to the path integral for interacting fermions in two dimensions. The resulting model is simple, featuring only two parameters: one governing spin-spin interaction (dual to effective hopping strength in the fermionic picture), the other measuring the deviation from the free fermion limit. Nevertheless, it exhibits a rich phase diagram, partially stabilized by elements of topology, and featuring three phases meeting at a tricritical point. Besides the interpretation as a spin and fermionic system, the model is closely related to loop gas and vertex models and can be interpreted as a parity-preserving (non-unitary) circuit. Its minimal construction makes it an ideal reference system for studying non-linearities in tensor networks and deriving results by means of duality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04345v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The concept of a particle is ambiguous in quantum field theory. It is generally agreed that particles depend not only on spacetime, but also on coordinates used to parametrise spacetime points. One of us has in contrast proposed a coordinate-frame-independent model of quantum particles within the framework of quantum field theory in curved spacetime. The aim of this article is to present a scalar-field-equation solution that is not only a zero-rank tensor under general coordinate transformations, but also common for anti-de-Sitter, de-Sitter, closed and open Einstein static universes. Moreover, it locally reduces to a Minkowski plane-wave solution and is non-perturbative in curvature. The former property makes it suitable for the standard applications of quantum theory in particle physics, while the latter allows then to gain insights into quantum physics in the strong-gravity regime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04347v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The prospect of developing more efficient classical or quantum photonic devices through the suppression of backscattering is a major driving force for the field of topological photonics. However, genuine protection against backscattering in photonics requires implementing architectures with broken time-reversal which is technically challenging. Here, we make use of a frequency-encoded synthetic dimension scheme in an optical fibre loop platform to experimentally realise a photonic Chern insulator inspired from the Haldane model where time-reversal is explicitly broken through temporal modulation. The bands' topology is assessed by reconstructing the Bloch states' geometry across the Brillouin zone. We further highlight its consequences by measuring a driven-dissipative analogue of the quantized transverse Hall conductivity. Our results thus open the door to harnessing topologically protected unidirectional transport of light in frequency-multiplexed photonic systems.</description>

      <title>Effects of non-integrability in a non-Hermitian time crystal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time crystals are systems that spontaneously break time-translation symmetry, exhibiting repeating patterns in time. Recent work has shown that non-Hermitian Floquet systems can host a time crystalline phase with quasi-long-range order. In this work, we investigate the effect of introducing a non-integrable interaction term into this non-Hermitian time crystal model. Using a combination of numerical TEBD simulations, mean-field analysis, and perturbation theory, we find that the interaction term has two notable effects. First, it induces a shift in the phase diagram, moving the boundaries between different phases. Second, a sufficiently strong interaction induces an unexpected symmetry-breaking transition, which is not captured by the mean-field approach. Within average Hamiltonian theory, we trace this back to a ferromagnetic transition in the anisotropic non-Hermitian XXZ model. Our results demonstrate that the interplay between non-Hermitian dynamics and many-body interactions can lead to novel symmetry breaking.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.04369v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The unavoidable interaction between thermal environments and quantum systems typically leads to the degradation of quantum coherence, which can be fought against by reservoir engineering. We propose the realization of a special mixture of thermal coherent states by coupling a thermal bath with a two-level system that is longitudinally coupled to a resonator. We find that the state of the resonator is a special mixture of two oppositely displaced thermal coherent states, whereas the two-level system remains thermal. This observation is verified by evaluating the second-order correlation coefficient for the resonator state. Moreover, we reveal the potential benefits of employing the mixture of thermal coherent states of the resonator in quantum thermometry. In this context, the resonator functions as a probe to measure the unknown temperature of a bath mediated by a two-level system, strategically bridging the connection between the two. Our results show that the use of an ancillary-assisted probe may enhance the precision and broaden the applicable temperature range.</description>

Abstract: Immersion (i.e., local embedding) is relevant to the physics of topologically ordered phases through entanglement bootstrap. An annulus can immerse in a disk or a sphere as a "figure-8", which cannot be smoothly deformed to an embedded annulus. We investigate a simple problem: is there an Abelian state on the immersed figure-8 annulus, locally indistinguishable from the ground state of the background physical system? We show that if the answer is affirmative, a strong sense of isomorphism must hold: two homeomorphic immersed regions must have isomorphic information convex sets, even if they cannot smoothly deform to each other on the background physical system. We explain why to care about strong isomorphism in physical systems with anyons and give proof in the context of Abelian anyon theory. We further discuss a connection between immersed annuli and anyon transportation in the presence of topological defects. In appendices, we discuss related problems in broader contexts.</description>

Abstract: The parity mapping provides a geometrically local encoding of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), at the expense of having a quadratic qubit overhead for all-to-all connected problems. In this work, we benchmark the parity-encoded QAOA on spin-glass models. We address open questions in the scaling of this algorithm. In particular, we show that for fixed number of parity-encoded QAOA layers, the performance or the output energy, vanishes towards zero (the value achieved by random guessing) with problem size $N$ as $N^{-1/2}$. Our results suggest that the parity-encoded QAOA does not have a promising scaling compared to the standard version of QAOA. We perform tensor-network calculations to confirm our results, and comment on the concentration of optimal QAOA parameters over problem instances.</description>

      <title>Techniques for learning sparse Pauli-Lindblad noise models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.15408v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Error-mitigation techniques such as probabilistic error cancellation and zero-noise extrapolation benefit from accurate noise models. The sparse Pauli-Lindblad noise model is one of the most successful models for those applications. In existing implementations, the model decomposes into a series of simple Pauli channels with one- and two-local terms that follow the qubit topology. While the model has been shown to accurately capture the noise in contemporary superconducting quantum processors for error mitigation, it is important to consider higher-weight terms and effects beyond nearest-neighbor interactions. For such extended models to remain practical, however, we need to ensure that they can be learned efficiently. In this work we present new techniques that accomplish exactly this. We introduce twirling based on Pauli rotations, which enables us to automatically generate single-qubit learning correction sequences and reduce the number of unique fidelities that need to be learned. In addition, we propose a basis-selection strategy that leverages graph coloring and uniform covering arrays to minimize the number of learning bases. Taken together, these techniques ensure that the learning of the extended noise models remains efficient, despite their increased complexity.</description>

Abstract: We present a quantum thermometry method utilizing an optomechanical system composed of an optical field coupled to a mechanical resonator for measuring the unknown temperature of a thermal bath. To achieve this, we connect a thermal bath to the mechanical resonator and perform measurements on the optical field, serving as a probe thermometer. Using the open quantum systems approach, we numerically calculate the quantum Fisher information for the probe. We find that, in specific parameter regimes, the system exhibits clusters of densely packed energy eigenstates interspaced with substantial energy gaps. This clustering of energy levels results in quasi-degeneracy within these energy eigenstate groups and hence widens the operational range of temperature estimation. Moreover, thermal sensitivity, especially at low temperatures, can be further boosted by appropriately tuning the essential system parameters.</description>

Abstract: The ZW-calculus is a graphical language capable of representing 2-dimensional quantum systems (qubit) through its diagrams, and manipulating them through its equational theory. We extend the formalism to accommodate finite dimensional Hilbert spaces beyond qubit systems. First we define a qu$d$it version of the language, where all systems have the same arbitrary finite dimension $d$, and show that the provided equational theory is both complete -- i.e. semantical equivalence is entirely captured by the equations -- and minimal -- i.e. none of the equations are consequences of the others. We then extend the graphical language further to allow for mixed-dimensional systems. We again show the completeness and minimality of the provided equational theory.</description>

      <title>Quantum Circuits for partial differential equations via Schr\"odingerisation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10032v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum computing has emerged as a promising avenue for achieving significant speedup, particularly in large-scale PDE simulations, compared to classical computing. One of the main quantum approaches involves utilizing Hamiltonian simulation, which is directly applicable only to Schr\"odinger-type equations. To address this limitation, Schr\"odingerisation techniques have been developed, employing the warped transformation to convert general linear PDEs into Schr\"odinger-type equations. However, despite the development of Schr\"odingerisation techniques, the explicit implementation of the corresponding quantum circuit for solving general PDEs remains to be designed. In this paper, we present detailed implementation of a quantum algorithm for general PDEs using Schr\"odingerisation techniques. We provide examples of the heat equation, and the advection equation approximated by the upwind scheme, to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Complexity analysis is also carried out to demonstrate the quantum advantages of these algorithms in high dimensions over their classical counterparts.</description>

      <title>Quantum-limited superresolution of two arbitrary incoherent point sources: beating the resurgence of Rayleigh's curse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13752v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Abstract Superresolution has been demonstrated to overcome the limitation of the Rayleigh's criterion and achieve significant improvement of the precision in resolving the separation of two incoherent optical point sources. However, in recent years, it was found that if the photon numbers of the two incoherent optical sources are unknown, the precision of superresolution vanishes when the two photon numbers are actually different. In this work, we first analyze the estimation precision of the separation between two incoherent optical sources with the same point-spread functions in detail, and show that when the photon numbers of the two optical sources are different but sufficiently close, the superresolution can still realized but with different precisions. We find the condition on how close the photon numbers of two optical sources need to be to realize the superresolution, and derive the precision of superresolution in different regimes of the photon number difference. We further consider the superresolution for two incoherent optical sources with different point-spread functions, and show that the competition between the difference of photon numbers, the difference of the two point-spread functions and the separation of the two optical sources determines the precision of superresolution. The results exhibit precision limits distinct from the case of two point sources with identical point-spread functions and equal photon numbers, and extend the realizable regimes of the quantum superresolution technique. The results are finally illustrated by Gaussian point-spread functions.</description>

      <title>Quantum simulation of time-dependent Hamiltonians via commutator-free quasi-Magnus operators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13889v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hamiltonian simulation is arguably the most fundamental application of quantum computers. The Magnus operator is a popular method for time-dependent Hamiltonian simulation in computational mathematics, yet its usage requires the implementation of exponentials of commutators, which has previously made it unappealing for quantum computing. The development of commutator-free quasi-Magnus operators (CFQMs) circumvents this obstacle, at the expense of a lack of provable global numeric error bounds. In this work, we establish one such error bound for CFQM-based time-dependent quantum Hamiltonian simulation by carefully estimating the error of each step involved in their definition. This allows us to compare its cost with the alternatives, and show that CFQMs are often the most efficient product-formula technique available by more than an order of magnitude. As a result, we find that CFQMs may be particularly useful to simulate time-dependent Hamiltonians on early fault-tolerant quantum computers.</description>

Abstract: Neutral atom arrays have emerged as a versatile platform towards scalable quantum computation and optimization. In this paper we present demonstrations of solving maximum weighted independent set problems on a Rydberg atom array using annealing with local light-shifts. We verify the ability to prepare weighted graphs in 1D and 2D arrays, including embedding a five vertex non-unit disk graph using nine physical qubits and demonstration of a simple crossing gadget. We find common annealing ramps leading to preparation of the target ground state robustly over a substantial range of different graph weightings. This work provides a route to exploring large-scale optimization of non-planar weighted graphs relevant for solving relevant real-world problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18529v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the crucial generic techniques for quantum computation is amplitude encoding. Although several approaches have been proposed, each of them often requires exponential classical-computational cost or an oracle whose explicit construction is not provided. Given the growing demands for practical quantum computation, we develop moderately specialized encoding techniques that generate an arbitrary linear combination of localized complex functions. We demonstrate that $n_{\mathrm{loc}}$ discrete Lorentzian functions as an expansion basis set lead to eficient probabilistic encoding, whose computational time is $\mathcal{O}( \max ( n_{\mathrm{loc}}^2 \log n_{\mathrm{loc}},n_{\mathrm{loc}}^2 \log n_q, n_q ))$ for $n_q$ data qubits equipped with $\log_2 n_{\mathrm{loc}}$ ancillae. Furthermore, amplitude amplification in combination with amplitude reduction renders it deterministic analytically with controllable errors and the computational time is reduced to $\mathcal{O}( \max ( n_{\mathrm{loc}}^{3/2} \log n_{\mathrm{loc}}, n_{\mathrm{loc}}^{3/2} \log n_q, n_q )).$ We estimate required resources for applying our scheme to quantum chemistry in real space. We also show the results on real superconducting quantum computers to confirm the validity of our techniques.</description>

      <title>Learning How to Dynamically Decouple</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08689v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current quantum computers suffer from noise that stems from interactions between the quantum system that constitutes the quantum device and its environment. These interactions can be suppressed through dynamical decoupling to reduce computational errors. However, the performance of dynamical decoupling depends on the type of the system-environment interactions that are present, which often lack an accurate model in quantum devices. We show that the performance of dynamical decoupling can be improved by optimizing its rotational gates to tailor them to the quantum hardware. We find that compared to canonical decoupling sequences, such as CPMG, XY4, and UR6, the optimized dynamical decoupling sequences yield the best performance in suppressing noise in superconducting qubits. Our work thus enhances existing error suppression methods which helps increase circuit depth and result quality on noisy hardware.</description>

      <title>Decoupling of External and Internal Dynamics in Driven Two-level Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01511v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show how a laser driven two-level system including quantized external degrees of freedom for each state can be decoupled into a set of oscillator equations acting only on the external degrees of freedom with operator valued damping representing the detuning. We give a way of characterizing the solvability of this family of problems by appealing to a classical oscillator with time-dependent damping. As a consequence of this classification we (a) obtain analytic and representation-free expressions for Rabi oscillations including external degrees of freedom with and without an external linear potential, (b) show that whenever the detuning operator can be diagonalized (analytically or numerically) the problem decomposes into a set of classical equations and (c) we can use the oscillator equations as a perturbative basis to describe Rabi oscillations in weak but otherwise arbitrary external potentials. Moreover, chirping of the driving fields phase emerges naturally as a means of compensating the Ehrenfest/mean-value part of the detuning operator's dynamics while the presence of driving phase noise leads to a stochastic evolution equation of Langevin type. Lastly, our approach is representation free with respect to the external degrees of freedom and as consequence a suitable representation or basis expansion can be chosen a posteriori depending on the desired application at hand.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04754v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a theoretical model and numerical optimization of double Bragg diffraction, a widely used technique in atom interferometry. We derive an effective two-level-system Hamiltonian based on the Magnus expansion in the so-called "quasi-Bragg regime", where most Bragg-pulse atom interferometers operate. Furthermore, we extend the theory to a five-level description to account for Doppler detuning. Using these derived effective Hamiltonians, we investigate the impacts of AC-Stark shift and polarization errors on the double Bragg beam-splitter, along with their mitigations through detuning control. Notably, we design a linear detuning sweep that demonstrates robust efficiency exceeding 99.5% against polarization errors up to 8.5%. Moreover, we develop an artificial intelligence-aided optimal detuning control protocol, showcasing enhanced robustness against both polarization errors and Doppler effects. This protocol achieves an average efficiency of 99.92% for samples with a finite momentum width of 0.05$\hbar k_L$ within an extended polarization error range of up to 10%.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09635v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) have gained significant attention due to their adaptability and efficiency on near-term quantum hardware. They have shown potential in a variety of tasks, including linear algebra, search problems, Gibbs and ground state preparation. Nevertheless, the presence of noise in current day quantum hardware, severely limits their performance. In this work, we introduce dissipative variational quantum algorithms (D-VQAs) by incorporating dissipative operations, such as qubit RESET and stochastic gates, as an intrinsic part of a variational quantum circuit. We argue that such dissipative variational algorithms posses some natural resilience to dissipative noise. We demonstrate how such algorithms can prepare Gibbs states over a wide range of quantum many-body Hamiltonians and temperatures, while significantly reducing errors due to both coherent and non-coherent noise. An additional advantage of our approach is that no ancilla qubits are need. Our results highlight the potential of D-VQAs to enhance the robustness and accuracy of variational quantum computations on NISQ devices.</description>

Abstract: Parrondo's paradox, a counterintuitive phenomenon where two losing strategies combine to produce a winning outcome, has been a subject of interest across various scientific fields, including quantum mechanics. In this study, we investigate the manifestation of Parrondo's paradox in discrete-time quantum walks. We demonstrate the existence of Parrondo's paradox using space and time-dependent coins without the need for a higher-dimensional coin or adding decoherence to the system. Our results enhance the feasibility of practical implementations and provide deeper insights into the underlying quantum dynamics, specifically the propagation constrained by the interference pattern of quantum walks. The implications of our results suggest the potential for more accessible and efficient designs in quantum transport, broadening the scope and application of Parrondo's paradox beyond conventional frameworks.</description>

      <title>Achieving Heisenberg scaling by probe-ancilla interaction in quantum metrology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16880v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Heisenberg scaling is an ultimate precision limit of parameter estimation allowed by the principles of quantum mechanics, with no counterpart in the classical realm, and has been a long-pursued goal in quantum metrology. It has been known that interactions between the probes can help reach the Heisenberg scaling without entanglement. In this paper, we show that interactions between the probes and the additional dimensions of an ancillary system may also increase the precision of parameter estimation to surpass the standard quantum limit and attain the Heisenberg scaling without entanglement, if the measurement scheme is properly designed. The quantum Fisher information exhibits periodic patterns over the evolution time, implying the existence of optimal time points for measurements that can maximize the quantum Fisher information. By implementing optimizations over the Hamiltonian, the initial states of the probes and the ancillary system, the interaction strength, and the time points for measurements, our protocol achieves the Heisenberg scaling for the parameter of the probe Hamiltonian, in terms of both evolution time and probe number. Our protocol features two aspects: (i) the Heisenberg scaling can be achieved by a product state of the probes and (ii) mere local measurement on the ancilla is sufficient, both of which reduce the quantum resources and the implementation complexity to achieve the Heisenberg scaling. The paper is concluded by the investigation of the effects of noise on this protocol.</description>

      <title>Stabilizer bootstrapping: A recipe for efficient agnostic tomography and magic estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06967v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the task of agnostic tomography: given copies of an unknown $n$-qubit state $\rho$ which has fidelity $\tau$ with some state in a given class $C$, find a state which has fidelity $\ge \tau - \epsilon$ with $\rho$. We give a new framework, stabilizer bootstrapping, for designing computationally efficient protocols for this task, and use this to get new agnostic tomography protocols for the following classes:
  Stabilizer states: We give a protocol that runs in time $\mathrm{poly}(n,1/\epsilon)\cdot (1/\tau)^{O(\log(1/\tau))}$, answering an open question posed by Grewal, Iyer, Kretschmer, Liang [43] and Anshu and Arunachalam [6]. Previous protocols ran in time $\mathrm{exp}(\Theta(n))$ or required $\tau&gt;\cos^2(\pi/8)$.
  States with stabilizer dimension $n - t$: We give a protocol that runs in time $n^3\cdot(2^t/\tau)^{O(\log(1/\epsilon))}$, extending recent work on learning quantum states prepared by circuits with few non-Clifford gates, which only applied in the realizable setting where $\tau = 1$ [33, 40, 49, 66].
  Discrete product states: If $C = K^{\otimes n}$ for some $\mu$-separated discrete set $K$ of single-qubit states, we give a protocol that runs in time $(n/\mu)^{O((1 + \log (1/\tau))/\mu)}/\epsilon^2$. This strictly generalizes a prior guarantee which applied to stabilizer product states [42]. For stabilizer product states, we give a further improved protocol that runs in time $(n^2/\epsilon^2)\cdot (1/\tau)^{O(\log(1/\tau))}$.
  As a corollary, we give the first protocol for estimating stabilizer fidelity, a standard measure of magic for quantum states, to error $\epsilon$ in $n^3 \mathrm{quasipoly}(1/\epsilon)$ time.</description>

Abstract: A critical milestone for quantum computers is to demonstrate fault-tolerant computation that outperforms computation on physical qubits. The tesseract subsystem color code protects four logical qubits in 16 physical qubits, to distance four. Using the tesseract code on Quantinuum's trapped-ion quantum computers, we prepare high-fidelity encoded graph states on up to 12 logical qubits, beneficially combining for the first time fault-tolerant error correction and computation. We also protect encoded states through up to five rounds of error correction. Using performant quantum software and hardware together allows moderate-depth logical quantum circuits to have an order of magnitude less error than the equivalent unencoded circuits.</description>

      <title>Dichotomy in the effect of chaos on ergotropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16587v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The maximum unitarily extractable work from a quantum system -- ergotropy -- is a useful and emerging idea in quantum thermodynamics. In this work, ergotropy is studied in quantum chaotic systems to illustrate the effects arising from chaotic dynamics. In an ancilla-assisted scenario, chaos enhances ergotropy when the state is known, a consequence of large entanglement production in the chaotic regime. In contrast, when the state is unknown, chaos impedes work extraction. This downside arises from chaos suppressing information gain about the system from coarse-grained measurements. When both entanglement and coarse-grained measurements are present, there is competition between the two, and ergotropy reaches maximum at an optimal value of the chaos parameter, followed by a decrease. The fall in ergotropy is due to chaos impeding measurements in the chaotic regime. These results are illustrated using two quantum chaotic models; the quantum kicked top and the kicked Ising spin chain.</description>

      <title>Impact of spatial curvature on quantum Otto engines</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21780v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a quantum Otto cycle with a quantum harmonic oscillator on a circle as its working substance. Since the eigen-energies of this oscillator depend on the curvature of the circle, this model, as an analog model, enables us to investigate the curvature effects of the physical space on properties of quantum heat engines. We assume that two classical hot and cold thermal baths are located at places with different curvatures. We calculate the curvature-dependent work and heat in our Otto cycle with a particular emphasis on how curvature affects it's thermal efficiency. By adjusting the curvature difference between the locations of the thermal baths, we demonstrate that the efficiency of our heat engine can reach the Carnot limit.</description>

      <title>Polylog-time- and constant-space-overhead fault-tolerant quantum computation with quantum low-density parity-check codes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03683v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A major challenge in fault-tolerant quantum computation (FTQC) is to reduce both space overhead -- the large number of physical qubits per logical qubit -- and time overhead -- the long physical gate sequences per logical gate. We prove that a protocol using non-vanishing-rate quantum low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes, combined with concatenated Steane codes, achieves constant space overhead and polylogarithmic time overhead, even when accounting for non-zero classical computation time. This protocol offers an improvement over existing constant-space-overhead protocols, which have polynomial time overhead using quantum LDPC codes and quasi-polylogarithmic time overhead using concatenated quantum Hamming codes. To ensure the completeness of this proof, we develop a technique called partial circuit reduction, which enables error analysis for the entire fault-tolerant circuit by examining smaller parts composed of a few gadgets. With this technique, we resolve a previously unaddressed logical gap in the existing arguments and complete the proof of the threshold theorem for the constant-space-overhead protocol with quantum LDPC codes. Our work highlights that the quantum-LDPC-code approach can realize FTQC with a negligibly small slowdown and a bounded overhead of physical qubits, similar to the code-concatenation approach, underscoring the importance of a comprehensive comparison of the future realizability of these two approaches.</description>

      <title>Reuse-Aware Compilation for Zoned Quantum Architectures Based on Neutral Atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11784v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum computing architectures based on neutral atoms offer large scales and high-fidelity operations. They can be heterogeneous, with different zones for storage, entangling operations, and readout. Zoned architectures improve computation fidelity by shielding idling qubits in storage from side-effect noise, unlike monolithic architectures where all operations occur in a single zone. However, supporting these flexible architectures with efficient compilation remains challenging. In this paper, we propose ZAC, a scalable compiler for zoned architectures. ZAC minimizes data movement overhead between zones with qubit reuse, i.e., keeping them in the entanglement zone if an immediate entangling operation is pending. Other innovations include novel data placement and instruction scheduling strategies in ZAC, a flexible specification of zoned architectures, and an intermediate representation for zoned architectures, ZAIR. Our evaluation shows that zoned architectures equipped with ZAC achieve a 22x improvement in fidelity compared to monolithic architectures. Moreover, ZAC is shown to have a 10% fidelity gap on average compared to the ideal solution. This significant performance enhancement enables more efficient and reliable quantum circuit execution, enabling advancements in quantum algorithms and applications.

      <title>Tower of Structured Excited States from Measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17020v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Preparing highly entangled quantum states is a key challenge in quantum metrology and quantum information science. Measurements, especially those of global observables, offer a simple and efficient way to generate entanglement between subsystems when they are measured as a whole. We introduce a log-depth protocol leveraging quantum phase estimation to measure a global observable, such as total magnetization and momentum. We demonstrate its capability to prepare towers of structured excited states that are useful in quantum metrology; examples include quantum many-body scars in various models, including the Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki (AKLT) model, the constrained domain-wall model, and the spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ and spin-$1$ XX chains. The same method is also applicable to preparing the Dicke states of high weight. In addition, we propose a protocol for momentum measurement that avoids disturbing the system, facilitating the preparation of states beyond the above construction, such as the Arovas $A$ state of the AKLT Hamiltonian. Our results expand the utility of measurement-based approaches to accessing highly entangled states in quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Simulating Vibrational Dynamics on Bosonic Quantum Devices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17950v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bosonic quantum devices, which utilize harmonic oscillator modes to encode information, are emerging as a promising alternative to conventional qubit-based quantum devices, especially for the simulation of vibrational dynamics and spectroscopy. We present a framework for digital quantum simulation of vibrational dynamics under anharmonic potentials on these bosonic devices. In our approach the vibrational Hamiltonian is decomposed into solvable fragments that can be used for Hamiltonian simulation on currently available bosonic hardware. Specifically, we extended the Cartan subalgebra approach [T.C. Yen, A.F. Izmaylov, PRX Quantum 2, 040320 (2021)] -- a method for decomposing quantum Hamiltonians into solvable parts -- to bosonic operators, enabling us to construct anharmonic Hamiltonian fragments that can be efficiently diagonalized using Bogoliubov transforms. The approach is tested using a simulation of tunneling dynamics in a model two-dimensional double-well potential and calculations of vibrational eigenenergies for small molecules. Our fragmentation scheme provides a new approach for digital quantum simulations on bosonic quantum hardware for multi-mode anharmonic vibrational dynamics.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Quantum Mpemba Effect in Markovian Systems and Quantum Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18417v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quantum Mpemba effect (QME) describes the counterintuitive phenomenon in which a system farther from equilibrium reaches steady state faster than one closer to equilibrium. However, ambiguity in defining a suitable distance measure between quantum states has led to varied interpretations across different contexts. Here we propose the intrinsic quantum Mpemba effect (IQME), defined using the trajectory length traced by the quantum state as a more appropriate measure of distance--distinct from previous trajectory-independent metrics. By treating quantum states as points in a Riemannian space defined by statistical distance, the trajectory length emerges as a more natural and accurate characterization of the counterintuitive dynamics, drawing an analogy to the classical Brachistochrone problem. We demonstrate the existence of IQME in Markovian systems and extend its definition to quantum circuits, thereby establishing a unified framework applicable to both open and closed systems. Notably, we observe an IQME in a $U(1)$-symmetric circuit, offering new insights into the rates of quantum thermalization for different initial states. This work deepens our understanding of quantum state evolution and lays the foundation for accurately capturing novel quantum dynamical behaviour.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19777v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While experimental measurements of photon correlations have become routine in laboratories, theoretical access to these quantities for the light generated in complex nanophotonic devices remains a major challenge. Current methods are limited to specific simplified cases and lack generality. Here we present a novel method that provides access to photon statistics resolved in space and frequency in arbitrary electromagnetic environments. Within the macroscopic QED framework, we develop a practical tool to compute electric field correlations for complex quantum systems by including lossy two-level systems that act as field detectors within the system. To make the implementation feasible, we use a recently developed multi-emitter few-mode quantization method to correctly account for fully retarded light propagation to the detectors. We demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed technique by studying the photon correlations of one and two emitters in close proximity to a plasmonic nanoparticle. The simulations show that even in these relatively simple configurations, the light statistics exhibit a strong angular dependence. These results highlight the importance of going beyond conventional quantum-optical approaches to fully capture the analyzed physical effects and enable the study of the quantum light generation in realistic nanophotonic devices.</description>

Abstract: Optimizing the frequency configuration of qubits and quantum gates in superconducting quantum chips presents a complex NP-complete optimization challenge. This process is critical for enabling practical control while minimizing decoherence and suppressing significant crosstalk. In this paper, we propose a neural network-based frequency configuration approach. A trained neural network model estimates frequency configuration errors, and an intermediate optimization strategy identifies optimal configurations within localized regions of the chip. The effectiveness of our method is validated through randomized benchmarking and cross-entropy benchmarking. Furthermore, we design a crosstalk-aware hardware-efficient ansatz for variational quantum eigensolvers, achieving improved energy computations.</description>

Abstract: The diversity of quantum communication protocols and their rapid growth entail the development of the Quantum Internet, the interconnection of various quantum communication nodes and systems. One of the challenges posed by this development is all-quantum mode adaptation, which is essential for adapting different quantum nodes to the common network, enhancing the efficiency and scalability of quantum information transmission. This paper investigates the mathematical frameworks of all-quantum mode adaptation, focusing on three essential elements-mode expansion, mode reduction, and mode mapping-which are crucial for managing compatibility among different quantum signals. By leveraging various degrees of freedom of photons, we demonstrate the possibility of adaptable all-quantum processors that can dynamically adjust to different communication environments, addressing real-world challenges in the Quantum Internet.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02040v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum systems composed of solid-state electronic spins can be sensitive detectors of narrowband magnetic fields. A prominent example is the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond, which has been employed for magnetic spectroscopy with high spatial and spectral resolution. However, NV-diamond spectroscopy protocols are typically based on dynamical decoupling sequences, which are limited to low-frequency signals ($\lesssim{20}\,$MHz) due to the technical requirements on microwave (MW) pulses used to manipulate NV electronic spins. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate a high-resolution magnetic spectroscopy protocol that integrates a quantum frequency mixing (QFM) effect in a dense NV ensemble with coherently averaged synchronized readout (CASR) to provide both a wide range of signal frequency detection and sub-Hz spectral resolution. We assess the sensitivity of this QFM-CASR protocol across a frequency range of 10$\,$MHz to 4$\,$GHz. By measuring the spectra of multi-frequency signals near 0.6, 2.4 and 4$\,$GHz, we demonstrate sub-Hz spectral resolution with a nT-scale noise floor for the target signal, and precise phase measurement with error $&lt;1^\circ$. Compared to state-of-the-art NV-diamond techniques for narrowband magnetic spectroscopy, the QFM-CASR protocol greatly extends the detectable frequency range, enabling applications in high-frequency radio frequency (RF) and MW signal microscopy and analysis, as well as tesla-scale nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy of small samples.</description>

We extend this procedure to the Morse oscillator by constructing a new set of GCS of Glauber type.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.07060v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate an open fermionic string theory in a non-commutative target phase space as well as for the space part and the momentum part. The modified commutation relations in terms of oscillating modes are derived. Modified super-Virasoro algebras are obtained in the Ramond and Neuveu-Schwarz sectors where new anomaly terms appears. The non-commutativity affect the Lorentz covariance and the mass operator is no more diagonal in the usual Fock space. A redefinition of the Fock space is proposed to diagonalize the non-commutativity parameters matrices to obtain a diagonalized mass operator. Some restrictions on the non commutativity parameters are imposed to eliminate the Virasoro algerbra anomaly terms due to the non-commutativity, where at the same time the usual mass spectrum is obtained. The GSO projection is now possible where a space time supersymmetry is obtained. More restrictions on the non-commutativity parameters zero modes are imposed and the Lorentz covariance is restored.</description>

Abstract: The non-Hermitian skin effect is a phenomenon in which an extensive number of states accumulates at the boundaries of a system. It has been associated to nontrivial topology, with nonzero bulk invariants predicting its appearance and its position in real space. Here, we demonstrate that the non-Hermitian skin effect has weaker bulk-edge correspondence than topological insulators: when translation symmetry is broken by a single non-Hermitian impurity, skin modes are depleted at the boundary and accumulate at the impurity site, without changing any bulk invariant. Similarly, a single non-Hermitian impurity may deplete the states from a region of Hermitian bulk.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.14634v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This book concerns the metasemantics of quantum mechanics (QM). Roughly, it pursues an investigation at the intersection of philosophy of physics and philosophy of language, and it offers a critical analysis of rival explanations of the semantic facts of standard QM. Two problems for such explanations are discussed: categoricity and permanence. New results include 1) a reconstruction of Einstein's incompleteness argument, which concludes that a local, separable, and categorical QM cannot exist, 2) a reinterpretation of Bohr's principle of correspondence, grounded in the principle of permanence, 3) a meaning-variance argument for quantum logic, which follows a line of critical reflections initiated by Weyl, and 4) an argument for semantic indeterminacy leveled against inferentialism about QM, inspired by Carnap's work in the philosophy of classical logic.</description>

Abstract: Anomaly analysis has been an important and powerful tool in studying nonperturbative physics for decades. The anomaly inflow mechanism provides an intuitive interpretation of the bulk-boundary correspondence in topological systems. In this work, we study global anomalies in systems with symmetry-preserving Luttinger surfaces, i.e. the manifolds of fermionic Green's function zeros in the momentum space at zero energy, described by nonlocal effective theories. We view the nonlocal effective theories as a result of integrating out some low energy states. Assuming that the states integrated out do not make extra contributions to the anomalies, we discuss the simplest Lagrangian describing a gapless Dirac zero and a two-pole variant, their global anomalies, and the bulk-boundary correspondence. We then consider the constraints on possible phases with Green's function zeros of Dirac type, such as non-Fermi liquids and emergent gapless quasiparticles on Luttinger surfaces. We also provide some perspectives on why the nonlocal fermionic effective theory discussed by Golterman and Shamir (arXiv: 2311.12790) is not a suitable starting point for a symmetrically gapped phase.</description>

      <title>Quasiperiodicity protects quantized transport in disordered systems without gaps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07049v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The robustness of topological properties, such as quantized currents, generally depends on the existence of gaps surrounding the relevant energy levels or on symmetry-forbidden transitions. Here, we observe quantized currents that survive the addition of bounded local disorder beyond the closing of the relevant instantaneous energy gaps in a driven Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper chain, a prototypical model of quasiperiodic systems. We explain the robustness using a local picture in \textit{configuration-space} based on Landau-Zener transitions, which rests on the Anderson localisation of the eigenstates. Moreover, we propose a protocol, directly realizable in for instance cold atoms or photonic experiments, which leverages this stability to prepare topological many-body states with high Chern numbers and opens new experimental avenues for the study of both the integer and fractional quantum Hall effects.</description>

      <title>Quantum-dot-based Kitaev chains: Majorana quality measures and scaling with increasing chain length</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09211v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Realizing Majorana bound states (MBSs) in short, well-controllable chains of coupled quantum dots sidesteps the problem of disorder, but requires fine-tuning and does not give the true topological protection inherent to long chains. Here, we introduce a new quality measure that is applicable also in the presence of strong electron-electron interactions and that quantifies the closeness to topological protection of finetuned MBSs in short quantum-dot chains. We call this measure local distinguishability because it puts a bound to the degree an arbitrary local measurement can distinguish between two states. We study the local distinguishability for quantum-dot chains of different length. The three-dot chain is studied in detail, and we find that it may not always be an improvement over the two-dot case, a fact that can be understood within an effective model derived from perturbation theory. For longer chains, the local distinguishability vanishes exponentially, signalling a transition to a topological phase with two ground states that cannot be distinguished by any local measurement.</description>

      <title>Interacting Dirac fields in an expanding universe: dynamical condensates and particle production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06405v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The phenomenon of particle production for quantum field theories in curved spacetimes is crucial to understand the large-scale structure of a universe from an inflationary epoch. In contrast to the free and fixed-background case, the production of particles with strong interactions and back reaction is not completely understood, especially in situations that require going beyond perturbation theory. In this work, we present advances in this direction by focusing on a self-interacting field theory of Dirac fermions in an expanding Friedmann-Robertson-Walker universe. By using a Hamiltonian lattice regularization with continuous conformal time and rescaled fields, this model becomes amenable to either a cold-atom analogue-gravity quantum simulation, or a dynamical variational approach. Leveraging a family of variational fermionic Gaussian states, we investigate how dynamical mass generation and the formation of fermion condensates associated to certain broken symmetries modify some well-known results of the free field theory. In particular, we study how the non-perturbative condensates arise and, more importantly, how their real-time evolution has an impact on particle production. Depending on the Hubble expansion rate, we find an interesting interplay of interactions and particle production, including a non-trivial back reaction on the condensates and a parity-breaking spectrum of produced particles.</description>

      <title>Third quantization with Hartree approximation for open-system bosonic transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13174v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The third quantization (3rd Q) for bosons provides the exact steady-state solution of the Lindblad equation with quadratic Hamiltonians. By decomposing the interaction of the Bose Hubbard model (BHM) according to Hartree approximation, we present a self-consistent formalism for solving the open-system bosonic Lindblad equation with weak interactions in the steady state. The 3rd Q with Hartree approximation takes into account the infinite Fock space of bosons while its demand of resource scales polynomially with the system size. We examine the method by analyzing three examples of the BHM, including the uniform chain, interaction induced diode effect, and Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) Hubbard model. When compared with the simulations with capped boson numbers for small systems, the 3rd Q with Hartree approximation captures the qualitative behavior and suggests an upper bound of the steady-state value. Finite-size scaling confirms the results from the 3rd Q with Hartree approximation converge towards the thermodynamic limit. Thus, the manageable method allows us to characterize and predict large-system behavior of quantum transport in interacting bosonic systems relevant to cold-atom experiments.</description>

      <title>Noninvertible Symmetry-Resolved Affleck-Ludwig-Cardy Formula and Entanglement Entropy from the Boundary Tube Algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02806v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive a refined version of the Affleck-Ludwig-Cardy formula for a 1+1d conformal field theory, which controls the asymptotic density of high energy states on an interval transforming under a given representation of a noninvertible global symmetry. We use this to determine the universal leading and sub-leading contributions to the noninvertible symmetry-resolved entanglement entropy of a single interval. As a concrete example, we show that the ground state entanglement Hamiltonian for a single interval in the critical double Ising model enjoys a Kac-Paljutkin $H_8$ Hopf algebra symmetry when the boundary conditions at the entanglement cuts are chosen to preserve the product of two Kramers-Wannier symmetries, and we present the corresponding symmetry-resolved entanglement entropies. Our analysis utilizes recent developments in symmetry topological field theories (SymTFTs).</description>

      <title>Distribution Function for $n \ge g$ Quantum Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09877v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A new quantum mechanical distribution function $n^I(\varepsilon)$, is derived for the condition $n \ge g$, where in contrast to the exclusion principle $n \le g$ for fermions, each energy state must be populated by at least one particle. Although the particles share many features with bosons, the anomalous behavior of $n^I(\varepsilon)$ precludes Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) due to the required occupancy of the excited states, which creates a permanently pressurized background at $T=0$, similar to the degeneracy pressure of fermions. An exhaustive classification scheme is presented for both distinguishable and indistinguishable, particles and energy levels based on Richard Stanley's twelvefold way in combinatorics.</description>
