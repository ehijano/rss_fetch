      <title>Short wavelength limit of the dynamic Matsubara local field correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the short wavelength limit of the dynamic Matsubara local field correction $\widetilde{G}(\mathbf{q},z_l)$ of the uniform electron gas based on direct \emph{ab initio} path integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) results over an unprecedented range of wavenumbers, $q\lesssim20q_\textnormal{F}$, where $q_\textnormal{F}$ is the Fermi wavenumber. We find excellent agreement with the analytically derived asymptotic limit by Hou \emph{et al.}~[\textit{Phys.~Rev.~B}~\textbf{106}, L081126 (2022)] for the static local field correction and empirically confirm the independence of the short wavelength limit with respect to the Matsubara frequency $z_l$. In the warm dense matter regime, we find that the onset of the quantum tail in the static local field correction closely coincides with the onset of the algebraic tail in the momentum distribution function and the corresponding empirical criterion reported by Hunger \emph{et al.}~[\textit{Phys.~Rev.~E} \textbf{103}, 053204 (2021)]. In the strongly coupled electron liquid regime, our calculations reveal a more complicated non-monotonic convergence towards the $q\to\infty$ limit that is shaped by the spatial structure in the system. We expect our results to be of broad interest for a number of fields including the study of matter under extreme conditions, the development of improved dielectric theories, and the construction of advanced exchange--correlation functionals for thermal density functional theory.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Witness for Indistinguishable Electrons using Solid-State Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Characterizing entanglement in quantum materials is crucial for advancing next-generation quantum technologies. Despite recent strides in witnessing entanglement in magnetic materials with distinguishable spin modes, quantifying entanglement in systems formed by indistinguishable electrons remains a formidable challenge. To solve this problem, we introduce a method to extract various four-fermion correlations by analyzing the nonlinearity in resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) spectra. These correlations constitute the primary components of the cumulant two-particle reduced density matrix (RDM). We further derive bounds for its eigenvalues and demonstrate the linear scaling with fermionic entanglement depth, providing a reliable witness for entanglement. Using the material-relevant strongly correlated models as examples, we show how this this entanglement witness can efficiently quantify multipartite entanglement across different phase regions, highlighting its advantage over quantum Fisher information (QFI).</description>

      <title>Easy-axis Heisenberg model on the triangular lattice: from supersolid to gapped solid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the easy-axis Heisenberg model on the triangular lattice by numerically studying the ground-state dynamical spin structure factor $S^{\mu\mu}({\bf q},\omega)$ on lattices up to $N=36$ sites. Results are analyzed within the supersolid scenario, characterized by the translation-symmetry-breaking parameter $m_z$ and the rotational supersolid order parameter $m_\perp$. We find very robust $m_z &gt; 0$ in the whole easy-axis anisotropy regime $\alpha = J_\perp/J_z &gt; 0$, even enhanced by the magnetic field $h&gt;0$. Results support also $m_\perp &gt;0$ for intermediate $\alpha &lt;1$ as well as for $h&gt;0$. Still, at small $\alpha \ll 1$, relevant for recent experiments on the magnetic material K$_2$Co(SeO$_3$)$_2$, we find at $h=0$ rather vanishing $m_\perp \sim 0$, reflecting the gapped spin excitations.</description>

      <title>Ergotropy, bound energy and entanglement in 1D long range Kitaev model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, a linear relationship between product of bound energy, a thermodynamic quantity, of a ground state with system size and square of half-chain entanglement entropy has been established for free fermionic chain with nearest neighbor hopping and conjectured to be true for all 1D conformal field theories [Phys. Rev. B, 107,075116(20230]. We probe this relationship in domain where conformal symmetry is broken using 1D Kitaev model with pairing term which decays with distance as a power-law with exponent $\alpha$. We analytically show that for $\alpha=1$, this relationship persists with same slope as found in $\alpha \to \infty$ case where conformal symmetry is unbroken. We recall that conformal symmetry is broken for $\alpha&lt;3/2$ [Phys. Rev. Lett., 113,156402(2014)]. We numerically show that linearity persists for intermediate values of $\alpha$. The presence of long range pairing helps in extracting more energy for the work i.e. ergotropy. We show analytically that ergotropy increases logarithmically with system size for $\alpha=1$ and becomes proportional to system size for $\alpha=0$ (numerically).</description>

      <title>Fractional quantum anomalous Hall effect in rhombohedral multilayer graphene with a strong displacement field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the fractional quantum anomalous Hall (FQAH) effect in rhombohedral multilayer graphene (RnG) in the presence of a strong applied displacement field. We first introduce the interacting model of RnG, which includes the noninteracting continuum model and the many-body Coulomb interaction. We then discuss the integer quantum anomalous Hall (IQAH) effect in RnG and the role of the Hartree-Fock approach in understanding its appearance. Next, we explore the FQAH effect in RnG for $n=3$--$6$ using a combination of constrained Hartree-Fock and exact diagonalization methods. We characterize the stability of the FQAH phase by the size of the FQAH gap and find that RnG generally has a stable FQAH phase, although the required displacement field varies significantly among different $n$ values. Our work establishes the theoretical universality of both IQAH and FQAH in RnG.</description>

      <title>Learning symmetry-protected topological order from trapped-ion experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classical machine learning has proven remarkably useful in post-processing quantum data, yet typical learning algorithms often require prior training to be effective. In this work, we employ a tensorial kernel support vector machine (TK-SVM) to analyze experimental data produced by trapped-ion quantum computers. This unsupervised method benefits from directly interpretable training parameters, allowing it to identify the non-trivial string-order characterizing symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases. We apply our technique to two examples: a spin-1/2 model and a spin-1 model, featuring the cluster state and the AKLT state as paradigmatic instances of SPT order, respectively. Using matrix product states, we generate a family of quantum circuits that host a trivial phase and an SPT phase, with a sharp phase transition between them. For the spin-1 case, we implement these circuits on two distinct trapped-ion machines based on qubits and qutrits. Our results demonstrate that the TK-SVM method successfully distinguishes the two phases across all noisy experimental datasets, highlighting its robustness and effectiveness in quantum data interpretation.</description>

      <title>New Field Theories with Foliation Structure and Subdimensional Particles from Godbillon-Vey Invariant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05048v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, subdimensional particles including fractons have attracted much attention from various areas. Notable features of such matter phases are mobility constraints and subextensive ground state degeneracies (GSDs). In this paper, we propose a BF-like theory motivated by the Godbillon-Vey invariant, which is a mathematical invariant of the foliated manifold. Our theory hosts subsystem higher form symmetries which manifestly ensure the mobility constraint and subextensive GSD through the spontaneous symmetry breaking. We also discuss some lattice spin models which realize the same low energy behaviours as the BF-like theory. Furthermore, we explore dynamical matter theories which are coupled to the BF-like theory.</description>

      <title>Generation of Ultrafast Magnetic Steps for Coherent Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05153v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A long-standing challenge in ultrafast magnetism and in functional materials research in general, has been the generation of a universal, ultrafast stimulus able to switch between stable magnetic states. Solving it would open up many new opportunities for fundamental studies, with potential impact on future data storage technologies. Ideally, step-like magnetic field transients with infinitely fast rise time would serve this purpose. Here, we develop a new approach to generate ultrafast magnetic field steps, based on an ultrafast quench of supercurrents in a superconductor. Magnetic field steps with millitesla amplitude, picosecond risetimes and slew rates approaching 1 GT/s are achieved. We test the potential of this technique by coherently rotating the magnetization in a ferrimagnet. With suitable improvements in the geometry of the device, these magnetic steps can be made both larger and faster, leading to new applications that range from quenches across phase transitions to complete switching of magnetic order parameters.</description>

      <title>Holographic thermal correlators and quasinormal modes from semiclassical Virasoro blocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by its relevance for thermal correlators in strongly coupled holographic CFTs, we refine and further develop a recent exact analytic approach to black hole perturbation problem, based on the semiclassical Virasoro blocks, or equivalently via AGT relation, the Nekrasov partition functions in the Nekrasov-Shatashvili limit. Focusing on asymptotically $\text{AdS}_5$ black hole backgrounds, we derive new universal exact expressions for holographic thermal two-point functions, both for scalar operators and conserved currents. Relatedly, we also obtain exact quantization conditions of the associated quasinormal modes (QNMs). Our expressions for the holographic $\text{CFT}_4$ closely resemble the well-known results for 2d thermal CFTs on $\mathbb{R}^{1,1}$. This structural similarity stems from the locality of fusion transformation for Virasoro blocks. We provide numerical checks of our quantization conditions for QNMs. Additionally, we discuss the application of our results to understand specific physical properties of QNMs, including their near-extremal and asymptotic limits. The latter is related to a certain large-momentum regime of semiclassical Virasoro blocks dual to Seiberg-Witten prepotentials.</description>

      <title>Engineering many-body quantum Hamiltonians with non-ergodic properties using quantum Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.08587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2106.08587v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a computational framework to identify Hamiltonians of interacting quantum many-body systems that host non-ergodic excited states. We combine quantum Monte Carlo simulations with the recently proposed eigenstate-to-Hamiltonian construction, which maps the ground state of a specified parent Hamiltonian to a single non-ergodic excited state of a new derived Hamiltonian. This engineered Hamiltonian contains non-trivial, systematically-obtained, and emergent features that are responsible for its non-ergodic properties. We demonstrate this approach by applying it to quantum many-body scar states where we discover a previously unreported family of Hamiltonians with spatially oscillating spin exchange couplings that host scar-like properties, including revivals in the quantum dynamics, and towers in the inverse participation ratio; and to many-body localization, where we find a two-dimensional Hamiltonian with correlated disorder that exhibits non-ergodic scaling of the participation entropy and inverse participation ratios of order unity. The method can be applied to other known ground states to discover new quantum many-body systems with non-ergodic excited states.</description>

      <title>Strong Pairing Originated from an Emergent $\mathbb{Z}_2$ Berry Phase in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.05726v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ offers a fresh platform for exploring unconventional pairing mechanisms. Starting with the basic argument that the electrons in $d_{z^2}$ orbitals nearly form local moments, we examine the effect of the Hubbard interaction $U$ on the binding strength of Cooper pairs based on a single-orbital bilayer model with intralayer hopping $t_{\|}$ and interlayer super-exchange $J_{\perp}$. By extensive density matrix renormalization group calculations, we observe a remarkable enhancement in binding energy as much as $10$-$20$ times larger with $U/t_\|$ increasing from $0$ to $12$ at $J_{\perp}/t_\|\sim 1$. We demonstrate that such a substantial enhancement stems from a kinetic-energy-driven mechanism. Specifically, a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ Berry phase will emerge at large $U$ due to the Hilbert space restriction (Mottness), which strongly suppresses the mobility of single particle propagation as compared to $U=0$. However, the kinetic energy of the electrons (holes) can be greatly restored by forming an interlayer spin-singlet pairing, which naturally results in a superconducting state even for relatively small $J_\perp$. An effective hard-core bosonic model is further proposed to estimate the superconducting transition temperature at the mean-field level.</description>

      <title>Fractional quantum anomalous Hall effects in rhombohedral multilayer graphene in the moir\'eless limit and in Coulomb imprinted superlattice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.04217v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The standard theoretical framework for fractional quantum anomalous Hall effect (FQAH) assumes an isolated flat Chern band in the single particle level. In this paper we challenges this paradigm for the FQAH recently observed in the pentalayer rhombohedral stacked graphene aligned with hexagon boron nitride (hBN). We show that the external moir\'e superlattice potential is simply a perturbation in a model with continuous translation symmetry. Through Hartree Fock calculation, we find that interaction opens a sizable remote band gap, resulting an isolated narrow $C=1$ Chern band at filling $\nu=1$. From exact diagonalization (ED) we identify FQAH phases at various fillings. But they exist also in the calculations without any external moir\'e potential. We suggest that the QAH insulator at $\nu=1$ should be viewed as an interaction driven topological Wigner crystal with QAH effect, which is then pinned by a small moir\'e potential. The $C=1$ QAH crystal is robust with a crystal period around $10\mathrm{nm}$ in 4-layer, 5-layer, 6-layer and 7-layer graphene systems. Our work suggests a new direction to exploring the interplay of topology and FQAH with spontaneous crystal formation in the vanishing moir\'e potential limit. We also propose a new system to generate and control both honeycomb and triangular moir\'e superlattice potential through Coulomb interaction from another control layer, which can stabilize or suppress the QAH crystal depending on the density of the control layer.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Properties of Gauge Theories from Higher-Form Symmetries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.16235v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the relationship between higher-form symmetries and entanglement properties in discrete lattice gauge theories, which can exhibit both topologically ordered phases and higher-form symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases. Our study centers on generalizing the Fradkin-Shenker model, where the Gauss law constraint can be either emergent or exact. The phase diagram includes a topologically ordered phase and a non-trivial SPT phase protected by a 1-form and a 0-form symmetry. We obtain the following key findings: First, the entanglement properties depend on whether the 1-form symmetries and the Gauss law are exact or emergent. For the emergent Gauss law, the entanglement spectrum (ES) of the non-trivial SPT phase exhibits degeneracies, which are robust at low energies against weak perturbations that explicitly break the exact 1-form symmetry. When the Gauss law and the 1-form symmetry are both exact, the ES degeneracy is extensive. This extensive degeneracy is fragile and can be removed completely by infinitesimal perturbations that explicitly break the exact 1-form symmetry while keeping the Gauss law exact. Second, we consider the ES in the topologically ordered phase where 1-form symmetries are spontaneously broken. In contrast to the ES of the non-trivial SPT phase, we find that spontaneous higher-form symmetry breaking removes "half" of the ES levels, leading to a non-degenerate ES in the topologically ordered phase in general. Third, we derive a connection between spontaneous higher-form symmetry breaking and the topological entanglement entropy (TEE). Using this relation, we investigate the entanglement entropy that can be distilled in the deconfined phase of the original Fradkin-Shenker model using gauge-invariant measurements. We show that the TEE is robust against the measurement when the 1-form symmetry is emergent but fragile when the 1-form symmetry is exact.</description>

Abstract: Describing the real-time evolution of many-electron quantum systems is crucial for understanding the dynamical properties of condensed matter, molecular systems in quantum chemistry, and the behaviors of complex materials. However, the real-time evolution of non-equilibrium quantum electronic systems poses a significant challenge for theoretical and computational approaches. This work introduces a variational approach for fermionic time-dependent wave functions, surpassing mean-field approximations by capturing many-body correlations. Our methodology introduces a parameterization of the time-evolving quantum state, enabling an accurate approximation of its evolution. To account for electron correlations, we employ time-dependent Jastrow factors and backflow transformations, which can be further enhanced by incorporating neural networks for function parameterization. We utilize the time-dependent variational Monte Carlo technique to efficiently compute optimal time-dependent parameters. Additionally, we introduce a new time-evolution method based on Trotter-root expansions of the propagator, enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of our simulations. The approach is demonstrated in three distinct systems: the solvable harmonic interaction model, the dynamics of a diatomic molecule in intense laser fields, and a quenched quantum dot. In all cases, we show clear signatures of many-body correlations in the dynamics that are not captured by mean-field methods. The results showcase the ability of our variational approach to accurately capture the time evolution of quantum states, providing insight into the quantum dynamics of interacting electronic systems, beyond the capabilities of mean-field.</description>

Abstract: We study the effects of photoirradiation with circularly polarized light on the Dirac half-metal state induced by the ferrimagnetic order in a triangular Kondo-lattice model. Our analysis based on the Floquet theory reveals that two types of Floquet Chern insulator phases appear as photoinduced nonequilibrium steady states and that these two phases can be experimentally detected and distinguished by measurements of the Hall conductivity. It is elucidated that these rich nonequilibrium topological phases come from higher-order terms in the high-frequency expansion called Brillouin-Wigner expansion, which is in striking contrast to usually discussed Floquet Chern insulator phases originating from the lowest-order terms of the expansion. So far, the lattice electron models on simple non-multipartite lattices such as triangular lattices and square lattices have not been regarded as targets of the Floquet engineering because the lowest-order terms of the high-frequency expansion for Floquet effective Hamiltonians cancel each other to vanish in these systems. Our findings of the Floquet Chern insulator phases in a triangular Kondo-lattice model are expected to expand the range of potential models and even materials targeted by the Floquet engineering.</description>

      <title>Representation Theory for Massless Quasiparticles in Bogoliubov-de Gennes Systems</title>

Abstract: Gapless quasiparticles can exist in the Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) Hamiltonians in the mean field description of superconductors (SCs), fermionic superfluids (SFs) and quantum spin liquids (QSLs). The mechanism of gapless quasiparticles in superconductors was studied in literature based on the homotopy theory or symmetry-indicators. However, important properties of the gapless quasiparticles including the degeneracy, the energy-momentum dispersion and the responses to external probe fields need to be determined. In the present work, we investigate gapless quasiparticles in general BdG systems by using projective representation theory for the full `symmetry' groups formed by combinations of lattice, spin and charge operations. We find that (I) charge conjugation (or effective charge conjugation) symmetry can yield gapless quasiparticles with linear, quadratic or higher order dispersions at high symmetry points of the Brillouin zone; (II) different quantum numbers protected level crossing can give rise to zero modes along high symmetry lines; (III) combined spatial inversion and time reversal symmetry can protect zero modes appearing at generic $k$ points. To obtain the low energy properties of gapless quasiparticles, the $k\cdot p$ theory is provided using a high efficient method--the Hamiltonian approach. Based on generalized band representation theory for BdG systems, several lattice models are constructed to illustrate the above results. Our theory provides a method to classify nodal SCs/SFs/QSLs with given symmetries, and enlightens the realization of Majorana type massless quasiparticles in condensed matter physics.</description>

      <title>Learning eigenstates of quantum many-body Hamiltonians within the symmetric subspaces using neural network quantum states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20065</link>

Abstract: The exploration of neural network quantum states has become widespread in the studies of complicated quantum many-body systems. However, achieving high precision remains challenging due to the exponential growth of Hilbert space size and the intricate sign structures. Utilizing symmetries of the physical system, we propose a method to evaluate and sample the variational ansatz within a symmetric subspace. This approach isolates different symmetry sectors, reducing the relevant Hilbert space size by a factor approximately proportional to the size of the symmetry group. It is inspired by exact diagonalization techniques and the work of Choo et al. in Phys. Rev. Lett. 121, 167204 (2018). We validate our method using the frustrated spin-1/2 $J_1$-$J_2$ antiferromagnetic Heisenberg chain and compare its performance to the case without symmetrization. The results indicate that our symmetric subspace approach achieves a substantial improvement over the full Hilbert space on optimizing the ansatz, reducing the energy error by orders of magnitude. We also compare the results on degenerate eigenstates with different quantum numbers, highlighting the advantage of operating within a smaller Hilbert subspace.</description>

      <title>Approximate Quantum Codes From Long Wormholes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.07770v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss families of approximate quantum error correcting codes which arise as the nearly-degenerate ground states of certain quantum many-body Hamiltonians composed of non-commuting terms. For exact codes, the conditions for error correction can be formulated in terms of the vanishing of a two-sided mutual information in a low-temperature thermofield double state. We consider a notion of distance for approximate codes obtained by demanding that this mutual information instead be small, and we evaluate this mutual information for the SYK model and for a family of low-rank SYK models. After an extrapolation to nearly zero temperature, we find that both kinds of models produce fermionic codes with constant rate as the number, $N$, of fermions goes to infinity. For SYK, the distance scales as $N^{1/2}$, and for low-rank SYK, the distance can be arbitrarily close to linear scaling, e.g. $N^{.99}$, while maintaining a constant rate. We also consider an analog of the no low-energy trivial states property which we dub the no low-energy adiabatically accessible states property and show that these models do have low-energy states that can be prepared adiabatically in a time that does not scale with system size $N$. We discuss a holographic model of these codes in which the large code distance is a consequence of the emergence of a long wormhole geometry in a simple model of quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopy of N=50 isotones with the valence-space density matrix renormalization group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18723v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recently proposed combination of the valence-space in-medium similarity renormalization group (VS-IMSRG) with the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) offers a scalable and flexible many-body approach for strongly correlated open-shell nuclei. We use the VS-DMRG to investigate the low-lying spectroscopy of N=50 isotones, which are characteristic for their transition between single-particle and collective excitations. We also study electromagnetic transitions and show the advantage of the VS-DMRG to capture the underlying physics more efficiently, with significantly improved convergence compared to state-of-the-art shell-model truncations. Combined with an analysis of quantum information measures, this further establishes the VS-DMRG as a valuable method for ab initio calculations of nuclei.</description>

      <title>Electric, thermal, and thermoelectric magnetoconductivity for Weyl/multi-Weyl semimetals in planar Hall set-ups induced by the combined effects of topology and strain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14844v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We continue our investigation of the response tensors in planar Hall (or planar thermal Hall) configurations where a three-dimensional Weyl/multi-Weyl semimetal is subjected to the combined influence of an electric field $\mathbf E $ (and/or temperature gradient $\nabla_{\mathbf r } T$) and an effective magnetic field $\mathbf B_\chi $, generalizing the considerations of Phys. Rev. B 108 (2023) 155132 and Physica E 159 (2024) 115914. The electromagnetic fields are oriented at a generic angle with respect to each other, thus leading to the possibility of having collinear components, which do not arise in a Hall set-up. The net effective magnetic field $\mathbf B_\chi $ consists of two parts -- (a) an actual/physical magnetic field $\mathbf B $ applied externally; and (b) an emergent magnetic field $\mathbf B_5 $ which quantifies the elastic deformations of the sample. $\mathbf B_5 $ is an axial pseudomagnetic field because it couples to conjugate nodal points with opposite chiralities with opposite signs. Using a semiclassical Boltzmann formalism, we derive the generic expressions for the response tensors, including the effects of the Berry curvature (BC) and the orbital magnetic moment (OMM), which arise due to a nontrivial topology of the bandstructures. We elucidate the interplay of the BC-only and the OMM-dependent parts in the longitudinal and transverse (or Hall) components of the electric, thermal, and thermoelectric response tensors. Especially, for the co-planar transverse components of the response tensors, the OMM part acts exclusively in opposition (sync) with the BC-only part for the Weyl (multi-Weyl) semimetals.</description>
