      <title>On perturbation around closed exclusion processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive the formula for the stationary states of particle-number conserving exclusion processes infinitesimally perturbed by inhomogeneous adsorption and desorption. The formula not only proves but also generalises the conjecture proposed in arXiv:1711.06949 to account for inhomogeneous adsorption and desorption. As an application of the formula, we draw part of the phase diagrams of the open asymmetric simple exclusion process with and without Langmuir kinetics, correctly reproducing known results.</description>

      <title>Efficient weighted-ensemble network simulations of the SIS model of epidemics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The presence of erratic or unstable paths in standard kinetic Monte Carlo simulations significantly undermines the accurate simulation and sampling of transition pathways. While typically reliable methods, such as the Gillespie algorithm, are employed to simulate such paths, they encounter challenges in efficiently identifying rare events due to their sequential nature and reliance on exact Monte Carlo sampling. In contrast, the weighted ensemble method effectively samples rare events and accelerates the exploration of complex reaction pathways by distributing computational resources among multiple replicas, where each replica is assigned a weight reflecting its importance, and evolves independently from the others. Here, we implement the highly efficient and robust weighted ensemble method to model susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) dynamics on large heterogeneous population networks. In particular, we explore the interplay between stochasticity and contact heterogeneity which gives rise to large fluctuations, leading to extinction (spontaneous clearance of infection). By studying a wide variety of networks characterized by fat-tailed degree distributions, we are able to compute the mean time to extinction as function of the various network and epidemic parameters. Importantly, this method allows exploring previously-inaccessible parameter regimes.</description>

      <title>Form factor bootstrap in the thermally perturbed tricritical Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a systematic construction for form factors of relevant fields in the thermal perturbation of the tricritical Ising model, an integrable model with scattering amplitudes described by the $E_7$ bootstrap. We find a new type of recursive structure encoding the information in the bound state fusion structure, which fully determines the form factors of the perturbing field and the order/disorder fields, for which we present a mathematical proof. Knowledge of these form factors enables the systematic computation of correlation functions and dynamical structure factors in systems whose dynamics is governed by the vicinity of a fixed point in the tricritical Ising universality class.</description>

      <title>Maximal information at the edge of stability in excitatory-inhibitory neural populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how the complex connectivity structure of the brain shapes its information-processing capabilities is a long-standing question. Here, by focusing on a paradigmatic architecture, we study how the neural activity of excitatory and inhibitory populations encodes information on external signals. We show that information is maximized at the edge of stability, where excitation is balanced by inhibition. When the input switches among different stimuli, this maximum corresponds to the entropy of the external switching dynamics. By analyzing the case of a prolonged stimulus, we find that stronger inhibition is needed to maximize the instantaneous sensitivity, revealing an intrinsic trade-off between short-time responses and long-time accuracy. In agreement with recent experimental findings, our results open the avenue for a complete information-theoretic understanding of how and why inhibition strength should be tuned to optimize information-processing capabilities.</description>

      <title>Field Theory Approach to Classical $N$-Particle Systems In and Out of Equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an approach to solving the evolution of a classical $N$-particle ensemble based on the path integral approach to classical mechanics. This formulation provides a perturbative solution to the Liouville equation in terms of a propagator which can be expanded in a Dyson series. We show that this perturbative expansion exactly corresponds to an iterative solution of the BBGKY-hierarchy in orders of the interaction potential. Using the path integral formulation, we perform a Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation (HST) to obtain an effective field theoretic description in terms of macroscopic fields, which contains the full microscopic dynamics of the system in its vertices. Naturally, the HST leads to a new perturbative expansion scheme which contains an infinite order of microscopic interactions already at the lowest order of the perturbative expansion. Our approach can be applied to in and out of equilibrium systems with arbitrary interaction potentials and initial conditions. We show how (unequal-time) cumulants of the Klimontovich phase space densities can be computed within this framework and derive results for density and momentum correlations for a spatially homogeneous system. Under the explicit assumptions for the interaction potential and initial conditions, we show that well-known results related to plasma oscillations and the Jeans instability criterion for gravitational collapse can be recovered in the lowest order perturbative expansion and that both are the effect of the same collective behaviour of the many-body system.</description>

      <title>Vertex Representation of Hyperbolic Tensor Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a vertex representation of the tensor network (TN) in the anti-de Sitter space (AdS$_{2+0}$) that we model on a subset of hyperbolic lattices. The tensors form a network of regular $p$-sided polygons ($p&gt;4$) with the coordination number four. The response to multi-state spin systems on the hyperbolic TN is analyzed for their entire parameter space. We show that entanglement entropy is sensitive to distinguish various hyperbolic geometries whereas other thermodynamic quantities are not. We test the numerical accuracy of vertex TNs in the phase transitions of the first, second, and infinite order at the point of maximal entanglement entropy. The hyperbolic structure of TNs induces non-critical properties in the bulk although boundary conditions significantly affect the total free energy in the thermodynamic limit. Thus developed vertex-type TN can be applied to study low-energy quantum states on AdS.</description>

      <title>Analytical Survival Analysis of the Non-autonomous Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The survival probability for a periodic non-autonomous Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process is calculated analytically using two different methods. The first uses an asymptotic approach. We treat the associated Kolmogorov Backward Equation with an absorbing boundary by dividing the domain into an interior region, centered around the origin, and a "boundary layer" near the absorbing boundary. In each region we determine the leading-order analytical solutions, and construct a uniformly valid solution over the entire domain using asymptotic matching. In the second method we examine the integral relationship between the probability density function and the mean first passage time probability density function. These allow us to determine approximate analytical forms for the exit rate. The validity of the solutions derived from both methods is assessed numerically, and we find the asymptotic method to be superior.</description>

      <title>Relaxation and fluctuations of a mass- and dipole-conserving stochastic lattice gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Han et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 132, 137102 (2024)] have recently introduced a classical stochastic lattice gas model which, in addition to particle conservation, also conserves the particles' dipole moment. Because of its intrinsic nonlinearity this model exhibits unusual macroscopic scaling behaviors, different from those of lattice gases that conserve only the number of particles. Here we investigate some basic relaxation and fluctuation properties of this model at large scales and at long times. These properties crucially depend on whether the total number of particles is infinite or finite. We find similarity solutions, describing relaxation of the dipole-conserving gas (DCG) in several standard settings. A major part of our effort is an extension to this model of the macroscopic fluctuation theory (MFT), previously developed for lattice gases where only the number of particles is conserved. We apply the MFT to the calculation of the variance of nonequilibrium fluctuations of the excess number of particles on the positive semi-axis when starting from an (either deterministic, or random) constant density at $t=0$. Using the MFT, we also identify the equilibrium Boltzmann-Gibbs distribution for the DCG. Finally, based on these results, we determine the probability distribution of, and the most probable density history leading to, a large deviation in the form of a macroscopic void of a given size in an initially uniform DCG at equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Multifractality in monitored single-particle dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study multifractal properties in time evolution of a single particle subject to repeated measurements. For quantum systems, we consider circuit models consisting of local unitary gates and local projective measurements. For classical systems, we consider models for estimating the trajectory of a particle evolved under local transition processes by partially measuring particle occupations. In both cases, multifractal behaviors appear in the ensemble of wave functions or probability distributions conditioned on measurement outcomes after a sufficiently long time. While the nature of particle transport (diffusive or ballistic) qualitatively affects the multifractal properties, they are even quantitatively robust to the measurement rate or specific protocols. On the other hand, multifractality is generically lost by generalized measurements allowing erroneous outcomes or by postselection of the outcomes with no particle detection. We demonstrate these properties by numerical simulations and also propose several simplified models, which allow us to analytically obtain multifractal properties in the monitored single-particle systems.</description>

      <title>Unconventional Scalings of Quantum Entropies in Long-Range Heisenberg Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, building on state-of-the-art quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we perform systematic finite-size scaling of both entanglement and participation entropies for long-range Heisenberg chain with unfrustrated power-law decaying interactions. We find distinctive scaling behaviors for both quantum entropies in the various regimes explored by tuning the decay exponent $\alpha$, thus capturing non-trivial features through logarithmic terms, beyond the case of linear Nambu-Goldstone modes. Our systematic analysis reveals that the quantum entanglement information, hidden in the scaling of the two studied entropies, can be obtained to the same level of order parameters and other usual finite-size observables of quantum many-body lattice models. The analysis and results obtained here can readily apply to more quantum criticalities in 1D and 2D systems.</description>

      <title>KPZ scaling from the Krylov space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, a superdiffusion exhibiting the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) scaling in late-time correlators and autocorrelators of certain interacting many-body systems has been reported. Inspired by these results, we explore the KPZ scaling in correlation functions using their realization in the Krylov operator basis. We focus on the Heisenberg time scale, which approximately corresponds to the ramp--plateau transition for the Krylov complexity in systems with a large but finite number degrees of freedom. Two frameworks are under consideration: i) the system with growing Lanczos coefficients and an artificial cut-off, and ii) the system with the finite Hilbert space. In both cases via numerical analysis, we observe the transition from Gaussian to KPZ-like scaling at the critical Euclidean time $t_{E}^*=c_{cr}K$, for the Krylov chain of finite length $K$, and $c_{cr}=O(1)$. In particular, we find a scaling $\sim K^{1/3}$ for fluctuations in the one-point correlation function and a dynamical scaling $\sim K^{-2/3}$ associated with the return probability (Loschmidt echo) corresponding to autocorrelators in physical space. In the first case, the transition is of the 3rd order and can be considered as an example of dynamical quantum phase transition (DQPT), while in the second, it is a crossover. For case ii), utilizing the relationship between the spectrum of tridiagonal matrices at the spectral edge and the spectrum of the stochastic Airy operator, we demonstrate analytically the origin of the KPZ scaling for the particular Krylov chain using the results of the probability theory. We argue that there is some outcome of our study for the double scaling limit of matrix models. For the case of topological gravity, the white noise $O(\frac{1}{N})$ term is identified, which should be taken into account in the controversial issue of ensemble averaging in 2D/1D holography.</description>

      <title>Theory and Modeling of Transport in Nanoporous Materials: From Microscopic to Coarse-Grained Descriptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03039v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This review presents the state of the art on the theory, molecular simulation, and coarse-grained strategies applied to the transport of gases and liquids in nanoporous materials (pore size in the range 1 - 100 nm). Recent advances in the understanding of molecular diffusion and transport under thermodynamic gradients in nanoporous adsorbents are discussed with special emphasis on small molecules in zeolites, active carbons, metal organic frameworks, but also in nanoporous materials with larger pores such as ordered and disordered mesoporous oxides. We provide a description of the fundamentals and principles of the different atom-scale and mesoscopic methods as well as of the theoretical formalisms that can be used to address such an important problem. Special attention is paid to the investigation of different molecular transport coefficients - including the so-called self, collective and transport diffusivities - but also to the determination of free energy barriers and their role in overall adsorption/separation process rates. We also introduce other available approaches such as hierarchical simulations and upscaling strategies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently Dijkman et al. (arxiv:2403.15007) proposed training classical neural density functionals via bulk pair-correlation matching. We show their method to be an efficient regularizer for neural functionals based on local learning of inhomogeneous one-body direct correlations [Samm\"uller et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 120, e2312484120 (2023)]. We demonstrate that local one-body learning allows flexible neural modelling of the full Mermin-Evans density functional map, but that bulk pair-correlation matching alone does not. Using spatial localization gives access to accurate neural free energy functionals, including convolutional neural networks, that transcend the training box.</description>

      <title>Nonreciprocal synchronization of active quantum spins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Active agents are capable of exerting nonreciprocal forces upon one another. For instance, one agent may attract another one, which in turn is repelled. These antagonistic nonreciprocal interactions have been extensively studied in classical systems, revealing a wealth of exciting phenomena such as novel phase transitions and traveling-wave states. Whether these phenomena can originate in quantum many-body systems is an open issue, and proposals for their realization are lacking. In this work, we present a model of two species of quantum spins that interact in an antagonistic nonreciprocal way of the attraction-repulsion type. We propose an implementation based on two atomic ensembles coupled via chiral waveguides featuring both braided and non-braided geometries. The spins are active due to the presence of local gain, which allows them to synchronize. We show that nonreciprocal interactions deeply affect their synchronization dynamics. In the thermodynamic limit, this results in a nonreciprocal phase transition to nonstationary traveling-wave states, associated with spontaneous breaking of parity-time symmetry. We establish how this symmetry emerges from the microscopic quantum model. For a finite number of spins, we discuss how traveling-wave states and nonreciprocal phase transitions are revealed by spin correlations measurable via the output field of the waveguides. Our work opens a new avenue to explore nonreciprocal interactions in active quantum matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03381v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the neural-network quantum states method has been investigated to study the ground state and the time evolution of many-body quantum systems. Here we expand on the investigation and consider a quantum quench from the paramagnetic to the anti-ferromagnetic phase in the tilted Ising model. We use two types of neural networks, a restricted Boltzmann machine and a feed-forward neural network. We show that for both types of networks, the projected time-dependent variational Monte Carlo (p-tVMC) method performs better than the non-projected approach. We further demonstrate that one can use K-FAC or minSR in conjunction with p-tVMC to reduce the computational complexity of the stochastic reconfiguration approach, thus allowing the use of these techniques for neural networks with more parameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.02705v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The detailed fluctuation theorem implies symmetry in the generating function of entropy production probability. The integral fluctuation theorem directly follows from this symmetry and the normalization of the probability. In this paper, we rewrite the generating function by integrating measurements and evolution into a constructed mapping. This mapping is completely positive, and the original integral FT is determined by the trace-preserving property of these constructed maps. We illustrate the convenience of this method by discussing the eigenstate fluctuation theorem and heat exchange between two baths. This set of methods is also applicable to the generating functions of quasi-probability, where we observe the Petz recovery map arising naturally from this approach.</description>

Abstract: The third law of thermodynamics has been verified experimentally, but how to perfectly express such a law in theory has become a cross-century problematic issue. It is found from the recent researches that by introducing an innovative method, the Nernst equation can be obtained directly from the experimental data of chemical reactions at low temperatures without the need for artificial additional assumptions appearing in textbooks, so that the Nernst theorem should be replaced by the Nernst statement. The heat capacity statement proposed recently can be also obtained from the experimental data of the heat capacity at low temperatures. The heat capacity statement and the Nernst statement are proved to be mutually derivable and the two are equivalent. The unattainability statement of absolute zero temperature is only a coloration of the Nernst statement or the heat capacity statement. Simultaneously, the defects and deficiencies related to the contents of the third law of thermodynamics appearing in textbooks are pointed out and corrected. The results obtained show clearly that the Nernst theorem and the unattainability statement of absolute zero temperature should be withdrawn from the statements of the third law of thermodynamics. It is important to find that the Nernst statement and the heat capacity statement are two equivalent statements of the third law of thermodynamics, which can solve the centennial debate problems of the third law of thermodynamics and supply the perfect statements for the third law of thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Kinetics of the one-dimensional voter model with long-range interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.16517v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The one-dimensional long-range voter model, where an agent takes the opinion of another at distance $r$ with probability $\propto r^{-\alpha}$, is studied analytically. The model displays rich and diverse features as $\alpha$ is changed. For $\alpha &gt;3$ the behavior is similar to the one of the nearest-neighbor version, with the formation of ordered domains whose typical size grows as $R(t)\propto t^{1/2}$ until consensus (a fully ordered configuration) is reached. The correlation function $C(r,t)$ between two agents at distance $r$ obeys dynamical scaling with sizeable corrections at large distances $r&gt;r^*(t)$, slowly fading away in time. For $2&lt; \alpha \le 3$ violations of scaling appear, due to the simultaneous presence of two lengh-scales, the size of domains growing as $t^{(\alpha-2)/(\alpha-1)}$, and the distance $L(t)\propto t^{1/(\alpha-1)}$ over which correlations extend. For $\alpha \le 2$ the system reaches a partially ordered stationary state, characterised by an algebraic correlator, % $C(r)\propto r^{-(2-\alpha)}$, whose lifetime diverges in the thermodynamic limit of infinitely many agents, so that consensus is not reached. For a finite system escape towards the fully ordered configuration is finally promoted by development of large distance correlations. In a system of $N$ sites, global consensus is achieved after a time $T \propto N^2$ for $\alpha&gt;3$, $T \propto N^{\alpha-1}$ for $2&lt;\alpha \le 3$, and $T \propto N$ for $\alpha \le 2$.</description>

      <title>Decay dynamics of a single spherical domain in near-critical phase-separated conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04973v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Domain decay is at the heart of the so-called evaporation-condensation Ostwald-ripening regime of phase ordering kinetics, where the growth of large domains occurs at the expense of smaller ones, which are expected to `evaporate'. We experimentally investigate such decay dynamics at the level of a single spherical domain picked from one phase in coexistence and brought into the other phase by an opto-mechanical approach, in a near-critical phase-separated binary liquid mixture. We observe that the decay dynamics is generally not compatible with the theoretically expected surface-tension decay laws for conserved order parameters. Using a mean-field description, we quantitatively explain this apparent disagreement by the gradient of solute concentrations induced by gravity close to a critical point. Finally, we determine the conditions for which buoyancy becomes negligible compared to capillarity and perform dedicated experiments that retrieve the predicted surface-tension induced decay exponent. The surface-tension driven decay dynamics of conserved order parameter systems in the presence and the absence of gravity, is thus established at the level of a single domain.</description>

      <title>Diffusion dynamics of an overdamped active ellipsoidal particle in two dimensions</title>

Abstract: Shape asymmetry is the most abundant in nature and attracted great interest in recent research. The phenomenon is widely recognized: a free ellipsoidal Brownian particle displays anisotropic diffusion during short time intervals, which subsequently transitions to an isotropic diffusion pattern over longer time scales. We have further expanded this concept to incorporate active ellipsoidal particles characterized by an initial self-propelled velocity. This paper provides analytical and simulation results of diffusion dynamics of an active ellipsoidal particle. The active ellipsoidal particle manifests three distinct regimes in its diffusion dynamics over time. In the transient regime, it displays diffusive behavior followed by a super-diffusive phase, and in the longer time duration, it transitions to purely diffusive dynamics. We investigated diffusion dynamics for the free particle as well as the particle in a harmonic trap, and the particle subject to a constant field force. Moreover, we have studied the rotational diffusion dynamics and torque production resulting from an external constant force field. Furthermore, our investigation extends to the examination of the scaled average velocity of an ellipsoidal active particle, considering both a constant force field and a one-dimensional ratchet.</description>

      <title>The Copycat Perceptron: Smashing Barriers Through Collective Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.03743v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We characterize the equilibrium properties of a model of $y$ coupled binary perceptrons in the teacher-student scenario, subject to a suitable cost function, with an explicit ferromagnetic coupling proportional to the Hamming distance between the students' weights. In contrast to recent works, we analyze a more general setting in which thermal noise is present that affects each student's generalization performance. In the nonzero temperature regime, we find that the coupling of replicas leads to a bend of the phase diagram towards smaller values of $\alpha$: This suggests that the free entropy landscape gets smoother around the solution with perfect generalization (i.e., the teacher) at a fixed fraction of examples, allowing standard thermal updating algorithms such as Simulated Annealing to easily reach the teacher solution and avoid getting trapped in metastable states as it happens in the unreplicated case, even in the computationally \textit{easy} regime of the inference phase diagram. These results provide additional analytic and numerical evidence for the recently conjectured Bayes-optimal property of Replicated Simulated Annealing (RSA) for a sufficient number of replicas. From a learning perspective, these results also suggest that multiple students working together (in this case reviewing the same data) are able to learn the same rule both significantly faster and with fewer examples, a property that could be exploited in the context of cooperative and federated learning.</description>

      <title>Stringlet Excitation Model of the Boson Peak</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.04230v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The boson peak (BP), a low-energy excess in the vibrational density of states over the Debye contribution, is often identified as a characteristic of amorphous solid materials. Despite decades of efforts, its microscopic origin still remains a mystery. Recently, it has been proposed, and corroborated with simulations, that the BP might stem from intrinsic localized modes involving one-dimensional (1D) string-like excitations (``stringlets"). We build on a theory originally proposed by Lund that describes the localized modes as 1D vibrating strings, but we specify the stringlet size distribution to be exponential, as observed in simulations. We provide an analytical prediction for the BP frequency $\omega_{BP}$ in the temperature regime well below the observed glass transition temperature $T_g$. The prediction involves no free parameters and accords quantitatively with prior simulation observations in 2D and 3D model glasses based on inverse power law potentials. The comparison of the string model to observations is more uncertain when compared to simulations of an Al-Sm metallic glass material at temperatures well above $T_g$. Nonetheless, our stringlet model of the BP naturally reproduces the softening of the BP frequency upon heating and offers an analytical explanation for the experimentally observed scaling with the shear modulus in the glass state and changes in this scaling in simulations of glass-forming liquids. Finally, the theoretical analysis highlights the existence of a strong damping for the stringlet modes above $T_g$, which leads to a large low-frequency contribution to the 3D vibrational density of states, observed in both experiments and simulations.</description>

      <title>Quantum-critical properties of the one- and two-dimensional random transverse-field Ising model from large-scale quantum Monte Carlo simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05223v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the ferromagnetic transverse-field Ising model with quenched disorder at $T = 0$ in one and two dimensions by means of stochastic series expansion quantum Monte Carlo simulations using a rigorous zero-temperature scheme. Using a sample-replication method and averaged Binder ratios, we determine the critical shift and width exponents $\nu_\mathrm{s}$ and $\nu_\mathrm{w}$ as well as unbiased critical points by finite-size scaling. Further, scaling of the disorder-averaged magnetisation at the critical point is used to determine the order-parameter critical exponent $\beta$ and the critical exponent $\nu_{\mathrm{av}}$ of the average correlation length. The dynamic scaling in the Griffiths phase is investigated by measuring the local susceptibility in the disordered phase and the dynamic exponent $z'$ is extracted. By applying various finite-size scaling protocols, we provide an extensive and comprehensive comparison between the different approaches on equal footing. The emphasis on effective zero-temperature simulations resolves several inconsistencies in existing literature.</description>

      <title>Quantum Dynamics in Krylov Space: Methods and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09628v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of quantum systems unfolds within a subspace of the state space or operator space, known as the Krylov space. This review presents the use of Krylov subspace methods to provide a compact and computationally efficient description of quantum evolution, with emphasis on nonequilibrium phenomena of many-body systems with a large Hilbert space. It provides a comprehensive update of recent developments, focused on the quantum evolution of operators in the Heisenberg picture as well as pure and mixed states. It further explores the notion of Krylov complexity and associated metrics as tools for quantifying operator growth, their bounds by generalized quantum speed limits, the universal operator growth hypothesis, and its relation to quantum chaos, scrambling, and generalized coherent states. A comparison of several generalizations of the Krylov construction for open quantum systems is presented. A closing discussion addresses the application of Krylov subspace methods in quantum field theory, holography, integrability, quantum control, and quantum computing, as well as current open problems.</description>
