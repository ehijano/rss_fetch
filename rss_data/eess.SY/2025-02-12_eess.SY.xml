      <title>A view on learning robust goal-conditioned value functions: Interplay between RL and MPC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) and model predictive control (MPC) offer a wealth of distinct approaches for automatic decision-making. Given the impact both fields have had independently across numerous domains, there is growing interest in combining the general-purpose learning capability of RL with the safety and robustness features of MPC. To this end, this paper presents a tutorial-style treatment of RL and MPC, treating them as alternative approaches to solving Markov decision processes. In our formulation, RL aims to learn a global value function through offline exploration in an uncertain environment, whereas MPC constructs a local value function through online optimization. This local-global perspective suggests new ways to design policies that combine robustness and goal-conditioned learning. Robustness is incorporated into the RL and MPC pipelines through a scenario-based approach. Goal-conditioned learning aims to alleviate the burden of engineering a reward function for RL. Combining the two leads to a single policy that unites a robust, high-level RL terminal value function with short-term, scenario-based MPC planning for reliable constraint satisfaction. This approach leverages the benefits of both RL and MPC, the effectiveness of which is demonstrated on classical control benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Active Inference through Incentive Design in Markov Decision Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a method for active inference with partial observations in stochastic systems through incentive design, also known as the leader-follower game. Consider a leader agent who aims to infer a follower agent's type given a finite set of possible types. Different types of followers differ in either the dynamical model, the reward function, or both. We assume the leader can partially observe a follower's behavior in the stochastic system modeled as a Markov decision process, in which the follower takes an optimal policy to maximize a total reward. To improve inference accuracy and efficiency, the leader can offer side payments (incentives) to the followers such that different types of them, under the incentive design, can exhibit diverging behaviors that facilitate the leader's inference task. We show the problem of active inference through incentive design can be formulated as a special class of leader-follower games, where the leader's objective is to balance the information gain and cost of incentive design. The information gain is measured by the entropy of the estimated follower's type given partial observations. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this problem can be solved by reducing a single-level optimization through softmax temporal consistency between followers' policies and value functions. This reduction allows us to develop an efficient gradient-based algorithm. We utilize observable operators in the hidden Markov model (HMM) to compute the necessary gradients and demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through experiments in stochastic grid world environments.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive Analysis of Thermal Dissipation in Lithium-Ion Battery Packs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective thermal management is critical for lithium-ion battery packs' safe and efficient operations, particularly in applications such as drones, where compact designs and varying airflow conditions present unique challenges. This study investigates the thermal performance of a 16-cell lithium-ion battery pack by optimizing cooling airflow configurations and integrating phase change materials (PCMs) for enhanced heat dissipation. Seven geometric configurations were evaluated under airflow speeds ranging from 0 to 15 m/s, reflecting the operational conditions of civilian drones. A comprehensive 3D simulation approach was used to analyze the effects of inlet and outlet configurations, airflow dynamics, and PCM phase transition behavior. Results indicate that the trapezoidal (wide-base) configuration, paired with a 5-inlet and 1-outlet setup, achieves the most balanced performance, effectively maintaining optimal operating temperatures across low and high-speed airflow conditions. PCM integration further stabilized thermal behavior, with phase change durations extending to 12.5 min under tested conditions. These findings highlight the importance of geometric optimization and material integration in advancing compact and reliable thermal management systems for energy-dense battery packs. This study provides a foundation for designing efficient cooling strategies tailored to lightweight applications such as drones and portable energy storage systems.</description>

      <title>Real-time Optimization for Wind-to-H2 Driven Critical Infrastructures Based on Active Constraints Identification and Integer Variables Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a concept of wind-to-hydrogen-driven critical infrastructure (W2H-CI) as an engineering solution for decarbonizing the power generation sector where it utilizes wind power to produce hydrogen through electrolysis and combines it with the carbon captured from fossil fuel power plants. First, a convex mathematical model of W2H-CI is developed. Then, an optimization model for optimal operation of W2H-CI, which is a large-scale mixed-integer convex program (MICP), is proposed. Moreover, we propose to solve this problem in real-time in order to hedge against the uncertainty of wind power. For this purpose, a novel solution method based on active constraints identification and integer variable prediction is introduced. This method can solve MICP problems very fast since it uses historical optimization data to predict the values of binary variables and a limited number of constraints which most likely contain all active constraints. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed fast solution method using two W2H-CI case studies.</description>

      <title>Optimal Steady-State Secondary Control of MT-HVdc Grids with Reduced Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a centralized secondary control for the real-time steady-state optimization of multi-terminal HVdc grids under voltage and current limits. First, we present the dynamic models of the grid components, including the modular multilevel converter (MMC) stations and their different control layers. We also derive the quasi-static input-output model of the system, which is suitable for the steady-state control design. Second, we formulate a general optimization problem using this quasi-static model and find the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker optimality conditions of its solutions. Third, we propose a secondary control based on primal-dual dynamics to adjust the voltage setpoints of the dispatchable MMCs, with which the system asymptotically converges to a steady state that satisfies these optimality conditions. Fourth, we provide a communication triggering mechanism to reduce the communication traffic between the secondary control unit and the MMC stations. Finally, we verify our proposal for different case studies by adapting it to an offshore multi-terminal HVdc grid composed of heterogeneous MMC stations simulated in the MATLAB/Simulink environment. The problems of proportional current minimization and loss reduction are two special case studies.</description>

      <title>Morphing Wing Designs in Commercial Aviation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With increasing demands for fuel efficiency and operational adaptability in commercial aviation}, this paper provides a systematic review and classification of morphing wing technologies, analyzing their aerodynamic performance characteristics and atmospheric condition adaptability. We first develop a comprehensive classification framework for morphing wing designs based on their scale of morphing, actuation mechanisms, and intended purposes. Through analysis of historical developments and current implementations, we evaluate two significant case studies: the Mission Adaptive Compliant Wing (MACW) and Adaptive Aspect Ratio (AdAR) morphing wing, demonstrating performance improvements of up to 25% in drag reduction and 40% in control authority. Our investigation reveals critical trade-offs between full-span and partial morphing approaches, particularly regarding implementation complexity, certification requirements, and operational reliability. The study concludes with an assessment of technical barriers and opportunities, providing specific recommendations for advancing morphing wing technology in commercial aviation applications. Key findings indicate that while material science and control system advances enable practical implementation, certification pathways and maintenance considerations remain critical challenges for widespread adoption.</description>

      <title>Non-Iterative Coordination of Interconnected Power Grids via Dimension-Decomposition-Based Flexibility Aggregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The bulk power grid is divided into regional grids interconnected with multiple tie-lines for efficient operation. Since interconnected power grids are operated by different control centers, it is a challenging task to realize coordinated dispatch of multiple regional grids. A viable solution is to compute a flexibility aggregation model for each regional power grid, then optimize the tie-line schedule using the aggregated models to implement non-iterative coordinated dispatch. However, challenges such as intricate interdependencies and curse of dimensionality persist in computing the aggregated models in high-dimensional space. Existing methods like Fourier-Motzkin elimination, vertex search, and multi-parameter programming are limited by dimensionality and conservatism, hindering practical application. This paper presents a novel dimension-decomposition-based flexibility aggregation algorithm for calculating the aggregated models of multiple regional power grids, enabling non-iterative coordination in large-scale interconnected systems. Compared to existing methods, the proposed approach yields a significantly less conservative flexibility region. The derived flexibility aggregation model for each regional power grid has a well-defined physical counterpart, which facilitates intuitive analysis of multi-port regional power grids and provides valuable insights into their internal resource endowments. Numerical tests validate the feasibility of the aggregated model and demonstrate its accuracy in coordinating interconnected power grids.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Recurrent Network for Gas Pipeline Network Parameters Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a part of the integrated energy system (IES), gas pipeline networks can provide additional flexibility to power systems through coordinated optimal dispatch. An accurate pipeline network model is critical for the optimal operation and control of IESs. However, inaccuracies or unavailability of accurate pipeline parameters often introduce errors in the mathematical models of such networks. This paper proposes a physics-informed recurrent network (PIRN) model to identify the state-space model of gas pipelines. The approach combines data-driven learning from measurement data with the fluid dynamics described by partial differential equations. By embedding the physical state-space model within the recurrent network, parameter identification is transformed into a training process for a PIRN. Similar to standard recurrent neural networks, this model can be implemented using the PyTorch framework and trained via backpropagation. Case studies demonstrate that our method accurately estimates gas pipeline models from sparse terminal node measurements, providing robust performance and significantly higher parameter efficiency. Furthermore, the identified models can be seamlessly integrated into optimization frameworks.</description>

      <title>Mixed Integer Linear Programming for Active Contact Selection in Deep Brain Stimulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) programming remains a complex and time-consuming process, requiring manual selection of stimulation parameters to achieve therapeutic effects while minimizing adverse side-effects. This study explores mathematical optimization for DBS programming, using functional subdivisions of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) to define the desired activation profile. A Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) framework is presented allowing for dissimilar current distribution across active contacts. MILP is compared to a Linear Programming (LP) approach in terms of computational efficiency and activation accuracy. Results from ten Parkinson's disease patients treated with DBS show that while MILP better matches the predefined stimulation target activation profile, LP solutions more closely resemble clinically applied settings, suggesting the profile may not fully capture clinically relevant patterns. Additionally, MILP's limitations are discussed, including its reliance on precisely defined target regions and its computational burden for larger target sets.</description>

      <title>On Event-Triggered Resilient Consensus Using Auxiliary Layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to its design simplicity, auxiliary layer-based resilient control is widely discussed in the literature to mitigate the effects of False Data Injection (FDI) attacks. However, the increased communication burden due to additional communication links for connecting an extra layer is often overlooked in the literature. This paper bridges this gap by considering an event-triggered approach for inter-layer communication between the physical layer (containing actual agents) and the auxiliary layer (containing virtual agents) for the resilient state consensus in a multi-agent system. We provide state-based and dynamic event-triggering mechanisms, the former being the motivation for the latter. The exclusion of Zeno behavior is established by proving positive minimum inter-event time (MIET). Extensive simulation and experimental results are provided to illustrate the proposed methodology.</description>

      <title>Enviro-IoT: Calibrating Low-Cost Environmental Sensors in Urban Settings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-cost miniaturised sensors offer significant advantage to monitor the environment in real-time and accurately. The area of air quality monitoring has attracted much attention in recent years because of the increasing impacts on the environment and more personally to human health and mental wellbeing. Rapid growth in sensors and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies is paving the way for low-cost systems to transform global monitoring of air quality. Drawing on 4 years of development work, in this paper we outline the design, implementation and analysis of \textit{Enviro-IoT} as a step forward to monitoring air quality levels within urban environments by means of a low-cost sensing system. An in-the-wild study for 9-months was performed to evaluate the Enviro-IoT system against industry standard equipment is performed with accuracy for measuring Particulate Matter 2.5, 10 and Nitrogen Dioxide achieving 98\%, 97\% and 97\% respectively. The results in this case study are made up Of 57, 120 which highlight that it is possible to take advantage of low-cost sensors coupled with IoT technologies to validate the Enviro-IoT device against research-grade industrial instruments.</description>

      <title>EIQP: Execution-time-certified and Infeasibility-detecting QP Solver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solving real-time quadratic programming (QP) is a ubiquitous task in control engineering, such as in model predictive control and control barrier function-based QP. In such real-time scenarios, certifying that the employed QP algorithm can either return a solution within a predefined level of optimality or detect QP infeasibility before the predefined sampling time is a pressing requirement. This article considers convex QP and adopts its homogeneous formulation to achieve infeasibility detection. Exploiting this homogeneous formulation, this article proposes a novel infeasible interior-point method (IPM) algorithm with the best theoretical $O(\sqrt{n})$ iteration complexity that feasible IPM algorithms enjoy. The iteration complexity is proved to be \textit{exact} (rather than an upper bound), \textit{simple to calculate}, and \textit{data independent}, with the value $\left\lceil\frac{\log(\frac{n+1}{\epsilon})}{-\log(1-\frac{0.414213}{\sqrt{n+1}})}\right\rceil$ (where $n$ and $\epsilon$ denote the number of constraints and the predefined optimality level, respectively), making it appealing to certify the execution time of online time-varying convex QPs. The proposed algorithm is simple to implement without requiring a line search procedure (uses the full Newton step), and its C-code implementation (offering MATLAB, Julia, and Python interfaces) and numerical examples are publicly available at https://github.com/liangwu2019/EIQP.</description>

      <title>Axial current as the origin of quantum intrinsic orbital angular momentum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that it is impossible to experimentally observe the quantum intrinsic orbital angular momentum (IOAM) effect without its axial current. Broadly speaking, we argue that the spiral or interference characteristics of the axial current density determine the occurrence of nonlinear or tunneling effects in any spacetimedependent quantum systems. Our findings offer a comprehensive theoretical framework that addresses the limitations of Keldysh theory and provides new insights into the angular momentum properties of quantum systems, particularly in tunneling-dominated regimes. Using Wigner function methods, fermionic generalized two-level model, and Berry phase simulations, we predict that IOAM effect can persist even in pure quantum tunneling processes. These results open the door for experimental verification of IOAM effects in future high-intensity QED experiments, such as those using X-ray free electron lasers.</description>

      <title>A Safe Hybrid Control Framework for Car-like Robot with Guaranteed Global Path-Invariance using a Control Barrier Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07136v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work proposes a hybrid framework for car-like robots with obstacle avoidance, global convergence, and safety, where safety is interpreted as path invariance, namely, once the robot converges to the path, it never leaves the path. Given a priori obstacle-free feasible path where obstacles can be around the path, the task is to avoid obstacles while reaching the path and then staying on the path without leaving it. The problem is solved in two stages. Firstly, we define a ``tight'' obstacle-free neighborhood along the path and design a local controller to ensure convergence to the path and path invariance. The control barrier function technology is involved in the control design to steer the system away from its singularity points, where the local path invariant controller is not defined. Secondly, we design a hybrid control framework that integrates this local path-invariant controller with any global tracking controller from the existing literature without path invariance guarantee, ensuring convergence from any position to the desired path, namely, global convergence. This framework guarantees path invariance and robustness to sensor noise. Detailed simulation results affirm the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.</description>

Abstract: Coordinated controlling a large UAV swarm requires significant spectrum resources due to the need for bandwidth allocation per UAV, posing a challenge in resource-limited environments. Over-the-air (OTA) control has emerged as a spectrum-efficient approach, leveraging electromagnetic superposition to form control signals at a base station (BS). However, existing OTA controllers lack sufficient optimization variables to meet UAV swarm control objectives and fail to integrate control with other BS functions like sensing. This work proposes an integrated sensing and OTA control framework (ISAC-OTA) for UAV swarm. The BS performs OTA signal construction (uplink) and dispatch (downlink) while simultaneously sensing objects. Two uplink post-processing methods are developed: a control-centric approach generating closed-form control signals via a feedback-looped OTA control problem, and a sensing-centric method mitigating transmission-induced interference for accurate object sensing. For the downlink, a non-convex problem is formulated and solved to minimize control signal dispatch (transmission) error while maintaining a minimum sensing signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Simulation results show that the proposed ISAC-OTA controller achieves control performance comparable to the benchmark optimal control algorithm while maintaining high sensing accuracy, despite OTA transmission interference. Moreover, it eliminates the need for per-UAV bandwidth allocation, showcasing a spectrum-efficient method for cooperative control in future wireless systems.</description>

      <title>Dual Arm Steering of Deformable Linear Objects in 2-D and 3-D Environments Using Euler's Elastica Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07509v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper describes a method for steering deformable linear objects using two robot hands in environments populated by sparsely spaced obstacles. The approach involves manipulating an elastic inextensible rod by varying the gripping endpoint positions and tangents. Closed form solutions that describe the flexible linear object shape in planar environments, Euler's elastica, are described. The paper uses these solutions to formulate criteria for non self-intersection, stability and obstacle avoidance. These criteria are formulated as constraints in the flexible object six-dimensional configuration space that represents the robot gripping endpoint positions and tangents. In particular, this paper introduces a novel criterion that ensures the flexible object stability during steering. All safety criteria are integrated into a scheme for steering flexible linear objects in planar environments, which is lifted into a steering scheme in three-dimensional environments populated by sparsely spaced obstacles. Experiments with a dual-arm robot demonstrate the method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a proof of an extension of the Hartman-Grobman theorem to nonhyperbolic but asymptotically stable equilibria of vector fields. Moreover, the linearizing topological conjugacy is (i) defined on the entire basin of attraction if the vector field is complete, and (ii) a $C^{k\geq 1}$ diffeomorphism on the complement of the equilibrium if the vector field is $C^k$ and the underlying space is not $5$-dimensional. We also show that the $C^k$ statement in the $5$-dimensional case is equivalent to the $4$-dimensional smooth Poincar\'{e} conjecture.</description>

      <title>Automatic Robot Task Planning by Integrating Large Language Model with Genetic Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate task planning is critical for controlling autonomous systems, such as robots, drones, and self-driving vehicles. Behavior Trees (BTs) are considered one of the most prominent control-policy-defining frameworks in task planning, due to their modularity, flexibility, and reusability. Generating reliable and accurate BT-based control policies for robotic systems remains challenging and often requires domain expertise. In this paper, we present the LLM-GP-BT technique that leverages the Large Language Model (LLM) and Genetic Programming (GP) to automate the generation and configuration of BTs. The LLM-GP-BT technique processes robot task commands expressed in human natural language and converts them into accurate and reliable BT-based task plans in a computationally efficient and user-friendly manner. The proposed technique is systematically developed and validated through simulation experiments, demonstrating its potential to streamline task planning for autonomous systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.16285v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Power-to-X (PtX) products constitute a promising solution component in the defossilisation of hard-to-abate sectors. Where direct electrification is not possible, they can find application as chemical feedstock, easy to transport energy carriers and storage. In this contribution, a modular system architecture for a highly automated operation of an offshore off-grid PtX production platform consisting of five layers (asset, control, communication, digital, application) is presented. The assumed advantage of such an off-grid platform is the good scalability worldwide as well as easy exploitation of renewable potentials in any location. Using the example of a power-to-methanol process, a simplified prototype is outlined.</description>

      <title>Precision on Demand: Propositional Logic for Event-Trigger Threshold Regulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14473v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a novel event-trigger threshold (ETT) regulation mechanism based on the quantitative semantics of propositional logic (PL). We exploit the expressiveness of the PL vocabulary to deliver a precise and flexible specification of ETT regulation based on system requirements and properties. Additionally, we present a modified ETT regulation mechanism that provides formal guarantees for satisfaction/violation detection of arbitrary PL properties. To validate our proposed method, we consider a convoy of vehicles in an adaptive cruise control scenario. In this scenario, the PL operators are used to encode safety properties and the ETTs are regulated accordingly, e.g., if our safety metric is high there can be a higher ETT threshold, while a smaller threshold is used when the system is approaching unsafe conditions. Under ideal ETT regulation conditions in this safety scenario, we show that reductions between 41.8 - 96.3% in the number of triggered events is possible compared to using a constant ETT while maintaining similar safety conditions.</description>

      <title>End-to-End Learning Framework for Solving Non-Markovian Optimal Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04649v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Integer-order calculus often falls short in capturing the long-range dependencies and memory effects found in many real-world processes. Fractional calculus addresses these gaps via fractional-order integrals and derivatives, but fractional-order dynamical systems pose substantial challenges in system identification and optimal control due to the lack of standard control methodologies. In this paper, we theoretically derive the optimal control via \textit{linear quadratic regulator} (LQR) for \textit{fractional-order linear time-invariant }(FOLTI) systems and develop an end-to-end deep learning framework based on this theoretical foundation. Our approach establishes a rigorous mathematical model, derives analytical solutions, and incorporates deep learning to achieve data-driven optimal control of FOLTI systems. Our key contributions include: (i) proposing an innovative system identification method control strategy for FOLTI systems, (ii) developing the first end-to-end data-driven learning framework, \textbf{F}ractional-\textbf{O}rder \textbf{L}earning for \textbf{O}ptimal \textbf{C}ontrol (FOLOC), that learns control policies from observed trajectories, and (iii) deriving a theoretical analysis of sample complexity to quantify the number of samples required for accurate optimal control in complex real-world problems. Experimental results indicate that our method accurately approximates fractional-order system behaviors without relying on Gaussian noise assumptions, pointing to promising avenues for advanced optimal control.</description>

      <title>Novelty Detection in Reinforcement Learning with World Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.08731v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) using world models has found significant recent successes. However, when a sudden change to world mechanics or properties occurs then agent performance and reliability can dramatically decline. We refer to the sudden change in visual properties or state transitions as novelties. Implementing novelty detection within generated world model frameworks is a crucial task for protecting the agent when deployed. In this paper, we propose straightforward bounding approaches to incorporate novelty detection into world model RL agents, by utilizing the misalignment of the world model's hallucinated states and the true observed states as an anomaly score. We provide effective approaches to detecting novelties in a distribution of transitions learned by an agent in a world model. Finally, we show the advantage of our work in a novel environment compared to traditional machine learning novelty detection methods as well as currently accepted RL focused novelty detection algorithms.</description>

Abstract: The contemporary landscape of wireless technology underscores the critical role of precise localization services. Traditional global navigation satellite systems (GNSS)-based solutions, however, fall short when it comes to indoor environments, and existing indoor localization techniques such as electromagnetic fingerprinting methods face challenges of additional implementation costs and limited coverage. This article explores an innovative solution that blends low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites with reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs), unlocking its potential for realizing seamless indoor and outdoor localization (SIOL) with global coverage. After a comprehensive review of the distinctive characteristics of LEO satellites and RISs, we showcase their potential for SIOL applications through two case studies on position error bound evaluation. Finally, we discuss system architectures and highlight open challenges in such systems.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning for Scalable and Optimal Load Shedding Under Power System Contingency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05521v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Prompt and effective corrective actions in response to unexpected contingencies are crucial for improving power system resilience and preventing cascading blackouts. The optimal load shedding (OLS) accounting for network limits has the potential to address the diverse system-wide impacts of contingency scenarios as compared to traditional local schemes. However, due to the fast cascading propagation of initial contingencies, real-time OLS solutions are challenging to attain in large systems with high computation and communication needs. In this paper, we propose a decentralized design that leverages offline training of a neural network (NN) model for individual load centers to autonomously construct the OLS solutions from locally available measurements. Our learning-for-OLS approach can greatly reduce the computation and communication needs during online emergency responses, thus preventing the cascading propagation of contingencies for enhanced power grid resilience. Numerical studies on both the IEEE 118-bus system and a synthetic Texas 2000-bus system have demonstrated the efficiency and effectiveness of our scalable OLS learning design for timely power system emergency operations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12125v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper considers the design of sparse actuator schedules for linear time-invariant systems. An actuator schedule selects, for each time instant, which control inputs act on the system in that instant. We address the optimal scheduling of control inputs under a hard constraint on the number of inputs that can be used at each time. For a sparsely controllable system, we characterize sparse actuator schedules that make the system controllable, and then devise a greedy selection algorithm that guarantees controllability while heuristically providing low control effort. We further show how to enhance our greedy algorithm via Markov chain Monte Carlo-based randomized optimization</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18768v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Learning from Demonstration (LfD) is a useful paradigm for training policies that solve tasks involving complex motions, such as those encountered in robotic manipulation. In practice, the successful application of LfD requires overcoming error accumulation during policy execution, i.e. the problem of drift due to errors compounding over time and the consequent out-of-distribution behaviours. Existing works seek to address this problem through scaling data collection, correcting policy errors with a human-in-the-loop, temporally ensembling policy predictions or through learning a dynamical system model with convergence guarantees. In this work, we propose and validate an alternative approach to overcoming this issue. Inspired by reservoir computing, we develop a recurrent neural network layer that includes a fixed nonlinear dynamical system with tunable dynamical properties for modelling temporal dynamics. We validate the efficacy of our neural network layer on the task of reproducing human handwriting motions using the LASA Human Handwriting Dataset. Through empirical experiments we demonstrate that incorporating our layer into existing neural network architectures addresses the issue of compounding errors in LfD. Furthermore, we perform a comparative evaluation against existing approaches including a temporal ensemble of policy predictions and an Echo State Network (ESN) implementation. We find that our approach yields greater policy precision and robustness on the handwriting task while also generalising to multiple dynamics regimes and maintaining competitive latency scores.</description>

      <title>Analytical Lyapunov Function Discovery: An RL-based Generative Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02014v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite advances in learning-based methods, finding valid Lyapunov functions for nonlinear dynamical systems remains challenging. Current neural network approaches face two main issues: challenges in scalable verification and limited interpretability. To address these, we propose an end-to-end framework using transformers to construct analytical Lyapunov functions (local), which simplifies formal verification, enhances interpretability, and provides valuable insights for control engineers. Our framework consists of a transformer-based trainer that generates candidate Lyapunov functions and a falsifier that verifies candidate expressions and refines the model via risk-seeking policy gradient. Unlike Alfarano et al. (2024), which utilizes pre-training and seeks global Lyapunov functions for low-dimensional systems, our model is trained from scratch via reinforcement learning (RL) and succeeds in finding local Lyapunov functions for high-dimensional and non-polynomial systems. Given the analytical nature of the candidates, we employ efficient optimization methods for falsification during training and formal verification tools for the final verification. We demonstrate the efficiency of our approach on a range of nonlinear dynamical systems with up to ten dimensions and show that it can discover Lyapunov functions not previously identified in the control literature.</description>

      <title>UniDB: A Unified Diffusion Bridge Framework via Stochastic Optimal Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05749v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion bridge models leverage Doob's $h$-transform to establish fixed endpoints between distributions, demonstrating promising results in image translation and restoration tasks. However, these approaches frequently produce blurred or excessively smoothed image details and lack a comprehensive theoretical foundation to explain these shortcomings. To address these limitations, we propose UniDB, a unified framework for diffusion bridges based on Stochastic Optimal Control (SOC). UniDB formulates the problem through an SOC-based optimization and derives a closed-form solution for the optimal controller, thereby unifying and generalizing existing diffusion bridge models. We demonstrate that existing diffusion bridges employing Doob's $h$-transform constitute a special case of our framework, emerging when the terminal penalty coefficient in the SOC cost function tends to infinity. By incorporating a tunable terminal penalty coefficient, UniDB achieves an optimal balance between control costs and terminal penalties, substantially improving detail preservation and output quality. Notably, UniDB seamlessly integrates with existing diffusion bridge models, requiring only minimal code modifications. Extensive experiments across diverse image restoration tasks validate the superiority and adaptability of the proposed framework. Our code is available at https://github.com/UniDB-SOC/UniDB/.</description>
