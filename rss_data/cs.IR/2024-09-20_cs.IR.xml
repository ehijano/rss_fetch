      <title>Bundle Fragments into a Whole: Mining More Complete Clusters via Submodular Selection of Interesting webpages for Web Topic Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Organizing interesting webpages into hot topics is one of key steps to understand the trends of multimodal web data. A state-of-the-art solution is firstly to organize webpages into a large volume of multi-granularity topic candidates; hot topics are further identified by estimating their interestingness. However, these topic candidates contain a large number of fragments of hot topics due to both the inefficient feature representations and the unsupervised topic generation. This paper proposes a bundling-refining approach to mine more complete hot topics from fragments. Concretely, the bundling step organizes the fragment topics into coarse topics; next, the refining step proposes a submodular-based method to refine coarse topics in a scalable approach. The propose unconventional method is simple, yet powerful by leveraging submodular optimization, our approach outperforms the traditional ranking methods which involve the careful design and complex steps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach surpasses the state-of-the-art method (i.e., latent Poisson deconvolution Pang et al. (2016)) 20% accuracy and 10% one on two public data sets, respectively.</description>

      <title>A Deep Dive into Fairness, Bias, Threats, and Privacy in Recommender Systems: Insights and Future Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recommender systems are essential for personalizing digital experiences on e-commerce sites, streaming services, and social media platforms. While these systems are necessary for modern digital interactions, they face fairness, bias, threats, and privacy challenges. Bias in recommender systems can result in unfair treatment of specific users and item groups, and fairness concerns demand that recommendations be equitable for all users and items. These systems are also vulnerable to various threats that compromise reliability and security. Furthermore, privacy issues arise from the extensive use of personal data, making it crucial to have robust protection mechanisms to safeguard user information. This study explores fairness, bias, threats, and privacy in recommender systems. It examines how algorithmic decisions can unintentionally reinforce biases or marginalize specific user and item groups, emphasizing the need for fair recommendation strategies. The study also looks at the range of threats in the form of attacks that can undermine system integrity and discusses advanced privacy-preserving techniques. By addressing these critical areas, the study highlights current limitations and suggests future research directions to improve recommender systems' robustness, fairness, and privacy. Ultimately, this research aims to help develop more trustworthy and ethical recommender systems that better serve diverse user populations.</description>

      <title>When SparseMoE Meets Noisy Interactions: An Ensemble View on Denoising Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning user preferences from implicit feedback is one of the core challenges in recommendation. The difficulty lies in the potential noise within implicit feedback. Therefore, various denoising recommendation methods have been proposed recently. However, most of them overly rely on the hyperparameter configurations, inevitably leading to inadequacies in model adaptability and generalization performance. In this study, we propose a novel Adaptive Ensemble Learning (AEL) for denoising recommendation, which employs a sparse gating network as a brain, selecting suitable experts to synthesize appropriate denoising capacities for different data samples. To address the ensemble learning shortcoming of model complexity and ensure sub-recommender diversity, we also proposed a novel method that stacks components to create sub-recommenders instead of directly constructing them. Extensive experiments across various datasets demonstrate that AEL outperforms others in kinds of popular metrics, even in the presence of substantial and dynamic noise.

      <title>HLLM: Enhancing Sequential Recommendations via Hierarchical Large Language Models for Item and User Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in various fields, prompting several studies to explore their potential in recommendation systems. However, these attempts have so far resulted in only modest improvements over traditional recommendation models. Moreover, three critical questions remain under-explored: firstly, the real value of LLMs' pre-trained weights, often considered to encapsulate world knowledge; secondly, the necessity of fine-tuning for recommendation tasks; lastly, whether LLMs can exhibit the same scalability benefits in recommendation systems as they do in other domains. In this paper, we propose a novel Hierarchical Large Language Model (HLLM) architecture designed to enhance sequential recommendation systems. Our approach employs a two-tier model: the first Item LLM extracts rich content features from the detailed text description of the item, while the second User LLM utilizes these features to predict users' future interests based on their interaction history. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method effectively leverages the pre-trained capabilities of open-source LLMs, and further fine-tuning leads to significant performance boosts. Additionally, HLLM achieves excellent scalability, with the largest configuration utilizing 7B parameters for both item feature extraction and user interest modeling. Moreover, HLLM offers excellent training and serving efficiency, making it practical in real-world applications. Evaluations on two large-scale datasets, PixelRec and Amazon Reviews, show that HLLM achieves state-of-the-art results, outperforming traditional ID-based models by a wide margin. In online A/B testing, HLLM showcases notable gains, validating its practical impact in real-world recommendation scenarios. Codes are available at https://github.com/bytedance/HLLM.</description>

      <title>The Relevance of Item-Co-Exposure For Exposure Bias Mitigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Through exposing items to users, implicit feedback recommender systems influence the logged interactions, and, ultimately, their own recommendations. This effect is called exposure bias and it can lead to issues such as filter bubbles and echo chambers. Previous research employed the multinomial logit model (MNL) with exposure information to reduce exposure bias on synthetic data.
  This extended abstract summarizes our previous study in which we investigated whether (i) these findings hold for human-generated choices, (ii) other discrete choice models mitigate bias better, and (iii) an item's estimated relevance can depend on the relevances of the other items that were presented with it. We collected a data set of biased and unbiased choices in a controlled online user study and measured the effects of overexposure and competition.
  We found that (i) the discrete choice models effectively mitigated exposure bias on human-generated choice data, (ii) there were no significant differences in robustness among the different discrete choice models, and (iii) only multivariate discrete choice models were robust to competition between items. We conclude that discrete choice models mitigate exposure bias effectively because they consider item-co-exposure. Moreover, exposing items alongside more or less popular items can bias future recommendations significantly and item exposure must be tracked for overcoming exposure bias. We consider our work vital for understanding what exposure bias it, how it forms, and how it can be mitigated.</description>

      <title>A Simple Model to Estimate Sharing Effects in Social Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12203v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Randomised Controlled Trials (RCTs) are the gold standard for estimating treatment effects across many fields of science. Technology companies have adopted A/B-testing methods as a modern RCT counterpart, where end-users are randomly assigned various system variants and user behaviour is tracked continuously. The objective is then to estimate the causal effect that the treatment variant would have on certain metrics of interest to the business.
  When the outcomes for randomisation units -- end-users in this case -- are not statistically independent, this obfuscates identifiability of treatment effects, and harms decision-makers' observability of the system. Social networks exemplify this, as they are designed to promote inter-user interactions. This interference by design notoriously complicates measurement of, e.g., the effects of sharing. In this work, we propose a simple Markov Decision Process (MDP)-based model describing user sharing behaviour in social networks. We derive an unbiased estimator for treatment effects under this model, and demonstrate through reproducible synthetic experiments that it outperforms existing methods by a significant margin.</description>

      <title>Familiarity-aware Evidence Compression for Retrieval Augmented Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) improves large language models (LMs) by incorporating non-parametric knowledge through evidence retrieval from external sources. However, it often struggles to filter out inconsistent and irrelevant information that can distract the LM from its tasks. While compressing the retrieved evidence with a compression model aims to address this issue, the compressed evidence may still be unfamiliar to the target model used for downstream task, potentially failing to utilize the evidence effectively. We propose FaviComp (Familiarity-aware Evidence Compression), a novel training-free evidence compression technique that makes retrieved evidence more familiar to the target model, while seamlessly integrating parametric knowledge from the model. Specifically, FaviComp proactively lowers the perplexity of the compressed evidence with regard to the target model by combining token probabilities from both the compression model and the target model to generate context that is more familiar to the target model. This approach balances the integration of parametric and non-parametric knowledge, which is especially helpful in complex tasks where the retrieved evidence set may not contain all the necessary information. Experimental results demonstrate that FaviComp consistently outperforms existing baselines in multiple open-domain QA datasets, achieving high compression rates and showcasing the effective integration of both parametric and non-parametric knowledge.</description>

      <title>Multi-View Adaptive Contrastive Learning for Information Retrieval Based Fault Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most studies focused on information retrieval-based techniques for fault localization, which built representations for bug reports and source code files and matched their semantic vectors through similarity measurement. However, such approaches often ignore some useful information that might help improve localization performance, such as 1) the interaction relationship between bug reports and source code files; 2) the similarity relationship between bug reports; and 3) the co-citation relationship between source code files. In this paper, we propose a novel approach named Multi-View Adaptive Contrastive Learning for Information Retrieval Fault Localization (MACL-IRFL) to learn the above-mentioned relationships for software fault localization. Specifically, we first generate data augmentations from report-code interaction view, report-report similarity view and code-code co-citation view separately, and adopt graph neural network to aggregate the information of bug reports or source code files from the three views in the embedding process. Moreover, we perform contrastive learning across these views. Our design of contrastive learning task will force the bug report representations to encode information shared by report-report and report-code views,and the source code file representations shared by code-code and report-code views, thereby alleviating the noise from auxiliary information. Finally, to evaluate the performance of our approach, we conduct extensive experiments on five open-source Java projects. The results show that our model can improve over the best baseline up to 28.93%, 25.57% and 20.35% on Accuracy@1, MAP and MRR, respectively.</description>

      <title>Exploring Large Language Models for Product Attribute Value Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Product attribute value identification (PAVI) involves automatically identifying attributes and their values from product information, enabling features like product search, recommendation, and comparison. Existing methods primarily rely on fine-tuning pre-trained language models, such as BART and T5, which require extensive task-specific training data and struggle to generalize to new attributes. This paper explores large language models (LLMs), such as LLaMA and Mistral, as data-efficient and robust alternatives for PAVI. We propose various strategies: comparing one-step and two-step prompt-based approaches in zero-shot settings and utilizing parametric and non-parametric knowledge through in-context learning examples. We also introduce a dense demonstration retriever based on a pre-trained T5 model and perform instruction fine-tuning to explicitly train LLMs on task-specific instructions. Extensive experiments on two product benchmarks show that our two-step approach significantly improves performance in zero-shot settings, and instruction fine-tuning further boosts performance when using training data, demonstrating the practical benefits of using LLMs for PAVI.</description>

      <title>MMSearch: Benchmarking the Potential of Large Models as Multi-modal Search Engines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has paved the way for AI search engines, e.g., SearchGPT, showcasing a new paradigm in human-internet interaction. However, most current AI search engines are limited to text-only settings, neglecting the multimodal user queries and the text-image interleaved nature of website information. Recently, Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have made impressive strides. Yet, whether they can function as AI search engines remains under-explored, leaving the potential of LMMs in multimodal search an open question. To this end, we first design a delicate pipeline, MMSearch-Engine, to empower any LMMs with multimodal search capabilities. On top of this, we introduce MMSearch, a comprehensive evaluation benchmark to assess the multimodal search performance of LMMs. The curated dataset contains 300 manually collected instances spanning 14 subfields, which involves no overlap with the current LMMs' training data, ensuring the correct answer can only be obtained within searching. By using MMSearch-Engine, the LMMs are evaluated by performing three individual tasks (requery, rerank, and summarization), and one challenging end-to-end task with a complete searching process. We conduct extensive experiments on closed-source and open-source LMMs. Among all tested models, GPT-4o with MMSearch-Engine achieves the best results, which surpasses the commercial product, Perplexity Pro, in the end-to-end task, demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed pipeline. We further present error analysis to unveil current LMMs still struggle to fully grasp the multimodal search tasks, and conduct ablation study to indicate the potential of scaling test-time computation for AI search engine. We hope MMSearch may provide unique insights to guide the future development of multimodal AI search engine. Project Page: https://mmsearch.github.io</description>

      <title>Empowering Sequential Recommendation from Collaborative Signals and Semantic Relatedness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07623v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sequential recommender systems (SRS) could capture dynamic user preferences by modeling historical behaviors ordered in time. Despite effectiveness, focusing only on the \textit{collaborative signals} from behaviors does not fully grasp user interests. It is also significant to model the \textit{semantic relatedness} reflected in content features, e.g., images and text. Towards that end, in this paper, we aim to enhance the SRS tasks by effectively unifying collaborative signals and semantic relatedness together. Notably, we empirically point out that it is nontrivial to achieve such a goal due to semantic gap issues. Thus, we propose an end-to-end two-stream architecture for sequential recommendation, named TSSR, to learn user preferences from ID-based and content-based sequence. Specifically, we first present novel hierarchical contrasting module, including coarse user-grained and fine item-grained terms, to align the representations of inter-modality. Furthermore, we also design a two-stream architecture to learn the dependence of intra-modality sequence and the complex interactions of inter-modality sequence, which can yield more expressive capacity in understanding user interests. We conduct extensive experiments on five public datasets. The experimental results show that the TSSR could yield superior performance than competitive baselines. We also make our experimental codes publicly available at https://github.com/Mingyue-Cheng/TSSR.</description>

      <title>LLM-Powered Text Simulation Attack Against ID-Free Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11690v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ID-free recommendation paradigm has been proposed to address the limitation that traditional recommender systems struggle to model cold-start users or items with new IDs. Despite its effectiveness, this study uncovers that ID-free recommender systems are vulnerable to the proposed Text Simulation attack (TextSimu) which aims to promote specific target items. As a novel type of text poisoning attack, TextSimu exploits large language models (LLM) to alter the textual information of target items by simulating the characteristics of popular items. It operates effectively in both black-box and white-box settings, utilizing two key components: a unified popularity extraction module, which captures the essential characteristics of popular items, and an N-persona consistency simulation strategy, which creates multiple personas to collaboratively synthesize refined promotional textual descriptions for target items by simulating the popular items. To withstand TextSimu-like attacks, we further explore the detection approach for identifying LLM-generated promotional text. Extensive experiments conducted on three datasets demonstrate that TextSimu poses a more significant threat than existing poisoning attacks, while our defense method can detect malicious text of target items generated by TextSimu. By identifying the vulnerability, we aim to advance the development of more robust ID-free recommender systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.09603v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Commercial organisations are holding and processing an ever-increasing amount of personal data. Policies and laws are continually changing to require these companies to be more transparent regarding the collection, storage, processing and sharing of this data. This paper reports our work of taking Booking.com as a case study to visualise personal data flows extracted from their privacy policy. By showcasing how the company shares its consumers' personal data, we raise questions and extend discussions on the challenges and limitations of using privacy policies to inform online users about the true scale and the landscape of personal data flows. This case study can inform us about future research on more data flow-oriented privacy policy analysis and on the construction of a more comprehensive ontology on personal data flows in complicated business ecosystems.</description>

Abstract: Deep neural networks have excelled in machine learning, particularly in vision tasks, however, they often suffer from catastrophic forgetting when learning new tasks sequentially. In this work, we introduce Cobweb4V, an alternative to traditional neural network approaches. Cobweb4V is a novel visual classification method that builds on Cobweb, a human like learning system that is inspired by the way humans incrementally learn new concepts over time. In this research, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation, showcasing Cobweb4Vs proficiency in learning visual concepts, requiring less data to achieve effective learning outcomes compared to traditional methods, maintaining stable performance over time, and achieving commendable asymptotic behavior, without catastrophic forgetting effects. These characteristics align with learning strategies in human cognition, positioning Cobweb4V as a promising alternative to neural network approaches.</description>

      <title>jina-embeddings-v3: Multilingual Embeddings With Task LoRA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10173v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce jina-embeddings-v3, a novel text embedding model with 570 million parameters, achieves state-of-the-art performance on multilingual data and long-context retrieval tasks, supporting context lengths of up to 8192 tokens. The model includes a set of task-specific Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) adapters to generate high-quality embeddings for query-document retrieval, clustering, classification, and text matching. Evaluation on the MTEB benchmark shows that jina-embeddings-v3 outperforms the latest proprietary embeddings from OpenAI and Cohere on English tasks, while achieving superior performance compared to multilingual-e5-large-instruct across all multilingual tasks. With a default output dimension of 1024, users can flexibly reduce the embedding dimensions to as low as 32 without compromising performance, enabled by Matryoshka Representation Learning.</description>

      <title>Skill matching at scale: freelancer-project alignment for efficient multilingual candidate retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12097v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Finding the perfect match between a job proposal and a set of freelancers is not an easy task to perform at scale, especially in multiple languages. In this paper, we propose a novel neural retriever architecture that tackles this problem in a multilingual setting. Our method encodes project descriptions and freelancer profiles by leveraging pre-trained multilingual language models. The latter are used as backbone for a custom transformer architecture that aims to keep the structure of the profiles and project. This model is trained with a contrastive loss on historical data. Thanks to several experiments, we show that this approach effectively captures skill matching similarity and facilitates efficient matching, outperforming traditional methods.</description>
