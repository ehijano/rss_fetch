      <title>Nucleon Short-Range Correlations and High-Momentum Dynamics: Implications on the Equation of State of Dense Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nucleon short-range correlations (SRCs) and their high-momentum tails (HMTs) encode key short-range dynamics in nuclei and dense matter. This review provides a concise overview of SRC features relevant to the Equation of State (EOS) of isospin-asymmetric nuclear matter. We summarize empirical and theoretical properties of the single-nucleon momentum distribution $n(k)$, emphasizing the role of the neutron--proton tensor force, the dominance of correlated np pairs, and the enhancement of minority-species HMTs. Links to nucleon effective E-masses, quasi-deuteron components, and orbital entanglement are briefly noted. We examine how SRC-induced HMTs modify kinetic and potential contributions to the EOS in both non-relativistic and relativistic frameworks, including the softening of the kinetic symmetry energy and departures from the isospin parabolic approximation of asymmetric nuclear EOS. Sensitivity to high-momentum components and generalizations to arbitrary dimensions are also highlighted. Implications for heavy-ion reactions are summarized, including effects on particle yields, collective flows, deeply sub-threshold particle production and hard photon emission, driven by modified initial nucleon momentum distributions and abundant high relative-momentum np pairs during the reaction. Finally, we outline SRC-HMT consequences for neutron-star matter, covering proton fractions, tidal deformabilities, $Z$-factors, cooling, and the core--crust transition, as well as possible connections to dark-matter interactions in dense environments.</description>

      <title>Exploring the QCD phase diagram through correlations and fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exploration of the Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) phase diagram is a central goal of relativistic heavy-ion collision experiments. This review focuses on the role of fluctuations and correlations as sensitive probes of the phase structure. We discuss theoretical advancements and experimental methodologies employed to map the QCD phase diagram, highlighting constraints derived from both lattice QCD calculations and existing experimental data. Key observables such as cumulants and factorial cumulants of conserved charges (e.g., net-proton, net-charge) are explored as promising signatures of phase transitions and the QCD critical point. We discuss how these quantities are measured experimentally and compared with theoretical predictions, addressing challenges and best practices for meaningful comparisons. Special attention is given to predictions and current experimental results at high baryon density, including recent findings from the STAR collaboration at RHIC. Finally, we identify open issues and future directions for fluctuation and correlation studies at lower collision energies, relevant for future measurements, for example by the CBM experiment.</description>

      <title>A Quarkyonic Quark-Meson Coupling Model for Nuclear and Neutron Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We unite the dual quarkyonic model with the quark-meson coupling (QMC) model to construct a novel nuclear model based on the quark degrees of freedom, which can cover a wide range of nuclear density from low density to the crossover region. In the model, the relativistic, gaussian quark wavefunction is used to describe the nucleon structure. We first evaluate the energy density, chemical potential, pressure and sound velocity within the ideal Fermi gas picture. In this case, those physical quantities are discontinuous or divergent at the quark saturation density, where quarkyonic phase emerges. To remove such singular behavior, we next introduce an infrared regulator, and combine the dual quarkyonic model and the QMC model to include the nuclear interaction -- we call it the quarkyonic quark-meson coupling (QQMC) model. We then find that the quark saturation density depends strongly on the nucleon size. For example, when $r_p = 0.6\, (0.8)$ fm, where $r_p$ is the root-mean-square radius of proton, the quark saturation density is about $3.6\,(1.5) \times \rho_0$ in symmetric nuclear matter, where $\rho_0$ is the nuclear saturation density. It is notable that the nuclear interaction is quite important to consider physical quantities quantitatively. In fact, the QQMC model can produce the sound velocity which is consistent with that inferred from the observed data of several neutron stars. Furthermore, pressure in symmetric or pure neutron matter deduced from the experiments of heavy-ion collisions at high energy can be explained by the QQMC model as well. We discuss in detail the formulation for the QQMC model and the physical quantities calculated by the model.</description>

      <title>Complex-energy eigenvector continuation for nuclear many-body broad resonances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Broad resonances are a unique phenomenon in nuclear many-body systems. Theoretical studies usually involve the continuum degree of freedom, which drastically increases the model space of calculations, and may lead to non-convergence or instability of computations. In this paper, we present the extension of the eigenvector continuation (EC) method to the complex-energy space to treat the broad resonances of open quantum systems of nuclei. EC provides an efficient method to predict the solution of a large-space many-body problem within a small subspace. Using only a few bound and narrow resonance solutions as input in EC, we can obtain the solution of a broad resonance. We have applied the complex-energy EC to the broad resonances of $^4$H, four-neutron $^4n$, $^6$He and $^7$He systems.</description>

      <title>Static Fission Properties of Even-Even Actinides within the Warsaw Macroscopic-Microscopic Model Using Fourier-over-Spheroid Parameterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A systematic study of fission barrier heights and static properties of even-even actinide nuclei from Th to Cf has been performed within the Warsaw macroscopic-microscopic model using the five-dimensional Fourier-over-Spheroid (FoS) shape parameterization. The use of a large deformation grid, containing about $1.3\times10^{8}$ points for each nucleus, allows for a refined and numerically complete exploration of the potential energy landscape without dividing the configuration space into subregions or applying interpolation. Barrier heights, extracted via the Immersion Water Flow method, show good agreement with empirical evaluations (including the new IAEA RIPL-4 dataset) with mean deviations below 1 MeV. Special attention is given to the long-debated third, hyperdeformed minimum. For Th isotopes, a shallow but distinct third well appears, whereas it's absent in heavier actinides (U, Pu).</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic and Transport properties of hot asymmetric nuclear matter within a chiral SU(3) model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the thermodynamic and transport properties in hot nuclear matter accounting for the medium modifications of the nucleons within a chiral SU(3) model including effects from isospin asymmetry. Using the relaxation time approximation, the transport coefficients of the shear viscosity and thermal conductivity are studied. The shear viscosity, $\eta$, calculated within the chiral SU(3) model is observed to be smaller than the values calculated for free nucleon gas, whereas the thermal conductivity $\kappa$ is appreciably larger as compared to the free nucleon gas. The shear viscosity coefficient to entropy density ratio, $\eta/s$, drops with increasing baryon density which becomes more pronounced at higher temperatures in the chiral SU(3) model as compared to the case of a free nucleon gas. The effect due to isospin asymmetry on the coefficient of shear viscosity turns out to be marginal. However, in the chiral SU(3) model, in presence of isospin asymmetry, the coefficient of thermal conductivity has an appreciably higher value as compared to the one for symmetric nuclear matter. The present study of the thermodynamic as well as transport properties in hot nuclear matter is of relevance for relativistic heavy-ion collisions with different initial isospin asymmetry, in particular for the compressed baryonic matter (CBM) experiment at the FAIR facility at GSI.</description>

      <title>Opacity estimation of OO collision from CoMBolt-ITA hybrid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the effect of system size on the applicability of the hydrodynamic description in heavy-ion physics remains unclear. Recent measurements of OO collisions at the LHC offer a new opportunity to refine our understanding of collectivity because of their intermediate size relative to heavy-ion and small-system collisions, as well as the relatively good control over their initial state. We use the CoMBolt-ITA hybrid model to describe recent OO measurements at the LHC. The model employs TrENTo for the initial state. A combination of the pre-equilibration and hydrodynamized medium stages is modeled consistently by CoMBolt-ITA, which evolves the Boltzmann distribution of massless collective excitations. The afterburner stage is included by employing UrQMD. Using this approach, we test whether the system lies in the regime where its spatial size approaches the mean free path, corresponding to low opacity, or in the opposite limit, where its size exceeds the mean free path sufficiently to enter the fluid-like evolution regime with high opacity. We find that, in light of the data-model comparison and considering the current status of the model, OO collisions with centralities larger than $60\%$ gradually leave the domain of fluid-like evolution.</description>

      <title>Nucleon to Roper transition amplitudes and electromagnetic form factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The second excitation of the nucleon, the Roper, has properties differentiated from other low-lying nucleon resonances. Their properties challenge our understanding of the structure of the baryons in terms of the degrees of freedom from QCD. In the present work we discuss the properties of the Roper resonance and the nucleon to Roper electromagnetic transition, based on the quark degrees of freedom, that are expected to dominate for large square momentum transfer $Q^2$. We also discuss the analytic structure of the transition amplitudes in the low-$Q^2$ region, and how the contributions of baryon-meson states can help to describe the low and intermediate $Q^2$ data, and the nature of the Roper.</description>

      <title>Internal superfluid response and torque evolution in the giant glitch of PSR J1718-3718</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the post-glitch rotational evolution of pulsars by analyzing the 2007 giant glitch of PSR J1718$-$3718 using a vortex creep model that incorporates both inward and outward nonlinear vortex motion, along with a time-varying external torque. A comprehensive fitting framework is developed, constrained by prior knowledge of moment of inertia participation from previous glitch studies. We apply a Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach to quantify uncertainties and parameter correlations. The model reproduces the observed timing data and yields physically consistent values for moment of inertia fractions and creep timescales. Our results indicate that inward creep and a long-term change in external torque dominate the observed increase in spin-down rate, pointing to structural changes within the star-likely triggered by a crustquake that initiated both vortex motion and a change in the moment of inertia. We estimate that the glitch involved approximately $2.4 \times 10^{12}$ inward-moving vortices and $\sim 142$ crustal plates with a typical size of $\sim 0.03$ km. This study demonstrates that detailed post-glitch modeling of sparse timing data can simultaneously constrain internal superfluid dynamics and external torque evolution, providing a quantitative framework to probe the structural properties of neutron star interiors.</description>

      <title>L\'evy sources in UrQMD in Ar+Sc collisions at SPS energies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.05019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the past few decades, progress in femtoscopy has been driven by the interplay between experimental measurements and theoretical calculations. Measurements provide data for the theory to understand it, while theoretical predictions guide new measurements. In the recent decade, several experiments have confirmed that the two-particle pion emitting source is well described by L\'evy alpha-stable distributions. To enable theoretical interpretation, phenomenological simulations have been done at RHIC and LHC energies, using various available heavy-ion collision models. In this paper, we investigate three-dimensional two-pion pair source distributions from $^{40}$Ar+$^{45}$Sc central collisions at SPS energies, generated with the Ultra-Relativistic Quantum Molecular Dynamics Monte-Carlo event generator. We fit the pair source with L\'evy-stable distributions, and discuss the extracted L\'evy parameters describing the spatial scale, shape and strength of the source.</description>

      <title>Investigating the competition between the deconfinement and chiral phase transitions in light of the multimessenger observations of neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05687v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend the parity doublet model for hadronic matter and study the possible presence of quark matter inside the cores of neutron stars with the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model. Considering the uncertainties of the QCD phase diagram and the location of the critical endpoint, we aim to explore the competition between the chiral phase transition and the deconfinement phase transition systematically, regulated by the vacuum pressure $-B$ in the NJL model. Employing a Maxwell construction, a sharp first-order deconfinement phase transition is implemented combining the parity doublet model for the hadronic phase and the NJL model for the high-energy quark phase. The position of the chiral phase transition is obtained from the NJL model self-consistently. We find stable neutron stars with a quark core within a specific parameter space that satisfies current astronomical observations. The observations suggest a relatively large chiral invariant mass $m_0=600$ MeV in the parity doublet model and a larger split between the chiral and deconfinement phase transitions while assuming the first-order deconfinement phase transition. The maximum mass of the hybrid star that we obtain is $\sim 2.2 M_{\odot}$.</description>

      <title>Ab Initio Calculations of the Carbon and Oxygen Isotopes: Energies, Correlations, and Superfluid Pairing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18722v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform \textit{ab initio} nuclear lattice calculations of the neutron-rich carbon and oxygen isotopes using high-fidelity chiral interactions. We find good agreement with the observed binding energies and compute correlations associated with each two-nucleon interaction channel. For the isospin $T=1$ channels, we show that the dependence on $T_z$ provides a measure of the correlations among the extra neutrons in the neutron-rich nuclei. For the spin-singlet S-wave channel, we observe that any paired neutron interacts with the nuclear core as well as its neutron pair partner, while any unpaired neutron interacts primarily with only the nuclear core. For the other partial waves, the correlations among the extra neutrons grow more slowly and smoothly with the number of neutrons. These general patterns are observed in both the carbon and oxygen isotopes and may be universal features that appear in many neutron-rich nuclei.</description>

      <title>Response of superfluid fermions at finite temperature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20751v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A consistent finite-temperature microscopic theory for the response of strongly coupled superfluid fermionic systems is formulated. We start from the general many-body Hamiltonian with the vacuum (bare) two-fermion interaction and derive the equation of motion (EOM) for the thermally averaged two-time two-fermion correlation function, which determines the spectrum of the system under study. The superfluidity is introduced via the Bogoliubov transformation of the fermionic field operators, and the entire formalism is carried out in the basis of Bogoliubov's quasiparticles, keeping the complete 4x4 block matrix structure of the two-fermion EOM. Fully correlated static and dynamical interaction kernels of the resulting EOM are discussed. A special focus is then placed on the latter kernel, which is advanced to a factorized form, enabling a minimal truncation of the many-body problem while keeping important effects of emergent collectivity and mapping to the quasiparticle-vibration coupling (qPVC). As in the zero-temperature and non-superfluid cases, the qPVC can be associated with a new order parameter, qPVC vertex. In the thermal superfluid theory, the latter vertex, as well as the components of the dynamical kernel, acquire an extended form including thermally unblocked transition amplitudes.</description>

      <title>Shape evolution in neutron-rich odd-even $^{105-109}$Nb isotopes</title>

Abstract: Neutron-rich nuclei around $Z\sim40$ exhibit multiple shape transitions. This region shows one of the sharpest transitions in the nuclear chart, from a spherical vibrator at $N=58$ to a strongly deformed prolate shape at $N=60$, with largest deformations seen for $_{38}$Sr and $_{40}$Zr. Below $Z=36$, a spherical-to-oblate transition is predicted, while above $Z=42$ and $N\ge60$, the shape evolves from axial to triaxial. Even-$Z$ nuclei have been well studied, but odd-$Z$ isotopes such as Nb offer additional insights into these mechanisms. The Nb isotopes lie at the boundary between axially deformed Zr and triaxially deformed Mo nuclei. This work explores the structure of neutron-rich Nb nuclei up to $N=68$, aiming to understand shape evolution with isospin and the onset of triaxiality. Two complementary fission experiments were used: (i) $^{238}$U+$^9$Be at GANIL in inverse kinematics with AGATA, EXOGAM, and VAMOS++, allowing prompt and delayed $\gamma$-ray spectroscopy with isotopic identification; (ii) spontaneous fission of $^{252}$Cf with the Gammasphere array providing high-fold $\gamma$-coincidence data. The level scheme of $^{105}$Nb was significantly extended with two new negative-parity bands. A revised scheme is proposed for $^{107}$Nb, differing from previous results, and new structures are reported in $^{109}$Nb. The signature splitting analysis indicates triaxial deformation for positive-parity bands, while negative-parity bands show axial symmetry, similar to Zr. This reveals a shape coexistence in neutron-rich Nb nuclei.</description>

      <title>PSR J0614-3329: A NICER case for Strange Quark Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02652v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Precise measurements of neutron star masses and radii by the NICER mission impose important constraints on the nuclear equation of state. The most recent NICER measurement of PSR J0614-3329 reported an equatorial radius of $R_{eq} = 10.29^{+1.01}_{-0.86}$ km for a mass of $M = 1.44^{+0.06}_{-0.07} M_{\odot}$. Considering all the NICER measurements to date, we find substantial evidence using Bayesian hypothesis ranking for strange quark stars over physically motivated models of neutron stars compatible with this low radius. This provides a strong case for quark matter in neutron stars and also for the possible existence of strange quark stars, a consequence of the Bodmer-Witten hypothesis, suggesting that they could be considered among the population of compact stars during analyses of astrophysical data. Using a wide sample of equations of state, we report the nucleonic equations of state that best fit current observations and rule out one model of strange quark matter.</description>

      <title>Extraction of neutron-capture cross sections on $^{92}$Zr using the charge-exchange Oslo method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09776v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The $^{93}$Nb($t$,$^{3}$He) reaction at 115 MeV/u was studied to demonstrate that nuclear level densities and $\gamma$-ray strength functions can be extracted from charge-exchange reactions at intermediate energies using the Oslo technique. The matrix of excitation energy in $^{93}$Zr, reconstructed from the ($t$,$^{3}$He) reaction, versus the energy of $\gamma$ rays emitted by the excited $^{93}$Zr nuclei, was obtained in an experiment with the S800 Spectrograph operated in coincidence with the GRETINA $\gamma$-ray detector. The extracted level density and $\gamma$-ray strength function obtained by applying the Oslo method to this matrix were used to estimate the $^{92}$Zr($n$,$\gamma$)$^{93}$Zr cross section by combining the new results with other experimental data and theoretical calculations for $E$1 and $M$1 strength functions at higher energies. Good agreement with direct measurements of the $^{92}$Zr($n$,$\gamma$)$^{93}$Zr cross section was found. The contribution from the upbend in the extracted $\gamma$-ray strength function was important to achieve the consistency as the neutron-capture cross section without this contribution is significantly below the direct measurements otherwise. Since charge-exchange reactions at intermediate energies have long been used for extracting Gamow-Teller strengths, the successful demonstration of the charge-exchange Oslo method enables experiments in which ($n$,$\gamma$) cross sections and Gamow-Teller strengths can be measured simultaneously, which is of benefit for astrophysical studies.</description>

      <title>A family of three maximally symmetric boost-invariant flows in relativistic hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10769v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I discuss the constructions of boost-invariant dissipative conformal hydrodynamic flows by elaborating on the geometric procedure by Gubser and Yarom, which starts from a static, maximally symmetric flow on dS$_3\times\mathbb{R}$. Three foliations of dS$_3$ preserve three-dimensional non-Abelian isometry groups, namely, the flat ISO(2)-invariant, the spherical (closed) SO(3)-invariant, and the hyperbolic (open) SO(2,1)-invariant slicings. I show that the fluids that preserve these symmetries, after they have been Weyl transformed to flat spacetime, give rise to three physically distinct and boost-invariant solutions of the relativistic dissipative Navier-Stokes equations: the well-known and widely studied Bjorken and Gubser flows, and a seemingly thus far unexplored solution that arises from the hyperbolic slicing of dS$_3$. The new solution combines the radial expansion characteristic of the Gubser flow with the late-proper-time applicability of Bjorken's solution, and features a finite, radially bounded droplet whose expanding edge resembles a free-streaming shockwave.</description>

      <title>The color force acting on a quark in the pion and nucleon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09019v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the Operator Product Expansion (OPE) of hard scattering amplitudes, the twist-3 operators describe local colored Lorentz forces acting on a quark, thereby providing a measure of the strength of the gluon fields. Its value is directly accessible from the nucleon twist-3 polarized $g_2$-parton distribution function. In the semiclassical (instanton-based) QCD vacuum models, the leading non-perturbative contribution stems from correlated instanton-anti-instanton pairs, or molecules. We analyze the magnitude of the color force on a 'struck' quark in light hadrons (pion and nucleon), in the context of the instanton liquid model (ILM). We derive explicitly the pertinent form factors associated to the color Lorenz force, and show that they are intimately related to the pertinent hadronic gravitational and transversity form factors. Using the ILM enhanced by molecules, we detail the ensuing colored force distribution in the transverse plane for luminal pions and nucleons. The results for the nucleons are in good agreement with those reported recently from a lattice collaboration.</description>
