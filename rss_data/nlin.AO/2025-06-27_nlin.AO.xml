      <title>The Devil's Dung? Money as a mechanism of generalized reciprocity in human societies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20691v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: St. Francis of Assisi (1181/82-1226) famously called money the devil's dung, and indeed money is often associated with greed, inequality, and corruption. Drawing on Nowak's five rules for the evolution of cooperation, we argue here that money promotes the formation of circuits of generalized reciprocity across human groups that are fundamental to social evolution. In an evolutionary tournament, we show that money exchange is an evolutionary stable strategy that promotes cooperation without relying on the cognitive demands of direct reciprocity or reputation mechanisms. However, we also find that excessive liquidity can be detrimental because it can distort the informational value of money as a signal of past cooperation, making defection more profitable. Our results suggest that, in addition to institutions that promoted trust and punishment, the emergence of institutions that regulated the money supply was key to maintaining generalized reciprocity within and across human groups.</description>

      <title>Influence and information in a collective of self-propelled particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20888v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While information-theoretic quantities, such as transfer entropy, have been widely adopted to infer causal relationships in collective systems, a critical gap exists: the absence of quantitative evidence directly linking information-theoretic quantities to a physically defined influence. This letter addresses this gap by proposing a modified Vicsek model that enables the calculation of a physically interpretable influence grounded in the angular interactions between particles. Averaged pairwise influences can serve as new order parameters to indicate collective phase transitions. We reveal quantitative relations between information, represented by transfer entropy, and average influence in pairwise and collective interactions. We test three typical methods of partial information decomposition and find that the method based on intrinsic mutual information gives the most appropriate interpretation. Overall, this work provides a model system for quantitative studies of influence and information in complex systems.</description>

      <title>Essential metrics for Life on graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a strong theoretical foundation that frames a well-defined family of outer-totalistic network automaton models as a topological generalisation of binary outer-totalistic cellular automata, of which the Game of Life is one notable particular case. These "Life-like network automata" are quantitatively described by expressing their genotype (the mean field curve and Derrida curve) and phenotype (the evolution of the state and defect averages). After demonstrating that the genotype and phenotype are correlated, we illustrate the utility of these essential metrics by tackling the firing squad synchronisation problem in a bottom-up fashion, with results that exceed a 90% success rate.</description>

      <title>Evolution of boundedly rational learning in games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: People make strategic decisions multiple times a day. We act strategically in negotiations, when we coordinate our actions with others, or when we choose with whom to cooperate. The resulting dynamics can be studied with evolutionary game theory. This framework explores how people adapt their decisions over time, in light of how effective their strategies have proven to be. A crucial quantity in respective models is the strength of selection. This quantity regulates how likely individuals switch to a better strategy when given the choice. The larger the selection strength, the more biased is the learning process in favor of strategies with large payoffs. Therefore, this quantity is often interpreted as a measure of rationality. Traditionally, most models take selection strength to be a fixed parameter. Instead, here we allow the individuals' strategies and their selection strength to co-evolve. The endpoints of this co-evolutionary process depend on the strategic interaction in place. In many prisoner's dilemmas, selection strength increases indefinitely, as one may expect. However, in snowdrift or stag-hunt games, it can either converge to a finite value, or we observe evolutionary branching altogether - such that different individuals arrive at different selection strengths. Overall, this work sheds light on how evolution might shape learning mechanisms for social behavior. It suggests that boundedly rational learning is not only a by-product of cognitive constraints. Instead it might also evolve as a means to gain strategic advantages.</description>

      <title>Properties of Hagen-Poiseuille flow in channel networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.19185v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive the main properties of adaptive Hagen-Poiseuille flows in elastic microchannel networks similar to biological veins found in organisms. We demonstrate that adaptive Hagen-Poiseuille flows effectively simulate key features of \textit{Physarum polycephalum} networks, replicating physiological out-of-equilibrium phenomena such as peristalsis and shuttle streaming, which are associated with the mechanism of nutrient transport in \textit{Physarum}. A new topological steady state has been identified for asynchronous adaptation, supporting out-of-equilibrium laminar fluxes. Adaptive Hagen-Poiseuille flows exhibit saturation effects on the fluxes in contractile veins, as observed in both animal and artificial contractile veins. These results suggest that the non-equilibrium effects observed in \textit{Physarum} have a hydrodynamic origin</description>
