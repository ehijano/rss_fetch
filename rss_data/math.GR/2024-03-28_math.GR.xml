      <title>Effective codescent morphisms of $n$-quasigroups and $n$-loops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective codescent morphisms of $n$-quasigroups and of $n$-loops are characterized. To this end, it is proved that, for any $n\geq 1$, every codescent morphism of $n$-quasigroups (resp. $n$-loops) is effective. This statement generalizes our earlier results on qusigroups and loops. Moreover, it is shown that the elements of the amalgamated free products of $n$-quasigroups (resp. $n$-loops) have unique normal forms, and that the varieties of $n$-quasigroups and $n$-loops satisfy the strong amalgamation property. The latter two statements generalize the corresponding old results on quasigroups and loops by Evans.</description>

      <title>Polyadic sigma matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generalize $\sigma$-matrices to higher arities using the polyadization procedure proposed by the author. We build the nonderived $n$-ary version of $SU\left( 2\right) $ using cyclic shift block matrices. We define a new function, the polyadic trace, which has an additivity property analogous to the ordinary trace for block diagonal matrices and which can be used to build the corresponding invariants. The elementary $\Sigma$-matrices introduced here play a role similar to ordinary matrix units, and their sums are full $\Sigma$-matrices which can be treated as a polyadic analog of $\sigma$-matrices. The presentation of $n$-ary $SU\left( 2\right) $ in terms of full $\Sigma$-matrices is done using the Hadamard product. We then generalize the Pauli group in two ways: for the binary case we introduce the extended phase shifted $\sigma$-matrices with multipliers in cyclic groups of order $4q$ ($q&gt;4$), and for the polyadic case we construct the correspondent finite $n$-ary semigroup of phase-shifted elementary $\Sigma$-matrices of order $4q\left( n-1\right) +1$, and the finite $n$-ary group of phase-shifted full $\Sigma$-matrices of order $4q$. Finally, we introduce the finite $n$-ary group of heterogeneous full $\mathit{\Sigma}^{het}$-matrices of order $\left( 4q\left( n-1\right) \right) ^{4}$. Some examples of the lowest arities are presented.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.16446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.16446v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study Measurable Imbeddability between groups, which is an order-like generalization of Measure Equivalence that allows the imbedded group to have an infinite measure fundamental domain. We prove if $\Lambda_1$ measurably imbeds into $\Gamma_1$, and $\Lambda_2$ measurably imbeds into $\Gamma_2$ under an additional assumption that lets the corresponding fundamental domains to be arranged in a special way, then $\Lambda_1 * \Lambda_2$ measurably imbeds into $\Gamma_1 * \Gamma_2$. Building upon the techniques we used, we show that the analogous result holds for graph products of groups.</description>

      <title>The Burnside problem for odd exponents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.15997v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the free Burnside groups $B(m,n)$ are infinite for $m\geq 2$ and odd $n\geq 557$, the best currently known lower bound for the exponent. The proof uses iterated small cancellation theory where the induction is based on the nesting depth of relators. The main instrument at every step is a new concept of a certification sequence.</description>

Abstract: We provide a version of Quillen's homological stability criterion for continuous bounded cohomology. This criterion is exploited in the companion paper (arXiv:2201.03879) in order to derive new bounded cohomological stability results for various families of classical groups.</description>

      <title>Effective equation solving, constraints and growth in virtually abelian groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.00475v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study the satisfiability and solutions of group equations when combinatorial, algebraic and language-theoretic constraints are imposed on the solutions. We show that the solutions to equations with length, lexicographic order, abelianisation or context-free constraints added, can be effectively produced in finitely generated virtually abelian groups. Crucially, we translate each of the constraints above into a rational set in an effective way, and so reduce each problem to solving equations with rational constraints, which is decidable and well understood in virtually abelian groups. A byproduct of our results is that the growth series of a virtually abelian group, with respect to any generating set and any weight, is effectively computable. This series is known to be rational by a result of Benson, but his proof is non-constructive.</description>

      <title>Arithmetic trialitarian hyperbolic lattices are not LERF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.20611v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A group is LERF (locally extended residually finite) if all its finitely generated subgroups are separable. We prove that the trialitarian arithmetic lattices in $\mathbf{PSO}_{7,1}(\mathbb{R})$ are not LERF. This result, together with previous work by the third author, implies that all arithmetic lattices in $\mathbf{PO}_{n,1}(\mathbb{R})$, $n&gt;3$, are not LERF.</description>

      <title>Discrete subgroups of semisimple Lie groups, beyond lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16833v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Discrete subgroups of SL(2,R) are well understood, and classified by the geometry of the corresponding hyperbolic surfaces. Discrete subgroups of higher-rank semisimple Lie groups, such as SL(n,R) for n&gt;2, remain more mysterious. While lattices in this setting are rigid, there also exist more flexible, "thinner" discrete subgroups, which may have large and interesting deformation spaces, giving rise in particular to so-called higher Teichm\"uller theory. We survey recent progress in constructing and understanding such discrete subgroups from a geometric and dynamical viewpoint.</description>

      <title>Units of twisted group rings and their correlations to classical group rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.17220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.17220v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is centered around the classical problem of extracting properties of a finite group $G$ from the ring isomorphism class of its integral group ring $\mathbb{Z} G$. This problem is considered via describing the unit group $\mathcal{U}( \mathbb{Z} G)$ generically for a finite group. Since the $90's$ several well known generic constructions of units are known to generate a subgroup of finite index in $\mathcal{U}(\mathbb{Z } G)$ if $\mathbb{Q} G$ does not have so-called exceptional simple epimorphic images, e.g. $M_2 (\mathbb{Q})$. However it remained a major open problem to find a {\it generic} construction under the presence of the latter type of simple images. In this article we obtain such generic construction of units. Moreover, this new construction also exhibits new properties, such as providing generically free subgroups of large rank. As an application we answer positively for several classes of groups recent conjectures on the rank and the periodic elements of the abelianisation $\mathcal{U}(\mathbb{Z} G)^{ab}$. To obtain all this, we investigate the group ring $R \Gamma$ of an extension $\Gamma$ of some normal subgroup $N$ by a group $G$, over a domain $R$. More precisely, we obtain a direct sum decomposition of the (twisted) group algebra of $\Gamma$ over the fraction field $F$ of $R$ in terms of various twisted group rings of $G$ over finite extensions of $F$. Furthermore, concrete information on the kernel and cokernel of the associated projections is obtained. Along the way we also launch the investigations of the unit group of twisted group rings and of $\mathcal{U}( R\Gamma)$ via twisted group rings.</description>

      <title>Prym Representations of the Handlebody Group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.14095v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $S$ be an oriented, closed surface of genus $g.$ The mapping class group of $S$ is the group of orientation preserving homeomorphisms of $S$ modulo isotopy. In 1997, Looijenga introduced the Prym representations, which are virtual representations of the mapping class group that depend on a finite, abelian group. Let $V$ be a genus $g$ handlebody with boundary $S$. The handlebody group is the subgroup of those mapping classes of $S$ that extend over $V.$ The twist group is the subgroup of the handlebody group generated by twists about meridians. Here, we restrict the Prym representations to the handlebody group and further to the twist group. We determine the image of the representations in the cyclic case.</description>
