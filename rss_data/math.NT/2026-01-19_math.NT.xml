      <title>On Ramanujan's Continued Fractions of Orders Five, Ten, and Twenty and Associated Eisenstein Series Identities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Eisenstein series play an important role in the theory of modular forms and have profound connections with $q$-series identities, partition theory, and special functions. Likewise, Ramanujan's mock theta functions, originally introduced in his last letter to Hardy, have inspired generations of mathematicians to work on $q$-series and modular forms. In this work, we establish several new identities connecting Ramanujan's continued fractions of order twenty. By employing product representation for Jacobi's theta function $\theta_1$, we derive a family of new relations connecting the continued fractions of order twenty with continued fractions of order ten and Rogers-Ramanujan continued fraction. Further, by expressing Eisenstein series in terms of Lambert series and utilizing certain mock theta functions and their logarithmic derivatives, we obtain beautiful relations between Eisenstein series and theta functions of level twenty. Using Ramanujan's $_1 \psi_1$ summation formula, we establish Eisenstein series identities associated with the continued fractions of order twenty. These results extend earlier work on continued fractions of order 6, 12, and 16 and contribute to theory of $q$-series.</description>

      <title>Mixed incomplete character sums of rational functions with smooth moduli</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\chi=\chi_q$ be a primitive character mod $q$ and fix $\Delta&gt;0$. In 1989 Graham and Ringrose gave strong bounds on character sums $\sum_{M&lt;n\leq M+N} \chi(n)$ in intervals of length $N=q^\Delta$ whenever $q$ is squarefree and is sufficiently smooth. Here we show that the smoothness parameter can be taken to be $N^{1-\epsilon}$. We also discuss various generalizations and applications, obtaining best possible results in several aspects.</description>

Abstract: Let phi(n) denote the Euler totient function. We study the analytic part associated with the summatory function of sigma_1(n) and obtain explicit bounds under the Riemann Hypothesis. In particular, we establish an upper bound of order x^{delta'} exp((log x)/(log log x)), where delta' = max(1/2, delta).</description>

      <title>Deterministic methods for finding elements of large multiplicative order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the problem of rigorously and deterministically finding elements of large order in the multiplicative group of integers modulo a natural number $N$. Solving this problem is an essential step in several recent deterministic algorithms for factoring $N$, including the currently fastest ones. In 2018, the second author gave an algorithm that for a given target order $D \geq N^{2/5}$, finds either an element of order exceeding $D$, or a nontrivial divisor of $N$, or proves that $N$ is prime. The running time was \[ O\left(\frac{D^{1/2}}{(\log \log D)^{1/2}} \log^2 N \right) \] bit operations, asymptotically the same as the cost of computing the order of a single element using Sutherland's optimisation of the classical babystep-giantstep method. Subsequent work by several authors weakened the hypothesis $D \geq N^{2/5}$ to $D \geq N^{1/6}$. In this paper, we show that the hypothesis may be dropped altogether. Moreover, if $N$ is prime, we can guarantee returning an element of order exceeding $D$, rather than a proof that $N$ is prime.</description>

      <title>Theta operators on Hodge type Shimura varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a new family of mod $p$ weight shifting differential operators on Hodge type Shimura varieties at hyperspecial level. First we construct basic theta operators, labelled by positive roots, that generalize Katz's theta operator for modular forms. Secondly we construct theta linkage maps, these are operators between automorphic vector bundles with linked weights, which can be thought of as generalizations of the classical theta cycle of Tate--Jochnowitz. In particular, there exist such maps within the $p$-restricted region, whose weight shifts are directly related to the conjectures of Herzig on the weight part of Serre's conjecture. We explain the relation between the two operators, and we prove some properties about them, e.g., the injectivity of some of them in a generic locus of the $p$-restricted region. As an application, we produce an example of a generic entailment of Serre weights for the groups $GL_{4,\mathbb{Q}_p}$ and $U(4)_{\mathbb{Q}_p}$, by combining the method of arxiv:2410.09602 with our stronger results about theta operators.</description>

      <title>A de Rham weight part of Serre's conjecture and generalized mod $p$ BGG decompositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose the use of de Rham cohomology of special fibers of Shimura varieties to formulate a geometric version of
  the weight part of Serre's conjecture. We conjecture that this formulation is equivalent to the one using Serre weights and the \'etale cohomology of Shimura varieties.
  We prove this equivalence for generic weights and generic non-Eisenstein eigensystems for a compact $U(2,1)$ Shimura variety such that $G_{\mathbb{Q}_p}=GL_3$. We do this by proving
  a generic concentration in middle degree of mod $p$ de Rham cohomology with coefficients.
  In turn, we prove this generic concentration by constructing generalized mod $p$ BGG decompositions for de Rham cohomology. After applying the results
  from our companion paper, this reduces to computing some BGG-like resolutions
  in a certain mod $p$ version of category $\mathcal{O}$, which is the main content
  of the article.
  In the $GSp_4$ case we also compute some explicit BGG decompositions, and assuming the generic concentration in middle degree of de Rham cohomology
  we obtain an improvement on the main result of arxiv:2410.09602.</description>

      <title>On the Landen formula for multiple polylogarithms and its $\ell$-adic Galois analogue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present paper, we provide an algebraic and geometric proof of the Landen formula for complex multiple polylogarithms originally established by Okuda and Ueno. Our approach employs a chain rule of complex KZ solutions arising from the symmetry $z \mapsto \frac{z}{z-1}$ of $\mathbb{P}^1 \backslash \{0,1,\infty\}$. Furthermore, by replacing complex KZ solutions with $\ell$-adic Galois 1-cocycles in this proof, we obtain the Landen formula for $\ell$-adic Galois multiple polylogarithms. This formula involves lower weight terms specific to the $\ell$-adic Galois setting, which originate from the higher-order terms of the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff sum ${\rm log}({\rm exp}(-e_1){\rm exp}(-e_0))$. These lower weight terms are explicitly described by an integral involving Goldberg polynomials.</description>

      <title>From ABC to Effective Roth and Ridout Constants for Cubic Roots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Enrico Bombieri showed conditionally (1994) that the ABC conjecture implies Roth's theorem, and Van Frankenhuysen (1999) later provided a complete proof. Building on Bombieri's and Van der Poorten's explicit formula for continued-fraction coefficients of algebraic numbers (specialized to cubic roots) we derive an effective bound for a Roth-type constant assuming an effective form of ABC. Roth's original argument establishes existence but does not yield an explicit value; our approach makes the dependence on the ABC parameters explicit and also gives an explicit bound in the corresponding special case of Ridout's theorem. We then introduce the notion of approximation gain as a refinement of the quality of an abc-triple. For c in a large computational range, the approximation gain remains below a strikingly small threshold, motivating the conjecture that the approximation gain is always smaller than 1.5. This suggests a potential strategy for attacking ABC by bounding approximation gain and power gain separately.</description>

Abstract: We establish power saving asymptotics for the sum of the divisor function along a binary quartic form, improving on work of Daniel. The proof involves an application of a recent two dimensional delta method due to Li, Rydin-Myerson, and Vishe and an exploitation of $\GL_2 $ automorphic forms arising from the factorization of varying cubic Dedekind zeta functions.</description>

      <title>Algorithmic aspects of Newman polynomials and their divisors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of determining which integer polynomials divide Newman polynomials. In this vein, we first give results concerning the $8438$ known polynomials with Mahler measure less than $1.3$. We then exhibit a list of polynomials that divide no Newman polynomial. In particular, we show that a degree-10 polynomial of Mahler measure \text{approximately} 1.419404632 divides no Newman polynomial, thereby improving the best known upper bound for any universal constant $\sigma$, if it exists, such that every integer polynomial of Mahler measure less than $\sigma$ divides a Newman polynomial. Finally, letting $l(x)$ denote Lehmer's polynomial, we explicitly construct Newman polynomials divisible by $l(x)^2$ with degrees up to $150$, and show that no Newman polynomial is divisible by $l(x)^3$ up to degree $160$.</description>

Abstract: Let $G$ be a locally compact abelian group with Haar measure $\mu$. For integers $n \geq 2$ and $H \geq 2$ and for any $n$-tuples $\mathbf{u}_1,\ldots, \mathbf{u}_H \in \mathbf{N}^n$, there exist measurable subsets $A_1,\ldots, A_n$ of $G$ such that the $n$-tuple $\left( \mu(hA_1),\ldots, \mu(hA_n) \right)$ has the same relative order as the $n$-tuple $\mathbf{u}_h$ for all $h = 1,\ldots, H$.
  For integers $m_{i,h}$ for $i =1,\ldots, n-1$ and $h = 1,\ldots, H$, there are Lebesgue measurable sets $A_1,\ldots, A_n$ in $\mathbf{R}$ such that $\mu(hA_{i+1}) - \mu(hA_i) = m_{i,h}$ for all $i$ and $h$.</description>

Abstract: Let $R$ be a finite local ring. We prove a quantitative universality statement for the cokernel of random matrices with i.i.d. entries valued in $R$. Rather than use the moment method, we use the Lindeberg replacement technique. This approach also yields a universality result for several invariants that are finer than the cokernel, such as the span and the determinant.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09602v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a new family of mod $p$ weight shifting differential operators on the Siegel threefold. In particular, we construct one operator which generalizes the classical theta cycle, whose weight shift allows for maps between $p$-restricted weights, and which is generically injective on global sections. As an application we produce a generic entailment of Serre weights, i.e. any Hecke eigenform which is modular for a generic Serre weight in the lowest alcove is also modular for a Serre weight in one of the upper alcoves. The entailed Serre weight corresponds to a shadow weight of the lowest alcove Serre weight,
  in Herzig's conjectural description of $W(\overline{\rho})$.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study $C(x, y)$, the second moment of Ramanujan sums. Assuming the Riemann Hypothesis(RH), we establish an asymptotic formula for $C(x, y)$ with improved error term. Our analysis applies uniformly to the case where $x$ and $y$ are arbitrary close, and in particular allows for a meaningful conparison with the work of \cite{TH} in case $y=2x^2$, while keeping the computational complexity low. The method relies on the use of smooth cutoff functions, which provide greater flexibility in contour shifting.</description>

      <title>Small solutions of ternary quadratic congruences with averaging over the moduli</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16980v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a recent paper, we proved that for any large enough odd modulus $q\in \mathbb{N}$ and fixed $\alpha_2\in \mathbb{N}$ coprime to $q$, the congruence \[ x_1^2+\alpha_2x_2^2+\alpha_3x_3^2\equiv 0 \bmod{q} \] has a solution of $(x_1,x_2,x_3)\in \mathbb{Z}^3$ with $x_3$ coprime to $q$ of height $\max\{|x_1|,|x_2|,|x_3|\}\le q^{11/24+\varepsilon}$ for, in a sense, almost all $\alpha_3$, where $\alpha_3$ runs over the reduced residue classes modulo $q$. Here it was of significance that $11/24&lt;1/2$, so we broke a natural barrier. In this paper, we average the moduli $q$ in addition, establishing the existence of a solution of height $\le Q^{3/8+\varepsilon}\alpha_2^{\varepsilon}$ for almost all pairs $(q,\alpha_3)$, with $Q$ large enough, $Q&lt;q\le 2Q$, $q$ coprime to $2\alpha_2$ and $\alpha_3$ running over the reduced residue classes modulo $q$.</description>

      <title>A Weyl equidistribution theorem over function fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18789v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A classical theorem of Weyl states that any polynomial with an irrational coefficient other than the constant term is uniformly distributed mod 1. We prove a new function field analogue of this statement, confirming a conjecture of L\^{e}, Liu, and Wooley.</description>

      <title>Seifert surfaces in the four-ball and composition of binary quadratic forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17746v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use composition of binary quadratic forms to systematically create pairs of Seifert surfaces that are non-isotopic in the four-ball. Our main topological result employs Gauss composition to classify the pairs of binary quadratic forms that arise as the Seifert forms of pairs of disjoint Seifert surfaces of genus one. The main ingredient of the proof is number-theoretic and of independent interest. It establishes a new connection between the Bhargava cube and the geometric approach to Gauss composition via planes in the space of two-by-two matrices. In particular, we obtain a geometric recipe that given any two binary quadratic forms finds a Bhargava cube that gives rise to their composition.</description>

      <title>A non-abelian version of Deligne's Fixed Part Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13910v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We formulate and prove a non-abelian analog of Deligne's Fixed Part theorem on Hodge classes, revisiting previous work of Jost--Zuo, Katzarkov--Pantev and Landesman--Litt. To this aim we study algebraically isomonodromic extensions of local systems and we relate them to variations of Hodge structures, for example we show that the Mumford-Tate group at a generic point stays constant in an algebraically isomonodromic extension of a variation of Hodge structure. v2: a few typos ironed and Thm 1.1 5) completed. v3: there was a Schlamassel leading to a mix-up of files. Apologies. Else identical version (one minor change). v5 final version. Appears in Alg. Geom.</description>

      <title>Forbidden Sidon subsets of perfect difference sets, featuring a human-assisted proof</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19804v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We resolve a $1000 Erd\H{o}s prize problem, complete with formal verification generated by a large language model.
  In over a dozen papers, beginning in 1976 and spanning two decades, Paul Erd\H{o}s repeatedly posed one of his "favourite" conjectures: every finite Sidon set can be extended to a finite perfect difference set. We establish that {1, 2, 4, 8, 13} is a counterexample to this conjecture.
  During the preparation of this paper, we discovered that although this problem was presumed to be open for half a century, Marshall Hall, Jr. published a different counterexample three decades before Erd\H{o}s first posed the problem. With a healthy skepticism of this apparent oversight, and out of an abundance of caution, we used ChatGPT to vibe code a Lean proof of both Hall's and our counterexamples.</description>
