      <title>Stochastic Volatility Modelling with LSTM Networks: A Hybrid Approach for S&amp;P 500 Index Volatility Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate volatility forecasting is essential in banking, investment, and risk management, because expectations about future market movements directly influence current decisions. This study proposes a hybrid modelling framework that integrates a Stochastic Volatility model with a Long Short Term Memory neural network. The SV model improves statistical precision and captures latent volatility dynamics, especially in response to unforeseen events, while the LSTM network enhances the model's ability to detect complex nonlinear patterns in financial time series. The forecasting is conducted using daily data from the S and P 500 index, covering the period from January 1 1998 to December 31 2024. A rolling window approach is employed to train the model and generate one step ahead volatility forecasts. The performance of the hybrid SV-LSTM model is evaluated through both statistical testing and investment simulations. The results show that the hybrid approach outperforms both the standalone SV and LSTM models and contributes to the development of volatility modelling techniques, providing a foundation for improving risk assessment and strategic investment planning in the context of the S and P 500.</description>

      <title>Interpretable Hypothesis-Driven Trading:A Rigorous Walk-Forward Validation Framework for Market Microstructure Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a rigorous walk-forward validation framework for algorithmic trading designed to mitigate overfitting and lookahead bias. Our methodology combines interpretable hypothesis-driven signal generation with reinforcement learning and strict out-of-sample testing. The framework enforces strict information set discipline, employs rolling window validation across 34 independent test periods, maintains complete interpretability through natural language hypothesis explanations, and incorporates realistic transaction costs and position constraints. Validating five market microstructure patterns across 100 US equities from 2015 to 2024, the system yields modest annualized returns (0.55%, Sharpe ratio 0.33) with exceptional downside protection (maximum drawdown -2.76%) and market-neutral characteristics (beta = 0.058). Performance exhibits strong regime dependence, generating positive returns during high-volatility periods (0.60% quarterly, 2020-2024) while underperforming in stable markets (-0.16%, 2015-2019). We report statistically insignificant aggregate results (p-value 0.34) to demonstrate a reproducible, honest validation protocol that prioritizes interpretability and extends naturally to advanced hypothesis generators, including large language models. The key empirical finding reveals that daily OHLCV-based microstructure signals require elevated information arrival and trading activity to function effectively. The framework provides complete mathematical specifications and open-source implementation, establishing a template for rigorous trading system evaluation that addresses the reproducibility crisis in quantitative finance research. For researchers, practitioners, and regulators, this work demonstrates that interpretable algorithmic trading strategies can be rigorously validated without sacrificing transparency or regulatory compliance.</description>

      <title>Strict universality of the square-root law in price impact across stocks: a complete survey of the Tokyo stock exchange</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13965v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Universal power laws have been scrutinised in physics and beyond, and a long-standing debate exists in econophysics regarding the strict universality of the nonlinear price impact, commonly referred to as the square-root law (SRL). The SRL posits that the average price impact $I$ follows a power law with respect to transaction volume $Q$, such that $I(Q) \propto Q^{\delta}$ with $\delta \approx 1/2$. Some researchers argue that the exponent $\delta$ should be system-specific, without universality. Conversely, others contend that $\delta$ should be exactly $1/2$ for all stocks across all countries, implying universality. However, resolving this debate requires high-precision measurements of $\delta$ with errors of around $0.1$ across hundreds of stocks, which has been extremely challenging due to the scarcity of large microscopic datasets -- those that enable tracking the trading behaviour of all individual accounts. Here we conclusively support the universality hypothesis of the SRL by a complete survey of all trading accounts for all liquid stocks on the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE) over eight years. Using this comprehensive microscopic dataset, we show that the exponent $\delta$ is equal to $1/2$ within statistical errors at both the individual stock level and the individual trader level. Additionally, we rejected two prominent models supporting the nonuniversality hypothesis: the Gabaix-Gopikrishnan-Plerou-Stanley and the Farmer-Gerig-Lillo-Waelbroeck models (Nature 2003, QJE 2006, and Quant. Finance 2013). Our work provides exceptionally high-precision evidence for the universality hypothesis in social science and could prove useful in evaluating the price impact by large investors -- an important topic even among practitioners.</description>
