      <title>SPH-Net: A Co-Attention Hybrid Model for Accurate Stock Price Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prediction of stock price movements presents a formidable challenge in financial analytics due to the inherent volatility, non-stationarity, and nonlinear characteristics of market data. This paper introduces SPH-Net (Stock Price Prediction Hybrid Neural Network), an innovative deep learning framework designed to enhance the accuracy of time series forecasting in financial markets. The proposed architecture employs a novel co-attention mechanism that initially processes temporal patterns through a Vision Transformer, followed by refined feature extraction via an attention mechanism, thereby capturing both global and local dependencies in market data. To rigorously evaluate the model's performance, we conduct comprehensive experiments on eight diverse stock datasets: AMD, Ebay, Facebook, FirstService Corp, Tesla, Google, Mondi ADR, and Matador Resources. Each dataset is standardized using six fundamental market indicators: Open, High, Low, Close, Adjusted Close, and Volume, representing a complete set of features for comprehensive market analysis. Experimental results demonstrate that SPH-Net consistently outperforms existing stock prediction models across all evaluation metrics. The model's superior performance stems from its ability to effectively capture complex temporal patterns while maintaining robustness against market noise. By significantly improving prediction accuracy in financial time series analysis, SPH-Net provides valuable decision-support capabilities for investors and financial analysts, potentially enabling more informed investment strategies and risk assessment in volatile market conditions.</description>

      <title>A Memory Efficient Adjoint Method to Enable Billion Parameter Optimization on a Single GPU in Dynamic Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic optimization is currently limited by sensitivity computations that require information from full forward and adjoint wave fields. Since the forward and adjoint solutions are computed in opposing time directions, the forward solution must be stored. This requires a substantial amount of memory for large-scale problems even when using check pointing or data compression techniques. As a result, the problem size is memory bound rather than bound by wall clock time, when working with modern GPU-based implementations that have limited memory capacity. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a new approach for approximate sensitivity computation based on the adjoint method (for self-adjoint problems) that relies on the principle of superposition. The approximation allows an iterative computation of the sensitivity, reducing the memory burden to that of the solution at a small number of time steps, i.e., to the number of degrees of freedom. This enables sensitivity computations for problems with billions of degrees of freedom on current GPUs, such as the A100 from NVIDIA (from 2020). We demonstrate the approach on full waveform inversion and transient acoustic topology optimization problems, relying on a highly efficient finite difference forward solver implemented in CUDA. Phenomena such as damping cannot be considered, as the approximation technique is limited to self-adjoint problems.</description>

      <title>A CARLA-based Simulation of Electrically Driven Forklifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the simulation of the operation of an electric forklift fleet within an intralogistics scenario. For this purpose, the open source simulation tool CARLA is used; according to our knowledge this is a novel approach in the context of logistics simulation. First, CARLA is used to generate and visualize a realistic 3D outdoor warehouse scenario, incorporating a number of randomly moving forklifts. In a next step, intralogistics transport tasks, such as pick-and-place, are simulated for the forklift fleet, including shortest-path finding. Furthermore, the capability to play back localization data, previously recorded from a ''real'' forklift fleet, is demonstrated.This play back is done in the original recreated environment, thereby enabling the visualization of the forklifts movements. Finally, the energy consumption of the forklift trucks is simulated by integrating a physical battery model that generates the state of charge (SOC) of each truck as a function of load and activity. To demonstrate the wide range of possible applications for the CARLA simulation platform, we describe two use cases. The first deals with the problem of detecting regions with critically high traffic densities, the second with optimal placement of charging stations for the forklift trucks. Both use cases are calculated for an exemplary warehouse model.</description>

      <title>Optimal Experimental Design of a Moving Sensor for Linear Bayesian Inverse Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We optimize the path of a mobile sensor to minimize the posterior uncertainty of a Bayesian inverse problem. Along its path, the sensor continuously takes measurements of the state, which is a physical quantity modeled as the solution of a partial differential equation (PDE) with uncertain parameters. Considering linear PDEs specifically, we derive the closed-form expression of the posterior covariance matrix of the model parameters as a function of the path, and formulate the optimal experimental design problem for minimizing the posterior's uncertainty. We discretize the problem such that the cost function remains consistent under temporal refinement. Additional constraints ensure that the path avoids obstacles and remains physically interpretable through a control parameterization. The constrained optimization problem is solved using an interior-point method. We present computational results for a convection-diffusion equation with unknown initial condition.</description>

      <title>Automated Constitutive Model Discovery by Pairing Sparse Regression Algorithms with Model Selection Criteria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16040v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The automated discovery of constitutive models from data has recently emerged as a promising alternative to the traditional model calibration paradigm. In this work, we present a fully automated framework for constitutive model discovery that systematically pairs three sparse regression algorithms (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), Least Angle Regression (LARS), and Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP)) with three model selection criteria: $K$-fold cross-validation (CV), Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). This pairing yields nine distinct algorithms for model discovery and enables a systematic exploration of the trade-off between sparsity, predictive performance, and computational cost. While LARS serves as an efficient path-based solver for the $\ell_1$-constrained problem, OMP is introduced as a tractable heuristic for $\ell_0$-regularized selection. The framework is applied to both isotropic and anisotropic hyperelasticity, utilizing both synthetic and experimental datasets. Results reveal that all nine algorithm-criterion combinations perform consistently well for the discovery of isotropic and anisotropic materials, yielding highly accurate constitutive models. These findings broaden the range of viable discovery algorithms beyond $\ell_1$-based approaches such as LASSO.</description>

      <title>A comparative analysis for different finite element types in strain-gradient elasticity simulations performed on Firedrake and FEniCS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12043v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The layer-upon-layer approach in additive manufacturing, open or closed cells in polymeric or metallic foams involve an intrinsic microstructure tailored to the underlying applications. Homogenization of such architectured materials creates metamaterials modeled by higher-gradient models, specifically when the microstructure's characteristic length is comparable to the length scale of the structure. In this study, we conduct a comparative analysis of various finite elements methods for solving problems in strain-gradient elasticity. We employ open-source packages from Firedrake and FEniCS. Different finite element formulations are tested: we implement Lagrange, Argyris, Hermite elements, a Hu--Washizu type (mixed) formulation, as well as isogeometric analysis with Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines (NURBS). For the numerical study, we investigate one- and two-dimensional problems discussed in the literature of strain-gradient modeling. All developed codes are open-access to encourage research in Finite Element Method (FEM) based computation of generalized continua.</description>

      <title>Efficient Bayesian multi-fidelity inverse analysis for expensive and non-differentiable physics-based simulations in high stochastic dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24708v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-dimensional Bayesian inverse analysis (dim &gt;&gt; 100) is mostly unfeasible for computationally demanding, nonlinear physics-based high-fidelity (HF) models. Usually, the use of more efficient gradient-based inference schemes is impeded if the multi-physics models are provided by complex legacy codes. Adjoint-based derivatives are either exceedingly cumbersome to derive or non-existent for practically relevant large-scale nonlinear and coupled multi-physics problems. Similarly, holistic automated differentiation w.r.t. primary variables of multi-physics codes is usually not yet an option and requires extensive code restructuring if not considered from the outset in the software design. This absence of differentiability further exacerbates the already present computational challenges. To overcome the existing limitations, we propose a novel inference approach called Bayesian multi-fidelity inverse analysis (BMFIA), which leverages simpler and computationally cheaper lower-fidelity (LF) models that are designed to provide model derivatives. BMFIA learns a simple, probabilistic dependence of the LF and HF models, which is then employed in an altered likelihood formulation to statistically correct the inaccurate LF response. From a Bayesian viewpoint, this dependence represents a multi-fidelity conditional density (discriminative model). We demonstrate how this multi-fidelity conditional density can be learned robustly in the small data regime from only a few HF and LF simulations (50 to 300), which would not be sufficient for naive surrogate approaches. The formulation is fully differentiable and allows the flexible design of a wide range of LF models.</description>
