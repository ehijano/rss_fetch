      <title>Identifying high resolution benchmark data needs and Novel data-driven methodologies for Climate Downscaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the essential role of information retrieval in enhancing climate downscaling, focusing on the need for high-resolution datasets and the application of deep learning models. We explore the requirements for acquiring detailed spatial and temporal climate data, crucial for accurate local forecasts, and discuss how deep learning (DL) techniques can significantly improve downscaling precision by modelling the complex relationships between climate variables. Additionally, we examine the specific challenges related to the retrieval of relevant climatic data, emphasizing methods for efficient data extraction and utilization to support advanced model training. This research underscores an integrated approach, combining information retrieval, deep learning, and climate science to refine the process of climate downscaling, aiming to produce more accurate and actionable local climate projections.</description>

      <title>Personalized Adapter for Large Meteorology Model on Devices: Towards Weather Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper demonstrates that pre-trained language models (PLMs) are strong foundation models for on-device meteorological variables modeling. We present LM-Weather, a generic approach to taming PLMs, that have learned massive sequential knowledge from the universe of natural language databases, to acquire an immediate capability to obtain highly customized models for heterogeneous meteorological data on devices while keeping high efficiency. Concretely, we introduce a lightweight personalized adapter into PLMs and endows it with weather pattern awareness. During communication between clients and the server, low-rank-based transmission is performed to effectively fuse the global knowledge among devices while maintaining high communication efficiency and ensuring privacy. Experiments on real-wold dataset show that LM-Weather outperforms the state-of-the-art results by a large margin across various tasks (e.g., forecasting and imputation at different scales). We provide extensive and in-depth analyses experiments, which verify that LM-Weather can (1) indeed leverage sequential knowledge from natural language to accurately handle meteorological sequence, (2) allows each devices obtain highly customized models under significant heterogeneity, and (3) generalize under data-limited and out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios.</description>

      <title>Gaussian Framework and Optimal Projection of Weather Fields for Prediction of Extreme Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extreme events are the major weather related hazard for humanity. It is then of crucial importance to have a good understanding of their statistics and to be able to forecast them. However, lack of sufficient data makes their study particularly challenging.
  In this work we provide a simple framework to study extreme events that tackles the lack of data issue by using the whole dataset available, rather than focusing on the extremes in the dataset. To do so, we make the assumption that the set of predictors and the observable used to define the extreme event follow a jointly Gaussian distribution. This naturally gives the notion of an optimal projection of the predictors for forecasting the event.
  We take as a case study extreme heatwaves over France, and we test our method on an 8000-year-long intermediate complexity climate model time series and on the ERA5 reanalysis dataset.
  For a-posteriori statistics, we observe and motivate the fact that composite maps of very extreme events look similar to less extreme ones.
  For prediction, we show that our method is competitive with off-the-shelf neural networks on the long dataset and outperforms them on reanalysis.
  The optimal projection pattern, which makes our forecast intrinsically interpretable, highlights the importance of soil moisture deficit and quasi-stationary Rossby waves as precursors to extreme heatwaves.</description>

      <title>Climate Variable Downscaling with Conditional Normalizing Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predictions of global climate models typically operate on coarse spatial scales due to the large computational costs of climate simulations. This has led to a considerable interest in methods for statistical downscaling, a similar process to super-resolution in the computer vision context, to provide more local and regional climate information. In this work, we apply conditional normalizing flows to the task of climate variable downscaling. We showcase its successful performance on an ERA5 water content dataset for different upsampling factors. Additionally, we show that the method allows us to assess the predictive uncertainty in terms of standard deviation from the fitted conditional distribution mean.</description>
