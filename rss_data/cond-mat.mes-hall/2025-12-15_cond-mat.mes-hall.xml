      <title>Andreev spin qubits bound to Josephson vortices in spin-orbit coupled planar Josephson junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a variant of Andreev spin qubits (ASQs) defined in planar Josephson junctions based on spin-orbit coupled two-dimensional electron gases (2DEGs) in a weak out-of-plane magnetic field. The magnetic field induces a linear phase gradient across the junction, generating Josephson vortices that can host low-energy Andreev bound states (ABSs). We show that, in certain parameter regimes, the combined effect of the phase gradient and spin-orbit coupling stabilizes an odd-fermion parity ground state, where a single Josephson vortex binds a spinful low-energy degree of freedom that is energetically separated from the other ABSs. This low-energy degree of freedom can be exploited to define a special type of ASQ, which we dub the vortex spin qubit (VSQ). We show that single-qubit gates for VSQs can be performed via flux driving, while readout can be achieved by adapting standard circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) techniques developed for conventional ASQs. We further outline how an entangling two-qubit gate can be performed using an ac current drive. We argue that VSQs offer prospects for a substantial reduction in device complexity and hardware overhead compared to conventional ASQ implementations, while preserving key advantages such as supercurrent-based readout, single-qubit gates, and long-range two-qubit gates.</description>

      <title>Topological Order and Non-Hermitian Skin Effect in Generalized Ideal Chern Bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fractionalization in ideal Chern bands and non-Hermitian topological physics are two active but so far separate research directions. Merging these, we generalize the notion of ideal Chern bands to the non-Hermitian realm and uncover several striking consequences both on the level of band theory and in the strongly interacting regime. Specifically, we show that the lowest band of a Kapit--Mueller lattice model with an imaginary gauge potential satisfies a generalized ideal condition with complex Berry curvature in sync with a complex quantum metric. The ideal band remains purely real and exactly flat yet all right and left eigenstates accumulate at the boundaries on a cylinder, implying a non-Hermitian skin effect without an accompanying spectral winding. The skin effect is inherited by the many-body zero modes, yielding skin-Laughlin states with an exponential profile on the lattice. Moreover, at a critical strength of non-Hermiticity there is an unconventional phase transition on the torus, which is absent on the cylinder. Our findings lead to an extension of topological order in non-Hermitian systems.</description>

      <title>Quasi-one-dimensional taco-shaped bands in large-angle twisted bilayer transition metal dichalcogenides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional moir\'e materials offer a powerful, twist-tunable platform for engineering electronic bands and correlations, though most studies to date have focused on small twist angles where flat bands arise from symmetry-pinned monolayer momenta. Here, we observe the surprising emergence of flat electronic bands with a distinctive quasi-one-dimensional dispersion at large twist angles in bilayer transition metal dichalcogenides that originate from the $\Lambda$ valley states at generic momenta between $\Gamma$ and $K$ points. These taco-shaped anisotropic bands result from optimal interlayer hybridization between like-spin $\Lambda$ valleys at the conduction band minimum in the Brillouin zone, resulting in directional band flattening at a magic twist-angle of 21.8$^{\circ}$. The bands form six anisotropic channels with a sixfold alternating spin texture reminiscent of altermagnetic textures. At low energies, the density of states shows a power-law dependence due to the quasi-one-dimensional character, enhancing the potential for correlated phases. Our results provide a new platform for correlated phenomena and broaden the scope of moir\'e engineering to large twist angles in 2D materials.</description>

      <title>Magnetoplasmon-Mediated Resonant Photogalvanic Effect in a Gated Strip of 2D Electrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate a nonlinear response to a linearly polarized monochromatic electromagnetic wave incident at an angle on a two-dimensional (2D) electronic system (ES) in the form of an infinite strip. The 2D ES is situated on a dielectric substrate near a perfectly conducting metal electrode (gate). The entire system is subjected to an external perpendicular constant magnetic field. We use Maxwell's equations for electromagnetic waves, while the electrons are described within the hydrodynamic approximation using Euler's equations and neglecting electromagnetic retardation effects. The incident electromagnetic wave excites magnetoplasmons in the strip. The fully screened limit is considered when all characteristic dimensions of the system, including the plasmon wavelengths, are much larger than the distance to the gate. This limit allows the linear response to be determined fully analytically. Due to the nonlinear hydrodynamic (convective) term, the excited magnetoplasmon oscillations give rise to a DC current along the strip and a voltage across it. Surprisingly, the relationship between the photocurrent and the photovoltage in resonance is exactly the same as in the classical Hall effect. The photovoltage is a monotonic function of the magnetic field. However, the photocurrent exhibits a minimum, which occurs at specific wavevector directions.</description>

      <title>Fibonacci sequence of twist angles in superconducting multi-layer graphene and hydrogenated graphitic fibers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A range of twist angles between adjacent surfaces/volumes are intrinsic to natural graphite or artificially design in multi-layer graphene. In addition, stacking faults can be created by the application of mechanic, electric or magnetic fields. Charge and spin transport then occur in relation to the existing twist-angle pattern. In two dimensions, a saddle point in the electronic band structure leads to divergence in the density of states, known as van Hove singularities (vHs). The energy difference between vHs for the conduction and valence bands was found to increase with the twist angle between neighboring graphite domains with respect to the c axis (perpendicular to the graphite planes). In this work, we estimate for the superconducting (SC)-like nano-size multi-layer granular domain in hydrogenated graphitic fibers [1]. We show that this value for and the values found by others for few-layer graphene might actually form the Fibonacci mathematical sequence. Moreover, SC hydrogenated graphite can harbour higher-order topology as reflected in at least quadratic energy gap flattening. Charge transport and magnetization measurements on hydrogenated graphitic fibers have been done using a Quantum Design Physical Properties Measurement System.</description>

      <title>Altermagnetic bulk and topological surface magnetizations for CrSb single crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We experimentally investigate the angle dependence of magnetization $M(\alpha)$ for single crystals of CrSb. CrSb belongs to a new class of altermagnetic materials, the small net magnetization is accompanied by alternating spin splitting in the k-space. In addition, CrSb reveals also topological features with Weyl surface states originating from bulk band topology. We observe, that $M(\alpha)$ oscillates around zero value, so magnetization is positive for $M(\alpha)$ maxima and it is negative for $M(\alpha)$ minima. The magnetization reversal curves $M(H)$ are non-linear with low-field hysteresis, but with almost linear high-field branches. The slope of the linear branches well correlates with $M(\alpha)$ oscillations, so it is positive for $M(\alpha)$ maxima and negative for $M(\alpha)$ minima. We demonstrate, that the interplay between the positive and the negative $M(H)$ slopes originates from several magnetic phases in CrSb. In particular, current-carrying topological surface states are responsible for the diamagnetic-like $M(H)$ negative slope, which dominates for the directions of full spin compensation in the bulk CrSb altermagnetic spectrum. Due to the spin-momentum locking, topological surface states are spin-polarized, which is responsible for the low-field hysteresis. Thus, we experimentally demonstrate both the altermagnetic bulk and the topological surface magnetizations for the altermagnetic candidate CrSb.

      <title>Thermal Spin Waves from Accelerating Domain Walls via the Unruh Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a wire consisting of a conducting ferromagnetic layer and an insulating antiferromagnetic layer that are coupled. The ferromagnet hosts a domain wall, which is dynamically driven by a charge current. We show that for a specific time-dependent current, the domain wall moves according to a Rindler trajectory. This motion excites spin waves in the antiferromagnetic insulator, and their emission spectrum is characterised by an effective temperature analogous to the Unruh temperature, $T_U = \hbar a/2\pi c k_B$, with a the acceleration of the domain wall, c the maximum antiferromagnetic spin wave velocity, and kB the Boltzmann constant. This thermal signature is a direct consequence of the Unruh effect and could be experimentally observed. Our results establish magnetism as a promising platform for probing relativistic quantum field phenomena. Moreover, since the Unruh effect is inherently linked to entanglement, our proposal provides a route for entangling magnetic domain walls via relativistic effects.</description>

      <title>Quantized pumping in disordered nonlinear Thouless pumps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of nonlinear optical Thouless pumps in the presence of disorder, using optical waveguide arrays. It was previously known that the displacement of solitons in Thouless pumps is quantized and may exhibit integer and fractional transport over the course of the pump cycle. Here, we demonstrate that, in disordered nonlinear pumps, quantization may be maintained despite the presence of disorder, even though it would not be in the linear domain. Moreover, nonlinearity allows pumps to be executed more quickly (i.e., less adiabatically). This may serve as a design principle for integrated non-reciprocal devices based on temporal modulation.</description>

      <title>Spin-correlation dynamics: A semiclassical framework for nonlinear quantum magnetism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical nonlinear theories are highly successful in describing far-from-equilibrium dynamics of magnets, encompassing phenomena such as parametric resonance, ultrafast switching, and even chaos. However, at ultrashort length and time scales, where quantum correlations become significant, these models inevitably break down. While numerous methods exist to simulate quantum many-body spin systems, they are often limited to near-equilibrium conditions, capture only short-time dynamics, or obscure the intuitive connection between nonlinear behavior and its geometric origin in the su(2) spin algebra. To advance nonlinear magnetism into the quantum regime, we develop a theory in which semiclassical spin correlations, rather than individual spins, serve as the fundamental dynamical variables. Defined on the bonds of a bipartite lattice, these correlations are inherently nonlocal, with dynamics following through a semiclassical mapping that preserves the original spin algebra. The resulting semiclassical theory captures nonlinear dynamics that are entirely nonclassical and naturally accommodates phenomenological damping at the level of correlations, which is typically challenging to include in quantum methods. As an application, we focus on Heisenberg antiferromagnets, which feature significant quantum effects. We predict nonlinear scaling of the mean frequency of quantum oscillations in the N\'eel state with the spin quantum number S. These have no classical analog and exhibit features reminiscent of nonlinear parametric resonance, fully confirmed by exact diagonalization. The predicted dynamical features are embedded in the geometric structure of the semiclassical phase space of spin correlations, making their physical origin much more transparent than in full quantum methods. With this, semiclassical spin-correlation dynamics provide a foundation for exploring nonlinear quantum magnetism.</description>

      <title>Impact of interdigitated electrodes design on the low frequency and random telegraph noise of single-layer graphene micro ribbons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High performance devices consisting of interdigitated electrodes (IDEs) on top of single-layer graphene (SLG) are candidates with favorable prospects for sensing applications. Graphene micro ribbons (GMRs) of various widths and IDE design geometries were fabricated and experimentally examined regarding their low-frequency noise (LFN) behavior. Measurements revealed a 1/f behavior and different kinds of trap activity behind it, which were studied through the analysis of random telegraph noise (RTN) signals. Our investigation suggests that adjusting the geometrical characteristics of either the GMR width or the IDE topology can significantly influence the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of SLG-based electronics. On the bright side, the results of our study can provide useful guidelines for fabrication decisions to maximize the SNR.</description>

      <title>Electric and spin-valley currents induced by structured light in 2D Dirac materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Structured optical fields can be used for the injection and control of charge and spin-valley currents. Here, we present a systematical study of these phenomena for interband absorption of structured light in 2D Dirac materials. We derive general expressions for the current density and the quasi-classical generation rate of photoelectrons in the momentum, coordinate, and spin-valley spaces. We reveal mechanisms of the current formation determined by the local and non-local contributions to the optical generation, including the mechanisms related to optical alignment of electron momenta by linearly polarized light, optical orientation by circularly polarized light, and the class of charge and spin-valley photon drags sensitive to the phase and polarization profiles of the optical field. We develop a kinetic theory of electric and spin-valley currents driven by the optical field with spatially inhomogeneous intensity, polarization, and phase and obtain analytical expressions for the current contributions. The theory is applied to analyze the photocurrents emerging in TMDC layers and graphene excited by polarization gratings.</description>

      <title>Quantum Dynamical Signatures of Topological Flow Transitions in Limit Cycle Phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum self-oscillatory phases are ubiquitous in driven-dissipative systems. Classically, each phase is defined by its flow pattern and how stationary sets organize phase space (e.g. fixed points and limit cycles), with transitions triggered by local bifurcations or global basin rearrangements. In the quantum regime, these reorganizations are often blurred by density-matrix averaging, and spectral indicators such as the Liouvillian gap can miss changes that unfold mainly in the transients. Here we introduce a topological graph invariant, the molecule, which captures the phase-space connectivity of fixed points and limit cycles. Transitions show up as discrete changes of this invariant, with each form marking a distinct quantum dynamical pattern (e.g. relaxation pathway). The molecule encodes the global topological constraints that govern how stationary sets and their basins can rearrange, clarifies when such rearrangements can affect the Liouvillian modes, and reveals additional transitions that remain hidden in the steady-state spectrum but stem from global changes of the flow topology. Our findings show that flow topology offers a clear and unified way to identify and classify dynamical phases beyond what Liouvillian spectra alone reveal.</description>

      <title>Gate-controlled analog memcapacitance in LaAlO3/SrTiO3 interface-based devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current memcapacitor implementations typically demand complex fabrication processes or depend on organic materials exhibiting poor environmental stability and reproducibility. Here, we demonstrate memcapacitor structures utilizing a quasi 2-dimensional electron gas, formed at the crystalline LaAlO3/SrTiO3 heterointerface, as electrodes and SiO2/SrTiO3 as dielectric layer. The observed memcapacitance originates from the charge localization in a lateral floating gate, while an applied gate voltage enables reversible tuning of the device capacitance. Furthermore, preprogrammed or erased gate biases enable controllable shifts of the capacitance hysteresis window toward positive or negative bias, leading to an enlarged capacitance gap at zero bias. A memcapacitor model developed for this system reproduces the main features of the experimental capacitance hysteresis, capturing the effects of charge fluctuations and dielectric frequency modulation within the oxide layer. The demonstrated low-voltage operation and gate tunability of oxide interface-based memcapacitors highlight their potential for power-efficient, capacitor-based neuromorphic and synaptic electronic architectures.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic permeability of fluctuating porous membranes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11368v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we examine how porosity fluctuations affect the hydrodynamic permeability of a porous matrix or membrane. We introduce a fluctuating Darcy model, which couples the Navier-Stokes equation to the space- and time-dependent porosity fluctuations via a Darcy friction term. Using a perturbative approach, a Dyson equation for hydrodynamic fluctuations is derived and solved to express the permeability in terms of the matrix fluctuation spectrum. Surprisingly, the model reveals strong modifications of the fluid permeability in fluctuating matrices compared to static ones. Applications to various matrix excitation models - breathing matrix, phonons, active forcing - highlight the significant influence of matrix fluctuations on fluid transport, offering insights for optimizing membrane design for separation applications.</description>

      <title>The Arf-Brown-Kervaire invariant on a lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11424v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a lattice formulation of the Arf-Brown-Kervaire (ABK) invariant which takes values in $\mathbb{Z}_8$. Compared to the standard $\mathbb{Z}$-valued index, the ABK invariant is more involved in that it arises in Majorana fermion partition functions with reflection symmetry on two-dimensional non-orientable manifolds, and its definition contains an infinite sum over Dirac eigenvalues that requires proper regularization. We employ the massive Wilson Dirac operator, with and without domain-walls, on standard two-dimensional square lattices, and use its Pfaffian for the definition. Twisted boundary conditions and cross-caps, which reverse the orientation, are introduced to realize nontrivial topologies equipped with nontrivial $\mathrm{Pin}^{-}$ structures of Majorana fermions. We verify numerically (and partly analytically) that our formulation on a torus, Klein bottle, real projective plane (as well as its triple connected sum), and two types of M\"obius strip reproduces the known values in continuum theory.</description>

      <title>Tailoring quantum walks in integrated photonic lattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.11608v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unlike discrete photonic circuits, which manipulate photons step-by-step using a series of optical elements, arrays of coupled waveguides enable photons to interfere continuously across the entire structure. When composed of a nonlinear material, such arrays can also directly generate quantum states of light within the circuit. To clarify the similarities and distinctions between these two approaches of quantum walks, we conduct here a systematic comparison between linear waveguide arrays, injected with photons produced externally, and nonlinear arrays, where photon pairs are continuously generated via parametric down-conversion. We experimentally validate these predictions using III-V semiconductor nonlinear waveguide lattices with varied geometries, enabling us to tune the depth of the quantum walks over an order of magnitude and reveal the gradual emergence of non-classicality in the output state. Finally, we demonstrate an inverse-design approach to engineer \textit{aperiodic} waveguide arrays, whose optimized coupling profiles generate maximally entangled states such as the biphoton W-state. These results highlight the potential of continuously-coupled photonic systems to harness high-dimensional entanglement within compact architectures.</description>

      <title>Dissipation due to bulk localized low-energy modes in strongly disordered superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11636v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a theory of the temperature $T$ and frequency $\omega$ dependence of ac dissipation in strongly disordered superconductors featuring a pseudogap $\Delta_{P}$ in the single-particle spectrum. Our theory applies to the regime $T,\,\hbar\omega\ll\Delta_{\text{typ}}\ll\Delta_{P}$, where $\Delta_{\text{typ}}$ is the typical superconducting gap. The dissipation is expressed in terms of the quality factor $Q(T,\omega)$ of microwave resonators made of these materials. We show that low-$\omega$ dissipation is dominated by a new type of bulk localized collective modes. Due to the strongly nonuniform spectral density of these modes, $Q$ decreases sharply with frequency, while its temperature dependence exhibits a two-level-system-like growth as a function of $T$ for $T\ll T_{c}$. Our theory is applicable to InO$_x$, TiN, NbN, and similar strongly disordered materials. We further argue that the experimentally observed behavior of disordered films of granular Aluminum is explained by similar physics, although this case requires a separate theoretical analysis.</description>

      <title>Nuclear magnetic resonance on a single atom with a local probe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.11652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nuclear spin is a prime candidate for quantum information applications due to its weak coupling to the environment and inherently long coherence times. However, this weak coupling also challenges the addressability of the nuclear spin. Here we demonstrate nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) on a single on-surface atom using a local scanning probe. We employ an electron-nuclear double resonance measurement scheme and resolve nuclear spin transitions of a single 47Ti isotope with a nuclear spin of I = 5/2. The quadrupole interaction enables to resolve multiple NMR transitions, which are consistent with our eigenenergy calculations. Our experimental results indicate that the nuclear spin can be driven efficiently irrespective of its hybridization with the electron spin, which is required for direct control of the nuclear spin in the long-lifetime regime. This investigation of NMR on a single atom in a platform with atomic-scale control is a valuable development for other platforms deploying nuclear spins for characterization techniques or quantum information technology.</description>

      <title>Curvilinear magnonic crystal based on 3D hierarchical nanotemplates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.11663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Curvilinear magnetic nanostructures enable control of magnetization dynamics through geometry-induced anisotropy and chiral interactions as well as magnetic field modulation. In this work, we report a curvilinear magnonic crystal based on large-area square arrays of truncated nanospikes fabricated by conformal coating of 3D hierarchical templates with permalloy thin films. Brillouin light scattering spectroscopy reveals anisotropic band structure with multiple dispersive and folded Bloch-type dispersive spin-wave modes as well as non-dispersive modes exhibiting direction-dependent frequency shifts and intensity asymmetries along lattice principal axes. Finite element micromagnetic simulations indicate that curvature-induced variations of the demagnetizing field govern the magnonic response, enabling the identification of modes propagating in nanochannels and other localized on nanospike apexes or along the ridges connecting adjacent nanospikes. The combination of geometric curvature and optical probing asymmetry produces directional dependence of magnonic bands, establishing 3D hierarchical templates as a versatile platform for curvature-engineered magnonics.</description>

      <title>Tailored Error Mitigation for Single-Qubit Magnetometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum sensing is an emerging field with the potential to outperform classical methods in both precision and spatial resolution. However, the sensitivity of the underlying quantum platform also makes the sensors highly susceptible to their environmental noise. To address this issue, techniques from the field of quantum error mitigation use information about the noise to improve measurement results. We present a novel mitigation technique for quantum sensors to efficiently reverse the effects of any noise that can be described by a completely positive trace preserving map. The method leverages the knowledge acquired by a pre-characterization step of the device to automatically adapt to the complexity of the dissipative evolution and to indicate optimal sensing times $\tau$ to achieve the most accurate results. We demonstrate that our method reaches the best achievable sensitivity in noisy single-NV-center magnetometry.
  This work marks a further step toward more resilient quantum sensors with the smallest scale of resolution.</description>

Abstract: Higher-order exceptional points (EPs) govern non-Hermitian system dynamics through their enriched and sharpened spectral topology, yet the intrinsic topological fragility hinders robust experimental realization. Here, we present a scalable architecture that implements arbitrary-order EPs via a recurrent network comprising a single nanomechanical resonator and unlimited virtual resonators. We experimentally realize mechanical EPs up to the seventh order and confirm this architecture's scalability. Moreover, we reveal that the fundamental noise component and the measured signal share the same system coupling channel and thus undergo identical root-response amplification near EPs of arbitrary order, consistent with our signal-to-noise ratio measurements. Our work establishes a general platform for exploring higher-order EP-based phenomena while clarifying the fundamental boundary of non-Hermitian sensitivity enhancement across diverse physical systems.</description>

      <title>When Is Nanoconfined Water Different From Interfacial Water?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11766v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Water behaves very differently at surfaces and under extreme confinement, but the boundary between these two regimes has remained unclear. Despite evidence that interfacial effects persist under sub-nanometre confinement, the molecular-scale behaviour and its evolution with slit width remain unclear. Here, we use machine-learning molecular dynamics with first-principles accuracy to probe water at graphene surfaces across slit widths ranging from the open-interface limit to angstrom-scale confinement. We find that water undergoes a sharp structural transition: when three or more water layers fit between the walls, the structure of the graphene-water interface is effectively indistinguishable from that in an open system, with density layering, hydrogen bonding, and orientational ordering retaining interfacial character. Below this threshold, however, angstrom-scale confinement strongly reorganises the liquid, producing enhanced ordering, a restructured hydrogen-bond network, and modified orientational motifs. These results establish a molecular-level picture that clearly separates interfacial behaviour from genuine nanoconfinement and provide guidance for predicting and controlling the structure of water in nanoscale solid-liquid environments.</description>

      <title>Strongly anharmonic flux-tunable transmon based on InAs-Al 2D heterostructure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12288v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The gatemon qubits, made of transparent superconducting-semiconducting Josephson junctions, typically have even weaker anharmonicity than the opaque AlOx-junction transmons. However, flux-frustrated gatemons can acquire a much stronger anharmonicity, originating from the interference of the higher-order harmonics of the supercurrent. Here we investigate this effect of enhanced anharmonicity in split-junction gatemon devices based on InAs-Al 2D heterostructure. We find that anharmonicity in excess of 100% can be routinely achieved at the half-integer flux sweet-spot without any need for electrical gating or excessive sensitivity to the offset charge noise. We verified that such intrinsically large anharmonicity enables our devices to be driven coherently with raw Rabi frequencies exceeding 100 MHz, without any pulse shaping, simplifying implementation and control compared to traditional gatemons and transmons. Furthermore, by analyzing a relatively high-resolution spectroscopy of the device transitions as a function of flux, we were able to extract fine details of the current-phase relation, to which transport measurements would hardly be sensitive. The strong anharmonicity of our anharmonic tunable transmons, along with their bare-bones design, can prove to be a precious resource that transparent superconducting-semiconducting junctions bring to quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Gyrotropic magnetic effect in metallic chiral magnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20153v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the gyrotropic magnetic effect (GME), the low-frequency limit of optical gyrotropy, in metals and semimetals coupled to chiral spin textures. In these systems, the chiral spin texture which lacks inversion symmetry can imprint itself upon the electronic structure through Hund's coupling, leading to novel low-frequency optical activity. Using perturbation theory and numerical diagonalization of both relativistic and non-relativistic models of conduction electrons coupled to spin textures, we analyze how the GME manifests in both single-$q$ and multi-$q$ textures. Analytical expressions for the rotatory power are derived in terms of universal scaling functions. Estimates based on realistic material parameters reveal an experimentally viable range of values for the rotatory power. The GME arises from the orbital and spin magnetic moments of conduction electrons, with the orbital part closely tied to Berry curvature and playing a significant role in relativistic metals but not so in non-relativistic metals where there is no inherent Berry curvature. The spin contribution to the GME can be significant in non-relativistic metals with a large Fermi energy. Our work establishes the GME as a sensitive probe of magnetic chirality and symmetry breaking in metallic chiral magnets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22472v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an overview of time-dependent transport phenomena in quantum systems, with a particular emphasis on steady-state regimes. We present the ideas after the main theoretical frameworks to study open-quantum systems out of equilibrium, that are useful to study quantum transport under time-dependent driving. We discuss the fundamentals of the key mechanisms such as dissipation, quantum pumping, noise, and energy conversion that are associated to the problem of quantum transport.
  Our primary focus is on electronic systems, where decades of research have established a rich theoretical foundation and a wealth of experimental realizations. Topics of interest include quantum optics with electrons, high-precision electron spectroscopy, quantum electrical metrology, and the critical role of quantum fluctuations in transport and thermodynamics. We also extend the discussion to atomic, molecular, and optical systems, as well as nanomechanical platforms, which offer complementary perspectives and are currently experiencing rapid experimental development. Finally, we examine the intersection of time-dependent transport and topological matter, a domain of active investigation.
  This review aims to gather the diverse approaches and emerging trends that define the current landscape of quantum transport research under time-dependent conditions, bridging theoretical insights with experimental advances across multiple physical platforms.</description>

      <title>Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality in optically induced lattices of exciton-polariton condensates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10187v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate space-time coherence in one-dimensional lattices of exciton-polariton condensates formed by fully reconfigurable non-resonant optical pumping. Starting from an open-dissipative Gross-Pitaevskii equation with deterministic reservoir kinetics and stochastic condensate noise, we derive a discrete complex-field model that incorporates coherent tunnelling, reservoir-mediated dissipative coupling and gain-saturation non-linearity. Adiabatic elimination of fast density fluctuations reveals a wedge-shaped region in the complex hopping plane where the coarse-grained phase dynamics reduces to the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation. By computing high-resolution phase diagrams of the temporal and spatial scaling exponents we pinpoint the boundaries separating the KPZ domain from the Edwards-Wilkinson (EW) regime. Large-scale graphics processing unit (GPU) simulations of chains containing up to $N=2000$ condensates confirm these predictions: inside the wedge the exponents converge to $\beta_{N}=\textbf{0.329}(3)\!\approx\!1/3$ and $\chi_{N}=\textbf{0.504}(4)\!\approx\!1/2$, whereas outside it the dynamics moves away from KPZ and ultimately flows toward the EW fixed point, although finite system size and finite observation time may yield intermediate effective exponents. These results pave the way to the implementation of ultrafast KPZ-simulators based on one-dimensional arrays of exciton-polariton condensates.</description>

      <title>Phonon-confinement theory of thermal conductivity in ultrathin silicon films</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.11914v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The thermal properties of solids under nanoscale confinement are currently not understood at the atomic level. Recent numerical studies have highlighted the presence of a minimum in the thermal conductivity as a function of thickness for ultrathin films at a thickness about 1-2 nm, which cannot be described by existing theories. We develop a theoretical description of thin films which predicts a new physical law for heat transfer at the nanoscale. In particular, due to the strong redistribution of phonon momentum states in reciprocal space (with a transition from a spherical Debye surface to a different homotopy group $\mathbb{Z}$ at strong confinement), the low-energy phonon density of states no longer follows Debye's law but rather a cubic law with frequency, which then crosses over to Debye's law at a crossover frequency proportional to the average speed of sound of the material and inversely proportional to the film thickness. Concomitantly, this implies that the phonon population becomes dominated by low-energy phonons as confinement increases, which then leads to a higher thermal conductivity under extreme confinement. The theory is able to reproduce the thermal conductivity minimum in recent molecular simulations data for ultrathin silicon and provides useful guidelines so as to tune the minimum position based on the mechanical properties of the material.</description>

Abstract: Dirac fermions, subject to external magnetic fields and in the presence of mass orders that assume topologically nontrivial spatial textures such as domain wall and vortices, for example, bind robust midgap states at zero energy, the number of which is governed by the Aharonov-Casher and Jackiw-Rebbi or Jackiw-Rossi index theorems, respectively. Here I extend the jurisdiction of these prominent index theorems to Lorentz invariant non-Hermitian (NH) Dirac operators, constructed by augmenting the celebrated Dirac Hamiltonian by a masslike anti-Hermitian operator that also scales linearly with momentum. The resulting NH Dirac operator manifests all-real eigenvalues over an extended NH parameter regime, characterized by a real effective Fermi velocity for NH Dirac fermions ($v_{_{\rm F}}$). From the explicit solutions of the zero-energy bound states, I show that in the presence of external magnetic fields of arbitrary shape such modes always exist when the system encloses a finite number of magnetic flux quanta, while in the presence of spatially nontrivial textures of the mass orders localized zero-energy modes can only be found in the spectrum when $v_{_{\rm F}}$ is real. These findings pave a concrete route to realize nucleation of competing orders from the topologically robust zero-energy manifold in NH or open Dirac systems. Possible extensions of these outcomes to other index theorems and tabletop experimental setups to test these predictions are discussed.</description>

      <title>Escaping AB caging via Floquet engineering: photo-induced long-range interference in an all-band-flat model</title>

Abstract: Flat-band lattices hosting compact localized states are highly sensitive to external modulation, and the tailored design of a perturbation to imprint specific features becomes relevant. Here we show that periodic driving in the high-frequency regime transforms the all-flat-band diamond chain into one featuring two tunable quasi-flat bands and a residual flat band pinned at $E=0$. The interplay between lattice geometry and the symmetries of the driven system gives rise to drive-induced tunneling processes that redefine the interference conditions and open a controllable route to escaping Aharonov-Bohm caging. Under driving, the diamond chain effectively acquires the geometry of a dimerized lattice, exhibiting charge oscillations between opposite boundaries. This feature can be exploited to generate two-particle entanglement that is directly accessible experimentally. The resulting drive-engineered quasi-flat bands thus provide a versatile platform for manipulating quantum correlations, revealing a direct link between spectral fine structure and dynamical entanglement.</description>

      <title>Entanglement of a nuclear spin qubit register in silicon photonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15467v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Color centers provide an optical interface to quantum registers based on electron and nuclear spin qubits in solids. The T center in silicon is an emerging spin-photon interface that combines telecom O-band optical transitions and an electron spin in a scalable photonics platform. In this work, we demonstrate the initialization, coherent control, and state readout of a three-qubit register based on the electron spin of a T center coupled to a hydrogen and a silicon nuclear spin. The spin register exhibits spin echo coherence times of $0.41(2)$~ms for the electron spin, $112(12)$~ms for the hydrogen nuclear spin, and $67(7)$~ms for the silicon nuclear spin. We use nuclear-nuclear two-qubit gates to generate entanglement between the two nuclear spins with a fidelity of $F=0.77(3)$ and a coherence time of $T^*_2=2.60(8)$~ms. Our results show that a T center in silicon photonics can realize a multi-qubit register with an optical interface for quantum communication.</description>

      <title>Evidence for Bose liquid from anomalous shot noise in nanojunctions of bad metal beta-Ta</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09973v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report anomalous shot noise in nanojunctions of beta-tantalum, a ``bad" metal whose electronic properties are inconsistent with the Fermi liquid theory. Fano factors cluster around even multiples of the values expected for Fermi liquids, suggesting that beta-Ta may host a correlated charge liquid of Cooper pair-like electron groups. Further evidence for correlations is provided by the effects of magnetic impurities, as well as reduced density of states near the Fermi level indicated by point contact spectroscopy and first principles calculations. Our results open new avenues for studies and applications of electron correlations.</description>

      <title>High Purcell enhancement in all-TMDC nanobeam resonator designs with active monolayers for nanolasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05333v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a nanobeam resonator incorporating an active monolayer, designed to achieve a high Purcell enhancement. The resonator is fully composed of transition-metal-dichalcogenide materials and intended to operate as a high-beta-factor nanolaser. A theoretical framework that models and optimizes the Purcell enhancement associated with the emission from atomically thin layers is developed. This framework is based on a resonance expansion, enabling spectral resolution of physical quantities governed by high-Q resonances. The numerical optimization of the resonator leads to the presence of a high-Q resonance supporting a strong electric field confinement in the monolayer to maximize the modal gain.</description>

      <title>Adiabatic Electron Transfer in the Barrierless and Marcus-Inverted Regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01909v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Here it is shown that in the adiabatic limit of condensed-phase electron transfer, the onset of barrierless transition occurs at a lower driving force than predicted by the non-adiabatic Marcus formulation. Furthermore, in the adiabatic limit of the Marcus-inverted region, the standard mechanism of electron transfer becomes topologically forbidden. This behavior arises from a topological change in the mapping between the adiabatic and diabatic electronic surfaces, emerging precisely at the onset of the Marcus-inverted region. In this case, alternative mechanisms such as tunneling and non-radiative decay may dominate the rate, typically orders of magnitude slower than the rate calculated from Marcus theory.</description>
