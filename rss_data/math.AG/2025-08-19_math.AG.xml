      <description>arXiv:2508.13307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we describe explicit algebraic equations of cyclic gonal curves reflecting the action of the normalizer of a tame cyclic $k$-gonal automorphism. This completes the known situation obtained by Wootton for the case when $k$ is a prime integer.</description>

      <title>Moduli of non-pure sheaves and contractions of Hilbert schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define certain stacks of rank one sheaves on a smooth projective variety, and show that they admit proper good moduli spaces. We offer several applications to contractions of subschemes inside Hilbert schemes of points. We construct a surgery diagram via non-GIT wall-crossing, and use the interpretation of the surgery as a fine moduli of sheaves to prove instances Kawamata's DK-hypothesis in this setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article is a continuation of my previous paper on miraculous pentagrams published in Annales Scientifiques de Facult\'e des Sciences de Toulouse in 2013. We discuss the moduli space of miraculous pentagrams which is the Del Pezzo surface of degree 5, and present some examples related to Fibonacci numbers.

Abstract: We compute the total Chow-Witt rings of the classifying space B\mu_n of the roots of unity, as well as the products BG_m x B\mu_n and B\mu_m x B\mu_n for all m,n greater than or equal to 1 based on the strategy by di Lorenzo and Mantovani (2023) for B\mu_n with n even.

      <title>Classification of del {P}ezzo surfaces of rank one. III. Height 3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article is a part of a series aimed at classifying normal del Pezzo surfaces of Picard rank one over an algebraically closed field of arbitrary characteristic, up to an isomorphism. The key invariant guiding our classification is the height, defined as the minimal number $h$ such that the minimal resolution of singularities admits a $\mathbb{P}^1$-fibration whose fiber meets the exceptional divisor $h$ times. It is expected that every singular del Pezzo surface of rank one is of height $h\leq 4$, with minor exceptions in characteristics $2$ and $3$. Having settled the case $h\leq 2$ in our previous article arXiv:2412.21174, we now give a classification in case the height equals $3$.</description>

      <title>Positive polynomials and the truncated moment problem on plane cubics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13850v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The truncated moment problem supported on a given closed set $K$ in $\mathbb{R}^2$ ($K$-TMP) asks to characterize conditions for a given linear functional on bivariate polynomials of bounded degree to have an integral representation with respect to a Borel measure $\mu$ with $\text{supp}\mu\subseteq K$. The solutions to the $K$-TMP are known for $K$, which is a line, a quadratic curve, and for some cases of cubic curves. In this paper, we solve the $C$-TMP for every cubic curve $C$. Our first result states that the extreme rays of the cone of polynomials of bounded degree, nonnegative on $C$, have only real zeroes. This result allows us to establish certificates for the positivity of polynomials on $C$ with degree bounds. To obtain concrete forms of these certificates, a case-by-case analysis is required. Up to affine linear change of variables, we divide cubics into 29 cases, 13 irreducible and 16 reducible ones. Using the certificates, we concretely solve the nonsingular $C$-TMP in terms of positive semidefiniteness of two or three localizing moment matrices. In most irreducible cases, we also provide constructive solutions to the nonsingular and singular $C$-TMPs, which can be used to compute a representing measure concretely. Upper bounds for the Carath\'eodory number are also obtained, which in some cases are sharp or differ by at most 1 from the sharp bound.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let G be a complex reductive group and D a finite subset of a compact Riemann surface X. It was shown in [BJ] that the moduli space of G-characters of the complement of D in X has a natural Poisson structure. We show that the moduli space of logarithmic G-connections on X singular over D has a Poisson structure. It is proved that the monodromy map from the moduli space of logarithmic G-connections to the moduli space of G-characters is Poisson structure preserving.</description>

      <title>Dynamical families of regular polynomial endomorphisms on $\mathbb{P}^2$ with many periodic curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove that for a regular polynomial endomorphism of positive degree on $\mathbb{P}^2$, a family of curves containing a Zariski dense set of periodic curves is invariant under some iterate of the endomorphism. The setting is closely related to the Relative Dynamical Manin-Mumford Conjecture, recently proposed by DeMarco and Mavraki, which concerns a parametrized family of endomorphisms and varieties. Our result proves a weaker version of the conjecture where the endomorphism is a regular polynomial endomorphism on $\mathbb{P}^2$ that remains fixed in the family, and the family of curves contains a dense set of periodic curves. This result can also be viewed as a Dynamical Manin-Mumford type statement on the moduli space of divisors, and it proves a special case of the Dynamical Manin-Mumford Conjecture with a stronger assumption.
  Moreover, our result specifically implies a uniform degree stabilization statement for a generic set of curves in a family under the transformation of a regular polynomial endomorphism. We demonstrate that a more general degree stabilization statement for a family of positive dimension subvarieties in $\mathbb{P}^K$ under the transformation of a family of endomorphisms is predicted by the Relative Dynamical Manin-Mumford Conjecture. We then prove that it is true when $K=2$ for families of regular polynomial endomorphisms under certain restrictions on the ramifications at the line at infinity.
  Finally, we demonstrate an application of our result to classify all regular polynomial endomorphisms that admit infinitely many periodic curves of bounded degree.</description>

      <title>Self-composition of Frobenius a real number of times, and some conjectures around Weil's Riemann hypothesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a smooth projective variety defined on a finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$. On $X$ there is a special morphism $Fr_X$, which raises coordinates to exponent $q$: $t\mapsto t^q$. Being an endomorphism of $X$, we can compose $Fr_X$ a \textbf{positive integer} of times, for example $Fr_X^2=Fr_X\circ Fr_X$, $Fr_X^3=Fr_X\circ Fr_X\circ Fr_X$. On the cohomological level, we can define $(Fr_X^*)^s$ for all integers $s$.
  What if we can define $(Fr_X^*)^s$ for all \textbf{real numbers} $s$, in a good way (to be made precise later)? This short note presents an approach towards so-called Dynamical degree comparison conjecture and Norm comparison conjecture, for dominant rational maps and more generally dynamical correspondences, proposed previously by Fei Hu and the author, via such a possibility. The main upshot is a heuristic argument to show that the mentioned conjectures almost follow from the Standard conjectures.
  All this discussion also holds if we replace $Fr_X$ by another polarised endomorphism on $X$.</description>

      <title>Unipotent homotopy theory of schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.10703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.10703v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Building on To\"en's work on affine stacks, we develop a certain homotopy theory for schemes, which we call "unipotent homotopy theory." Over a field of characteristic $p&gt;0$, we prove that the unipotent homotopy group schemes $\pi_i^{\mathrm{U}}(\,\cdot\,)$ introduced in our paper recover the unipotent Nori fundamental group scheme, the $p$-adic \'etale homotopy groups, as well as certain formal groups introduced by Artin and Mazur. We prove a version of the classical Freudenthal suspension theorem as well as a profiniteness theorem for unipotent homotopy group schemes. We also introduce the notion of a formal sphere and use it to show that for Calabi-Yau varieties of dimension $n$, the group schemes $\pi_i^{\mathrm{U}}(\,\cdot\,)$ are derived invariants for all $i \ge 0$; the case $i=n$ is related to recent work of Antieau and Bragg involving topological Hochschild homology. Using the unipotent homotopy group schemes, we establish a correspondence between formal Lie groups and certain higher algebraic structures.</description>

      <title>Nearby cycles at infinity as a triangulated functor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07910v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a polynomial function $f \colon \mathbb{C}^n \longrightarrow \mathbb{C}$, it is well-known in singularity theory (after Thom, Pham, Verdier,...) that outside a finite subset of $\mathbb{C}$, the function is a locally trivial $C^{\infty}$-fibration. The minimal such finite set is called the bifurcation set associated with $f$ and determining the bifurcation sets is a difficult task in singularity theory. To such a function, Raibaut attaches a virtual invariant called motivic nearby cycles at infinity. This invariant lives in some Grothendieck ring of varieties and measures the difference between the Euler characteristics of the general fiber and a fixed fiber. In this work, we show that the motivic nearby cycles at infinity admits a functorial version in the context of motivic homotopy theory, called the motivic nearby cycles functors at infinity. The motivic nearby cycles functors at infinity live in the world of motives and hence capture cohomological information (not just Euler characteristics) of singularities at infinity and realizes to Raibaut's construction in the world of virtual motives. Moreover, our construction is universal in the sense that it is applicable to any theory of nearby cycles functors defined in terms of six operations.</description>

Abstract: Let $(X,\Delta)$ be a dlt log Calabi-Yau pair admitting a polarized endomorphism. We show that $(X,\Delta)$ is a finite quotient of a toric log Calabi-Yau fibration over an abelian variety. We provide an example which shows that the previous statement does not hold if we drop the dlt condition of $(X,\Delta)$ even if $X$ is a smooth variety. Given a klt type variety $X$ and a log Calabi-Yau pair $(X,\Delta)$ admitting a polarized endomorphism, we show that a suitable birational modification of $(X,\Delta)$ is a finite quotient of a toric log Calabi-Yau fibration over an abelian variety.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07458v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $(X,D)$ be an open log del Pezzo surface of rank one, that is, $X$ is a normal projective surface of Picard rank one, the boundary $D$ is a reduced nonzero divisor on $X$, and the anti-log canonical divisor $-(K_X+D)$ is ample. We show that, up to well described exceptions in characteristics 2, 3 and 5, the smooth part of $X\setminus D$ admits an $\mathbb{A}^1$- or an $\mathbb{A}^{1}_{*}$-fibration, which extends to a $\mathbb{P}^1$-fibration of the minimal log resolution of $(X,D)$. In characteristic 0 this improves a well-known structure theorem of Miyanishi-Tsunoda. Within the proof, we classify rational anti-canonical curves contained in smooth loci of canonical del Pezzo surfaces of rank one.</description>

      <title>Classification of del Pezzo surfaces of rank one. I. Height 1 and 2. II. Descendants with elliptic boundaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.21174v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This is the first article in a series aimed at classifying normal del Pezzo surfaces of Picard rank one over algebraically closed fields of arbitrary characteristic up to an isomorphism. Our guiding invariant is the height of a del Pezzo surface, defined as the minimal intersection number of the exceptional divisor of the minimal resolution and a fiber of some $\mathbb{P}^1$-fibration. The geometry of del Pezzo surfaces gets more constrained as the height grows; in characteristic $0$ no example of height bigger than $4$ is known.
  In this article, we classify del Pezzo surfaces of Picard rank one and height at most $2$; in particular we describe the non-log terminal ones. We also describe a natural class of del Pezzo surfaces which have descendants with elliptic boundary, i.e. whose minimal resolution has a birational morphism onto a canonical del Pezzo surface of rank one mapping the exceptional divisor to an anti-canonical curve.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09015v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study quasi-$F^e$-split and quasi-$F$-regular singularities, which generalize Yobuko's quasi-$F$-splitting. We establish Fedder type criteria that characterize these properties for hypersurfaces. These criteria offer explicit tools for computation and verification. As an application, we construct a counterexample to the inversion of adjunction for quasi-$F$-regularity and compute the quasi-$F$-split threshold of the cone over the ordinary cusp.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07729v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a nonsingular rational variety. We prove that $X\times \mathbb{C}^2$ is uniformly rational. It follows that nonsingular stably rational varieties are stably uniformly rational.</description>

      <title>K-differentials with prescribed singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.11654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.11654v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the local invariants that a meromorphic $k$-differential on a Riemann surface of genus $g \geq 0$ can have for $k \geq 3$. These local invariants include the orders of zeros and poles, as well as the $k$-residues at the poles. We show that for a given pattern of orders of zeros, there exists, with a few exceptions, a primitive holomorphic $k$-differential having zeros of these orders. In the meromorphic case, for genus $g \geq 1$, every expected tuple appears as a configuration of $k$-residues. On the other hand, for certain strata in genus zero, finitely many tuples (up to simultaneous scaling) do not occur as configurations of $k$-residues for a $k$-differential.</description>

      <title>The Hopf algebra of formal multiple polylogarithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15071v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define a Hopf algebra of polylogarithms of an arbitrary field, which is a candidate for a conjectural Hopf algebra of framed mixed Tate motives. Our definition is elementary and mimics Goncharov's construction of higher Bloch groups. We also discuss the Hodge and motivic realizations of the Hopf algebra of polylogarithms.</description>

      <title>Compact K\"{a}hler manifolds with partially semi-positive curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13155v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study MRC fibrations of compact K\"ahler manifolds with partially semi-positive curvature. We first prove that a compact K\"ahler manifold is rationally connected if its tangent bundle is BC-$p$ positive for all $1\leq p\leq \dim X$. As applications, we confirm a conjecture that any compact K\"ahler manifold with positive orthogonal Ricci curvature must be rationally connected, and generalize a result of Heier-Wong and Yang to the conformally K\"ahler case. The second result concern structure theorems for two immediate curvature conditions. We prove that, a compact K\"ahler manifold with $k$-semi-positive Ricci curvature or semi-positive $k$-scalar curvature, either the rational dimension $\geq n-k+1$ or the universal cover is biholomorphic and isometric to the product of $\mathbb{C}^m\times F$ for some rationally connected manifold $F$.</description>
