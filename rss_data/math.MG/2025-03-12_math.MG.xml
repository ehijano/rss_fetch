      <title>Smooth Approximations of Quasispheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that every quasisphere is the Gromov-Hausdorff limit of a sequence of locally smooth uniform quasispheres. We also prove an analogous result in the bi-Lipschitz setting. These generalize recent results of D. Ntalampekos to arbitrary dimension.</description>

      <title>Gromov-Hausdorff convergence of maximal Gromov hyperbolic spaces and their boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The relation between negatively curved spaces and their boundaries is important for various rigidity problems. In \cite{biswas2024quasi}, the class of Gromov hyperbolic spaces called maximal Gromov hyperbolic spaces was introduced, and the boundary functor $X \mapsto \partial X$ was shown to give an equivalence of categories between maximal Gromov hyperbolic spaces (with morphisms being isometries) and a class of compact quasi-metric spaces called quasi-metric antipodal spaces (with morphisms being Moebius homeomorphisms). The proof of this equivalence involved the construction of a filling functor $Z \mapsto {\mathcal M}(Z)$, associating to any quasi-metric antipodal space $Z$ a maximal Gromov hyperbolic space ${\mathcal M}(Z)$.
  We study the ``continuity" properties of the boundary and filling functors. We show that convergence of a sequence of quasi-metric antipodal spaces (in a certain sense called ``almost-isometric convergence") implies convergence (in the Gromov-Hausdorff sense) of the associated maximal Gromov hyperbolic spaces. Conversely, we show that convergence of maximal Gromov hyperbolic spaces together with a natural hypothesis of ``equicontinuity" on the boundaries implies convergence of boundaries. We use this to show that Gromov-Hausdorff convergence of a sequence of proper, geodesically complete CAT(-1) spaces implies Gromov-Hausdorff convergence of their boundaries equipped with visual metrics. We also show that convergence of maximal Gromov hyperbolic spaces to a maximal Gromov hyperbolic space with finite boundary implies convergence of boundaries.</description>

      <title>A note on Erd\H{o}s matrices and Marcus--Ree inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1959, Marcus and Ree proved that any bistochastic matrix $A$ satisfies $\Delta_n(A):= \max_{\sigma\in S_n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}A(i, \sigma(i))-\sum_{i, j=1}^n A(i, j)^2 \geq 0$. Erd\H{o}s asked to characterize the bistochastic matrices satisfying $\Delta_n(A)=0$. It was recently proved that there are only finitely many such matrices for any $n$. However, a complete list of such matrices was obtained in dimension $n=2, 3$ only recently, arXiv:2306.05518. In this paper, we characterize all $4\times 4$ bistochastic matrices satisfying $\Delta_4(A)=0$. Furthermore, we show that for $n\geq 3$, $\Delta_n(A)=\alpha$ has uncountably many solutions when $\alpha\notin \{0, (n-1)/4\}$. This answers a question raised in arXiv:2410.06612. We extend the Marcus$\unicode{x2013}$Ree inequality to infinite bistochastic arrays and bistochastic kernels. Our investigation into $4\times 4$ Erd\H{o}s matrices also raises several intriguing questions that are of independent interest. We propose several questions and conjectures and present numerical evidence for them.</description>

      <title>Exotic spherical flexible octahedra and counterexamples to the Modified Bellows Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2014 the author showed that in the three-dimensional spherical space, alongside with three classical types of flexible octahedra constructed by Bricard, there exists a new type of flexible octahedra, which was called exotic. In the present paper we give a geometric construction for exotic flexible octahedra, describe their configuration spaces, and calculate their volumes. We show that the volume of an exotic flexible octahedron is nonconstant during the flexion, and moreover the volume remains nonconstant if we replace any set of vertices of the octahedron with their antipodes. So exotic flexible octahedra are counterexamples to the Modified Bellows Conjecture proposed by the author in 2015.</description>

      <title>Anti-Vietoris--Rips metric thickenings and Borsuk graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08862v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For $X$ a metric space and $r\ge 0$, the \emph{anti-Vietoris--Rips metric thickening $\mathrm{AVR^m}(X;r)$} is the space of all finitely supported probability measures on $X$ whose support has spread at least $r$, equipped with an optimal transport topology. We study the anti-Vietoris--Rips metric thickenings of spheres. We have a homeomorphism $\mathrm{AVR^m}(S^n;r) \cong S^n$ for $r &gt; \pi$, a homotopy equivalence $\mathrm{AVR^m}(S^n;r) \simeq \mathbb{RP}^{n}$ for $\frac{2\pi}{3} &lt; r \le \pi$, and contractibility $\mathrm{AVR^m}(S^n;r) \simeq *$ for $r=0$. For an $n$-dimensional compact Riemannian manifold $M$, we show that the covering dimension of $\mathrm{AVR^m}(M;r)$ is at most $(n+1)p-1$, where $p$ is the packing number of $M$ at scale $r$. Hence the $k$-dimensional \v{C}ech cohomology of $\mathrm{AVR^m}(M;r)$ vanishes in all dimensions $k\geq (n+1)p$. We prove more about the topology of $\mathrm{AVR^m}(S^n;\frac{2\pi}{3})$, which has vanishing cohomology in dimensions $2n+2$ and higher. We explore connections to chromatic numbers of Borsuk graphs, and in particular we prove that for $k&gt;n$, no graph homomorphism $\mathrm{Bor}(S^k;r) \to \mathrm{Bor}(S^n;\alpha)$ exists when $\alpha &gt; \frac{2\pi}{3}$.</description>

      <title>A Combination Theorem for Geodesic Coarsely Convex Group Pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08995v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The first author and Oguni introduced a class of groups of non-positive curvature, called coarsely convex group. The recent success of the theory of groups which are hyperbolic relative to a collection of subgroups has motivated the study of other properties of groups from the relative perspective. In this article, we propose definitions for the notions of weakly semihyperbolic, semihyperbolic, and coarsely convex group pairs extending the corresponding notions in the non-relative case. The main result of this article is the following combination theorem. Let $\mathcal{A}_{wsh}$, $\mathcal{A}_{sh}$, and $\mathcal{A}_{gcc}$ denote the classes of group pairs that are weakly semihyperbolic, semihyperbolic, and geodesic coarsely convex respectively. Let $\mathcal A$ be one of the classes $\mathcal{A}_{wsh}$, $\mathcal{A}_{sh}$, and $\mathcal{A}_{gcc}$. Let $G$ be a group that splits as a finite graph of groups such that each vertex group $G_v$ is assigned a finite collection of subgroups $\mathcal{H}_v$, and each edge group $G_e$ is conjugate to a subgroup of some $H\in \mathcal{H}_v$ if $e$ is adjacent to $v$. Then there is a non-trivial finite collection of subgroups $\mathcal{H}$ of $G$ satisfying the following properties. If each $(G_v, \mathcal{H}_v)$ is in $\mathcal{A} $, then $(G,\mathcal{H})$ is in $\mathcal{A}$. The main results of the article are combination theorems generalizing results of Alonso and Bridson; and Fukaya and Matsuka.</description>

      <title>Refined algebraic domains with finite sets in the boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Refined algebraic domains are regions in the plane surrounded by finitely many non-singular real algebraic curves which may intersect with normal crossing. We are interested in shapes of such regions with surrounding real algebraic curves. Poincar'e-Reeb Graphs of them are graphs the regions naturally collapse to respecting the projection to a straight line. Such graphs were first formulated by Sorea, for example, around 2020, and regions surrounded by mutually disjoint non-singular real algebraic curves were mainly considered. The author has generalized the studies to several general situations.
  We find classes of such objects defined inductively by adding curves. We respect characteristic finite sets in the curves. We consider regions surrounded by the curves and of a new type. We investigate geometric properties and combinatorial ones of them and discuss important examples. We also previously studied explicit classes defined inductively in this way and review them.</description>

      <title>Optimal partial transport for metric pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17674v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article we study Figalli and Gigli's formulation of optimal transport between non-negative Radon measures in the setting of metric pairs. We carry over classical characterisations of optimal plans to this setting and prove that the resulting spaces of measures, $\mathcal{M}_p(X,A)$, are complete, separable and geodesic whenever the underlying space, $X$, is so. We also prove that, for $p&gt;1$, $\mathcal{M}_p(X,A)$ preserves the property of being non-branching, and for $p=2$ it preserves non-negative curvature in the Alexandrov sense. Finally, we prove isometric embeddings of generalised spaces of persistence diagrams $\mathcal{D}_p(X,A)$ into the corresponding spaces $\mathcal{M}_p(X,A)$, generalising a result by Divol and Lacombe. As an application of this framework, we show that several known geometric properties of spaces of persistence diagrams follow from those of $\mathcal{M}_p(X,A)$, including the fact that $\mathcal{D}_2(X,A)$ is an Alexandrov space of non-negative curvature whenever $X$ is a proper non-negatively curved Alexandrov space.</description>

      <title>Random zero sets with local growth guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21931v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that if $(\mathcal{M},d)$ is an $n$-point metric space that embeds quasisymmetrically into a Hilbert space, then for every $\tau&gt;0$ there is a random subset $\mathcal{Z}$ of $\mathcal{M}$ such that for any pair of points $x,y\in \mathcal{M}$ with $d(x,y)\ge \tau$, the probability that both $x\in \mathcal{Z}$ and $d(y,\mathcal{Z})\ge \beta\tau/\sqrt{1+\log (|B(y,\kappa \beta \tau)|/|B(y,\beta \tau)|)}$ is $\Omega(1)$, where $\kappa&gt;1$ is a universal constant and $\beta&gt;0$ depends only on the modulus of the quasisymmetric embedding. The proof relies on a refinement of the Arora--Rao--Vazirani rounding technique. Among the applications of this result is that the largest possible Euclidean distortion of an $n$-point subset of $\ell_1$ is $\Theta(\sqrt{\log n})$, and the integrality gap of the Goemans--Linial semidefinite program for the Sparsest Cut problem on inputs of size $n$ is $\Theta(\sqrt{\log n})$. Multiple further applications are given.</description>
