      <title>Context-sensitive hypothesis-testing and exponential families</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a number of concepts and properties related to `weighted' statistical inference where the observed data are classified in accordance with a `value' of a sample string. The motivation comes from the concepts of weighted information and weighted entropy that proved useful in industrial/microeconomic and medical statistics. We focus on applications relevant in hypothesis testing and an analysis of exponential families. Several notions, bounds and asymptotics are established, which generalize their counterparts well-known in standard statistical research. It includes Stein-Sanov theorem, Pinsker's, Bretangnole-Huber and van Trees inequalities and Kullback--Leibler, Bhattacharya, Bregman, Burbea-Rao, Chernoff, Renyi and Tsallis divergences.</description>

      <title>Complete corrected formula for generating functions of the hypergeometric distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The hypergeometric distribution is a popular distribution, whose properties have been extensively investigated. Generating functions of this distribution, such as the probability-generating function, the moment-generating function, and the characteristic function, are known to involve the Gauss hypergeometric function. We elucidate that the existing formula of generating functions is incomplete and provide the corrected formula. In view of the utility and applicability of the hypergeometric distribution, the exact and correct foundation is crucially important.</description>

      <title>Design and inference for multi-arm clinical trials with informational borrowing: the interacting urns design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper deals with a new design methodology for stratified comparative experiments based on interacting reinforced urn systems. The key idea is to model the interaction between urns for borrowing information across strata and to use it in the design phase in order to i) enhance the information exchange at the beginning of the study, when only few subjects have been enrolled and the stratum-specific information on treatments' efficacy could be scarce, ii) let the information sharing adaptively evolves via a reinforcement mechanism based on the observed outcomes, for skewing at each step the allocations towards the stratum-specific most promising treatment and iii) make the contribution of the strata with different treatment efficacy vanishing as the stratum information grows. In particular, we introduce the Interacting Urns Design, namely a new Covariate-Adjusted Response-Adaptive procedure, that randomizes the treatment allocations according to the evolution of the urn system. The theoretical properties of this proposal are described and the corresponding asymptotic inference is provided. Moreover, by a functional central limit theorem, we obtain the asymptotic joint distribution of the Wald-type sequential test statistics, which allows to sequentially monitor the suggested design in the clinical practice.</description>

      <title>Location- and scale-free procedures for distinguishing between distribution tail models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.03894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.03894v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider distinguishing between two distribution tail models when tails of one model are lighter (or heavier) than those of the other. Two procedures are proposed: one scale-free and one location- and scale-free, and their asymptotic properties are established. We show the advantage of using these procedures for distinguishing between certain tail models in comparison with the tests proposed in the literature by simulation and apply them to data on daily precipitation in Green Bay, US and Saentis, Switzerland.</description>

      <title>Multi-Scale CUSUM Tests for Time Dependent Spherical Random Fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.01392v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the asymptotic behavior of structural break tests in the harmonic domain for time dependent spherical random fields. In particular, we prove a functional central limit theorem result for the fluctuations over time of the sample spherical harmonic coefficients, under the null of isotropy and stationarity; furthermore, we prove consistency of the corresponding CUSUM test, under a broad range of alternatives, including deterministic trend, abrupt change, and a nontrivial power alternative. Our results are then applied to NCEP data on global temperature: our estimates suggest that Climate Change does not simply affect global average temperatures, but also the nature of spatial fluctuations at different scales.</description>

      <title>Symmetrisation of a class of two-sample tests by mutually considering depth ranks including functional spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.09869v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Statistical depth functions provide measures of the outlyingness, or centrality, of the elements of a space with respect to a distribution. It is a nonparametric concept applicable to spaces of any dimension, for instance, multivariate and functional. Liu and Singh (1993) presented a multivariate two-sample test based on depth-ranks. We dedicate this paper to improving the power of the associated test statistic and incorporating its applicability to functional data. In doing so, we obtain a more natural test statistic that is symmetric in both samples. We derive the null asymptotic of the proposed test statistic, also proving the validity of the testing procedure for functional data. Finally, the finite sample performance of the test for functional data is illustrated by means of a simulation study and a real data analysis on annual temperature curves of ocean drifters is executed.</description>

      <title>Monte Carlo inference for semiparametric Bayesian regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.05498v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data transformations are essential for broad applicability of parametric regression models. However, for Bayesian analysis, joint inference of the transformation and model parameters typically involves restrictive parametric transformations or nonparametric representations that are computationally inefficient and cumbersome for implementation and theoretical analysis, which limits their usability in practice. This paper introduces a simple, general, and efficient strategy for joint posterior inference of an unknown transformation and all regression model parameters. The proposed approach directly targets the posterior distribution of the transformation by linking it with the marginal distributions of the independent and dependent variables, and then deploys a Bayesian nonparametric model via the Bayesian bootstrap. Crucially, this approach delivers (1) joint posterior consistency under general conditions, including multiple model misspecifications, and (2) efficient Monte Carlo (not Markov chain Monte Carlo) inference for the transformation and all parameters for important special cases. These tools apply across a variety of data domains, including real-valued, positive, and compactly-supported data. Simulation studies and an empirical application demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of this strategy for semiparametric Bayesian analysis with linear models, quantile regression, and Gaussian processes. The R package SeBR is available on CRAN.</description>

      <title>Reverse Information Projections and Optimal E-statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.16646v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Information projections have found important applications in probability theory, statistics, and related areas. In the field of hypothesis testing in particular, the reverse information projection (RIPr) has recently been shown to lead to growth-rate optimal (GRO) e-statistics for testing simple alternatives against composite null hypotheses. However, the RIPr as well as the GRO criterion are undefined whenever the infimum information divergence between the null and alternative is infinite. We show that in such scenarios, under some assumptions, there still exists a measure in the null that is closest to the alternative in a specific sense. Whenever the information divergence is finite, this measure coincides with the usual RIPr. It therefore gives a natural extension of the RIPr to certain cases where the latter was previously not defined. This extended notion of the RIPr is shown to lead to optimal e-statistics in a sense that is a novel, but natural, extension of the GRO criterion. We also give conditions under which the (extension of the) RIPr is a strict sub-probability measure, as well as conditions under which an approximation of the RIPr leads to approximate e-statistics. For this case we provide tight relations between the corresponding approximation rates.</description>

      <title>Causal Effect Estimation after Propensity Score Trimming with Continuous Treatments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.00706v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Propensity score trimming, which discards subjects with propensity scores below a threshold, is a common way to address positivity violations that complicate causal effect estimation. However, most works on trimming assume treatment is discrete and models for the outcome regression and propensity score are parametric. This work proposes nonparametric estimators for trimmed average causal effects in the case of continuous treatments based on efficient influence functions. For continuous treatments, an efficient influence function for a trimmed causal effect does not exist, due to a lack of pathwise differentiability induced by trimming and a continuous treatment. Thus, we target a smoothed version of the trimmed causal effect for which an efficient influence function exists. Our resulting estimators exhibit doubly-robust style guarantees, with error involving products or squares of errors for the outcome regression and propensity score, which allows for valid inference even when nonparametric models are used. Our results allow the trimming threshold to be fixed or defined as a quantile of the propensity score, such that confidence intervals incorporate uncertainty involved in threshold estimation. These findings are validated via simulation and an application, thereby showing how to efficiently-but-flexibly estimate trimmed causal effects with continuous treatments.</description>
