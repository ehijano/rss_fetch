      <title>AI/ML-Driven Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) and Spectroscopy: Materials Interfaces and Autonomous Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This review explores the evolution of Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) spectroscopy and sensing, transitioning from fundamental studies of adsorption-desorption kinetics to the sophisticated sensing with Electropolymerized Molecularly Imprinted Polymers (E-MIPs). A significant portion of our previous research focuses on the optical properties, electrochromism of polymer dielectrics, and structure-order correlation in polymer brushes and hierarchical ultrathin films. We then address the transformative impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) in data interpretation, culminating in the conceptualization of Self-Driving Labs (SDLs). The importance of generating high-quality training data through high-throughput experimentation (THE) with the SPR is a possibility. These autonomous systems represent the future of materials science, enabling the rapid, closed-loop discovery and optimization of next-generation SPR sensors and analytical methods. This overview highlights the trajectory for integrating conventional experimental design with AI-driven sensing and analytical chemistry across materials and biomedical applications.</description>

      <title>Buried Stressor Engineering for Position-Controlled InGaAs Quantum Dots with Local Density Variation for Integrated Quantum Photonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the monolithic, two-step epitaxial growth of site-controlled InGaAs quantum dots via the buried stressor method with local quantum dot density variation. As a result of high fabrication accuracy, we achieve low lateral displacements of the individual buried stressor apertures of $ 17^{+19}_{-17}$~nm from mesa centers. We provide extensive micro-photoluminescence and cathodoluminescence characterization of the site-controlled quantum dots and give theoretical calculations, explaining the effect of the stressor aperture on the quantum dot emission properties, positioning, and density. We show reproducibility of the nucleation process for apertures of the same size and achieve precisely-positioned, low- and high-density quantum dot nucleation within one active layer growth step. The results presented in this work demonstrate the significant potential of the buried stressor concept in fabricating single photonic chips, simultaneously combining single-photon sources and microlasers featuring different local densities of site-controlled quantum dots, paving the way for highly functional source modules with applications in photonic quantum technology.</description>

      <title>Tuning of Atomic Layer Deposition Pulse Time through Physics-Informed Bayesian Active Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) process development is often hindered by time-consuming and precursor-intensive tuning cycles required to identify saturation conditions. We introduce a physics-informed Bayesian Active Learning (BAL) framework that autonomously tunes precursor pulse times by integrating a Langmuir adsorption model directly into the Gaussian Process (GP) kernel. A key innovation is a two-stage parameter estimation strategy that decouples noise filtering from physical parameter extraction: the GP first smooths noisy data through standard prediction, then Langmuir parameters are fitted to the noise-filtered GP predictions. This approach effectively separates signal from experimental noise. We evaluate the framework against a standard data-driven GP across four simulated regimes, demonstrating convergence within five iterations, up to fourfold improvement in prediction accuracy, and two to fourfold reduction in precursor usage. Experimental validation using TiO2 deposition via Tetrakisdimethylamido Titanium (TDMAT) and ozone confirms that the physics-informed model accurately identifies saturation times for high-coverage targets ($\geq$95\%), with observed deviations at lower saturation levels providing valuable insight into non-ideal desorption behaviors.</description>

      <title>When Atoms Choose Their Neighbors: Element-Specific Views of Local Chemical Order in High-Entropy Alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Local chemical order (LCO) is a key descriptor linking composition, atomic arrangement, and function in high-entropy alloys (HEAs), yet remains difficult to quantify. This Perspective highlights how X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) provides element-specific, quantitative insight into LCO in complex alloys. We outline practical considerations for XAS data collection and fitting, including width of spectra range, multi-temperature analysis, and X-ray absorption edge choice for 5d elements. We then highlight a coordination-number-based framework for LCO analysis and use model HEAs to show how single-atom and near-single-atom motifs naturally emerge as component number increases, bridging HEAs and single-atom alloys. Finally, we identify priorities including standardized protocols, uncertainty quantification, expanded operando and time-resolved XAS, and integration with complementary characterization and modelling.</description>

      <title>Real-time vacancy concentration evolution revealed via heavy ion irradiation experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that in situ ion irradiation transient grating spectroscopy (I3TGS) can be used to monitor the real-time evolution of vacancy concentration generated by self-ion radiation damage in Cu-based alloys. Surface acoustic wave (SAW) frequencies are shown, using a combination of theory and experiment, to reveal vacancy concentrations and their kinetics in real-time. These results are shown to agree with corresponding kinetic Monte Carlo simulations at similar temperatures and dose rates. These results suggest the utility of TGS as a non-contact, non-destructive tool for real-time defect monitoring.</description>

      <title>A ReaxFF-based thermomechanical analysis of N-carbophenes: phase-change, thermal expansion, and high temperature synthesis pathway</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: N-carbophenes are a class of two-dimensional covalent organic frameworks with potential for solid-state gas storage and as 2D topological materials. Previous studies have demonstrated that variations in their bonding, topology, and functionalization enable the tuning of their chemical, electrical, and mechanical properties. Yet, the thermal stability and high-temperature behavior of pristine and functionalized N-carbophenes remain unexplored. Using ReaxFF-based reactive molecular dynamics (RMD) simulations with extensive statistical validation, we performed temperature-ramp MD simulations of pristine and functionalized N-carbophenes. We demonstrate that N-carbophenes remain stable up to temperatures above 1000 K. The phase-change onset temperatures decrease as the N-phenylene chain length increases in pristine N-carbophenes, attributed to increasing antiaromaticity in the central phenylene segments, thereby contributing to the foundational understanding of aromatic versus antiaromatic bonding in 2D carbon networks, a topic of considerable interest in theoretical chemistry. Pristine N-carbophenes exhibit negative area thermal expansion (NATE), whereas functional groups modulate this, leading to either negative or positive expansion. Functional groups remain stably bonded well above the transition temperature. We also show that a temperature-induced phase transition from graphenylene (2-carbophene) to {\gamma}-graphyne is possible. Our results provide upper bounds on N-carbophene stability, clarify the relationships between structure and thermal properties, and identify a new transformation pathway. These results will have applications in tunable band gaps, porous architectures, or chemically accessible sites.</description>

      <title>EXAFS studies of the local environment of lead and selenium atoms in PbTe$_{1-x}$Se$_x$ solid solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: EXAFS spectroscopy is used to study the local environment of lead and selenium atoms in PbTe$_{1-x}$Se$_x$ solid solution. In addition to a bimodal distribution of bond lengths in the first shell, unusually large Debye--Waller factors for the Pb--Pb interatomic distances in the second shell and a substantial deviation of these distances from Vegard's law are observed. Valence force field (VFF) calculations show that these observations are due to the complex structure of the distribution function for Pb--Pb distances. It is found that the number of Se--Se pairs in the second shell surpasses the statistical value, which indicates that chemical factors play an important role in the structure of the solid solution. The contribution of these chemical factors to the enthalpy of mixing of the solid is estimated to be approximately 0.5 kcal/mole, which is comparable to the strain contribution.</description>

      <title>Beam-Offset Thermoreflectance with Bayesian Optimization to Measure the Anisotropic Thermal Properties of Semiconductor Superlattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The directional nature of heat conduction in semiconductor superlattices--marked by significant differences between in-plane and cross-plane pathways--poses substantial challenges for precise thermal property assessment. Conventional frequency-domain thermoreflectance (FDTR) techniques, while proficient at evaluating cross-plane thermal conductivity, suffer from restricted capability in resolving in-plane transport due to inherent phase-delay constraints and inadequate lateral resolution. In this investigation, we establish a non-contact beam-offset FDTR (BO-FDTR) approach that concurrently determines both directional thermal conductivities within layered semiconductor architectures. Our methodology implements spatial separation between excitation and detection beams while utilizing coupled normalized amplitude and phase responses as analytical inputs, thereby improving discrimination between anisotropic thermal parameters. We combine this experimental configuration with a Bayesian optimization scheme incorporating Gaussian Process Regression (BO-GPR) to reduce estimation inaccuracies, attaining measurement uncertainties under 1% to 2% at 95% confidence intervals. This technique demonstrates particular efficacy for intricate multilayer nanostructures, furnishing a structured protocol for superlattice thermal evaluation. Experimental characterization of an AlAs/GaAs superlattice (period thickness 52 nm) delivers thermal conductivity values of 14.7 W m-1 K-1 (cross-plane) and 37.4 W m-1 K-1 (in-plane). Our findings indicate that integrating frequency sweeps with varied beam offset locations yields superior measurement precision, exceeding conventional single-variable methods and confirming thermal assessment validity across both geometric arrangements.</description>

      <title>Layer-number parity induced topological phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that stacking topologically trivial layers, under enforced symmetry restrictions, yields emergent topological phases with protected boundary states. Remarkably, the number of layers itself acts as a topological switch, enabling the system to host topological bound states in the continuum (BICs). We analytically show that the spectrum becomes gapless for an odd number of layers; combined with entanglement-spectrum calculations, this confirms that odd-layer systems indeed support topological BICs. We provide experimental confirmation of these phenomena in stacked acoustic lattices. Our findings establish a previously overlooked pathway to topology and demonstrate a readily applicable strategy for realizing exotic states in a wide range of artificial material systems.</description>

      <title>Work-hardening exhaustion as the origin of low toughness in L-PBF alloys: A case study on the role of intrinsic vs. extrinsic defects in SS316L</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF) additive manufacturing offers a remarkable balance of strength and ductility across many structural alloys. However, L-PBF alloys often display much lower fracture toughness, in some cases up to 70% below conventionally wrought counterparts. The reasons for this toughness paradox have remained elusive, since conventional tools cannot directly visualize sub-surface microscale deformation processes that govern crack growth. Here we apply scanning 3D X-ray diffraction and phase contrast tomography to simultaneously capture microstructural evolution with 1 micron resolution near an advancing crack tip, utilizing 316L stainless steel as a model system. We demonstrate that the toughness paradox is not solely a consequence of extrinsic processing defects or residual stresses, but rather an intrinsic failure to relax crack-tip stresses via plasticity. While wrought material facilitates stable crack-tip blunting through localized dislocation accumulation, the L-PBF material undergoes premature work-hardening saturation that triggers extreme stress partitioning and high stress triaxiality. This results in a transition from ductile blunting to a sharp, unstable fracture mode. These findings identify work-hardening exhaustion as a systemic vulnerability inherent to L-PBF microstructures, where the exceptional initial dislocation density required for high yield strength acts as a saturation ceiling for damage tolerance. This work provides a physical basis for adapting damage models to L-PBF metals and challenges the assumption that high tensile ductility guarantees fracture resistance in rapidly solidified components.</description>

      <title>A computationally efficient approach for predicting the transport properties of transition-metal alloys at elevated temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel phenomenological framework for an efficient estimation of the thermo-electric properties at room temperature and elevated temperatures of body-centered cubic (BCC) transition metal concentrated alloys is proposed in this work. The methodology is used to predict the electrical resistivity of BCC systems with our predictions showing excellent correlation with experimental data. This framework is further extended to predict the electrical resistivity $\rho$, thermal conductivity $\kappa$ and the specific heat capacity Cp of BCC alloys in the temperature range of 300-1300 K and the results are validated against experimental data. We demonstrate the capabilities of this model by using it to predict the thermo-electric properties of a concentrated W53Ta42V5 alloy which shows a saturation in the electrical resistivity $\rho$ in the temperature range 300K-1300K. This model is then used to predict the properties of another concentrated Nb$_4$0Mo$_4$0Ta$_2$0 alloy in the same temperature regime.</description>

      <title>Hidden Chiral Ferroelectricity in AgNbO$_3$ Perovskite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AgNbO$_3$ is a lead-free perovskite with considerable potential for energy storage and optoelectronic applications, yet its low-temperature crystal structure has remained controversial. In this Letter, we revisit its low-energy structural landscape using a systematic first-principles structural search based on symmetry-adapted phonon-mode theory. We uncover a previously unreported chiral ferroelectric phase with space group $R3$, which exhibits a large spontaneous polarization and a low polarization switching barrier, enabling polarization reversal under electric fields. Crucially, the structural chirality of this phase is intrinsically locked to the ferroelectric polarization, allowing electrical control of the chiral handedness. Consequently, chiral optical responses--including circular dichroism, circular photogalvanic effect, optical activity, and second-order nonlinear optics--can be reversibly switched by an external electric field. These results not only clarify the complex low-temperature structural behavior of AgNbO$_3$ but also establish a rare purely inorganic platform for electric-field-tunable chirality, opening a pathway toward ultrafast, electrically controlled chiral optoelectronics.</description>

      <title>Giant Out-of-Plane Magnetic Orbital Torque of Altermagnets from Spin-Group Symmetry Breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To search for nontrivial spintronic characters of altermagnets has been a focus in spintronics, with numerous attentions paid to spin-group symmetry dictated non-relativistic effects, such as the spin-splitting torque (SST). Here, we go beyond this paradigm by unveiling the magnetic orbital torque (MOT) that is enabled only by spin-group symmetry breaking of real altermagnets with spin-orbit coupling. This effect enables generating unconventional out-of-plane orbital current with collinear orbital polarization from all 10 spin Laue groups of centrosymmetric altermagnets, which is critical for field-free manipulation of perpendicular magnetization that is a key for next-generation information technology. We reveal perturbative and non-perturbative effects of spin-group symmetry breaking, and unveil that MOT is a much more generic effect of real altermagnets than SST. Our first-principles calculations predict giant out-of-plane MOTs at room temperature in the absence of and competing with SST in experimentally identified altermagnets CrSb and FeSb2, respectively. These findings uncover new fundamental physics in altermagnetic spintronics, and open up broad vistas of altermagnets in magnetic memory.</description>

      <title>Constrained Diffusion for Accelerated Structure Relaxation of Inorganic Solids with Point Defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Point defects affect material properties by altering electronic states and modifying local bonding environments. However, high-throughput first-principles simulations of point defects are costly due to large simulation cells and complex energy landscapes. To this end, we propose a generative framework for simulating point defects, overcoming the limits of costly first-principles simulators. By leveraging a primal-dual algorithm, we introduce a constraint-aware diffusion model which outperforms existing constrained diffusion approaches in this domain. Across six defect configuration settings for Bi2Te3, the proposed approach provides state-of-the-art performance generating physically grounded structures.</description>

Abstract: For the first time, the field dependences of the magnetoresistance of a textured polycrystalline Bi$_{88.08}$Mn$_{11.92}$ sample were investigated in the $H \perp I$ and $H \parallel I$ configurations, and the results were compared with those previously obtained for the solid solution Bi$_{95.69}$Mn$_{3.69}$Fe$_{0.62}$ with a lower manganese concentration. It was demonstrated that the magnetoresistance field dependencies for Bi$_{88.08}$Mn$_{11.92}$ differ significantly from those of Bi$_{95.69}$Mn$_{3.69}$Fe$_{0.62}$ below 100 K, becoming nearly identical as the temperature approaches room temperature. It was established that the maximum relative magnetoresistance values for Bi$_{88.08}$Mn$_{11.92}$ are observed at a magnetic field of 90 kOe and a temperature of 100 K in both the $H \perp I$ and $H \parallel I$ configurations, amounting to 3170\% and 380\%, respectively. These values are significantly lower than those previously reported for the solid solution containing less manganese (Bi$_{95.69}$Mn$_{3.69}$Fe$_{0.62}$), which were 3877\% and 742\%, respectively. Analysis of the results indicates that differences in field dependence among the studied materials are associated with varying amounts of magnetic $\alpha$-BiMn. The anomalous magnetoresistance behavior, as compared with that of pure bismuth, is attributed to the influence of internal magnetism on electrical transport within the bismuth matrix of the studied solid solutions.</description>

      <title>Unraveling the temperature-responsive charge-disproportionation in BaBiO$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study shows that the charge disproportionation at the Bi site in BaBiO$_3$ alters as a function of temperature. Decreasing the temperature from 300K down to 160K leads to a significant modification of the density of states corresponding to the Bi-O hybridized band near the Fermi level (E$_\text{F}$). This modification indicates reduction of Bi 6$sp$ - O 2$p$ hybridization and O 2$p$ spectral weight near E$_\text{F}$. The strong decrement of covalency at lower temperatures is accompanied by a decrement in O 2$p$ hole density due to possible charge transfer from Bi 6$s$ to the O 2$p$ band. Bi-charge state analysis from Bi-4$f$ core-level spectra showed that at 300K, $\delta$ (charge difference between alternate Bi sites) value in 4$\pm\delta$ is much less than at 160K, which reveals the transition towards the ionic nature of CD or static CD in BBO at low temperature. On the other hand, O 1$s$ core-level spectra displayed an asymmetric shape, and temperature-dependent modifications of the asymmetric shape and intensity have been observed. This highlights the significant influence of the O 2$p$ band hole on the dynamical CD at the Bi site.</description>

      <title>Dual energy-differentiated topological transition in artificial red phosphorus chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the spectral and transport properties of an atomic chain of red phosphorus. We reveal the separation of flat-band states from the rest of the system and calculate its energy bands analytically. The topological properties of the system are established through the evaluation of the Berry (Zak) phase of the energy bands, revealing nontrivial topology. The Berry phase depends on the relative strength of the hopping parameters and exhibits dual energy-dependent topological phase transitions. Remarkably, the emergence of inert band edges provides a direct spectral signature of these transitions, acting as energy-resolved indicators of the redistribution of topological charge between bands. The existence of the associated edge states is proved numerically for finite lattices. The theoretical predictions, particularly the band structure and the existence of edge states, are further confirmed by numerical simulations of red phosphorus through a phononic lattice in the form of a highly structured aluminum plate.</description>

      <title>Improving Reliability of Machine Learned Interatomic Potentials With Physics-Informed Pretraining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have emerged as powerful tools for molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with their competitive accuracy and computational efficiency. However, MLIPs are often observed to exhibit un-physical behavior when encountering configurations which deviate significantly from their training data distribution, leading to simulation instabilities and unreliable dynamics, thus limiting the reliability of MLIPs for materials simulations. We present a physics-informed pretraining strategy that leverages simple physical potentials which can improve the robustness and stability of graph-based MLIPs for MD simulations. We demonstrate this approach by deploying a pretraining-finetuning pipeline where MLIPs are initially pretrained on data labelled with embedded atom model potentials and subsequently finetuned on the quantum mechanical ground truth data. By evaluating across three diverse material systems (phosphorus, silica, and a subset of Materials Project) and three representative MLIP architectures (CGCNN, M3GNet, and TorchMD-NET), we find that this physics-informed pretraining consistently improves both prediction accuracy as well as stability in MD compared to the baselines.</description>

      <title>Rotational anisotropy Raman spectrometer for high-sensitivity crystallographic symmetry analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Raman spectroscopy stands as a cornerstone technique for probing collective excitations and emergent quantum phases in solids. While polarization-resolved Raman scattering has been widely used to extract symmetry information of eigenmodes, its conventional geometry suffers from significant limitations: it accesses only a subset of Raman tensor elements, enforces {\pi}-periodic intensity patterns that obscure intrinsic crystalline symmetries, and lacks sensitivity to wavevector-dependent anisotropy. To overcome these constraints, here we introduce rotational-anisotropy Raman spectroscopy (RA-Raman). By measuring scattering intensity during full azimuthal rotation of the optical scattering plane at oblique incidence, this geometry enables complete reconstruction of the Raman tensor and reveals rich rotational anisotropy patterns essential for accessing subtle symmetry information elusive to conventional methods. We developed a prototype instrument to validate this approach experimentally. For centrosymmetric crystals, RA-Raman unambiguously identifies phonon symmetry representations and determines crystallographic axes. In noncentrosymmetric crystals, it resolves directional anisotropy and angular dispersion of phonon-polaritons, enabling quantitative determination of the Faust-Henry coefficient and the separation of deformation-potential and electro-optic scattering contributions. By demonstrating unprecedented symmetry-resolving power in standard benchmark crystals, we establish RA-Raman as a powerful tool with far-reaching potential to discover and characterize symmetry-breaking phases and topological excitations in quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Coherent Phonon-Driven Band Renormalizations in 1T$'$-MoTe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here, we investigate phonon mode- and electron band-selective electron-phonon couplings in centrosymmetric 1T$'$-MoTe$_2$ using time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy combined with frequency-domain analysis. Femtosecond near-infrared pulses excite coherent $A_g$-symmetric phonon modes at 2.34 THz, 3.34 THz, and 3.86 THz, which manifest as oscillatory modulations in photoemission intensity and binding energy across the valence bands. Pixel-wise Fourier analysis using recently developed methodologies reveals pronounced band selectivity with distinct coupling strengths for different electronic states and phonon modes, enabling the evaluation of band-renormalization amplitudes in the range of few meV. Ab initio calculations qualitatively reproduce the experimentally observed coupling patterns and relative trends, demonstrating the capability of combined experimental and theoretical approaches to resolve ultrafast electron-phonon interactions in quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Theory of strained quantum emitters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.19640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Defects in semiconductors acting as optically active spin qubits are intriguing objects of fundamental study and future technological developments. These defect-based color centers are of particular interest for detection and response to physical variations such as pressure and strain. To investigate the defect emission response to strain, we have studied the vibrational structure of the negatively charged silicon vacancy ($\mathrm{V_{Si}^{-}}$) in 4H-SiC under applied tensile and compressive uniaxial strain using first-principles calculations. The strain variations of the emission spectrum can be explained by differing responses of bulk-like and quasi-localized vibrational modes. In particular, substantial differences are found between the hexagonal ($h$) and quasicubic ($k$) configurations of $\mathrm{V_{Si}^{-}}$ in 4H-SiC that result in a strain-induced improvement of the Debye-Waller factor for $\mathrm{V_{Si}^{-}}(h)$ under $+2\%$ uniaxial strain along the $a$-axis of 4H-SiC. Finally, strain-dependent changes in the phonon sideband enable distinguishing between compressive and tensile strain, opening up the possibility of magnetic field-free strain detection using only spin-conserving transitions of solid-state quantum emitters.</description>

      <title>Investigation of Corroded T91 Steel in Static Lead-Bismuth Eutectic Under an Oxidising Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding corrosion in liquid metal-cooled nuclear systems is tantamount to controlling it. While much literature exists detailing corrosion rates and mechanisms of structural materials in liquid metals, much still remains to be discovered in new regimes of temperature, chemistry, and impurity levels. We focus on a less-studied set of conditions, specifically to investigate how liquid lead-bismuth eutectic (LBE) corrodes ferritic/martensitic steels in high-temperature oxidizing conditions. We find that corrosion follows grain boundaries, transitioning from intergranular attack to broader area corrosion as it progresses. Both the Cr and oxygen diffusion play vital roles in this process. Mechanistically speaking, the ingress of LBE induces regions of martensitic decomposition to ferrite via localized Cr depletion, somewhat blunting or slowing the corrosion from occurring. A stable, coherent oxide scale appears to be the deciding factor controlling whether intergranular LBE attack occurs or not. Most surprisingly, a layer of Fe enriched BCC phase forms on the surface of LBE-corroded T91 at these conditions, contradicting previous studies, including our own, which reported oxide-based surface layers.</description>

      <title>Strain- and Field-Tunable Nonrelativistic Spin Splitting and Wave-Symmetry-Dependent Spin Transport in Twisted Bilayer Altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetism-driven nonrelativistic spin splitting (NRSS) provides a pathway toward efficient, spin-orbit-free spintronics. In centrosymmetric two-dimensional antiferromagnets, spin-polarized transport is symmetry-forbidden due to the combined space-time inversion ($PT$) symmetry. Here, by employing first-principles density functional theory and spin-group symmetry analysis, we demonstrate that twisting two antiferromagnetic or ferromagnetic monolayers of CoCl$_2$, AX$_2$ (A = Mn, V; X = Cl, Br, I), NiF$_2$, NiBr$_2$, FeS, CoS, MnTe$_2$, MnSe$_2$, and RuSe induces finite NRSS even in the absence of spin-orbit coupling. The relative twist breaks $[C_2||P]$ and $[E||C_{nz}]$ symmetries, giving rise to momentum-dependent spin polarization with distinct $d$-, $g$-, and $i$-wave altermagnetic patterns across the Brillouin zone. Using symmetry-invariant $k\cdot p$ modeling, we extract linear spin-splitting coefficients $\alpha^{(1)}$ ranging from 800-1100 meV\AA{}, comparable to SOC-induced Rashba-Dresselhaus strengths observed in noncentrosymmetric semiconductors. An out-of-plane electric field ($\mathcal{E}_z$) introduces Zeeman-type band splitting up to 110 meV at 10 MV/cm, while biaxial strain tunes the NRSS magnitude nearly linearly without altering symmetry. Crucially, the strain $u_{xx-yy}$ reduces the spin point group symmetry and drives reversible $g/i \rightarrow d$ wave-type transitions, resulting in finite spin conductivity and an enhanced spin-splitter angle (up to 18$^\circ$). These results extend the concept of altermagnetism to twisted bilayer geometries and establish a general route for realizing exchange-driven, nonrelativistic spin currents through symmetry engineering without requiring heavy elements or spin-orbit coupling.</description>

      <title>Twist-induced altermagnetism in a metallic van der Waals antiferromagnet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.19734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnetism -a magnetic state characterized by spin-polarized electronic bands at zero net magnetization- offers a promising route for next-generation spintronic devices. In two-dimensional (2D) magnets, twist engineering enables its realization by breaking the combined inversion and time-reversal symmetry (PT) while preserving crystal symmetries that ensure the altermagnetic order. Here, by means of first-principles calculations and symmetry analysis, we demonstrate that twist engineering applied to the recently synthesized metallic van der Waals antiferromagnet Co-doped bilayer Fe$_3$GaTe$_2$ (Fe$_2$CoGaTe$_2$) provides a robust platform for altermagnetism. By twisting two layers of Fe$_2$CoGaTe$_2$, the PT symmetry between opposite spin sublattices is broken, resulting in a non-relativistic $i$-wave altermagnetic state with spin splitting up to 138 meV. In the absence of spin-orbit coupling (SOC), the electronic states are spin-degenerate along six high-symmetry directions, while the inclusion of SOC preserves this degeneracy along the three directions protected by twofold rotation axes. Furthermore, we unveil the microscopic mechanisms governing the magnetic behavior in twisted Fe$_2$CoGaTe$_2$. Our results establish twist engineering and metallic Fe-based van der Waals antiferromagnets as versatile platforms to realize 2D van der Waals altermagnetism, with potential for designing high-efficiency ultrathin nanodevices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.19793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magneto-optical materials are indispensable across modern physics, serving as the foundation for precision magnetic sensing, nonreciprocal photonics, and optical isolation technologies. The continual pursuit of materials with high Verdet constants has driven the development of garnet-based compounds exhibiting extreme magneto-optical sensitivity. In this work, we report the growth and comprehensive magneto-optical characterization of bismuth-substituted lutetium iron garnet (LuBiIG), a material that combines the large spin-orbit coupling of bismuth with the lattice stability of lutetium iron garnet. The films exhibit an exceptionally high Verdet constant of up to -0.120 deg/um/mT, peaking in the visible spectral range near 520nm. LuBiIG films with thicknesses between 80 and 220nm were grown by pulsed laser deposition and characterized at room temperature over the 500-820nm wavelength range. These results position LuBiIG as a highly sensitive magneto-optical material suitable for advanced cryogenic detection and hybrid quantum applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.19820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a first-principles modeling of the beta-Ga2O3/3C-SiC interface that takes into account the reconstructions occurring at the 3C-SiC (001) surface by oxidation, aiming to mimic the actual deposition process under the best structural and thermodynamic conditions. Using density functional theory calculations, we systematically investigate the interface configurations between beta-Ga2O3 (100) and both Si- and C-terminated 3C-SiC (001) substrates, considering realistic oxidation states that form at the SiC surface prior to epitaxial growth. Our analysis evaluates different stacking sequences and atomic-scale bonding arrangements, computing adhesion energies for various interface geometries to determine their relative thermodynamic stability. This work addresses the critical need for understanding beta-Ga2O3 integration on substrates with superior thermal conductivity, providing a theoretical framework for optimizing heteroepitaxial growth conditions in ultra-wide-bandgap power electronics applications.</description>

Abstract: Tip-Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (TERS) provides nanoscale chemical fingerprints alongside high-resolution topographic mapping of molecules, offering a powerful tool for materials discovery. However, TERS image datasets are challenging to interpret and typically demand time-consuming, computationally intensive quantum-chemistry calculations. To overcome this problem, we present an encoder-decoder model trained and evaluated on simulated TERS images of planar molecules, enabling direct prediction of molecular structures from spectral simulated data with high accuracy. Our approach demonstrates the feasibility of automating molecular structure identification from TERS images, bypassing traditional manual analysis. These findings provide a foundation for extending machine learning methods to experimental TERS datasets, potentially accelerating molecular discovery by integrating nanoscale spectroscopy with automated computational analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.19955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photoemission, from core levels and valence band, and low-energy electron diffraction (LEED) have been employed to investigate the electronic and structural properties of novel graphene-ferromagnetic (G-FM) systems,obtained by intercalation of one mono-layer (1ML) and several layers (4ML) of Co on G grown on Ir(111). Upon intercalation of 1ML of Co, the Co lattice is resized to match the Ir-Ir lattice parameter, resulting in a mismatched G/Co/Ir(111) system. The intercalation of further Co layers leads to a relaxation of the Co lattice and a progressive formation of a commensurate G layer lying on top. We show the C 1s line shape and the band structure of G in the two artificial phases, mismatched and commensurate G/Co, through a comparison with the electronic structure of G grown directly on a Co thick film. Our results show that while the G valence band mainly reflects the hybridization with the d states of Co, regardless of the structural phase, the C 1s line shape is very sensitive to the rumpling of the G layer and the coordination of carbon atoms with the underlying Co. Even in the commensurate (1x1) G/Co phase, where graphene is in register with the Co film, from the angular dependence of the C 1s core level we infer the presence of a double component, due to in-equivalent adsorption sites of carbon sub-lattices.</description>

      <title>Cr3+ spin dynamics under the octahedral crystal field in van der Waals antiferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The magnetic moment in van der Waals (vdW) materials containing 3d transition metals originates from unpaired d-electron spins and their interaction with surrounding ligands. The interplay between exchange interactions and magnetic anisotropy stabilizes long-range ordering of such moments. The compound CuCrP2S6 (CCPS) presents an interesting class of vdW solids where the coupling of Cr3+ moments and ordering of Cu1+ ions give rise to a multiferroic ground state. Here we investigate the spin dynamics of Cr3+ ions in CCPS through magnetization and broadband as well as single sub-THz magnetic resonance measurements. The orbital moment of Cr3+ is quenched under the octahedral crystal field of surrounding chalcogen ions, resulting in negligible magnetic anisotropy-a feature common to Cr-based vdW antiferromagnets (AFM). Resonance spectra over a wide frequency-field-temperature range reveal quasi-2D AFM dynamics governed mainly by isotropic Cr-Cr exchange interactions, which determine the magnetic order, spin reorientation, and damping. Sub-THz resonance spectra also uncover a field-induced ferromagnetic polarization, highlighting the universal role of Cr-Cr exchange in layered Cr compounds. Moreover, persistent magnetic correlations far above the N\'eel temperature (TN ~ 32 K) points to short-range magnetic order in CCPS and motivates future studies of a possible interplay between AFM and antiferroelectric orders. These results establish CCPS as an exemplary system for exploring 2D magnetism and electric-field-tunable spintronic functionalities in layered multiferroics.</description>

      <title>The effect of the A-site cation on the phase transition temperature of metal halide perovskites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A key challenge for the practical application of metal halide perovskites (MHPs) is the instability of the desired perovskite phase relative to the optically non-active $\delta$ phase. To determine the phase stability, we previously developed a procedure to compute the harmonic free energy as a function of temperature, which was suited for CsPbI$_3$ but fails when Cs is replaced by organic cations due to their rotational freedom. Herein we propose a multistep thermodynamic integration (TI) approach that corrects the harmonic free energy to obtain the Gibbs free energy. Given the abundance of local minima in these materials, we employ replica exchange to prevent simulations from getting trapped, while introducing an intermediate potential energy surface to improve convergence and reduce computational cost. Benchmarking energy and forces from different exchange-correlation functionals and dispersion methods against high-level RPA+HF calculations identifies PBE+D3(BJ) as the best trade-off between accuracy, computational efficiency, and precision. To perform molecular dynamics simulations within the TI framework, it was necessary to train a machine learning potential using the MACE architecture on ab initio data calculated with density functional theory. Our results show that, for all three materials, the free energy difference between the $\gamma$ and $\delta$ phases exhibits a very similar temperature dependence. This suggests that phase stability is primarily governed by differences in ground-state energy, rather than by material-specific thermal effects. Beyond these three materials, our methodology provides a robust framework for investigating the phase behavior of other MHPs, paving the way for the discovery of more stable perovskites.</description>

      <title>Tunable dislocations overcome mechano-functional tradeoff in perovskite oxides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in dislocation engineering are reshaping the traditional view towards ceramics being brittle. Here, we use KTaO3 (KTO), a perovskite oxide that is newly discovered with room-temperature bulk plasticity, and demonstrate that the seeded dislocations can effectively tune both mechanical and functional properties. We uncover a novel brittle-ductile-brittle (BDB) transition: low dislocation densities lead to brittle failure, intermediate densities (~10*14 m-2) enable superior ductility with strains over 20%, and high dislocation densities (~10*15 m-2) induce again brittle fracture. This dislocation density-dependent non-monotonic mechanical response challenges the traditional behavior of ceramics and offers new design opportunities. Furthermore, dislocation densities can monotonically decrease thermal conductivity, revealing a tradeoff between mechanical strength and functionality. The findings reveal a critical threshold of dislocation density in optimizing the performance of functional oxides, and provide a new framework for using dislocations to design advanced materials where mechanical durability and enhanced functionality are intertwined.</description>

      <title>Microstructural Evolution and Crystallization Behavior of Amorphous Medium-Entropy Ti-Nb-Zr-Ag Thin Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Improving the performance of metallic implants increasingly relies on the development of multifunctional surface modifications that combine structural stability, bioactivity, and prevention of bacterial colonization. Medium-entropy alloys (MEAs) represent a promising approach for such coatings, as their chemical complexity allows the formation of structurally stable matrices with tunable properties. In this study, Ti-Nb-Zr and Ti-Nb-Zr-Ag thin films were deposited by magnetron sputtering and subjected to annealing at temperatures of up to 1100 $^{\circ}$C to evaluate the influence of Ag, added for its antibacterial potential, on structural evolution. The as-deposited Ag-free film was fully amorphous, whereas the Ag-containing film exhibited a predominantly amorphous matrix with finely dispersed crystalline nanoparticles, indicating that Ag promoted early-stage crystallization. Both films displayed a fine columnar morphology (column diameter $\sim$15 nm) with dome-like protrusions, a hierarchical surface structure favorable for protein adhesion. Upon annealing, the Ag-free film recrystallized into a granular, loosely packed morphology, while the Ag-containing film retained a compact structure, demonstrating the stabilizing role of Ag. These findings underscore the potential of Ag-containing amorphous MEAs for forming multifunctional coatings with enhanced thermal stability, antibacterial functionality, and biointerface-relevant surface features for advanced biomedical applications.</description>

      <title>Role of octahedral tilting induced acoustic softening on limiting thermal transport in SrSnO3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Octahedral tilting is a fundamental structural distortion in perovskites, governing key phenomena such as lattice stabilizing, soft phonon dynamics, group-theoretical analysis, phase transitions, ferroelectricity, and even for tunable electronic band gap. However, its influence on lattice thermal conductivity (kL) remains poorly understood. In the archetypal perovskite SrTiO3, tilting in the low-temperature tetragonal phase is known to enhance kL by suppressing specific phonon scattering channels around 200 cm-1. Here, we investigate the thermal transport in strontium stannate (SrSnO3), another perovskite oxide that undergoes temperature-driven phase transitions, and reveal a completely opposite effect. Through a systematic study across its orthorhombic, tetragonal, and cubic phases, we demonstrate that octahedral tilting in the tetragonal phase of SrSnO3 anomalously triggers acoustic phonon softening. This softening manifests as reduced frequencies and group velocities in low-frequency (&lt;3 THz) acoustic modes, creating a large decrease for heat transport, particularly along the c-axis. Consequently, kL is significantly suppressed, decreasing from 7.48 W m-1 K-1 to 6.06 W m-1 K-1 as the tilting angle increases by a mere 1 degree. These findings identify tilting-induced acoustic softening as a pivotal mechanism for limiting and controlling anisotropic thermal transport in SrSnO3, presenting a stark contrast to the established behavior in SrTiO3.</description>

      <title>Acoustic Manipulation of Tangible Janus Icons on Liquid Droplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18730v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interfaces that couple digital information with physical matter enable computation to be expressed through tangible motion and touch, yet typically rely on embedded actuators, rigid mechanisms, or enclosed environments. Consequently, contactless manipulation and interaction with centimeter-scale tangible elements in open settings remain difficult to achieve. Here, we present PolygonWave, a solid--fluid acoustic interface that enables transport and tangible interaction by coupling airborne ultrasound with liquid-mediated support. The system employs lightweight Janus icons with asymmetric wettability: a superhydrophobic upper surface permits dry touch interaction, while a hydrophilic lower surface couples to a water droplet resting on a superhydrophobic mesh. Focused acoustic fields generated by a 256-element phased array induce lateral forces, enabling programmable motion without mechanical contact. Systematic characterization demonstrates transport of payloads up to 525 mg across variations in icon size, droplet volume, and applied load. Beyond translation, the liquid layer functions as a reconfigurable mechanical element, enabling button-like input with self-recovery and resonance-driven vibro-visual feedback, exhibiting a peak response near 22 Hz for 200 \textmu L droplets. Liquid-mediated acoustic coupling provides a unified mechanism for mechanically expressive, touch-accessible tangible interfaces bridging acoustics, soft matter physics, and physical human--computer interaction.</description>

      <title>Exact expression for the Berry connection in the projection gauge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18973v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Berry connection encodes the momentum-space geometry of occupied Bloch states in gapped insulators and plays a central role in topological materials. While gauge-invariant quantities can be evaluated from overlap matrices between neighboring $k$ points, accessing the Berry connection itself as a smooth field requires specifying a continuous gauge over the Brillouin zone. Wannier-based workflows achieve this through projection onto localized orbitals, enabling stable evaluation of geometric quantities and response functions. In this setting, the Berry connection enters directly in Wannier-interpolated calculations of polarization, Berry curvature, optical conductivity, and related response functions. In practical implementations, however, the projection-gauge Berry connection is typically constructed from finite-difference overlaps between neighboring $k$ points, discretizing momentum derivatives and introducing errors tied to $k$-mesh spacing and gauge alignment. These effects can become numerically delicate in systems with small band gaps or when evaluating higher-order responses such as the Chern-Simons axion angle. Here, we derive an exact expression for the non-Abelian Berry connection in the projection gauge that is local in crystal momentum. Starting from projected and orthonormalized Bloch-like states, we obtain a closed-form equation expressed entirely in terms of $k$-local quantities. We validate the formulation in one and three dimensions by computing the Berry phase and Chern-Simons axion angle in tight-binding models. The resulting framework provides a stable route to evaluating geometric properties within Wannier interpolation schemes and future first-principles implementations.</description>

      <title>Superconducting phase diagram of multi-layer square-planar nickelates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.19093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery of superconductivity in square-planar nickelates has offered a rich materials platform to explore the origins of cuprate-like superconductivity. Experimental investigations however have largely been limited to the infinite-layer $R$NiO$_2$ ($R$=rare-earth) nickelates. Here, we construct a phase diagram of multi-layer square-planar Nd$_{n+1}$Ni$_n$O$_{2n+2}$ compounds and discover signatures of superconductivity for $n$ = 4 - 8. Upon decreasing the dimensionality $n$, the superconducting anisotropy evolves due to 4$f$ electron effects, and electronic structure characteristics approach cuprate-like behavior. Magnetic fluctuations persist from within the superconducting regime and into the over-doped, non-superconducting regime. Remarkably, the superconducting regime overlaps with that of chemically-doped infinite-layer nickelates, demonstrating underlying commonalities and distinct differences across varying structural realizations of square-planar nickelates. Our work establishes this layered template for creating new nickel-based superconductors.</description>

      <title>Precompression engineering of metal-insulator transition and magnetism in designed breathing kagome systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.19147v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kagome materials featuring dispersive Dirac cones and topological flat bands exhibit unique electronic and magnetic properties. However, kagome compounds with tunable electrical conductivity remain scarce, which severely impedes their device applications. Here, based on density functional theory (DFT) and Boltzmann transport theory, we introduce the breathing effect into kagome materials $\mathrm{Nb_3XCl_7}$ (X = F, Cl, Br, I) via chemical precompression, thereby inducing a metal-insulator transition and magnetic variation. We determine that the band structures, optical absorption spectra and magnetic ground states agree well with experimental results at the effective correlation strength $U_{\text{eff}} = 2$ eV. The calculated conductivity and magnetic properties reveal that the monolayer $\mathrm{Nb_3Cl_8}$ and $\mathrm{Nb_3XCl_7}$ undergoes transitions from paramagnetic metals to Mott insulators at $U_{\text{eff}} = 1$ eV and $t_{\text{out}}/t_{\text{in}} = 0.6674$, respectively. Our detailed analysis establishes that the stronger breathing effect corresponds to enhanced chemical precompression, which reduces the region of free electron gas between intercell Nb atoms and facilitates the metal-insulator transition. Finally, we propose several viable synthesis routes for $\mathrm{Nb_3FCl_7}$, $\mathrm{Nb_3BrCl_7}$, and $\mathrm{Nb_3ICl_7}$, providing predictive guidance for experimental studies. Our study establishes a practical framework for investigating the breathing effect in correlated kagome systems and yields valuable insights into the mechanisms underlying metal-insulator transition and magnetic properties in real breathing kagome materials.</description>

Abstract: Our goal is to provide precise effective operators for monolayer graphene at Fermi energy. We consider the microscopic potential created by a lattice, and add a macroscopic potential with the same periodicity but varying at a scale $\varepsilon^{-1} \in \mathbb{N}$, creating a superlattice. Our approach consists in coupling the variational approximation, perturbation theory together with a multiscale method. At the effective level the usual massless Dirac operator is replaced by other operators, and we provide simulations in the case of graphene.</description>

      <title>Microscopic origin of hard-plane antiferromagnetism in the Kondo lattice Ce2Rh3Ge5</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.19221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hard plane antiferromagnetic order where ordered moments lie perpendicular to the single-ion crystal electric field easy axis is rare in Ce-based Kondo lattices and is a subject of active interest. Here we show that Ce$_2$Rh$_3$Ge$_5$ realizes a hard-plane antiferromagnetic state in which partial delocalization of the local moment gives rise to an RKKY exchange that overturns the single-ion easy-axis preference. Neutron diffraction reveals moments in the $ab$ plane, while inelastic neutron scattering and susceptibility establish a magnetic easy axis along $c$ in the paramagnetic regime, highlighting a clear inversion between single-ion and ordered-state anisotropies. In this work, we establish a unified microscopic framework to consistently account for partial $4f$-moment delocalization, enhanced in-plane RKKY exchange, and the resulting hard-plane antiferromagnetic order. Ce$_2$Rh$_3$Ge$_5$ thus provides a benchmark system in which single-ion anisotropy, Kondo screening, and RKKY exchange compete on comparable energy scales, revealing a cooperative route to hard-axis ordering in strongly hybridized Kondo lattices.</description>

      <title>Profiling THz Beams With Off-Label Use of Infrared Microbolometric Cameras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.19635v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Visualizing the spatial profile of light beams is essential for evaluating irradiance, characterizing beam quality, and achieving precise alignment. In the optical spectral range, this is readily performed using silicon-based CCD and CMOS cameras. In the terahertz (THz) range, however, it typically requires specialized detectors with prohibitive costs. Here, we show that an infrared (IR) camera can be used outside of its labeled specifications to achieve similar performance as a dedicated microbolometric THz camera, at under 1% of the THz camera's cost. We compared the cameras by characterizing THz beam profiles from two sources: a pulsed broadband THz beam produced through optical rectification in organic crystals, and a narrowband quasi-continuous-wave (quasi-CW) THz beam emitted by a quantum cascade laser. For the broadband THz radiation, the beam width measured by the two cameras differed by only ~ 6%, well within the pixel resolution limit, and in the narrowband quasi-CW case by just ~ 1.3%. Additionally, both cameras show linear responsivity over a comparable irradiance range. These results expand the applicability of conventional IR cameras to the THz range, suggesting that they will become routine tools for high-fidelity THz beam diagnostics and imaging in scientific and industrial applications.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Bath Fitting for Hamiltonian-Diagonalization Dynamical Mean-Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19637v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a machine-learning-based initialization method to overcome the nonlinear bath-fitting bottleneck in Hamiltonian-diagonalization-based dynamical mean-field theory (HD-DMFT). In HD-DMFT, the continuous hybridization function is approximated by a finite set of bath-site energies and hybridization amplitudes, determined by minimizing a highly non-convex multivariable cost function. As the number of bath sites increases, the optimization becomes more sensitive to the initial guess and more prone to suboptimal local minima, which can slow or destabilize the DMFT self-consistency loop. We reformulate bath fitting as a supervised regression problem and train a kernel ridge regression model to predict near-optimal discrete bath parameters directly from the target hybridization function on the Matsubara axis. To ensure physical relevance and data diversity, we construct the training dataset from tight-binding Hamiltonians of layered-perovskite-like ruthenate models across systematically deformed structures, instead of relying on naive random parameter sampling, and obtain high-quality labels through fully converged conventional bath fitting. Time-reversal symmetry is explicitly incorporated in both feature and target representations to reduce effective dimensionality and enforce physical consistency. Benchmarks in the non-interacting limit show that the learned initialization systematically reduces the initial fitting error, decreases the number of conjugate-gradient iterations, and improves robustness against local minima over a wide range of bath sizes. We further demonstrate transferability to interacting DMFT calculations for $\mathrm{Sr_{2}RuO_{4}}$ solved with an adaptive-truncation impurity solver, where the ML initialization yields consistently faster convergence than a symmetry-preserving heuristic baseline while preserving the final fitted solution.</description>

      <title>Optical properties of single CsPbBr3 perovskite quantum dots synthesized by a modified ligand-assisted reprecipitation method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19693v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Colloidal perovskite quantum dots (pQDs) are promising quantum light emitters, and investigations at the single pQD scale have so far relied mostly on hot-injection synthesis, which requires precise temperature control and an inert atmosphere. While alternative synthesis routes under milder conditions are often associated with structural and surface defects that may have limited impact in ensemble measurements, demonstrating high optical quality at the level of individual pQDs constitutes the most stringent benchmark for a new synthesis protocol. Here, we demonstrate that a modified ligand-assisted reprecipitation (LARP) approach yields CsPbBr3 pQDs showing state-of-the-art optical properties at the scale of single emitters. By combining an amine-mediated post-synthetic size-trimming strategy with didodecyldimethylammonium bromide (DDAB) ligands for enhanced surface passivation and colloidal stability, we obtain isolated pQDs with stable emission and minimal spectral diffusion at cryogenic temperatures. Micro-photoluminescence experiments resolve the characteristic fine structure of the bright exciton, its low-energy optical phonon replicas, and the trion and biexciton states. Time-resolved and photon correlation measurements show a ~90 ps lifetime and high purity single photon emission, respectively. These results demonstrate that modified LARP synthesis constitutes an accessible alternative to hot injection, preserving the intrinsic excitonic and quantum optical properties of individual pQDs while offering greater flexibility for post-synthetic ligand engineering, as exemplified here by the use of DDAB for surface passivation.</description>

      <title>A Physics-Regularized Neural Network and Kirchhoff Markov Random Field Framework for Inferring Internal Electrochemical States from Operando Spectromicroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19888v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantitative understanding of coupled reaction and transport processes in lithium-ion battery (LIB) composite electrodes remains challenging because key internal states cannot be measured directly. In this study, we develop a physics-integrated, data-driven analysis pipeline to estimate internal electrochemical states from operando microscopic X-ray absorption fine structure ($\mu$-XAFS) hyperspectral data of LIB cathodes with LiPF$_6$ electrolyte. State-of-charge (SOC) maps are first constructed from Co K-edge spectra. To resolve ambiguities in the two-phase reaction region, a physics-regularized three-layer neural network is introduced, enforcing spatial continuity of SOC and current conservation. The inferred SOC dynamics are then incorporated into a Kirchhoff-based Markov random field framework that integrates Kirchhoff's current and voltage laws, Ohm's law, and a symmetric Butler-Volmer relation to estimate interfacial current, ionic current, electrolyte potential, and effective ionic conductivity. Application to composite electrodes with different initial electrolyte concentrations (0.3, 1, and 2M LiPF$_6$) reveals distinct reaction propagation behaviors governed by electrolyte concentration-dependent conductivity. The inferred electrolyte concentration distributions show qualitative agreement with independent operando X-ray transmission imaging performed on LIB composite cathodes employing a LiAsF$_6$ electrolyte. This framework enables quantitative visualization of otherwise inaccessible internal transport phenomena.</description>

      <title>Linearised Identification of Mechanical and Structural Anisotropy of Granular Materials from Hollow-Cylinder Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19902v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Anisotropy in granular materials arises from both the internal fabric and the directionality of the stress state, yet separating these effects experimentally remains challenging. This study develops a first-order linearisation of the incremental stress-strain response that isolates mechanical anisotropy from structural anisotropy using two independent orientation measures. The formulation enables both contributions to be quantified directly from macroscopic laboratory data. The method is applied to hollow-cylinder tests with systematically varied loading directions. Results show that both anisotropy components intensify as the stress state becomes more deviatoric; mechanical anisotropy is consistently stronger; and its relative dominance decreases with increasing deviatoric stress. Comparison with an isotropic hypoplastic model confirms that mechanically induced directional effects are captured even without fabric anisotropy. The framework offers a practical and physically transparent means for quantifying and comparing anisotropy mechanisms in granular materials.</description>

      <title>Non Fermi liquid signatures across strain engineered metal-insulator transition in line-graph lattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.19972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Controlling the properties and thus the functionalities of correlated electron systems via externally tunable perturbations has always remained a cherished goal in quantum condensed matter physics. Recently, straintronics has proved to be one such external control which can dictate the quantum phases and transitions in materials via the reconstruction of their electronic band structure. A particularly intriguing scenario arises in the context of flat band line-graph lattices wherein straintronics is found to bring forth non trivial phase transitions. This paper reports the phase transitions and thermal scales across the Lieb/Kagome interconversion in the electronic interaction-strain-temperature space. Based on the thermodynamic, spectroscopic and transport signatures across the strain tuned interconversion of these line-graph lattices we have mapped out the low temperature phases and thermal transition scales, numerically determined using non perturbative calculations. While at the low temperatures, interaction-strain plane is spanned by magnetically correlated insulators, flat band induced weak transiently localized insulators and non Fermi liquid metallic phases, thermal fluctuations aid in to stabilize coexistent magnetic correlations. Apart from quantifying the magnetic transition scales in this system our results on the spectroscopic and transport signatures distill the strain tuned metal-insulator transition and crossover scales which exhibit variable transport scaling exponents.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00419v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Filamentary objects such as nano-wires, nanotubes and DNA are of current interest in physics, nanoscience, chemistry, biology and medicine. They can interact via strong, exceptionally long-ranged many-object van der Waals (vdW, dispersion) forces, causing them to cluster into multi-object bundles. We analyse their vdW interactions perturbatively, predicting $N$-object vdW energy contributions that alternate in sign with increasing $N$. Our findings are confirmed here via the first detailed analysis of a 4-cylinder vdW model. We also provide novel insights permitting these tendencies to be understood simply in terms of electronic screening and anti-screening. Our results suggest that a non-perturbative calculation will be required for reliable prediction of dispersion interactions in these ubiquitous systems.</description>

Abstract: Circularly polarized phonons conventionally carry an angular momentum and a magnetic moment arising from circular motions of the atoms. Here, we present three anomalous cases that lead to phonon magnetic moments, which cannot be described in the conventional framework: rotationless axial phonons, which exhibit magnetic responses despite only carrying pseudo angular momentum, divergent gyromagnetic ratios of phonons, in which a magnetic moment is produced despite vanishing angular momentum, and anisotropic gyromagnetic ratios of phonons, which make the phonon angular momentum and magnetic moment noncollinear. Our results shed light on the origin and nature of phonon magnetism and suggest the existence of phononomagnetic hidden order.</description>

      <title>Nucleation and Antiphase Twin Control in Bi$_2$Se$_3$ via Step-Terminated Al$_2$O$_3$ Substrates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18103v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The epitaxial synthesis of high-quality 2D layered materials is an essential driver of both fundamental physics studies and technological applications. Bi$_2$Se$_3$, a prototypical 2D layered topological insulator, is sensitive to defects imparted during the growth, either thermodynamically or due to the film-substrate interaction. In this study, it is shown that step-terminated Al$_2$O$_3$ substrates with a high miscut angle (3{\deg}) can effectively suppress a particular hard-to-mitigate defect, the antiphase twin. Systematic investigations across a range of growth temperatures and substrate miscut angles confirm that atomic step edges act as preferential nucleation sites, stabilizing a single twin domain. First-principles calculations suggest that there is a significant energy barrier for twin boundary formation at step edges, supporting the experimental observations. Detailed structural characterization indicates that this twin-selectivity is lost through the mechanism of the 2D layers overgrowing the step edges, leading to higher twin density as the thickness increases. These findings highlight the complex energy landscape unique to 2D materials that is driven by the interplay between substrate properties, nucleation dynamics, and defect formation, and overcoming and controlling these are critical to improve material quality for quantum and electronic applications.</description>

      <title>Optically detected magnetic resonance of nitrogen-vacancy centers in microdiamonds inside nanopolycrystalline diamond anvil cell</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13634v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrated optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in microdiamonds inside a diamond anvil cell pressurized with nanopolycrystalline diamond (NPD) anvils. NPD exhibits high optical transparency, superior hardness, and low thermal conductivity, making it suitable for optical and spectroscopic measurements under high-pressure and high-temperature conditions. We observed the ODMR signal from an ensemble of NV centers under conditions where NV centers in microdiamonds served as markers for pressures exceeding 30 GPa, with a culet diameter of 600 $\mu$m. We also performed ODMR measurements on multiple microdiamonds sealed inside a sample chamber and found that the resonance frequency varied with the pressure distribution. The combination of NPD and microdiamonds containing NV centers is auspicious for pressure and magnetic sensing under concurrent high-pressure and high-temperature conditions.</description>

      <title>Cation vacancies mediate thermochemical water splitting with iron aluminates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.05328v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Solar thermochemical water splitting enables hydrogen production by cycling metal oxides between reduced and oxidized states, typically through an oxygen vacancy mechanism. However, recent experimental work suggests that cation vacancies have a greater influence on the redox behavior of iron aluminate spinels used in water splitting. This remains debated, as calculations predict that such cation vacancies are thermodynamically unfavorable. In the current work, we show that Fe vacancies in (Fe$\zeta$Al1-$\zeta$)3O4 become accessible only when facilitated by inversion between Fe and Al. This antisite disorder lowers the formation energy of octahedral Fe vacancies in Al-rich spinels ($\zeta$ = 1/3) from over 3 eV to just 0.62 eV when one third of the cation sites are inverted, allowing high Fe vacancy concentrations under oxidizing conditions. This mechanism supports high H2 yields up to 361 $\mu$mol/g, consistent with experimental observations. Our findings support the notion that solar thermochemical water splitting can occur through a cation vacancy mechanism. They also clarify how site inversion, vacancy energetics, and defect interactions each contribute to redox performance, offering general design principles for identifying and optimizing materials that operate through cation vacancy cycling.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials Enable Molecular Dynamics Simulations of Doped MoS2</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.05339v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dopants can tune the performance of MoS2 in various applications, but use of molecular dynamics simulations for doped MoS2 materials discovery is limited by the lack of multi-dopant interatomic potentials. Universal machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) could be a solution, but the accuracy of these potentials must first be evaluated. Here, we evaluate the accuracy of a recently developed MLIP, META's Universal Model for Atoms (UMA), for 25 different MoS2 dopants spanning metals, non-metals, and transition metals in Mo substitution, S substitution, and intercalated positions by benchmarking the MLIP-predicted formation energy and the dopant-induced structural change against density functional theory calculations. The computational framework for MLIP validation and simulations are described in detail and the source code is made open source. The MLIP is then demonstrated by performing heating-cooling simulations of MoS2 supercells with all 25 dopants. These simulations capture complex phenomena including dopant clustering, MoS2 layer fracturing, interlayer diffusion, and chemical compound formation at orders-of-magnitude reduced computational cost compared to density functional theory. This work provides a computational workflow for application-oriented design of doped-MoS2, enabling high-throughput screening of dopant candidates and optimization of compositions for targeted tribological, electronic, and optoelectronic performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.14237v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Efficient numerical routines are developed for numerical studies of the dependence of the equilibrium magnetic states, excitations, and microwave power absorption on temperature and composition in transition-metal/rare-earth ferrites, including the reversal of the N\'eel vector occurring on both temperature and the concentration of the rare-earth atoms. It results in a drastic change in the behavior at the magnetization and angular-momentum compensation points. Dominant uniform oscillation modes are obtained by computing the magnetization correlation function. They are compared with the analytical solution, which is analyzed in detail. The fluctuation-dissipation theorem is used to compute the frequency dependence of the absorbed microwave power. A good agreement with analytical results is demonstrated. Disorder caused by random positions of rare-earth atoms in a diluted RE system leads to multiple localized modes that converge into broad absorption maxima as the size of the system increases. The power absorption integrated over frequency exhibits a minimum at the compensation point.</description>

Abstract: The Landau-Brazovskii model provides a theoretical framework for describing various phases arising from competing short- and long-range interactions in many physical systems. In this work, we investigate phase transitions among various ordered phases within the three-dimensional Landau-Brazovskii model. We construct the phase diagram of this model, which encompasses eight distinct phases, and systematically compute the transition pathways connecting various metastable and stable states using the Landau-Brazovskii saddle dynamics. Along each transition pathway, the critical nucleus is identified with some detailed analyses of its shape, energy barrier, and Hessian eigenvalues. Furthermore, we explore how the transition state is influenced by model parameters, revealing systematic trends in critical nucleus sizes and energy barrier heights. Our results provide a comprehensive characterization of the nucleation mechanisms within the Landau-Brazovskii model and offer valuable insights into the structural transformations of modulated-phase systems.</description>

Abstract: Amorphous solid-state electrolytes (SSEs) offer unique advantages for next-generation batteries, but their rational design is hindered by an unclear structure-property relationship. This study establishes universal design principles through atomistic simulations of 32 amorphous Li-M-X systems (M = B, Al, Si, P; X = F, Cl, Br, I, O, S, Se, N). We identify four structure types governed by a rule that saturated M-X groups with more negative charges preferentially form M-X-M chains, identify paddle-wheel and cooperative migration as two favorable transport mechanisms that are significantly enhanced in amorphous structures. We also pinpoint Oxides and fluorides as optimal for electrochemical and hydrolytic stability, and reveal bulk modulus as a simple predictor for $Li^+$ mobility. These insights are integrated into a practical design diagram, providing a novel and valuable framework for advancing high-performance amorphous SSEs.</description>

      <title>Origin of the large topological Hall effect in the EuCd$_2$Sb$_2$ antiferromagnet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.17445v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the origin of large topological Hall effect in the single-crystalline EuCd$_2$Sb$_2$, which orders antiferromagnetically at the N\'eel temperature $T_{\rm N}=7.4$ K. Measurements of magnetoresistance and Hall resistivity disclose anomalies that evolve with temperature and magnetic field, closely tracking the magnetization process. Analysis of these data identifies three possible mechanisms responsible for the enhanced Berry curvature driving the observed topological Hall effect. Below and above $T_{\rm N}$, Weyl states are the main sources of large momentum-space Berry curvature, though their formation mechanisms differ in these two temperature ranges. Below $T_{\rm N}$, breaking of $C_{3}$ symmetry generates Dirac points that split into Weyl nodes in applied magnetic field, whereas above $T_{\rm N}$, strong spin fluctuations can induce Weyl states. The third contribution, which occurs below $T_{\rm N}$, arises from scalar spin chirality developing within antiferromagnetic domain walls, which generates a real-space Berry curvature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.18026v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We review recent advances in Klein and anti-Klein tunneling in one- and two-dimensional materials. Using a general tight-binding framework applied to multiple periodic systems, we establish the criteria for the emergence of Klein tunneling based on the conservation of an effective reduced pseudospin. The inclusion of higher-order terms in the wave vector leads to nontrivial matching conditions for wave scattering at interfaces. We further examine the emergence of multiple types of Klein tunneling in two-dimensional materials beyond graphene, including phosphorene and borophene, as well as in one-dimensional systems such as Su-Schrieffer-Heeger lattices. Finally, we discuss how these tunneling phenomena can be tested in both synthesized and artificial lattices, including elastic metamaterials, optical, photonic, phononic, and superconducting platforms, demonstrating the universality of Klein tunneling across different wave natures and length scales.</description>

      <title>Janus MoSSe/WSSe Heterobilayers as Selective Photocatalysts for Water Splitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13898v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Identifying materials that simultaneously straddle the water redox potentials and possess an intrinsic electric field is crucial for achieving high solar-to-hydrogen (STH) efficiency. Using state-of-the-art first-principles calculations, including a range-separated hybrid functional and spin-orbit coupling, we investigate MoXY/WXY (X, Y = S, Se) Janus bilayers for overall water splitting. We find a critical competition between the metal-to-metal chemical potential difference and the intrinsic dipoles at the interface between the Janus monolayers. We find that the Se-Se interfaced heterobilayer is intrinsically capable of driving water splitting, while its S-S counterpart can meet the redox requirements through pH modulation. For both configurations, a remarkable STH efficiency of 17.1% is anticipated. Furthermore, we predict a threshold of 1.0 eV for the built-in potential gradient to govern the transition from overall water splitting to band-edge pinning. Compared to homobilayers, heterobilayers benefit from the reciprocity between layer-specific dipoles and the Mo/W chemical potential difference, which promotes spatial separation and suppresses recombination, overall enhancing hydrogen production. Our results establish specific electronic descriptors for Janus heterostructures, providing a rational design rule for maximizing solar-driven hydrogen production in asymmetric two-dimensional materials.</description>

      <title>Sub-1-Angstrom-Resolution Imaging Reveals Phase Contrast Transition in Ice Ih Caused by Basal Stacking Faults</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14920v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Phase-contrast transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of hexagonal ice (Ih) along [0001] sometimes shows a honeycomb-like pattern, often interpreted as individual oxygen columns in single crystals. Here, we show that this pattern commonly arises from intrinsic basal stacking faults instead. A translational boundary separating domains of comparable thickness, with an in-plane offset of $(\frac{2}{3} a_{1} + \frac{1}{3} a_{2})$, produces this honeycomb-like contrast. Stacking domains translated in nonequivalent directions yields patterns resembling cubic ice (Ic) along [111] but with a 3-fold symmetry. We imaged this structure at a record-breaking line resolution of 89 picometers, finer than the O-H covalent bond length. These findings highlight the defect tolerance of ice's molecular packing and clarify the structural relationships among hexagonal, stacking-disordered, and cubic ice phases. This resolution milestone opens new avenues for characterizing subtle structural perturbations of water in the solid state.</description>

      <title>Reshaping MOFs text mining with a dynamic multi-agents framework of large language model</title>

Abstract: Accurately identifying the synthesis conditions of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) is essential for guiding experimental design, yet remains challenging because relevant information in the literature is often scattered, inconsistent, and difficult to interpret. We present MOFh6, a large language model driven system that reads raw articles or crystal codes and converts them into standardized synthesis tables. It links related descriptions across paragraphs, unifies ligand abbreviations with full names, and outputs structured parameters ready for use. MOFh6 achieved 99% extraction accuracy, resolved 94.1% of abbreviation cases across five major publishers, and maintained a precision of 0.93 +/- 0.01. Processing a full text takes 9.6 s, locating synthesis descriptions 36 s, with 100 papers processed for USD 4.24. By replacing static database lookups with real-time extraction, MOFh6 reshapes MOF synthesis research, accelerating the conversion of literature knowledge into practical synthesis protocols and enabling scalable, data-driven materials discovery.</description>

      <title>Dirac edge states as signature of two-dimensional altermagnetic topological crystalline phase</title>

Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) metallic altermagnets present exciting opportunities for both fundamental research and practical innovations. Their ability to enhance tunneling magnetoresistance in magnetic tunnel junctions, combined with the direct control of spin currents via electric fields, makes them highly promising for spintronic devices. Moreover, the rich electronic structure of altermagnets can host nontrivial topological phases. In particular, topological crystalline insulators are compounds where the topological states are protected by both crystalline and time-reversal symmetries. Furthermore, manipulating the state of a system between topological and trivial phases through external parameters unlocks new possibilities for quantum materials and advanced electronics. We show the edge states of a 2D altermagnetic topological crystalline insulator, using as a representative example Cr$_2$BAl, a 2D MBene metallic altermagnet with a d$_{x^2-y^2}$ altermagnetic ordering. We find that the system can host an altermagnetic phase with extremely large ``weak ferrimagnetism" which is sizeable also with light atoms, only with an in-plane component of the N\'eel vector. The electronic structure of Cr$_2$BAl presents multiple crossings and anti-crossings in the vicinity of the Fermi level along [100] and [010] directions. When the spin-orbit coupling interaction is included, with the N\'eel vector along [001] direction, energy gaps open at the band crossing points, resulting in a pronounced peak in the spin Hall conductivity. The simulated Cr-B terminated [100] edge-projected band structure reveals Dirac dispersions at the bulk crossings and anti-crossings, which are absent in Cr-Al terminations.</description>

      <title>Role of on-site Coulomb energy and negative-charge transfer in a Dirac semi-metal NiTe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02245v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) combined with band structure calculations have shown that the layered transition metal dichalcogenide(TMD) NiTe$_2$ is a type-II Dirac semimetal. However, conflicting conclusions were reported regarding the role of electron correlations in NiTe$_2$. We study core-levels and valence band electronic structure of single crystal NiTe$_2$ using soft and hard x-ray photoemission spectroscopy(SXPES, HAXPES), X-ray absorption spectroscopy(XAS) and Ni $2p-3d$ Resonant-PES to quantify electronic parameters in NiTe$_2$. The Ni $3d$ on-site Coulomb energy ($U_{dd}$) is quantified from measurements of the Ni $3d$ single particle density of states(DOS) and the two-hole correlation satellite. The Ni $2p$ core level and $L$-edge XAS spectra are analyzed by charge-transfer (CT) cluster model calculations using the experimental $U_{dd}$, and it shows that NiTe$_2$ exhibits a negative CT energy $\Delta$. A comparative analysis of NiO $L$-edge XAS confirms its well-known strongly correlated CT insulator character, with a larger $U_{dd}$ and positive $\Delta$. The $d$-$p$ hybridization strength $T_{eg}$ for NiTe$_2$$&lt;$NiO, and shows that $T_{eg}$ is not responsible for reducing $U_{dd}$ in NiTe\textsubscript{2} compared to NiO. The negative-$\Delta$ and a reduced $U_{dd}$ leads to the increase in $d^n$ count on the Ni site in NiTe$_{2}$ by nearly one electron. However, importantly, since $U_{dd}$$&gt;$$|\Delta|$, a finite repulsive $U_{dd}$ results in pushing $d$-states away from Fermi level and this is required to make NiTe$_{2}$ a moderately correlated Dirac semi-metal with band inversion in the $p$-$p$ type lowest energy excitations.</description>

      <title>The nexus between negative charge-transfer and reduced on-site Coulomb energy in a correlated topological metal CoTe$_2$</title>

Abstract: The layered $3d$ transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) CoTe$_2$ is a topological Dirac Type-II metal. However, the Co $3d$-bands in CoTe$_2$ do not exhibit the expected correlation-induced band narrowing seen in CoO. We address this conundrum by studying the electronic structure of CoTe$_2$ using hard x-ray photoemission spectroscopy (HAXPES), x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and Resonant-PES. We quantify the on-site Coulomb energy $U_{dd}$ via single-particle partial density of states and the two-hole correlation satellite using valence band Resonant-PES), and obtain $U_{dd}$ = 3.0 eV for CoTe$_2$. Charge-transfer (CT) cluster model simulations of the measured core-level Co $2p$ PES and $L$-edge XAS spectra of CoTe\textsubscript{2} and CoO validate their contrasting electronic parameters:$U_{dd}$ and CT energy $\Delta$ are (3.0 eV, -2.0 eV) for CoTe\textsubscript{2}, and (5.0 eV, 4.0 eV) for CoO, respectively. The $d$-$p$ hybridization strength $T_{eg}$ for CoTe$_2$$&lt;$CoO, and indicates that the reduced $U_{dd}$ in CoTe\textsubscript{2} is not due to $T_{eg}$. The increase in $d^n$-count$\sim$1 by CT from ligand to Co site in CoTe$_2$ is due to a negative-$\Delta$ and reduced $U_{dd}$. Yet, only because $U_{dd}$$&gt;$$\big|\Delta\big|$, CoTe$_{2}$ becomes a topological metal with $p$$\rightarrow$$p$ type lowest energy excitations. The study reveals the nexus between negative-$\Delta$ and reduced $U_{dd}$ required for setting up the electronic structure framework for achieving topological behavior via band inversion in the correlated metal CoTe$_2$.</description>

      <title>Acoustic Analogy of Quantum Baldin Sum Rule for Optimal Causal Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02630v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The mass law is a cornerstone in predicting sound transmission loss, yet it neglects the constraints of causal dispersion. Current causality-based theories, such as the Rozanov limit, are applicable only to one-port reflective absorbers. Here, we derive a universal sum rule governing causal scattering in acoustic systems, establishing a rigorous analogy to the Baldin sum rule in quantum field theory. This relation reveals that the integral of the extinction cross-section is fundamentally locked by the scatterer's static effective mass and stiffness, which is validated numerically using seminal examples of underwater metamaterials. Furthermore, the proposed sum rule predicts an optimal condition for an anomalously broadened transmission loss bandwidth, as experimentally observed through the spectral shaping effect of an acoustic Fano resonator. Our findings open up an unexplored avenue for enhancing the scattering bandwidth of passive metamaterials.</description>

      <title>Universal rapid machine learning models for predicting unconvoluted and convoluted X-ray Absorption Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22173v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) is an essential tool for elucidating the atomic-scale, local three-dimensional (3D) structure of given materials and molecules. The rapid computation of XANES based on molecular 3D structures constitutes a vital element of quantitative XANES analysis. Here, we present an XANES prediction model. It takes 3D structures as input and generates either unconvoluted XANES or convoluted spectra as output, demonstrating excellent generalizability across diverse instrumental broadening. This model has validated its predictive capability for both hard X-ray XAS (exemplified by K-edges of 3d 4d metals and lanthanides) and soft X-ray XAS (using S K-edge as examples). Adopting the model, XANES spectra of multiple elements can be predicted using a single unified model. A highly efficient 3D structure fitting algorithm based on this unconvoluted XANES prediction model, aiming to serve as an online data analysis method suitable for XAS beamlines.</description>
