      <title>Reconstructing initial pressure and speed of sound distributions simultaneously in photoacoustic tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Image reconstruction in photoacoustic tomography relies on an accurate knowledge of the speed of sound in the target. However, the speed of sound distribution is not generally known, which may result in artefacts in the reconstructed distribution of initial pressure. Therefore, reconstructing the speed of sound simultaneously with the initial pressure would be valuable for accurate imaging in photoacoustic tomography. Furthermore, the speed of sound distribution could provide additional valuable information about the imaged target. In this work, simultaneous reconstruction of initial pressure and speed of sound in photoacoustic tomography is studied. This inverse problem is known to be highly ill-posed. To overcome this, we study an approach where the ill-posedness is alleviated by utilising multiple photoacoustic data sets that are generated by different initial pressure distributions within the same imaged target. Then, these initial pressure distributions are reconstructed simultaneously with the speed of sound distribution. A methodology for solving this minimisation problem is formulated using a gradient-based iterative approach equipped with bound constraints and a multigrid approach. The methodology was evaluated with numerical simulations. Different approaches for generating multiple initial pressure distributions and their effect on the solution of the image reconstruction problem were studied. The results show that initial pressure and speed of sound can be simultaneously reconstructed from photoacoustic data. Furthermore, utilising multiple initial pressure distributions improves the reconstructions such that the locations of initial pressure and speed of sound inhomogeneities can be better distinguished and image artifacts are reduced.</description>

      <title>Analysis of gesture-sound decorrelation in electronic drumming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Drumming belongs to a family of musical instruments whose practice, whether as an amateur or at a high level, is associated with an increased risk of musculoskeletal disorders (MSD), particularly of the upper limbs and lumbar spine. The vast majority of drummers learn to play on acoustic instruments, the sound intensity of which is proportional to the striking force developed. This correlation is disrupted when playing the electronic version of the instrument, which is often purchased by musicians seeking to reduce the sound produced (e.g. playing in apartments). The aim of this study was therefore to analyze whether drumming on electronic equipment would lead to a change in the kinematics and feel of drummers. To this end, several drummers were recruited to perform repeated rhythms at different pitches on acoustic and electric drums under two sound conditions (sound on and sound off with noise-canceling headphones). The sound produced and the kinematics of the upper limbs were measured by video motion capture during the beats. In addition, self-confrontation interviews were conducted after each condition. The drummers, confronted with video recordings of their actions, were asked to describe, explain and comment step by step on their performance. These interviews were also used to assess their ability to maintain a constant strike force. A questionnaire was used to obtain subjective information on how they felt. The results showed a lower sound power of electronic drums, despite a similar striking speed. This gesture-sound decorrelation could explain the increase in MSD among drummers when switching from an acoustic to an electronic instrument.</description>

      <title>A fully flexible joint lattice position and dose optimization method for LATTICE therapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lattice radiotherapy (LATTICE) is a form of spatially fractionated radiation therapy (SFRT) designed to deliver high doses to tumor regions while sparing surrounding tissues. Traditional LATTICE uses rigid vertex patterns, limiting adaptability for irregular tumors or those near critical organs. This study introduces a novel planning method with flexible vertex placement and joint optimization of vertex positions and dose distribution, enhancing treatment precision. The method integrates vertex positioning with other treatment variables within a constrained optimization framework, allowing dynamic adjustments. Results showed that plans generated with the new method (NEW) demonstrated superior or comparable quality to conventional LATTICE plans, with improvements in the optimization objective and peak-to-valley dose ratio (PVDR). This approach offers significant improvements in target dose conformity and OAR sparing, providing an enhanced LATTICE technique.</description>

      <title>A Fourier finite volume approach for the optical inverse problem of quantitative photoacoustic tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new approach for solving the optical inverse problem of quantitative photoacoustic tomography is introduced, which interpolates between the well-known diffusion approximation and a radiative transfer equation based model. The proposed formulation combines a spatial finite volume scheme with a truncated Fourier expansion in the direction variable for the radiative transfer equation. The finite volume scheme provides a natural and simple approach for representing piecewise constant image data modelled using transport equations. The truncated Fourier expansion in the direction variable facilitates the interpolation between the diffusion approximation at low order, and the full radiative transfer model as the truncation limit $N\rightarrow\infty$. It is therefore possible to tune the precision of the model to the demands of the imaging application, taking $N=1$ for cases when the diffusion approximation would suffice and increasing the number of terms otherwise. We will then utilise the non-linear optimisation functionality of Matlab to address the corresponding large-scale nonlinear inverse problem using gradient based quasi-Newton minimisation via the limited memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno algorithm. Numerical experiments for two test-cases of increasing complexity and resolution will be presented, and the effect of logarithmically rescaling the problem data on the accuracy of the reconstructed solutions will be investigated. We will focus on cases where the diffusion approximation is not sufficient to demonstrate that our approach can provide significant accuracy gains with only a modest increase in the number of Fourier terms included.</description>

      <title>RAIDER: Rapid, anatomy-independent, deep learning-based PDFF and R2* estimation using magnitude-only signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01178v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Purpose: There has been substantial recent interest in magnitude-based fitting methods for estimating proton density fat fraction (PDFF) and R2* from chemical shift-encoded MRI data, since these methods can still be used when complex-based methods fail or when phase data are inaccessible or unreliable, and may also be used as a final processing step with complex-based methods. However, conventional fitting techniques are computationally expensive. Deep learning (DL)-based methods promise to accelerate parameter estimation, but previous attempts have used convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which are limited by training requirements and poor generalizability (anatomy-dependence). To address these limitations, we propose RAIDER, a voxelwise method for rapid, anatomy-independent deep learning-based PDFF and R2* estimation using multi-echo magnitude-data. Theory and Methods: RAIDER uses two multilayer perceptrons, each trained separately with simulated single-voxel multi-echo magnitude signals, to estimate PDFF and R2*. The use of two networks, each with restricted training distribution, solves the problem of degeneracy during training. During inference, the solution from one of the two networks is chosen based on likelihood. Performance and speed are investigated in a series of simulation experiments, in phantoms and in vivo. Results: RAIDER is 285-1450 times faster than conventional magnitude fitting, taking 1.4-2.3s per slice rather than 8-56minutes, and offers performance similar to conventional fitting. It produces accurate PDFF measurements in phantoms and in vivo images with different anatomies, despite having been trained only on simulation data. Conclusion: RAIDER can substantially accelerate magnitude-based PDFF and R2* estimation, whilst avoiding intrinsic limitations of CNN-based methods.</description>

      <title>Rapid, High-resolution and Distortion-free $R_{2}^{*}$ Mapping of Fetal Brain using Multi-echo Radial FLASH and Model-based Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00256v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Purpose: To develop a rapid, high-resolution and distortion-free technique for simultaneous water-fat separation, $R_{2}^{*}$ and $B_{0}$ mapping of the fetal brain at 3T.
  Methods: A 2D multi-echo radial FLASH sequence with blip gradients is adapted for data acquisition during maternal free breathing. A calibrationless model-based reconstruction with sparsity constraints is developed to jointly estimate water, fat, $R_{2}^{*}$ and $B_{0}$ field maps directly from k-space. This approach was validated and compared to reference methods using numerical and NIST phantoms and data from nine fetuses between 26 and 36 weeks of gestation age.
  Results: Both numerical and experimental phantom studies confirm good accuracy and precision. In fetal studies, model-based reconstruction yields quantitative $R_{2}^{*}$ values in close agreement with those from a parallel imaging compressed sensing (PICS) technique using Graph Cut (intra-class correlation coefficient [ICC] = 0.9601), while providing enhanced image detail. Repeated scans confirm good reproducibility (ICC = 0.9213). Compared to multi-echo EPI, the proposed radial technique produces higher-resolution (1.1 $\times$ 1.1 $\times$ 3 mm$^{3}$ vs. 2-3 $\times$ 2-3 $\times$ 3 mm$^{3}$) $R_{2}^{*}$ maps with reduced distortion. Despite of differences in motion, resolution and distortion, $R_{2}^{*}$ values are comparable between the two acquisition strategies (ICC = 0.8049). Additionally, the proposed approach enables synthesis of high-resolution and distortion-free $R_{2}^{*}$-weighted images.
  Conclusion: This study demonstrates the feasibility of using multi-echo radial FLASH combined with calibrationless model-based reconstruction for motion-robust, distortion-free $R_{2}^{*}$ mapping of the fetal brain at 3T, achieving a nominal resolution of $1.1 \times 1.1 \times 3$ mm$^{3}$ within 2 seconds per slice.</description>
