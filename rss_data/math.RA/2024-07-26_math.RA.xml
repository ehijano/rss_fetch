      <title>Arithmetic and $k$-maximality of the cyclic free magma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We survey free magmas and we explore the structure of their submagmas. By equipping the cyclic free magma with a second distributive operation we obtain a ringoid-like structure with some primitive arithmetical properties. A submagma is $k$-maximal when there are only $k-1$ submagmas between it and the free magma itself. These two tools, arithmetic and maximality, allow us to study the lattice of the submagmas of a free magma.</description>

      <title>Equidecomposable magmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A magma is called equidecomposable when the operation is injective, or, in other words, if $x+y=x'+y'$ implies that $x=x'$ and $y=y'$. A magma is free iff it is equidecomposable and graded, hence the notion of equidecomposability is very related to the notion of freeness although it is not sufficient. We study main properties of such magmas. In particular, an alternative characterization of freeness, which uses a weaker condition, is proved. We show how equidecomposable magmas can be split into two disjoint submagmas, one of which is free. Certain tranformations on finite presentations permit to obtain a reduced form which allows us identify all the finite presented equidecomposable magmas up to isomorphisms.</description>

      <title>Yetter-Drinfeld post-Hopf algebras and Yetter-Drinfeld relative Rota-Baxter operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, Li, Sheng and Tang introduced post-Hopf algebras and relative Rota-Baxter operators (on cocommutative Hopf algebras), providing an adjunction between the respective categories under the assumption that the structures involved are cocommutative. We introduce Yetter-Drinfeld post-Hopf algebras, which become usual post-Hopf algebras in the cocommutative setting. In analogy with the correspondence between cocommutative post-Hopf algebras and cocommutative Hopf braces, the category of Yetter-Drinfeld post-Hopf algebras is isomorphic to the category of Yetter-Drinfeld braces introduced by the author in a joint work with D. Ferri. This allows to explore the connection with matched pairs of actions and provide examples of Yetter-Drinfeld post-Hopf algebras. Moreover, we prove that the category of Yetter-Drinfeld post-Hopf algebras is equivalent to a subcategory of Yetter-Drinfeld relative Rota-Baxter operators. The latter structures coincide with the inverse maps of Yetter-Drinfeld 1-cocycles introduced by the author and D. Ferri, and generalise bijective relative Rota-Baxter operators on cocommutative Hopf algebras. Hence the previous equivalence passes to cocommutative post-Hopf algebras and bijective relative Rota-Baxter operators. Once the surjectivity of the Yetter-Drinfeld relative Rota-Baxter operators is removed, the equivalence is replaced by an adjunction and one can recover the result of Li, Sheng and Tang in the cocommutative case.</description>

      <title>Generalizations of almost prime and right $S$-prime ideals in noncommutative rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.04886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.04886v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $R$ be a noncommutative ring, and let $S$ be an $m$-system of $R$. In this paper, we give more results on the concept of almost prime (right) ideals, that were introduced by the first two authors, especially in (right) $S$-unital rings, local rings, and decomposable rings. In addition, we introduce the concept of almost right $S$-prime ideals, and we show how some findings regarding almost prime ideals can be derived as consequences of almost right $S$-prime ideals. Besides, we show how almost right $S$-prime ideals behave in related rings such as homomorphic images, quotient rings, and decomposable rings. Finally, we construct almost right $S$-prime ideals using the Nagata method of idealization.</description>

      <title>Bounded $t$-structures, finitistic dimensions, and singularity categories of triangulated categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00130v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, Amnon Neeman settled a bold conjecture by Antieau, Gepner, and Heller regarding the relationship between the regularity of finite-dimensional noetherian schemes and the existence of bounded $t$-structures on their derived categories of perfect complexes.
  In this paper, using different methods, we prove some very general results about the existence of bounded $t$-structures on (not necessarily algebraic or topological) triangulated categories and their invariance under completion. We show that if the opposite category of an essentially small triangulated category has finite finitistic dimension in our sense, then the existence of a bounded t-structure on it forces it to be equal to its completion. We also prove a parallel result regarding the equivalence of all bounded t-structures on any intermediate triangulated category between the starting category and its completion.
  Our general treatment, when specialized to the case of schemes, immediately gives us Neeman's theorem as an application and significantly generalizes another remarkable theorem by Neeman about the equivalence of bounded $t$-structures on the bounded derived categories of coherent sheaves. When specialized to other cases like associative rings, nonpositive DG-rings, connective $\mathbb{E}_1$-rings, triangulated categories without models, etc., we get many other applications. Under mild finiteness assumptions, these results not only give a categorical obstruction (the singularity category in our sense) to the existence of bounded $t$-structures on a triangulated category, but also provide plenty of triangulated categories on which all bounded $t$-structures are equivalent. The strategy used in our treatment is introducing a new concept of finitistic dimension for triangulated categories and lifting $t$-structures along completions of triangulated categories.</description>

      <title>Exterior powers and Tor-persistence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.09174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2007.09174v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A commutative Noetherian ring $R$ is said to be Tor-persistent if, for any finitely generated $R$-module $M$, the vanishing of $\operatorname{Tor}_i^R(M,M)$ for $i\gg 0$ implies $M$ has finite projective dimension. An open question of Avramov, et. al. asks whether any such $R$ is Tor-persistent. In this work, we exploit properties of exterior powers of modules and complexes to provide several partial answers to this question; in particular, we show that every local ring $(R,\mathfrak{m})$ with $\mathfrak{m}^3=0$ is Tor-persistent. As a consequence of our methods, we provide a new proof of the Tachikawa Conjecture for positively graded rings over a field of characteristic different from 2.</description>

      <title>Categories of hypermagmas, hypergroups, and related hyperstructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.09273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.09273v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In order to diagnose the cause of some defects in the category of canonical hypergroups, we investigate several categories of hyperstructures that generalize hypergroups. By allowing hyperoperations with possibly empty products, one obtains categories with desirable features such as completeness and cocompleteness, free functors, regularity, and closed monoidal structures. We show by counterexamples that such constructions cannot be carried out within the category of canonical hypergroups. This suggests that (commutative) unital, reversible hypermagmas -- which we call mosaics -- form a worthwhile generalization of (canonical) hypergroups from the categorical perspective. Notably, mosaics contain pointed simple matroids as a subcategory, and projective geometries as a full subcategory.</description>

      <title>Length of triangulated categories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07583v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of composition series and the length of triangulated categories, and we study compositions series of derived categories of certain projective varieties and finite dimensional algebras. For example, we compute the length of the derived category ${\rm D}^{\rm b}(C)$ of a smooth projective curve $C$ and classify all finite length thick subcategories of ${\rm D}^{\rm b}(C)$. Furthermore, we prove that the derived categories of certain smooth projective varieties have composition series of different lengths. We also discuss the length of (1) derived categories of finite dimensional representations of Dynkin and extended Dynkin quivers, (2) derived categories of some singular varieties and (3) Krah's phantom subcategories.</description>
