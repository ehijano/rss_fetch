      <title>An Empirical Characterization of Outages and Incidents in Public Services for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: People and businesses increasingly rely on public LLM services, such as ChatGPT, DALLE, and Claude. Understanding their outages, and particularly measuring their failure-recovery processes, is becoming a stringent problem. However, only limited studies exist in this emerging area. Addressing this problem, in this work we conduct an empirical characterization of outages and failure-recovery in public LLM services. We collect and prepare datasets for 8 commonly used LLM services across 3 major LLM providers, including market-leads OpenAI and Anthropic. We conduct a detailed analysis of failure recovery statistical properties, temporal patterns, co-occurrence, and the impact range of outage-causing incidents. We make over 10 observations, among which: (1) Failures in OpenAI's ChatGPT take longer to resolve but occur less frequently than those in Anthropic's Claude;(2) OpenAI and Anthropic service failures exhibit strong weekly and monthly periodicity; and (3) OpenAI services offer better failure-isolation than Anthropic services. Our research explains LLM failure characteristics and thus enables optimization in building and using LLM systems. FAIR data and code are publicly available on https://zenodo.org/records/14018219 and https://github.com/atlarge-research/llm-service-analysis.</description>
