      <title>On an Unnoticed Geometrical Paradox in Plato's Timaeus' Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a previous article, we discussed a paradox in Timaeus' cosmology: that there is no void inside the universe, even though it is entirely filled with polyhedra-a mathematical impossibility (Brisson-Ofman 2025). In the present article, we examine another paradox. While the first paradox is well known and was already highlighted by Aristotle as a fundamental mathematical contradiction undermining Plato's cosmology, this new paradox has gone almost entirely unnoticed by commentators, both ancient and modern. This oversight may surprise scholars, given the extensive body of work on Timaeus' universe, much of which emphasizes discrepancies with astronomical observations or points out supposed internal contradictions. Like the first paradox, this one arises from the premise of a universe entirely filled with polyhedra. However, in this case, the contradiction stems from the absence of void outside it. In the first section, we demonstrate that the shape of the universe cannot be a perfect mathematical sphere: that is, its boundary is not smooth but exhibits bumps and hollows. Next, we present conceptual arguments from Plato's text that support the necessity of such 'defects' in the universe's shape compared to a perfect mathematical sphere. In the third section, we argue that such a universe cannot move at all. Finally, we propose a solution to this mathematical contradiction in Timaeus' construction, drawing on the same ideas used to address the earlier apparent contradiction: the unique feature of Timaeus' universe as a living being, whose parts are continuously moving, changing, decomposing, and reforming. While this problem does not depend on the various schools of interpretation of the Timaeus, it is related to some important issues concerning Plato's philosophy. These issues include the importance of observations in science-particularly in astronomy-the relationship between intelligible models and their sensible copies, the mythos/ logos approach of Plato's cosmology, and the debate over 'metaphorical' vs 'literal' interpretation. Of course, all these questions fall outside the scope of this article and will not be addressed here.</description>

      <title>The restoration of Book X of the Elements to its original Theaetetean form</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present work, we aim to restore Book X of the $\it{Elements}$ to its original Theaetetean, pre-Eudoxean form in two separate ways. First, we restore the considerable mathematical content of Book X, by correlating Book X with Plato's account of Theaetetus' mathematical discoveries and Plato's imitations of these discoveries for his philosophy. Thus, Theaetetus proved (i) the eventual periodicity of the anthyphairesis of lines a to b, satisfying $Ma^2 = Nb^2$, for MN not square number; (ii) the eventual periodic anthyphairesis of lines a to b, satisfying more general quadratic expressions, including the Application of Areas in defect, and employing this to show that the 12 classes of alogoi lines, including the minor, despite being alogoi, are determined by an eventually periodic Application of Areas in defect; (iii) the anthyphairetic palindromic periodicity of the anthyphairesis of the surds $\sqrt{N}$ for any non-square number N, of relevance to the general Pell's Diophantine problem. Secondly, we restore the proofs of all propositions of Book X, in such way that these are proofs based on Theaetetus', and not on Eudoxus' theory of proportion of magnitudes, in particular not making any use of Eudoxus' condition (namely of definition 4 of Book V). The restoration is based on our reconstruction of Theaetetus' theory of proportion for magnitudes, for the limited class of ratios a/b such that either a, b are commensurable or the anthyphairesis of a to b is eventually periodic, without employing Eudoxus' condition, and its success provides a confirmation of our reconstruction.
  The final version of this paper will appear as a chapter in the journal Ganita Bh\=arat\=i, Bulletin of the Indian Society for History of Mathematics, (2) 45 (2023).</description>
