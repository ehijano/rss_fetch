      <title>Accelerated Proton Resonance Frequency-based Magnetic Resonance Thermometry by Optimized Deep Learning Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Proton resonance frequency (PRF) based MR thermometry is essential for focused ultrasound (FUS) thermal ablation therapies. This work aims to enhance temporal resolution in dynamic MR temperature map reconstruction using an improved deep learning method. The training-optimized methods and five classical neural networks were applied on the 2-fold and 4-fold under-sampling k-space data to reconstruct the temperature maps. The enhanced training modules included offline/online data augmentations, knowledge distillation, and the amplitude-phase decoupling loss function. The heating experiments were performed by a FUS transducer on phantom and ex vivo tissues, respectively. These data were manually under-sampled to imitate acceleration procedures and trained in our method to get the reconstruction model. The additional dozen or so testing datasets were separately obtained for evaluating the real-time performance and temperature accuracy. Acceleration factors of 1.9 and 3.7 were found for 2 times and 4 times k-space under-sampling strategies and the ResUNet-based deep learning reconstruction performed exceptionally well. In 2-fold acceleration scenario, the RMSE of temperature map patches provided the values of 0.888 degree centigrade and 1.145 degree centigrade on phantom and ex vivo testing datasets. The DICE value of temperature areas enclosed by 43 degree centigrade isotherm was 0.809, and the Bland-Altman analysis showed a bias of -0.253 degree centigrade with the apart of plus or minus 2.16 degree centigrade. In 4 times under-sampling case, these evaluating values decreased by approximately 10%. This study demonstrates that deep learning-based reconstruction can significantly enhance the accuracy and efficiency of MR thermometry for clinical FUS thermal therapies.</description>

      <title>Chemical Shift Encoding based Double Bonds Quantification in Triglycerides using Deep Image Prior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01926v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study evaluated a deep learning-based method using Deep Image Prior (DIP) to quantify triglyceride double bonds from chemical-shift encoded multi-echo gradient echo images without network training. We employed a cost function based on signal constraints to iteratively update the neural network on a single dataset. The method was validated using phantom experiments and in vivo scans. Results showed close alignment between measured and reference double bond values, with phantom experiments yielding a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.96 (p = .0005). In vivo results demonstrated good agreement in subcutaneous fat. We conclude that Deep Image Prior shows feasibility for quantifying double bonds and fatty acid content from chemical-shift encoded multi-echo MRI.</description>

      <title>Developing a Novel Image Marker to Predict the Clinical Outcome of Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy (NACT) for Ovarian Cancer Patients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.07087v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Objective Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) is one kind of treatment for advanced stage ovarian cancer patients. However, due to the nature of tumor heterogeneity, the clinical outcomes to NACT vary significantly among different subgroups. Partial responses to NACT may lead to suboptimal debulking surgery, which will result in adverse prognosis. To address this clinical challenge, the purpose of this study is to develop a novel image marker to achieve high accuracy prognosis prediction of NACT at an early stage. Methods For this purpose, we first computed a total of 1373 radiomics features to quantify the tumor characteristics, which can be grouped into three categories: geometric, intensity, and texture features. Second, all these features were optimized by principal component analysis algorithm to generate a compact and informative feature cluster. This cluster was used as input for developing and optimizing support vector machine (SVM) based classifiers, which indicated the likelihood of receiving suboptimal cytoreduction after the NACT treatment. Two different kernels for SVM algorithm were explored and compared. A total of 42 ovarian cancer cases were retrospectively collected to validate the scheme. A nested leave-one-out cross-validation framework was adopted for model performance assessment. Results The results demonstrated that the model with a Gaussian radial basis function kernel SVM yielded an AUC (area under the ROC [receiver characteristic operation] curve) of 0.806. Meanwhile, this model achieved overall accuracy (ACC) of 83.3%, positive predictive value (PPV) of 81.8%, and negative predictive value (NPV) of 83.9%. Conclusion This study provides meaningful information for the development of radiomics based image markers in NACT treatment outcome prediction.</description>

      <title>Biophysical effects and neuromodulatory dose of transcranial ultrasonic stimulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19869v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transcranial ultrasonic stimulation (TUS) has the potential to usher in a new era for human neuroscience by allowing spatially precise and high-resolution non-invasive targeting of both deep and superficial brain regions. Currently, fundamental research on the mechanisms of interaction between ultrasound and neural tissues is progressing in parallel with application-focused research. However, a major hurdle in the wider use of TUS is the selection of optimal parameters to enable safe and effective neuromodulation in humans. In this paper, we will discuss the major factors that determine both the safety and efficacy of TUS. We will discuss the thermal and mechanical biophysical effects of ultrasound, which underlie its biological effects, in the context of their relationships with tunable parameters. Based on this knowledge of biophysical effects, and drawing on concepts from radiotherapy, we propose a framework for conceptualising TUS dose.</description>

      <title>The relationship between parameters and effects in transcranial ultrasonic stimulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01232v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transcranial ultrasonic stimulation (TUS) is rapidly gaining traction for non-invasive human neuromodulation, with a pressing need to establish protocols that maximise neuromodulatory efficacy. In this review, we aggregate and examine empirical evidence for the relationship between tunable TUS parameters and in vitro and in vivo outcomes. Based on this multiscale approach, TUS researchers can make better informed decisions about optimal parameter settings. Importantly, we also discuss the challenges involved in extrapolating results from prior empirical work to future interventions, including the translation of protocols between models and the complex interaction between TUS protocols and the brain. A synthesis of the empirical evidence suggests that larger effects will be observed at lower frequencies within the sub-MHz range, higher intensities and pressures than commonly administered thus far, and longer pulses and pulse train durations. Nevertheless, we emphasise the need for cautious interpretation of empirical data from different experimental paradigms when basing protocols on prior work as we advance towards refined TUS parameters for human neuromodulation.</description>
