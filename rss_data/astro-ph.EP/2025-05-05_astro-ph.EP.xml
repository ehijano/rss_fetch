      <title>Characterizing the Radiative-Convective Structure of Dense Rocky Planet Atmospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use a one-dimensional line-by-line radiative-convective model to simulate hot, dense terrestrial-planet atmospheres. We find that strong shortwave absorption by H2O and CO2 inhibits near-surface convection, reducing surface temperatures by up to approximately 2000 K compared to fully convective predictions. Pure CO2 atmospheres are typically 1000 K cooler than pure H2O atmospheres, with only a few percent of H2O needed to elevate surface temperatures by hundreds of kelvin for a fixed incident stellar radiation. We also show that minor greenhouse gases such as SO2 and NH3 have a limited warming effect when H2O is abundant. Even at insolation values as high as 12,500 W/m2 (about 37 times Earth's current solar flux), planets with mixed CO2-H2O envelopes have surface temperatures in the 1200 to 2000 K range, limiting surface melting. Our results highlight the critical role of shortwave heating on magma ocean planets and the need for improved high-temperature spectroscopy beyond 20,000 cm-1.</description>

      <title>A Model of UV-Blue Absorbance in Bulk Liquid of Venusian Cloud Aerosols Is Consistent with Efficient Organic Absorbers at High Concentrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At visible wavelengths, Venus appears serene and pale-yellow, but since the 1920s, observers have noted high-contrast features in the ultraviolet. These features track the about 4-day superrotation of the upper cloud deck and vary widely over time and space. The identity of the UV absorber(s)-active between at least 280 and 500 nm-remains unknown, as no proposed candidate fully matches all observational data. From remote observations of Venus, and accounting for light scattering by sub-micrometer droplets, we modeled the 365-455 nm absorbance per cm of the bulk liquids forming Venus's clouds. Assuming a uniform distribution in mode 1 and 2 particles across a 6 km layer below the cloud top at 65 km, we constrain the bulk absorbance with a peak at A375 nm being 2942 per cm. This extremely high absorbance implies the presence of a highly efficient absorber, most likely conjugated organics, at relatively high concentration-e.g. about 25 g/L for porphyrin type pigments. Inorganic absorbers, with molar absorption coefficients typically in the range of 1,000-10,000 per M per cm, would either need to comprise a large portion of the aerosols or are simply not light absorbent enough, even if present in pure form. We emphasize that all candidate absorbers must be evaluated against Venus's reflectance curve using (i) known molar absorption coefficients, (ii) realistic atmospheric distributions, and (iii) appropriate particle size distributions. The upcoming Rocket Lab mission will test the hypothesis of organics in Venus's clouds.</description>

      <title>HD 35843: A Sun-like star hosting a long period sub-Neptune and inner super-Earth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the discovery and confirmation of two planets orbiting the metal-poor Sun-like star, HD 35843 (TOI 4189). HD 35843 c is a temperate sub-Neptune transiting planet with an orbital period of 46.96 days that was first identified by Planet Hunters TESS. We combine data from TESS and follow-up observations to rule out false-positive scenarios and validate the planet. We then use ESPRESSO radial velocities to confirm the planetary nature and characterize the planet's mass and orbit. Further analysis of these RVs reveals the presence of an additional planet, HD 35843 b, with a period of 9.90 days and a minimum mass of $5.84\pm0.84$ $M_{\oplus}$. For HD 35843 c, a joint photometric and spectroscopic analysis yields a radius of $2.54 \pm 0.08 R_{\oplus}$, a mass of $11.32 \pm 1.60 M_{\oplus}$, and an orbital eccentricity of $e = 0.15\pm0.07$. With a bulk density of $3.80 \pm 0.70$ g/cm$^3$, the planet might be rocky with a substantial H$_2$ atmosphere or it might be a ``water world". With an equilibrium temperature of $\sim$480 K, HD 35843 c is among the coolest $\sim 5\%$ of planets discovered by TESS. Combined with the host star's relative brightness (V= 9.4), HD 35843 c is a promising target for atmospheric characterization that will probe this sparse population of temperate sub-Neptunes.</description>

      <title>Meteoroid rotation and quasi-periodic brightness variation of meteor light curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Meteor light curves are sometimes known to display flickering: rapid, quasi-periodic variations in brightness. This effect is generally attributed to the rotational modulation of the ablation rate, which is caused by the time-varying cross section area presented by a nonspherical rotating meteoroid to the oncoming airflow. In this work we investigate the effects that the rotation of a meteoroid of given shape (spherical, cubic, or cylindrical) has on the meteor's light curve, given state-of-the-art experimental laboratory estimates of the drag and lift coefficients of hypersonic flow (Mach number &gt; 5) around various shaped objects. The meteoroid's shape is important in determining these two forces, due to the different response of the drag and lift coefficients according to the angle of attack. As a case study, the model was applied to a fireball observed on 2018 April 17 by the PRISMA network, a system of all-sky cameras that achieves a systematic monitoring of meteors and fireballs in the skies over the Italian territory. The results show that this methodology is potentially able to yield a powerful diagnostic of the rotation rate of meteoroids prior to their encounter with the atmosphere, while also providing essential information on their pre-fall actual shapes.</description>

      <title>Instrumentation prospects for rocky exoplanet atmospheres studies with high resolution spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studying the atmospheres of exoplanets is one of the most promising ways to learn about distant worlds beyond our solar system. The composition of an exoplanet's atmosphere can provide critical insights into its geology and potential habitability. For instance, the presence of certain molecules such as water vapor, oxygen, or methane have been proposed to indicate the possibility of life. From an observation point of view, over the past fifteen years, significant progress has been made in characterizing exoplanetary atmospheres. This work reviews recent developments in ground-based high-resolution spectroscopic instruments that make it possible to analyze distant atmospheres in great detail. High-resolution transmission spectroscopy, one of the most effective methods used, has examined the atmospheres of Jupiter-like and is pushing towards the smaller, sub-Neptunian exoplanets. Numerous molecules have been detected using this technique, including CO,H2O,TiO,HCN,CH4,NH3,C2H2,OH. We explore the intriguing possibilities that lie ahead for future ground-based instrumentation, particularly in the context of detecting biologically relevant molecules within Earth-analog exoplanetary atmospheres including molecular oxygen (O2). With detailed exposure time calculations for detecting O2 we find that at the same exposure time spectral resolution of 300,000 reaches higher significance compared to 100,000. The exposure time and therefore the needed number of transits is reduced by a factor of 4 in challenging haze and cloud scenarios.</description>

      <title>Bridging the Atmospheric Circulations of Hot and Warm Giant Exoplanets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform high-resolution atmospheric flow simulations of hot and warm giant exoplanets that are tidally locked. The modeled atmospheres are representative of those on KELT-11b and WASP-39b, which possess markedly different equilibrium temperatures but reside in a similar dynamical regime: in this regime, their key dynamical numbers (e.g., Rossby and Froude numbers) are comparable. Despite their temperature difference, both planets exhibit qualitatively similar atmospheric circulation patterns, which are characterized by turbulent equatorial flows, anticyclonic polar vortices, and large-scale Rossby waves that gives rise to quasi-zonal flows in the extra-tropics (i.e., near ~20 degrees). Quantitative differences between the KELT-11b and WASP-39b atmospheres reflect their different Rossby deformation scales, which influence the horizontal length scale of wave--vortex interactions and the overall structure of the circulation.</description>

      <title>Can planet-planet binaries survive in star-forming regions?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00762v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Significant numbers of free-floating planetary-mass objects have been discovered in nearby star-forming regions by the James Webb Space Telescope, including a substantial number (42) of Jupiter Mass Binary Objects ('JuMBOs') in the Orion Nebula Cluster. The JuMBOs have much wider separations than other populations of substellar binaries, and their existence challenges conventional theories of substellar and planetary-mass object formation. Whilst several theories have been proposed to explain their formation, there has yet to be a study that determines whether they could survive the dynamical encounters prevalent within a dense star-forming region. We place a population of planet-planet binaries in N-body simulations of dense star-forming regions and calculate their binary fraction over time. We find that between 50-90 per cent of planet-planet binaries are destroyed on timescales of a few Myr, which implies that many more must form if we are to observe them in their current numbers. Furthermore, if the ONC was much more dense at formation, the initial separation distribution of the JuMBOs must have been even wider (and less similar to other substellar binaries) than the observed distribution.</description>

      <title>The JWST weather report from the nearest brown dwarfs II: Consistent variability mechanisms over 7 months revealed by 1-14 $\mu$m NIRSpec + MIRI monitoring of WISE 1049AB</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new epoch of JWST spectroscopic variability monitoring of the benchmark binary brown dwarf WISE 1049AB, the closest, brightest brown dwarfs known. Our 8-hour MIRI low resolution spectroscopy (LRS) and 7-hour NIRSpec prism observations extended variability measurements for any brown dwarfs beyond 11 $\mu$m for the first time, reaching up to 14 $\mu$m. Combined with the previous epoch in 2023, they set the longest JWST weather monitoring baseline to date. We found that both WISE 1049AB show wavelength-dependent light curve behaviours. Using a robust k-means clustering algorithm, we identified several clusters of variability behaviours associated with three distinct pressure levels. By comparing to a general circulation model (GCM), we identified the possible mechanisms that drive the variability at these pressure levels: Patchy clouds rotating in and out of view likely shaped the dramatic light curves in the deepest layers between 1-2.5 $\mu$m, whereas hot spots arising from temperature / chemical variations of molecular species likely dominate the high-altitude levels between 2.5-3.6 $\mu$m and 4.3-8.5 $\mu$m. Small-grain silicates potentially contributed to the variability of WISE 1049A at 8.5-11 $\mu$m. While distinct atmospheric layers are governed by different mechanisms, we confirmed for the first time that each variability mechanism remains consistent within its layer over the long term. Future multi-period observations will further test the stability of variability mechanisms on this binary, and expanded JWST variability surveys across the L-T-Y sequence will allow us to trace and understand variability mechanisms across a wider population of brown dwarfs and planetary-mass objects.</description>

      <title>A Survey Of Model Fits to Brown Dwarf Spectra Through the L-T Sequence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00978v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We fit archival near-infrared spectra of 305 brown dwarfs with atmosphere models from the Sonora and Phoenix groups. Using the parameters of the best-fit models as estimates for the physical properties of the brown dwarfs in our sample, we have performed a survey of how brown dwarf atmospheres evolve with spectral type and temperature. We present the fit results and observed trends. We find that clouds have a more significant impact on near infrared spectra than disequilibrium chemistry, and that silicate clouds influence the near infrared spectrum through the late T types. We note where current atmosphere models are able to replicate the data and where the models and data conflict. We also categorize objects with similar spectral morphologies into families and discuss possible causes for their unique spectral traits. We identify two spectral families with morphologies that are likely indicative of binarity.</description>

      <title>Benchmark stars for mean stellar density and surface gravity estimates of solar-type stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adding an independent estimate of the mean stellar density, $\rho_{\star}$, as a constraint in the analysis of stars that host transiting exoplanets can significantly improve the precision of the planet radius estimate in cases where the light curve is too noisy to yield an accurate value of the transit impact parameter, e.g. the light curves of Earth-size planets orbiting in the habitable zone of Sun-like stars that will be obtained by the PLATO mission. I have compiled a sample of 36 solar-type stars for which analysis of high-quality light curves together with constraints on the orbital eccentricity yield mean stellar density measurements with a median error of 2.3%. Of these, 8 are in transiting exoplanet systems and 28 in eclipsing binary systems with very low mass companions that contribute &lt;0.1% of the total flux in the V band. A re-calibrated empirical relation for stellar mass as a function of T$_{\rm eff}$, $\rho_{\star}$ and [Fe/H] has been used to find mass estimates with a typical precision of 5.2% for the stars in this sample. Examples are given of how this sample can be used to test the accuracy and precision of $\rho_{\star}$ and log(g) estimates from catalogues of stellar parameters for solar-type stars.</description>
