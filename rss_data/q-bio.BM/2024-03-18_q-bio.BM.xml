      <title>FoldToken: Learning Protein Language via Vector Quantization and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Is there a foreign language describing protein sequences and structures simultaneously? Protein structures, represented by continuous 3D points, have long posed a challenge due to the contrasting modeling paradigms of discrete sequences. We introduce \textbf{FoldTokenizer} to represent protein sequence-structure as discrete symbols. This innovative approach involves projecting residue types and structures into a discrete space, guided by a reconstruction loss for information preservation. We refer to the learned discrete symbols as \textbf{FoldToken}, and the sequence of FoldTokens serves as a new protein language, transforming the protein sequence-structure into a unified modality. We apply the created protein language on general backbone inpainting and antibody design tasks, building the first GPT-style model (\textbf{FoldGPT}) for sequence-structure co-generation with promising results. Key to our success is the substantial enhancement of the vector quantization module, Soft Conditional Vector Quantization (\textbf{SoftCVQ}).</description>

      <title>Structure-Based Drug Design via 3D Molecular Generative Pre-training and Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14315v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Structure-based drug design aims at generating high affinity ligands with prior knowledge of 3D target structures. Existing methods either use conditional generative model to learn the distribution of 3D ligands given target binding sites, or iteratively modify molecules to optimize a structure-based activity estimator. The former is highly constrained by data quantity and quality, which leaves optimization-based approaches more promising in practical scenario. However, existing optimization-based approaches choose to edit molecules in 2D space, and use molecular docking to estimate the activity using docking predicted 3D target-ligand complexes. The misalignment between the action space and the objective hinders the performance of these models, especially for those employ deep learning for acceleration. In this work, we propose MolEdit3D to combine 3D molecular generation with optimization frameworks. We develop a novel 3D graph editing model to generate molecules using fragments, and pre-train this model on abundant 3D ligands for learning target-independent properties. Then we employ a target-guided self-learning strategy to improve target-related properties using self-sampled molecules. MolEdit3D achieves state-of-the-art performance on majority of the evaluation metrics, and demonstrate strong capability of capturing both target-dependent and -independent properties.</description>

      <title>Physics-informed generative model for drug-like molecule conformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07925v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a diffusion-based, generative model for conformer generation. Our model is focused on the reproduction of bonded structure and is constructed from the associated terms traditionally found in classical force fields to ensure a physically relevant representation. Techniques in deep learning are used to infer atom typing and geometric parameters from a training set. Conformer sampling is achieved by taking advantage of recent advancements in diffusion-based generation. By training on large, synthetic data sets of diverse, drug-like molecules optimized with the semiempirical GFN2-xTB method, high accuracy is achieved for bonded parameters, exceeding that of conventional, knowledge-based methods. Results are also compared to experimental structures from the Protein Databank (PDB) and Cambridge Structural Database (CSD).</description>

      <title>AdaNovo: Adaptive \emph{De Novo} Peptide Sequencing with Conditional Mutual Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07013v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tandem mass spectrometry has played a pivotal role in advancing proteomics, enabling the analysis of protein composition in biological samples. Despite the development of various deep learning methods for identifying amino acid sequences (peptides) responsible for observed spectra, challenges persist in \emph{de novo} peptide sequencing. Firstly, prior methods struggle to identify amino acids with post-translational modifications (PTMs) due to their lower frequency in training data compared to canonical amino acids, further resulting in decreased peptide-level identification precision. Secondly, diverse types of noise and missing peaks in mass spectra reduce the reliability of training data (peptide-spectrum matches, PSMs). To address these challenges, we propose AdaNovo, a novel framework that calculates conditional mutual information (CMI) between the spectrum and each amino acid/peptide, using CMI for adaptive model training. Extensive experiments demonstrate AdaNovo's state-of-the-art performance on a 9-species benchmark, where the peptides in the training set are almost completely disjoint from the peptides of the test sets. Moreover, AdaNovo excels in identifying amino acids with PTMs and exhibits robustness against data noise. The supplementary materials contain the official code.</description>
