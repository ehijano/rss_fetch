      <title>Dynamic Spatial Treatment Effects as Continuous Functionals: Theory and Evidence from Healthcare Access</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I develop a continuous functional framework for spatial treatment effects grounded in Navier-Stokes partial differential equations. Rather than discrete treatment parameters, the framework characterizes treatment intensity as continuous functions $\tau(\mathbf{x}, t)$ over space-time, enabling rigorous analysis of boundary evolution, spatial gradients, and cumulative exposure. Empirical validation using 32,520 U.S. ZIP codes demonstrates exponential spatial decay for healthcare access ($\kappa = 0.002837$ per km, $R^2 = 0.0129$) with detectable boundaries at 37.1 km. The framework successfully diagnoses when scope conditions hold: positive decay parameters validate diffusion assumptions near hospitals, while negative parameters correctly signal urban confounding effects. Heterogeneity analysis reveals 2-13 $\times$ stronger distance effects for elderly populations and substantial education gradients. Model selection strongly favors logarithmic decay over exponential ($\Delta \text{AIC} &gt; 10,000$), representing a middle ground between exponential and power-law decay. Applications span environmental economics, banking, and healthcare policy. The continuous functional framework provides predictive capability ($d^*(t) = \xi^* \sqrt{t}$), parameter sensitivity ($\partial d^*/\partial \nu$), and diagnostic tests unavailable in traditional difference-in-differences approaches.</description>

      <title>Learning Correlated Reward Models: Statistical Barriers and Opportunities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15839v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Random Utility Models (RUMs) are a classical framework for modeling user preferences and play a key role in reward modeling for Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). However, a crucial shortcoming of many of these techniques is the Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives (IIA) assumption, which collapses \emph{all} human preferences to a universal underlying utility function, yielding a coarse approximation of the range of human preferences. On the other hand, statistical and computational guarantees for models avoiding this assumption are scarce. In this paper, we investigate the statistical and computational challenges of learning a \emph{correlated} probit model, a fundamental RUM that avoids the IIA assumption. First, we establish that the classical data collection paradigm of pairwise preference data is \emph{fundamentally insufficient} to learn correlational information, explaining the lack of statistical and computational guarantees in this setting. Next, we demonstrate that \emph{best-of-three} preference data provably overcomes these shortcomings, and devise a statistically and computationally efficient estimator with near-optimal performance. These results highlight the benefits of higher-order preference data in learning correlated utilities, allowing for more fine-grained modeling of human preferences. Finally, we validate these theoretical guarantees on several real-world datasets, demonstrating improved personalization of human preferences.</description>

      <title>Estimating Individual Responses when Tomorrow Matters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.09105v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a regression-based approach to estimate how individuals' expectations influence their responses to a counterfactual change. We provide conditions under which average partial effects based on regression estimates recover structural effects. We propose a practical three-step estimation method that relies on panel data on subjective expectations. We illustrate our approach in a model of consumption and saving, focusing on the impact of an income tax that not only changes current income but also affects beliefs about future income. Applying our approach to Italian survey data, we find that individuals' beliefs matter for evaluating the impact of tax policies on consumption decisions.</description>

      <title>Inference after discretizing time-varying unobserved heterogeneity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07352v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Approximating time-varying unobserved heterogeneity by discrete types has become increasingly popular in economics. Yet, provably valid post-clustering inference for target parameters in models that do not impose an exact group structure is still lacking. This paper fills this gap in the leading case of a linear panel data model with nonseparable two-way unobserved heterogeneity. Building on insights from the double machine learning literature, we propose a simple inference procedure based on a bias-reducing moment. Asymptotic theory and simulations suggest excellent performance. In the application on fiscal policy we revisit, the novel approach yields conclusions in line with economic theory.</description>
