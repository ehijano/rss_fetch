      <title>BASIN: Bayesian mAtrix variate normal model with Spatial and sparsIty priors in Non-negative deconvolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16130v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics allows researchers to visualize and analyze gene expression within the precise location of tissues or cells. It provides spatially resolved gene expression data but often lacks cellular resolution, necessitating cell type deconvolution to infer cellular composition at each spatial location. In this paper we propose BASIN for cell type deconvolution, which models deconvolution as a nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) problem incorporating graph Laplacian prior. Rather than find a deterministic optima like other recent methods, we propose a matrix variate Bayesian NMF method with nonnegativity and sparsity priors, in which the variables are maintained in their matrix form to derive a more efficient matrix normal posterior. BASIN employs a Gibbs sampler to approximate the posterior distribution of cell type proportions and other parameters, offering a distribution of possible solutions, enhancing robustness and providing inherent uncertainty quantification. The performance of BASIN is evaluated on different spatial transcriptomics datasets and outperforms other deconvolution methods in terms of accuracy and efficiency. The results also show the effect of the incorporated priors and reflect a truncated matrix normal distribution as we expect.</description>

      <title>The Cultural Mapping and Pattern Analysis (CMAP) Visualization Toolkit: Open Source Text Analysis for Qualitative and Computational Social Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The CMAP (cultural mapping and pattern analysis) visualization toolkit introduced in this paper is an open-source suite for analyzing and visualizing text data - from qualitative fieldnotes and in-depth interview transcripts to historical documents and web-scaped data like message board posts or blogs. The toolkit is designed for scholars integrating pattern analysis, data visualization, and explanation in qualitative and/or computational social science (CSS). Despite the existence of off-the-shelf commercial qualitative data analysis software, there is a dearth of highly scalable open source options that can work with large data sets, and allow advanced statistical and language modeling. The foundation of the toolkit is a pragmatic approach that aligns research tools with social science project goals- empirical explanation, theory-guided measurement, comparative design, or evidence-based recommendations- guided by the principle that research paradigm and questions should determine methods. Consequently, the CMAP visualization toolkit offers a range of possibilities through the adjustment of relatively small number of parameters, and allows integration with other python tools.</description>

      <title>Communication-Efficient and Memory-Aware Parallel Bootstrapping using MPI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16284v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bootstrapping is a powerful statistical resampling technique for estimating the sampling distribution of an estimator. However, its computational cost becomes prohibitive for large datasets or a high number of resamples. This paper presents a theoretical analysis and design of parallel bootstrapping algorithms using the Message Passing Interface (MPI). We address two key challenges: high communication overhead and memory constraints in distributed environments. We propose two novel strategies: 1) Local Statistic Aggregation, which drastically reduces communication by transmitting sufficient statistics instead of full resampled datasets, and 2) Synchronized Pseudo-Random Number Generation, which enables distributed resampling when the entire dataset cannot be stored on a single process. We develop analytical models for communication and computation complexity, comparing our methods against naive baseline approaches. Our analysis demonstrates that the proposed methods offer significant reductions in communication volume and memory usage, facilitating scalable parallel bootstrapping on large-scale systems.</description>

      <title>Equilibrium-Constrained Estimation of Recursive Logit Choice Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recursive logit (RL) model provides a flexible framework for modeling sequential decision-making in transportation and choice networks, with important applications in route choice analysis, multiple discrete choice problems, and activity-based travel demand modeling. Despite its versatility, estimation of the RL model typically relies on nested fixed-point (NFXP) algorithms that are computationally expensive and prone to numerical instability. We propose a new approach that reformulates the maximum likelihood estimation problem as an optimization problem with equilibrium constraints, where both the structural parameters and the value functions are treated as decision variables. We further show that this formulation can be equivalently transformed into a conic optimization problem with exponential cones, enabling efficient solution using modern conic solvers such as MOSEK. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our convex reformulation achieves accuracy comparable to traditional methods while offering significant improvements in computational stability and efficiency, thereby providing a practical and scalable alternative for recursive logit model estimation.</description>

      <title>Variational Inference for Uncertainty Quantification: an Analysis of Trade-offs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13748v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given an intractable distribution $p$, the problem of variational inference (VI) is to find the best approximation from some more tractable family $Q$. Commonly, one chooses $Q$ to be a family of factorized distributions (i.e., the mean-field assumption), even though $p$ itself does not factorize. We show that this mismatch can lead to an impossibility theorem: if $p$ does not factorize and furthermore has a non-diagonal covariance matrix, then any factorized approximation $q\!\in\!Q$ can correctly estimate at most one of the following three measures of uncertainty: (i) the marginal variances, (ii) the marginal precisions, or (iii) the generalized variance (which for elliptical distributions is closely related to the entropy). In practice, the best variational approximation in $Q$ is found by minimizing some divergence $D(q,p)$ between distributions, and so we ask: how does the choice of divergence determine which measure of uncertainty, if any, is correctly estimated by VI? We consider the classic Kullback-Leibler divergences, the more general $\alpha$-divergences, and a score-based divergence which compares $\nabla \log p$ and $\nabla \log q$. We thoroughly analyze the case where $p$ is a Gaussian and $q$ is a (factorized) Gaussian. In this setting, we show that all the considered divergences can be ordered based on the estimates of uncertainty they yield as objective functions for VI. Finally, we empirically evaluate the validity of this ordering when the target distribution $p$ is not Gaussian.</description>

      <title>Moments by Integrating the Moment-Generating Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23587v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel method for obtaining a wide variety of moments of any random variable with a well-defined moment-generating function (MGF). We derive new expressions for fractional moments and fractional absolute moments, both central and non-central moments. The expressions are relatively simple integrals that involve the MGF, but do not require its derivatives. We label the new method CMGF because it uses a complex extension of the MGF and can be used to obtain complex moments. We illustrate the new method with three applications where the MGF is available in closed-form, while the corresponding densities and the derivatives of the MGF are either unavailable or very difficult to obtain.</description>

      <title>Large-scale spatial variable gene atlas for spatial transcriptomics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07653v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spatial variable genes (SVGs) reveal critical information about tissue architecture, cellular interactions, and disease microenvironments. As spatial transcriptomics (ST) technologies proliferate, accurately identifying SVGs across diverse platforms, tissue types, and disease contexts has become both a major opportunity and a significant computational challenge. Here, we present a comprehensive benchmarking study of 20 state-of-the-art SVG detection methods using human slides from STimage-1K4M, a large-scale resource of ST data comprising 662 slides from more than 18 tissue types. We evaluate each method across a range of biologically and technically meaningful criteria, including recovery of pathologist-annotated domain-specific markers, cross-slide reproducibility, scalability to high-resolution data, and robustness to technical variation. Our results reveal marked differences in performance depending on tissue type, spatial resolution, and study design. Beyond benchmarking, we construct the first cross-tissue atlas of SVGs, enabling comparative analysis of spatial gene programs across cancer and normal tissues. We observe similarities between pairs of tissues that reflect developmental and functional relationships, such as high overlap between thymus and lymph node, and uncover spatial gene programs associated with metastasis, immune infiltration, and tissue-of-origin identity in cancer. Together, our work defines a framework for evaluating and interpreting spatial gene expression and establishes a reference resource for the ST community.</description>
