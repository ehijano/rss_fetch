      <title>B\"acklund-Darboux Transformations for Super KdV Type Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21878v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By introducing a Miura transformation, we derive a generalized super modified Korteweg-de Vries (gsmKdV) equation from the generalized super KdV (gsKdV) equation. It is demonstrated that, while the gsKdV equation takes Kupershmidt's super KdV (sKdV) equation and Geng-Wu's sKdV equation as two distinct reductions, there are also two equations, namely Kupershmidt's super modified KdV (smKdV) equation and Hu's smKdV equation, which are associated with the gsmKdV equation. By analyzing the flows within the gsKdV and gsmKdV hierarchies, we specifically derive the first negative flows associated with both hierarchies.We then construct a number of B\"acklund-Darboux transformations (BDTs) for both the gsKdV and gsmKdV equations, elucidating the interrelationship between them. By proper reductions, we are able not only to recover the previously known BDTs for Kupershimdt's sKdV and smKdV equations, but also to obtain the BDTs for the Geng-Wu's sKdV/smKdV and Hu's smKdV equations. As applications, we construct some exact solutions for those equations. Since all flows of the sKdV or smKdV hierarchy share the same spatial parts of spectral problem, thus these Darboux matrices and spatial parts of BTs are applicable to any flow of those hierarchies.</description>

      <title>Echoes and defects in the Calogero model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09488v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we extend the study of the interplay between scaling symmetries and statistics to one-dimensional fluids by studying the Calogero model in a harmonic trap modulated through time. The latter harbors an interpretation in terms of free particles imbued with exclusion statistics and is an example of a scale invariant fluid in one-dimension displaying $\mathrm{SO(2,1)}$ dynamical symmetry preserved by harmonic traps. Taking advantage of the dynamical symmetry, two experimentally relevant drive protocols spanning both quasistatic and nonadiabatic regimes are investigated and universal signatures of the interactions and exclusion statistics are uncovered in the ground-state echo amplitude and closely related ground-state fidelity. In particular, under both periodic modulation and slow drive through the gapless point of the trap frequency, enhanced interactions and exclusion are shown to favor the proliferation of defects and to hinder their annihilation, which leads to a universal decrease of ground-state fidelities and echo amplitudes. We also show that increasing exclusion sparks a sharp suppression of the likelihood of intermediate echoes beyond those imposed by the commensurability of a periodic drive and the natural frequency of the trap.</description>
