      <title>The optimisation of short-term scheduling of science observations at Paranal observatory (VLT and ELT)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The efficiency of science observation Short-Term Scheduling (STS) can be defined as being a function of how many highly ranked observations are completed per unit time. Current STS at ESO's Paranal observatory is achieved through filtering and ranking observations via well-defined algorithms, leading to a proposed observation at time t. This Paranal STS model has been successfully employed for more than a decade. Here, we summarise the current VLT(I) STS model, and outline ongoing efforts of optimising the scientific return of both the VLT(I) and future ELT. We describe the STS simulator we have built that enables us to evaluate how changes in model assumptions affect STS effectiveness. Such changes include: using short-term predictions of atmospheric parameters instead of assuming their constant time evolution; assessing how the ranking weights on different observation parameters can be changed to optimise the scheduling; changing STS to be more `dynamic' to consider medium-term scheduling constraints. We present specific results comparing how machine learning predictions of the seeing can improve STS efficiency when compared to the current model of using the last 10\,min median of the measured seeing for observation selection.</description>

      <title>Generalizing Trilateration: Approximate Maximum Likelihood Estimator for Initial Orbit Determination in Low-Earth Orbit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15180v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the increase in the number of active satellites and space debris in orbit, the problem of initial orbit determination (IOD) becomes increasingly important, demanding a high accuracy. Over the years, different approaches have been presented such as filtering methods (for example, Extended Kalman Filter), differential algebra or solving Lambert's problem. In this work, we consider a setting of three monostatic radars, where all available measurements are taken approximately at the same instant. This follows a similar setting as trilateration, a state-of-the-art approach, where each radar is able to obtain a single measurement of range and range-rate. Differently, and due to advances in Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) radars, we assume that each location is able to obtain a larger set of range, angle and Doppler shift measurements. Thus, our method can be understood as an extension of trilateration leveraging more recent technology and incorporating additional data. We formulate the problem as a Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE), which for some number of observations is asymptotically unbiased and asymptotically efficient. Through numerical experiments, we demonstrate that our method attains the same accuracy as the trilateration method for the same number of measurements and offers an alternative and generalization, returning a more accurate estimation of the satellite's state vector, as the number of available measurements increases.</description>

      <title>Accounting for Selection Effects in Supernova Cosmology with Simulation-Based Inference and Hierarchical Bayesian Modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15923v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are thermonuclear exploding stars that can be used to put constraints on the nature of our universe. One challenge with population analyses of SNe Ia is Malmquist bias, where we preferentially observe the brighter SNe due to limitations of our telescopes. If untreated, this bias can propagate through to our posteriors on cosmological parameters. In this paper, we develop a novel technique of using a normalising flow to learn the non-analytical likelihood of observing a SN Ia for a given survey from simulations, that is independent of any cosmological model. The learnt likelihood is then used in a hierarchical Bayesian model with Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling to put constraints on different sets of cosmological parameters conditioned on the observed data. We verify this technique on toy model simulations finding excellent agreement with analytically-derived posteriors to within $1 \sigma$.</description>

      <title>Toward Exoplanet Transit Spectroscopy Using JWST/MIRI's Medium Resolution Spectrometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI)'s Medium Resolution Spectrometer (the MRS) on JWST has potentially important advantages for transit and eclipse spectroscopy of exoplanets, including lack of saturation for bright host stars, wavelength span to longward of 20 microns, and JWST's highest spectral resolving power. We here test the performance of the MRS for time series spectroscopy by observing the secondary eclipse of the bright stellar eclipsing binary R Canis Majoris. Our observations push the MRS into saturation at the shortest wavelength, more than for any currently known exoplanet system. We find strong charge migration between pixels that we mitigate using a custom data analysis pipeline. Our data analysis recovers much of the spatial charge migration by combining detector pixels at the group level, via weighting by the point spread function. We achieve nearly photon-limited performance in time series data at wavelengths longward of 5.2 microns. In 2017, Snellen et al. suggested that the MRS could be used to detect carbon dioxide absorption from the atmosphere of the temperate planet orbiting Proxima Centauri. We infer that the relative spectral response of the MRS versus wavelength is sufficiently stable to make that detection feasible. As regards the secondary eclipse of this Algol-type binary, we measure the eclipse depth by summing our spectra over the wavelengths in four channels, and also measuring the eclipse depth as observed by TESS. Those eclipse depths require a temperature for the secondary star that is significantly hotter than previous observations in the optical to near-IR, probably due to irradiation by the primary star. At full spectral resolution of the MRS, we find atomic hydrogen recombination emission lines in the secondary star, from principal quantum levels n = 7, 8, 10, and 14.</description>

      <title>H-infinity Optimization for Active Seismic Isolation Systems in Gravitational-Wave Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-frequency seismic noise poses a significant challenge in gravitational-wave detectors, prompting the use of active seismic isolation systems. These systems employ advanced control configurations, including feedback control, sensor correction, and sensor fusion, to mitigate seismic disturbances. Optimal performance of these systems is achieved through the application of the H-infinity method, which optimizes control filters. The H-infinity method was employed to optimize a sensor correction filter and complementary filters for sensor fusion for a KAGRA Type-B suspension, resulting in the development of an instrumentation-optimal ``super sensor''. The super sensor exhibits comparable overall displacement noise RMS performance to a relative sensor, yet offers significantly better band-limited RMS performance around the secondary microseism frequency, making it highly robust to seismic noise. This highlights the efficacy of the H-infinity method in generating seismic isolation filters tailored to instrument limitations, thereby transforming the system into a fully functional active seismic isolation system.</description>

      <title>Scenarios of future annual carbon footprints of astronomical research infrastructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Research infrastructures have been identified as an important source of greenhouse gas emissions of astronomical research. Based on a comprehensive inventory of 1,211 ground-based observatories and space missions, we assessed the evolution of the number of astronomical facilities and their carbon footprint from 1945 to 2022. We found that space missions dominate greenhouse gas emissions in astronomy, showing an important peak at the end of the 1960ies, followed by a decrease that has turned again into a rise over the last decade. Extrapolating past trends, we predict that greenhouse gas emissions from astronomical facilities will experience no strong decline in the future, and may even rise substantially, unless research practices are changed. We demonstrate that a continuing growth in the number of operating astronomical facilities is not environmentally sustainable. These findings should motivate the astronomical community to reflect about the necessary evolutions that would put astronomical research on a sustainable path.</description>

      <title>Energy-dependent and energy-integrated two-moment general-relativistic neutrino transport simulations of hypermassive neutron star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compare two-moment based \emph{energy-dependent} and 3 variants of \emph{energy-integrated} neutrino transport general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamics simulations of hypermassive neutron star. To study the impacts due to the choice of the neutrino transport schemes, we perform simulations with the same setups and input neutrino microphysics. We show that the main differences between energy-dependent and energy-integrated neutrino transport are found in the disk and ejecta properties, as well as in the neutrino signals. The properties of the disk surrounding the neutron star and the ejecta in energy-dependent transport are very different from the ones obtained using energy-integrated schemes. Specifically, in the energy-dependent case, the disk is more neutron-rich at early times, and becomes geometrically thicker at later times. In addition, the ejecta is more massive, and on average more neutron-rich in the energy-dependent simulations. Moreover, the average neutrino energies and luminosities are about 30\% higher. Energy-dependent neutrino transport is necessary if one wants to better model the neutrino signals and matter outflows from neutron star merger remnants via numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>The enhancement of Gaussian mixture modelling as an application to the coherent WaveBurst algorithm in the search for short gravitational wave transients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16414v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an enhanced method for the application of Gaussian Mixture Modelling (GMM) to the coherent WaveBurst (cWB) algorithm in the search for short-duration gravitational wave (GW) transients. The supervised Machine Learning method of GMM allows for the multi-dimensional distributions of noise and signal to be modelled over a set of representative attributes, which aids in the classification of GW signals against noise transients (glitches) in the data. We demonstrate that updating the approach to model construction eliminates bias previously seen in the GMM analysis, increasing the robustness and sensitivity of the analysis over a wider range of burst source populations. The enhanced methodology is applied to the generic burst all-sky short search in the LIGO-Virgo full third observing run (O3), marking the first application of GMM to the 3 detector Livingston-Hanford-Virgo network. For both 2- and 3- detector networks, we observe comparable sensitivities to an array of generic signal morphologies, with significant sensitivity improvements to waveforms in the low Quality factor parameter space at false alarm rates of 1 per 100 years. This proves that GMM can effectively mitigate blip glitches, which are one of the most problematic sources of noise for un-modelled GW searches. The cWB-GMM search recovers similar numbers of compact binary coalescence (CBC) events as other cWB post-production methods, and concludes on no new gravitational wave detection after known CBC events are removed.</description>

      <title>Dark Photon Dark Matter and Low-Frequency Gravitational Wave Detection with Gaia-like Astrometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16488v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Astrometric surveys offer us a method to search for elusive cosmic signatures, such as ultralight dark photon dark matter and gravitational waves, by observing the deflection to the apparent positions of the stars. The detection capabilities of such surveys rapidly decrease at low frequencies, because the signals become hardly distinguishable from the background motion of stars. In this work, we find that the background motion can be well described by a linear model over time, based on which we propose a linear background subtraction scheme. Compared to the conventional quadratic subtraction, the advantage of linear subtraction emerges within the frequency range below $6 \times 10^{-9}~{\rm Hz}$. Taking dark photons with purely gravitational interactions, dark photons with additional $U(1)_{B}$ or $U(1)_{B-L}$ gauge interactions, and low-frequency gravitational waves as examples, we illustrate that the linear subtraction scheme can result in an enhancement of more than one order of magnitude in the exclusion limits of Gaia-like experiments in the low-frequency range.</description>

      <title>The role of meridional flow in the generation of solar/stellar magnetic fields and cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16620v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Meridional flow is crucial in generating the solar poloidal magnetic field by facilitating the poleward transport of the field from the decayed Bipolar Magnetic Regions (BMRs). As the meridional circulation changes with the stellar rotation rate, the properties of stellar magnetic cycles are expected to be influenced by this flow. In this study, we explore the role of meridional flow in generating magnetic fields in Sun and sun-like stars using STABLE, Surface flux Transport And Babcock-Leighton, dynamo model. We find that a moderate meridional flow increases the polar field by efficiently driving the trailing polarity flux toward the pole, while a strong flow tends to transport both polarities of BMRs poleward, potentially reducing the polar field. Our findings are in perfect agreement with what one can expect from the surface flux transport model. Similarly, the toroidal field initially increases with moderate flow speeds and then decreases after a certain value. This trend is due to the competitive effects of shearing and diffusion. Furthermore, our study highlights the impact of meridional flow on the cycle strength and duration in stellar cycles. By including the meridional flow from a mean-field hydrodynamics model in STABLE, we show that the magnetic field strength initially increases with the stellar rotation rate and then declines in rapidly rotating stars, offering an explanation of the observed variation of stellar magnetic field with rotation rate.</description>

Abstract: The Simons Observatory (SO) is a Cosmic Microwave Background experiment located in the Atacama Desert in Chile. SO consists of three small aperture telescopes (SATs) and one large aperture telescope (LAT) with a total of 60,000 detectors in six frequency bands. As an observatory, SO encompasses hundreds of hardware components simultaneously running at different readout rates, all separate from its 60,000 detectors on-sky and their metadata. We provide an overview of commissioning SO's data acquisition software system for SAT-MF1, the first SAT deployed to the Atacama site. Additionally, we share insights from deploying data access software for all four telescopes, detailing how performance limitations affected data loading and quality investigations, which led to site-compatible software improvements.</description>

      <title>Toward Robust Corrections for Stellar Contamination in JWST Exoplanet Transmission Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.15418v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transmission spectroscopy is still the preferred characterization technique for exoplanet atmospheres, although it presents unique challenges that translate into characterization bottlenecks when robust mitigation strategies are missing. Stellar contamination is one such challenge that can overpower the planetary signal by up to an order of magnitude, and thus not accounting for it can lead to significant biases in the derived atmospheric properties. Yet this accounting may not be straightforward, as important discrepancies exist between state-of-the-art stellar models and measured spectra and between models themselves. Here we explore the extent to which stellar models can be used to reliably correct for stellar contamination and yield a planet's uncontaminated transmission spectrum. We find that discrepancies between stellar models can significantly contribute to the noise budget of JWST transmission spectra of planets around stars with heterogeneous photospheres, the true number of unique photospheric spectral components and their properties can only be accurately retrieved when the stellar models have sufficient fidelity, and under such optimistic circumstances the contribution of stellar contamination to the noise budget of a transmission spectrum is considerably below that of the photon noise for the standard transit observation setup. Therefore, we advocate for further development of model spectra of stars and their active regions in a data-driven manner, empirical approaches for deriving spectra of photospheric components using the observatories with which the atmospheric explorations are carried out, and analysis techniques accounting for multimodal posterior distributions for photospheric parameters of interest, which will be increasingly revealed by precise JWST measurements.</description>

      <title>A roadmap for the atmospheric characterization of terrestrial exoplanets with JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.15895v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ultra-cool dwarf stars are abundant, long-lived, and uniquely suited to enable the atmospheric study of transiting terrestrial companions with JWST. Amongst them, the most prominent is the M8.5V star TRAPPIST-1 and its seven planets. While JWST Cycle 1 observations have started to yield preliminary insights into the planets, they have also revealed that their atmospheric exploration requires a better understanding of their host star. Here, we propose a roadmap to characterize the TRAPPIST-1 system -- and others like it -- in an efficient and robust manner. We notably recommend that -- although more challenging to schedule -- multi-transit windows be prioritized to mitigate the effects of stellar activity and gather up to twice more transits per JWST hour spent. We conclude that, for such systems, planets cannot be studied in isolation by small programs, but rather need large-scale, jointly space- and ground-based initiatives to fully exploit the capabilities of JWST for the exploration of terrestrial planets.</description>

      <title>A Model of the Response of Surface Detectors to Extensive Air Showers Based on Shower Universality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03494v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a full model of surface-detector responses to extensive air showers. The model is motivated by the principles of air-shower universality and can be applied to different types of surface detectors. Here we describe a parametrization for both water-Cerenkov detectors and scintillator surface detectors, as for instance employed by the upgraded detector array of the Pierre Auger Observatory. Using surface detector data, the model can be used to reconstruct with reasonable precision shower observables such as the depth of the shower maximum $X_\text{max}$ and the number of muons $R_\mu$.</description>
