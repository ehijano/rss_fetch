      <title>Two-dimensional PIC simulation of collective Thomson scattering in a beam-plasma system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collective Thomson scattering (CTS) in a beam-plasma system is reproduced by using 2D PIC simulations and the characteristics of the scattered wave spectrum are examined. By formulating the geometric shape of the scattered wave spectrum in wave number space, where the velocity vector of the beam component and the wave vectors of the incident and scattered waves are arbitrary, it is demonstrated that the spectrum in 2D wave number space becomes asymmetric. The spectrum of scattered waves propagating in a specific direction is presented as a function of wavelength to show that the electron (ion) feature is amplified and becomes asymmetric or distorted when Buneman (ion acoustic) instability occurs. An additional simulation is conducted for a weak, linearly stable beam-plasma system with a hot beam, and confirmed that the obtained scattered wave spectrum shows asymmetric feature. The results are expected to be applicable to the interpretation of radar observations of ionospheric plasmas as well as CTS measurements in laboratory plasmas.</description>

      <title>A DC discharge plasma experiment for undergraduate laboratories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plasma physics offers a wide range of fundamental phenomena, making it an excellent subject for undergraduate laboratory instruction. In this work, we present the design, construction, and characterization of a DC glow-discharge plasma chamber developed for the junior-level curriculum, a project carried out by two undergraduate students. The apparatus consists of a 1-meter-long quartz tube with a movable electrode, enabling systematic exploration of plasma behavior under varying pressure, voltage, and geometry. Using this platform, we characterized the Paschen breakdown relation and the voltage-current characteristics of the plasma. We then developed Langmuir probes to map spatial distributions of electron temperature and density, and used Boltzmann plot spectroscopy to measure excitation temperatures across different plasma regions. Finally, with custom Helmholtz coils, we demonstrated magnetic focusing of electrons. We performed Runge-Kutta simulations of particle trajectories and analyzed the electron drift velocity by comparing the focal lengths. Overall, this plasma chamber provides a versatile platform for investigating fundamental plasma phenomena and offers potential for future studies, including microwave-plasma interactions and other student-driven investigations.</description>

      <title>Optimized matching conditions for self-guided laser wakefield accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the matching conditions for self-guided laser pulse propagation in plasma and refine their formulation to maximize the energy of electrons produced via laser wakefield acceleration. Bayesian optimization, combined with particle-in-cell simulations carried out in a quasi-three-dimensional geometry and a Lorentz-boosted frame, is employed. The optimization identifies the maximum electron energy that a self-guided laser wakefield accelerator, driven by a laser of a given energy, can produce, together with the corresponding acceleration distance. Our results further demonstrate that electrons with energies close to the maximum value can be obtained across a relatively wide range of input parameters and without the need for their precise tuning. This provides substantial flexibility for experimental implementation and significantly relaxes the operational constraints associated with self-guided laser wakefield accelerators.</description>

      <title>Generation of proton beams at switchback boundary-like rotational discontinuities in the solar wind</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10406v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Alfv\'enic rotational discontinuities (RDs) are abundant in the inner heliosphere and can be used to model the boundary of switchbacks, i.e. Alfv\'enic magnetic kinks. To investigate the effects of RDs on proton kinetics, we model a pair of switchback-boundary-like RDs with a hybrid Particle-In-Cell (PIC) approach in a 2D system. We find that, at one of the boundary RDs, a significant population of protons remains trapped over long times, creating a secondary beam-like component with temperature anisotropy $T_\perp/T_\|\gtrsim4$ in the proton velocity distribution function that excites ion cyclotron waves within the downstream portion of the transition layer. Further analysis suggests that the static electric field in the vicinity of the RD is the key factor in trapping the protons. This work indicates that switchback boundaries could represent a viable environment for the creation of proton beams in the heliosphere; it also highlights the need to investigate RD sub-structures, especially the embedded current systems of interplanetary RDs. Finally, this paper underscores the importance of high-resolution observations of the solar wind velocity distributions around RDs.</description>

      <title>Modelling cosmic-ray transport: magnetised versus unmagnetised motion in astrophysical magnetic turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18155v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cosmic-ray transport in turbulent astrophysical environments remains a multifaceted problem and, despite decades of study, the impact of complex magnetic field geometry -- evident in simulations and observations -- has only recently received more focussed attention. To understand how ensemble-averaged transport behaviour emerges from the intricate interactions between cosmic rays and structured magnetic turbulence, we run test-particle experiments in snapshots of a strongly turbulent magnetohydrodynamics simulation. We characterise particle--turbulence interactions via the gyro radii of particles and their experienced field-line curvatures, which reveals two distinct transport modes: magnetised motion, where particles are tightly bound to strong coherent flux tubes and undergo large-scale mirroring; and unmagnetised motion, characterised by chaotic scattering through weak and highly tangled regions of the magnetic field. We formulate an effective stochastic process for each mode: compound subdiffusion with long mean free paths for magnetised motion, and a Langevin process with short mean free paths for unmagnetised motion. A combined stochastic walker that alternates between these two modes accurately reproduces the mean squared displacements observed in the test-particle data. Our results emphasise the critical role of coherent magnetic structures in comprehensively understanding cosmic-ray transport and lay a foundation for developing a theory of geometry-mediated transport.</description>

      <title>Response of a magnetically diverted tokamak plasma to a resonant magnetic perturbation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07666v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The safety-factor profile of a magnetically diverted tokamak plasma diverges logarithmically as the magnetic separatrix (a.k.a. the last closed magnetic flux-surface) is approached. At first sight, this suggests that, when determining the response of such a plasma to a static, externally generated, resonant magnetic perturbation (RMP), it is necessary to include an infinite number of rational magnetic flux-surfaces in the calculation, the majority of which lie very close to the separatrix. In fact, when finite plasma resistivity is taken into account, this turns out not to be the case. Instead, it is only necessary to include rational surfaces that lie in the region 0&lt;Psi&lt;Psi_c, where Psi is the normalized poloidal magnetic flux, and Psi_c&lt;1 can be calculated from the edge plasma parameters. It is estimated that Psi_c= 0.9985 for an n=1 RMP, and Psi_c=0.9952 for an n=4 RMP, in a typical JET H-mode plasma.</description>

      <title>Overview of the Helios Design: A Practical Planar Coil Stellarator Fusion Power Plant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08027v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thea Energy, Inc. has developed the preconceptual design for "Helios," a fusion power plant based on the planar coil stellarator architecture. In this overview paper, the design is summarized and the reader is referred to the other papers for more detail. The Helios design is based around a two-field-period quasi-axisymmetric ("QA") stellarator equilibrium with aspect ratio 4.5 and a novel tokamak-like X-point divertor. The natural stability, low recirculating power, and steady-state capability of the stellarator are leveraged. Stability and transport are calculated using state-of-the-art, high-fidelity codes and grounded in measured performance of existing experiments. The electromagnetic coil set is high-temperature superconducting ("HTS") and consists of 12 large, plasma-encircling coils like the toroidal field coils of a tokamak, and 324 smaller, field-shaping coils. All coils are planar and convex. A maximum of 20 T on-coil is enforced, a value which has been achieved in existing large-bore HTS coils. There is a minimum of 1.2 m between plasma and coils, leaving space for tritium breeding blanket and neutron shielding. Because of this thick shielding, all coils have a minimum 40-year operational lifetime, the same minimum lifetime of the power plant system. 1.1 GW of thermal power and 390 MW of net electric power are produced. The shaping coils are individually controllable, enabling a uniquely configurable magnetic field for relaxed manufacturing and assembly tolerances and plasma control. A practical maintenance architecture is a primary driver of the design; maintenance is performed on entire toroidal sectors that are removed from between the encircling coils. A biennial maintenance cycle is estimated to take approximately 84 days, resulting in an 88% capacity factor. Rigorous engineering constraints such as temperature and stress limits are enforced.</description>
