      <title>Network-aided Efficient Large Language Model Services With Denoising-inspired Prompt Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in various tasks, leading to their increasing adoption in diverse services delivered through wireless networks. There is a growing trend toward longer prompts to better leverage LLMs' capabilities and address difficult tasks. However, longer prompts not only increase data transmission costs across wireless transmission but also require more computing resources and processing time, impacting the overall system efficiency and user experience. To address this challenge, we propose Joint Power and Prompt Optimization (JPPO), a framework that combines Small Language Model (SLM)-based prompt compression with wireless power allocation optimization. By deploying SLM at edge devices for prompt compression and employing Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) for joint optimization of compression ratio and transmission power, JPPO effectively balances service quality with resource efficiency. Furthermore, inspired by denoising diffusion models, we design a denoising-inspired prompt compression approach that iteratively compresses prompts by gradually removing non-critical information. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework achieves high service fidelity while optimizing power usage in wireless LLM services, reducing the total service response time. With our DRL-based JPPO, the framework maintains fidelity comparable to the no-compression baseline while still achieving a 17% service time reduction through adaptive compression. When prioritizing compression, our framework achieves up to 16x compression ratio while maintaining acceptable fidelity (within 30% reduction). Compared to no compression, baseline single-round compression with a 16x compression ratio reduces the system total response time by approximately 42.3%, while the denoising-inspired method achieves a 46.5% service time-saving.</description>

      <title>Enabling Sustainable Urban Mobility: The Role of 5G Communication in the Mobilities for EU Project</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines the role of 5G communication in the Mobilities for EU project, a collaborative initiative involving 29 partners and 11 pilots aimed at revolutionizing urban mobility through electrification, automation, and connectivity. Focusing on Dresden as a Lead City, we explore the integration of 27 innovative solutions, including autonomous freight transport, eBuses, and charging robots, using a 5G communication network as the central framework. We analyze how 5G enables seamless connectivity and real-time data processing across diverse technologies, fostering interdependencies and synergies. This approach not only provides a cohesive understanding of the project's scope but also demonstrates 5G's critical role in smart city infrastructure. We evaluate the anticipated impact on sustainability metrics such as air quality, noise levels, CO2 emissions, and traffic congestion. The paper concludes by discussing challenges and strategies in leveraging 5G for comprehensive urban mobility solutions and its potential impact on future smart city developments.</description>

      <title>Integrated Sensing and Communications for Low-Altitude Economy: A Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies an integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) system for low-altitude economy (LAE), where a ground base station (GBS) provides communication and navigation services for authorized unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), while sensing the low-altitude airspace to monitor the unauthorized mobile target. The expected communication sum-rate over a given flight period is maximized by jointly optimizing the beamforming at the GBS and UAVs' trajectories, subject to the constraints on the average signal-to-noise ratio requirement for sensing, the flight mission and collision avoidance of UAVs, as well as the maximum transmit power at the GBS. Typically, this is a sequential decision-making problem with the given flight mission. Thus, we transform it to a specific Markov decision process (MDP) model called episode task. Based on this modeling, we propose a novel LAE-oriented ISAC scheme, referred to as Deep LAE-ISAC (DeepLSC), by leveraging the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) technique. In DeepLSC, a reward function and a new action selection policy termed constrained noise-exploration policy are judiciously designed to fulfill various constraints. To enable efficient learning in episode tasks, we develop a hierarchical experience replay mechanism, where the gist is to employ all experiences generated within each episode to jointly train the neural network. Besides, to enhance the convergence speed of DeepLSC, a symmetric experience augmentation mechanism, which simultaneously permutes the indexes of all variables to enrich available experience sets, is proposed. Simulation results demonstrate that compared with benchmarks, DeepLSC yields a higher sum-rate while meeting the preset constraints, achieves faster convergence, and is more robust against different settings.</description>

      <title>Traffic-cognitive Slicing for Resource-efficient Offloading with Dual-distillation DRL in Multi-edge Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In edge computing, emerging network slicing and computation offloading can support Edge Service Providers (ESPs) better handling diverse distributions of user requests, to improve Quality-of-Service (QoS) and resource efficiency. However, fluctuating traffic and heterogeneous resources seriously hinder their broader application in multi-edge systems. Existing solutions commonly rely on static configurations or prior knowledge, lacking adaptability to changeable multi-edge environments and thus causing unsatisfying QoS and improper resource provisioning. To address this important challenge, we propose SliceOff, a novel resource-efficient offloading framework with traffic-cognitive network slicing for dynamic multi-edge systems. First, we design a new traffic prediction model based on self-attention to capture traffic fluctuations among different edge regions. Next, an adaptive slicing strategy based on random rounding is devised to adjust the resource configuration according to the traffic and demands of edge regions. Finally, we develop an improved Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) method with a dual-distillation mechanism to address the complex offloading problem, where twin critics networks and dual policy distillation are integrated to improve the agents exploration and updating efficiency in huge decision spaces. Notably, we carry out rigorous theoretical analysis to prove the effectiveness of the proposed SliceOff. Using the real-world testbed and datasets of user traffic, extensive experiments are conducted to verify the superiority of the proposed SliceOff. The results show that the SliceOff improves resource inefficiency and ESP profits under dynamic multi-edge environments, which outperforms state-of-the-art methods on multiple metrics under various scenarios.</description>

      <title>Intent-based Meta-Scheduling in Programmable Networks: A Research Agenda</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence and growth of 5G and beyond 5G (B5G) networks has brought about the rise of so-called "programmable" networks, i.e., networks whose operational requirements are so stringent that they can only be met in an automated manner, with minimal/no human involvement. Any requirements on such a network would need to be formally specified via intents, which can represent user requirements in a formal yet understandable manner. Meeting the user requirements via intents would necessitate the rapid implementation of resource allocation and scheduling in the network. Also, given the expected size and geographical distribution of programmable networks, multiple resource scheduling implementations would need to be implemented at the same time. This would necessitate the use of a meta-scheduler that can coordinate the various schedulers and dynamically ensure optimal resource scheduling across the network.
  To that end, in this position paper, we propose a research agenda for modeling, implementation, and inclusion of intent-based dynamic meta-scheduling in programmable networks. Our research agenda will be built on active inference, a type of causal inference. Active inference provides some level of autonomy to each scheduler while the meta-scheduler takes care of overall intent fulfillment. Our research agenda will comprise a strawman architecture for meta-scheduling and a set of research questions that need to be addressed to make intent-dynamic meta-scheduling a reality.</description>

      <title>Securing RC Based P2P Networks: A Blockchain-based Access Control Framework utilizing Ethereum Smart Contracts for IoT and Web 3.0</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ensuring security for highly dynamic peer-to-peer (P2P) networks has always been a challenge, especially for services like online transactions and smart devices. These networks experience high churn rates, making it difficult to maintain appropriate access control. Traditional systems, particularly Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), often fail to meet the needs of a P2P environment. This paper presents a blockchain-based access control framework that uses Ethereum smart contracts to address these challenges. Our framework aims to close the gaps in existing access control systems by providing flexible, transparent, and decentralized security solutions. The proposed framework includes access control contracts (ACC) that manage access based on static and dynamic policies, a Judge Contract (JC) to handle misbehavior, and a Register Contract (RC) to record and manage the interactions between ACCs and JC. The security model combines impact and severity-based threat assessments using the CIA (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability) and STRIDE principles, ensuring responses are tailored to different threat levels. This system not only stabilizes the fundamental issues of peer membership but also offers a scalable solution, particularly valuable in areas such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and Web 3.0 technologies.</description>

      <title>Meta-Reinforcement Learning With Mixture of Experts for Generalizable Multi Access in Heterogeneous Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03850v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper focuses on spectrum sharing in heterogeneous wireless networks, where nodes with different Media Access Control (MAC) protocols to transmit data packets to a common access point over a shared wireless channel. While previous studies have proposed Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)-based multiple access protocols tailored to specific scenarios, these approaches are limited by their inability to generalize across diverse environments, often requiring time-consuming retraining. To address this issue, we introduce Generalizable Multiple Access (GMA), a novel Meta-Reinforcement Learning (meta-RL)-based MAC protocol designed for rapid adaptation across heterogeneous network environments. GMA leverages a context-based meta-RL approach with Mixture of Experts (MoE) to improve representation learning, enhancing latent information extraction. By learning a meta-policy during training, GMA enables fast adaptation to different and previously unknown environments, without prior knowledge of the specific MAC protocols in use. Simulation results demonstrate that, although the GMA protocol experiences a slight performance drop compared to baseline methods in training environments, it achieves faster convergence and higher performance in new, unseen environments.</description>

      <title>How to design a Public Key Infrastructure for a Central Bank Digital Currency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) is a new form of money, issued by a country's or region's central bank, that can be used for a variety of payment scenarios. Depending on its concrete implementation, there are many participants in a production CBDC ecosystem, including the central bank, commercial banks, merchants, individuals, and wallet providers. There is a need for robust and scalable Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) for CBDC to ensure the continued trust of all entities in the system. This paper discusses the criteria that should flow into the design of a PKI and proposes a certificate hierarchy, together with a rollover concept ensuring continuous operation of the system. We further consider several peculiarities, such as the circulation of offline-capable hardware wallets.</description>

      <title>Online SLA Decomposition: Enabling Real-Time Adaptation to Evolving Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08968v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When a network slice spans multiple technology domains, it is crucial for each domain to uphold the End-to-End (E2E) Service Level Agreement (SLA) associated with the slice. Consequently, the E2E SLA must be properly decomposed into partial SLAs that are assigned to each domain involved. In a network slice management system with a two-level architecture, comprising an E2E service orchestrator and local domain controllers, we consider that the orchestrator has access solely to historical data regarding the responses of local controllers to previous requests, and this information is used to construct a risk model for each domain. In this study, we extend our previous work by investigating the dynamic nature of real-world systems and introducing an online learning-decomposition framework to tackle the dynamicity. We propose a framework that periodically updates the risk models based on the most recent feedback. This approach leverages key components such as online gradient descent and FIFO memory buffers, which enhance the stability and robustness of the overall process. Our empirical study on an analytic model-based simulator demonstrates that the proposed framework outperforms the state-of-the-art static approach, providing more accurate and resilient SLA decomposition even under varying conditions and limited data scenarios.</description>

      <title>Joint Mobile IAB Node Positioning and Scheduler Selection in Locations With Substantial Obstacles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16831v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Integrated Access and Backhaul (IAB) in cellular networks combines access and backhaul within a wireless infrastructure reducing reliance on fibre-based backhaul. This enables faster and more cost-effective network expansion, especially in hard-to-reach areas. Positioning a mobile IAB node (MIAB) in a seaport environment, in order to ensure ondemand, resilient wireless connectivity, presents unique challenges due to the high density of User Equipments (UEs) and potential shadowing effects caused by obstacles. This paper addresses the problem of positioning MIABs within areas containing UEs, IAB donors (CFs), and obstacles. Our approach considers user associations and different types of scheduling, ensuring MIABs and CFs meet the capacity requirements of a special team of served UEs, while not exceeding backhaul capacity. Using Genetic Algorithm (GA) solver, we achieve capacity improvement gains, by up to 200% for the 90th percentile. The proposed solution improves network performance, particularly during emergency capacity demands.</description>

      <title>A Deep RL Approach on Task Placement and Scaling of Edge Resources for Cellular Vehicle-to-Network Service Provisioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.09832v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cellular-Vehicle-to-Everything (C-V2X) is currently at the forefront of the digital transformation of our society. By enabling vehicles to communicate with each other and with the traffic environment using cellular networks, we redefine transportation, improving road safety and transportation services, increasing efficiency of vehicular traffic flows, and reducing environmental impact. To effectively facilitate the provisioning of Cellular Vehicular-to-Network (C-V2N) services, we tackle the interdependent problems of service task placement and scaling of edge resources. Specifically, we formulate the joint problem and prove that it is not computationally tractable. To address its complexity we propose Deep Hybrid Policy Gradient (DHPG), a new Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) approach that operates in hybrid action spaces, enabling holistic decision-making and enhancing overall performance. We evaluated the performance of DHPG using simulations with a real-world C-V2N traffic dataset, comparing it to several state-of-the-art (SoA) solutions. DHPG outperforms these solutions, guaranteeing the $99^{th}$ percentile of C-V2N service delay target, while simultaneously optimizing the utilization of computing resources. Finally, time complexity analysis is conducted to verify that the proposed approach can support real-time C-V2N services.</description>
