      <title>Spread complexity for the planar limit of holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complexity is a fundamental characteristic of states within a quantum system. Its use is however mostly limited to bosonic systems, inhibiting its present applicability to supersymmetric theories. This is also relevant to its application to the AdS/CFT correspondence. To address this limitation, we extend the framework of spread complexity beyond bosonic systems to include fermionic and supercoherent states. This offers a gateway to compute spread complexity analytically for any semiclassical system governed by a Hamiltonian associated with a Lie (super)algebra. This requires extending the Krylov chain to a Krylov path in a higher-dimensional lattice. A detailed analysis of supercoherent states within the super Heisenberg-Weyl and OSp$(2|1)$ algebras elucidates distinct contributions from bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom to the complexity. This generalisation allows us to access the semiclassical regime of the planar limit of the holographic correspondence. We then compute the spread complexity of large charge superstring states on the gravity side, which are equivalent to the dual gauge states. The resulting complexity leads to Krylov paths capturing the geometry in which the string propagates.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic and Rayleigh-Plateau instabilities of Q-strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the linear response of Q-strings to perturbations along the cylindrical direction. The results show that the Q-string exhibits dynamical instability when the perturbation wavelength exceeds a threshold $\lambda&gt;\lambda_{c}$. This long-wavelength instability can be characterized by second-order hydrodynamics of viscous fluids and is expected to spontaneously destroy the invariance of the Q-string in the cylindrical direction. More interestingly, at the thin-wall limit, as the configuration of the Q-string approaches a cylinder, this hydrodynamic instability degenerates into the Rayleigh-Plateau instability with a threshold related only to the radius of the cylinder $\lambda_{c}=2\pi R$. Such results reveal the hydrodynamic properties of solitons.</description>

      <title>Distinct neutrino signatures of quark deconfinement in accretion-induced collapse of white dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first seconds-long general relativistic neutrino-radiation simulations of accretion-induced collapse (AIC) of white dwarfs using hadron-quark matter equations of state with different onset densities and latent heat of the first-order quantum chromodynamics phase transition (PT). The collapse forms a proto-neutron star that continues contracting due to neutrino cooling and the softening effect of mixed nuclear-quark matter, followed by a second bounce triggered by the PT to deconfined quark matter, leading to a stable remnant of proto-hybrid star. The resultant distinct neutrino bursts and narrow mass range of AIC events offer critical insights into the existence and properties of hybrid stars, including constraints on the onset density of PT.</description>

      <title>Tensor Product CFTs and One-Character Extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study one-character CFTs obtained as one-character extensions of the tensor products of a single CFT $\mathcal{C}$. The motivation comes from the fact that $28$ of the $71$ CFTs in the Schelleken's list of $c = 24$ CFTs are such CFTs. We study for $\mathcal{C}$ : (i) any two-character WZW CFT with vanishing Wronskian index, (ii) the Ising CFT, (iii) the infinite class of $D_{r,1}$ CFTs and the $A_{4,1}$ CFT. The characters being $S$-invariant homogenous polynomials of the characters of $\mathcal{C}$, when organised in terms of a $S$-invariant basis, take compact forms allowing for closed form answers for high central charges. We find a $S$-invariant basis for each of the CFTs studied. As an example, one can find an explicit expression for the character of the monster CFT as a degree-$48$ polynomial of the characters of the Ising CFT. In some CFTs, some of the $S$-invariant polynomials of characters compute, after using the $q$-series of the characters, to a constant value. Hence, the characters of one-character extensions are more properly elements of the quotient ring of polynomials (of characters) with the ideal needed for the quotient, generated by $S$-invariant polynomials that compute to a constant.</description>

      <title>The Equivalence Theorem at work: manifestly gauge-invariant Abelian Higgs model physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We reconsider the Equivalence Theorem from an algebraic viewpoint, using an extended BRST symmetry. This version of the Equivalence Theorem is then used to reexpress the Abelian Higgs model action, originally written in terms of undesirable gauge variant field excitations, in terms of gauge-invariant, physical variables, corresponding to the Fr\"ohlich-Morchio-Strocchi composite operators in the original field formulation. Although the ensuing action encompasses an infinite number of vertices and appears to be nonrenormalizable from the powercounting viewpoint, it nevertheless is renormalizable, thanks to the hidden equivalence with the original model. Hence, manifestly gauge-invariant computations are possible. We present an explicit illustration in terms of the gauge-invariant scalar field, its Green's function and corresponding pole mass.</description>

      <title>Path integral measure and cosmological constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Considering (euclidean) quantum gravity in the Einstein-Hilbert truncation, we calculate the one-loop effective action $\Gamma^{1l}_{\rm grav}$ using a spherical background. Usually, this calculation is performed resorting to proper-time regularization within the heat kernel expansion and gives rise to quartically and quadratically UV-sensitive contributions to the vacuum energy $\rho_{\rm vac}=\frac{\Lambda_{\rm cc}}{8\pi G}$, with $\Lambda_{\rm cc}$ and $G$ cosmological and Newton constant, respectively. We show that, if the measure in the path integral that defines $\Gamma^{1l}_{\rm grav}$ is correctly taken into account, and the physical UV cutoff $\Lambda_{\rm cut}$ properly introduced, $\rho_{\rm vac}$ presents only a (mild) logarithmic sensitivity to $\Lambda_{\rm cut}$. We also consider a free scalar field and a free Dirac field on a spherical gravitational background, and find that the same holds true even in the presence of matter. These results are found without resorting to any supersymmetric embedding of the theory, and shed new light on the cosmological constant problem.</description>

      <title>Charged Particle in Lie-Poisson Electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lie-Poisson electrodynamics describes the semi-classical limit of non-commutative $U(1)$ gauge theory, characterized by Lie-algebra-type non-commutativity. We focus on the mechanics of a charged point-like particle moving in a given gauge background. First, we derive explicit expressions for gauge-invariant variables representing the particle's position. Second, we provide a detailed formulation of the classical action and the corresponding equations of motion, which recover standard relativistic dynamics in the commutative limit. We illustrate our findings by exploring the exactly solvable Kepler problem in the context of the $\lambda$-Minkowski (or the angular) non-commutativity, along with other examples.</description>

      <title>Quantum vorticity: a not so effective field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a comprehensive picture for the formulation of the perfect fluid in the modern effective field theory formalism at both the classical and quantum level. Due to the necessity of decomposing the hydrodynamical variables $(\rho, p, u^\mu)$ into other internal degrees of freedom, the procedure is inherently not unique. We discuss and compare the different inequivalent formulations. These theories possess a peculiarity: the presence of an infinite dimensional symmetry implying a vanishing dispersion relation $\omega = 0$ for the transverse modes. This sets the stage for UV-IR mixing in the quantum theory, which we study in the different formulations focussing on the incompressible limit. We observe that the dispersion relation gets modified by quantum effects to become $\omega \propto \mathbf{k}^2$, where the fundamental excitations can be viewed as vortex-anti-vortex pairs. The spectrum exhibits infinitely many types of degenerate quanta. The unusual sensitivity to UV quantum fluctuations renders the implementation of the defining infinite symmetry somewhat subtle. However we present a lattice regularization that preserves a deformed version of such symmetry.</description>

      <title>Navigating string theory field space with geometric flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Swampland Distance Conjecture postulates the emergence of an infinite tower of massless states when approaching infinite-distance points in moduli space. However, most string backgrounds are supported by fluxes, and therefore depart from the purely geometric paradigm. This fact requires an extension of the Swampland conjectures to scalar field spaces with non-trivial potentials, rather than just moduli spaces. To address this task, we utilise geometric flows, in particular generalised Ricci flow, to probe the associated scalar field spaces. Considering internal spaces supported by three-form fluxes, we first show that the distance defined in terms of the Perelman entropy functional needs to be refined in order to encompass fluxes. Doing so, we extend the Ricci Flow Conjecture to include Kalb-Ramond flux besides the metric and the dilaton field. This allows us to probe infinite-distance points within these scalar field spaces in a purely geometric way. We subsequently construct a geometric flow for internal manifolds supported by Ramond-Ramond fluxes and discuss its role in the Ricci Flow Conjecture. Our analysis suggests that in the presence of fluxes the Distance Conjecture might be better characterised in terms of a cost function on the space of metrics, rather than a genuine distance.</description>

      <title>Recursion for Differential Cross-Section from the Optical Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05575v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel framework for computing differential cross-sections in quantum field theory using the optical theorem and loop amplitudes, circumventing the traditional method of squaring scattering amplitudes. This approach addresses two major computational challenges in high-multiplicity processes: complexity from amplitude squaring and the extensive summations over color and helicity. Our method employs quantum off-shell recursion, a loop-level generalization of Berends--Giele recursion, combined with Veltman's largest time equation (LTE) through a doubling prescription of fields. By deriving Dyson--Schwinger equations within this doubled framework and constructing quantum perturbiner expansions, we develop recursive relations for generating LTEs. We validate our method by successfully reproducing the differential cross-section for tree-level $2 \to 2$ and $2 \to 4$ scalar scattering for $\phi^{4}$ theory through one-loop and three-loop amplitude calculation respectively. This framework offers an efficient alternative to conventional methods and can be broadly applied to theories with color charges, such as QCD and the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>Three-loop jet function for boosted heavy quarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06881v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the inclusive jet function for boosted heavy quarks to $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s^3)$. The jet function is defined and calculated in the framework of boosted Heavy-Quark Effective Theory (bHQET). It describes the effect of radiation collimated in narrow jets arising from energetic heavy quarks on observables probing the jet invariant mass $M$ in the region where $M^2 - m^2 \ll m^2$, with $m$ the heavy quark mass. This kinematic situation is relevant e.g. in boosted top (pair) production at high-energy colliders. We have verified that our result satisfies non-Abelian exponentiation and checked that our calculation reproduces the known cusp and non-cusp anomalous dimensions of the jet function to $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s^3)$. We also confirmed that the $n_\ell^2\alpha_s^3$ contribution, where $n_\ell$ is the number of massless quark flavors, agrees with the prediction from renormalon calculus. Our computation provides the last missing piece to obtain the N$^3$LL$^\prime$ resummed (self-normalized) thrust distribution used for the calibration of the top quark mass parameter in parton-shower Monte Carlo generators. Our result also contributes to the invariant mass distribution of reconstructed top quarks at N$^3$LL$^\prime$, which can be employed for a precise top mass determination at future lepton colliders. As a by-product, we obtain the relation between the pole and short-distance jet-mass schemes at $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s^3)$. Finally, we estimate the non-logarithmic contribution to the four-loop jet function based on renormalon dominance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Based on the relationship between reduced and thermal density matrices in conformal field theory (CFT), we show that the entanglement spectrum of a conformal critical chain with exponentially decaying terms consists of conformal towers of the associated chiral CFT, with only weak finite-size effects. Through free-fermion and interacting examples, we show that these entanglement spectra present a reliable method to extract detailed CFT spectra from single wave functions without access to the parent Hamiltonian. We complement our method with a Wilsonian numerical renormalisation group algorithm for solving interacting, exponentially decaying chain Hamiltonians.</description>

Abstract: We present a Group Field Theory (GFT) quantization of the Husain-Kucha\v{r} (HK) model formulated as a non-interacting GFT. We demonstrate that the path-integral formulation of this HK-GFT provides a completion of a corresponding spinfoam model developed earlier; we also show that the HK-GFT admits a unique Fock representation that describes the quantum three-geometries of the HK model. These results provide a link to the canonical quantization of the HK model and demonstrate how GFTs can bridge distinct quantization schemes.</description>

      <title>Subsystem Thermalization Hypothesis in Quantum Spin Chains with Conserved Charges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the thermalization hypothesis of pure states in quantum Ising chain with $Z_2$ symmetry, XXZ chain with $U(1)$ symmetry, and XXX chain with $SU(2)$ symmetries. Two kinds of pure states are considered: the energy eigenstates and the typical states evolved unitarily from the random product states for a long enough period. We further group the typical states by their expectation values of the conserved charges and consider the fine-grained thermalization hypothesis. We compare the locally (subsystem) reduced states of typical states/eigenstates with the ones of the corresponding thermal ensemble states. Besides the usual thermal ensembles such as the (micro-)canonical ensemble without conserved charges and the generalized Gibbs ensemble (GGE) with all conserved charges included, we also consider the so-called partial-GGEs (p-GGEs), which include only part of the conserved charges in the thermal ensemble. Moreover, in the framework of p-GGE, the Hamiltonian and other conserved charges are on an equal footing. The introduction of p-GGEs extends quantum thermalization to a more general scope. The validity of the subsystem thermalization hypothesis can be quantified by the smallness of the relative entropy of the reduced states obtained from the GGE/p-GGE and the typical states/eigenstates. We examine the validity of the thermalization hypothesis by numerically studying the relative entropy demographics. We show that the thermalization hypothesis holds generically for the small enough subsystems for various p-GGEs. Thus, our framework extends the universality of quantum thermalization.</description>

      <title>Stability of cosmological singularity-free solutions in quadratic gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10111v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a large family of homogeneous and isotropic cosmological solutions in quadratic gravity which are singularity-free at early and late times. This kind of smooth solutions only emerges beyond the unstable de Sitter branch $3\alpha &lt; \beta$, $\alpha$ being the coupling of the $R^2$ term and $-\beta$ the coupling of the $R_{\mu\nu}^2$ term. We have analyzed the stability of these singularity-free solutions by computing the second-order variation of the action. The complete analysis shows that a Big Bang can emerge from a singularity-free regime when the parameters of the theory are slightly modified, revealing the unstable nature of this type of solutions.</description>

      <title>Fractonic superfluids. III. Hybridizing higher moments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10280v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fractonic many-body systems are characterized by mobility restrictions on single-particle hopping due to the conservation of higher moments (e.g., dipoles, angular momenta, and quadrupoles). This conservation allows the definition of new symmetries and their physical consequences, with spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) being especially intriguing in bosonic systems. Building on previous work [Yuan \textit{et al. arXiv:1911.02876] and [Chen \textit{et al.}, arXiv:2010.03261], we propose a new class of phases called hybrid fractonic superfluids (HFS), where multiple boson species interact and moment hybridization is conserved. We focus on two model series: Model Series A, where moments of the same order from different species are conserved, and Model Series B, where moments of different orders are conserved. In Model Series A, we analyze dipole moment hybridization and extend the analysis to higher-order moments. We investigate ground states, Goldstone modes, correlation functions, and the spontaneous breaking of charge symmetry, showing that at zero temperature, charge symmetry is partially broken when the spatial dimension is at least $N+1$. This results in off-diagonal long-range order (ODLRO) driven by particle-hole bound states formed by bosons of different species. In Model Series B, we explore systems conserving mixed dipole-quadrupole moments. Additionally, we construct Bose-Hubbard-type lattice models where the small Hubbard $U$ limit realizes HFS for both series. We analyze mean-field phase diagrams for Model Series A and discuss potential realizations in strongly tilted optical lattices. Finally, we suggest directions for future research, e.g., MW theorems and large-scale numerical studies for Bose-Hubbard models. This article, together with previous work, forms a trilogy of fractonic superfluids to uncover the exotic interplay of SSB physics and fracton physics.</description>

      <title>Stochastic relativistic viscous hydrodynamics from the Metropolis algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10306v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an algorithm for simulating stochastic relativistic fluid dynamics based on Metropolis updates. Each step of the algorithm begins with an update based on ideal hydrodynamics. This is followed by proposing random (spatial) momentum transfers between fluid cells, keeping the total energy fixed. These proposals are then accepted or rejected using the change in entropy as a statistical weight. The algorithm reproduces relativistic viscous hydrodynamics in the ``Density Frame", which is a formulation of viscous hydrodynamics we review and clarify here. This formulation is first order in time and requires no auxiliary dynamical fields such as $\Pi^{\mu\nu}$. The only parameters are the shear and bulk viscosities and the equation of state. By adopting the 3+1 split of general relativity, we extend the Metropolis algorithm to general space-time coordinates, such as Bjorken coordinates, which are commonly used to simulate heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Investigating SU(3) with Nf=8 fundamental fermions at strong renormalized coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10322v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lattice simulations have observed a novel strong coupling symmetric mass generation (SMG) phase for the SU(3) gauge system with $N_f=8$ fundamental fermions (represented by two sets of staggered fields) at very large renormalized coupling ($g^2_{GF} \gtrsim 25$). The results of Phys.Rev.D 106 (2022) 014513 suggest that the SMG phase is separated from the weak coupling, conformal phase by a continuous phase transition, implying that the SMG phase exists in the continuum limit. To scrutinize these findings, we are generating a set of large volume zero temperature ensembles using nHYP improved staggered fermions with additional Pauli-Villars fields to tame gauge field fluctuations. We consider the low-lying meson spectrum and verify the existence of the SMG phase. Based on a finite size scaling analysis we predict that the phase transition between the strong and weak coupling phases is likely governed by a merged fixed point that is ultraviolet in the strong coupling but infrared in the weak coupling side. This finding suggests that the SU(3) 8-flavor system sits at the opening of the conformal window</description>

      <title>Novel electrically charged wormhole, black hole and black bounce exact solutions in hybrid metric-Palatini gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a systematic exploration of exact solutions for electrically charged wormholes, black holes, and black bounces within the hybrid metric-Palatini gravity (HMPG) framework. HMPG combines features of the metric and Palatini formulations of modified gravity, offering a powerful approach to address challenges in General Relativity, particularly those related to cosmic acceleration and dark matter. We examine configurations characterized by a zero scalar potential under spherical symmetry, and present solutions in both the Jordan and Einstein conformal frames. A diverse set of solutions emerges, including traversable wormholes, black holes with extremal horizons, and "black universe" models in which spacetime beyond the horizon leads to an expanding cosmological solution rather than a singularity. Each configuration is categorized according to the properties of the scalar field, with an in-depth analysis of the horizon and throat structures, asymptotic behaviour, and singularities. These findings underscore the versatility of HMPG in capturing complex gravitational phenomena and broadens the scope of the theory, offering a robust framework for modelling gravitational phenomena across a range of astrophysical contexts. Future work will benefit from extending these solutions to include scalar potentials, addressing both early-universe inflation and late-time acceleration, and applying observational data, such as gravitational lensing and gravitational wave measurements.</description>

      <title>Possibility of Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking in the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model with torsion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.08699v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model in curved space-time with torsion in the leading order of the $1/N$ expansion. The effective potential of the torsion sector is calculated using the new technique based on the nonlocal part of anomaly-induced action which was recently found to produce the effective potential in the low-energy limit. The spontaneous symmetry breaking caused by the change of the torsion term is found, confirming the statements known from the existing literature. Furthermore, the gap equation is calculated as a function of curvature and torsion. Finally, the behavior of the effective four fermions coupling constant as a function of the torsion is discussed.</description>

      <title>On the Definition of the Spin Charge in Asymptotically-Flat Spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19547v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a solution to a classic problem in gravitational physics consisting of defining the spin associated with asymptotically-flat spacetimes. We advocate that the correct asymptotic symmetry algebra to approach this problem is the generalized-BMS algebra $\textsf{gbms}$ instead of the BMS algebra used hitherto in the literature for which a notion of spin is generically unavailable. We approach the problem of defining the spin charges from the perspective of coadjoint orbits of $\textsf{gbms}$ and construct the complete set of Casimir invariants that determine $\textsf{gbms}$ coadjoint orbits, using the notion of vorticity for $\textsf{gbms}$. This allows us to introduce spin charges for $\textsf{gbms}$ as the generators of area-preserving diffeomorphisms forming its isotropy subalgebra. To elucidate the parallelism between our analysis and the Poincar\'e case, we clarify several features of the Poincar\'e embedding in $\textsf{gbms}$ and reveal the presence of condensate fields associated with the symmetry breaking from $\textsf{gbms}$ to Poincar\'e. We also introduce the notion of a rest frame available only for this extended algebra. This allows us to construct, from the spin generator, the gravitational analog of the Pauli--Luba\'nski pseudo-vector. Finally, we obtain the $\textsf{gbms}$ moment map, which we use to construct the gravitational spin charges and gravitational Casimirs from their dual algebra counterparts.</description>

      <title>A local Generalized second law in crossed product constructions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00718v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we show a local generalized second law (the generalized entropy is nondecreasing) in crossed product constructions for maximally extended static and Kerr black holes using modular theory. The new ingredient is the use of results from a recent paper discussing the entropy of the algebra of operators in subregions of arbitrary spacetimes. These results rely on an assumption which we show is true in our setting. However, we do assume as in that paper, that the gravitational constraints are implemented on each partial Cauchy slice. We employ a slight generalization of the construction, by including an observer degree of freedom even for wedge shaped regions with an asymptotic boundary. In the last part of the paper, we look at modular Hamiltonians of deformed half-spaces in a class of static spacetimes, including the Schwarzschild spacetime. These are computed using path integrals, and we primarily compute them to investigate whether these non-local modular Hamiltonians can be made local by subtracting off pieces from the algebra and its commutant, as has been surmised in the literature. Along the way, the averaged null energy condition (ANEC) also follows in this class of spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Nontrivial bundles and defect operators in $n$-form gauge theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03406v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In $(d+1)$-dimensional $1$-form nonabelian gauge theories, we classify nontrivial $0$-form bundles in $ \mathbb{R}^{d} $, which yield configurations of $D(d-2j)$-branes wrapping $(d-2j)$-cycles $c_{d-2j} $ in $Dd$-branes. We construct the related defect operators $ U^{(2j-1)} ( c_{d-2j} ) $, which are disorder operators carrying the $D(d-2j)$ charge. We compute the commutation relations between the defect operators and Chern-Simons operators on odd-dimensional closed manifolds, and derive the generalized Witten effect for $U^{(2j-1)} ( c_{d-2j} ) $. When $c_{d-2j}$ is not exact, $ U^{(2j-1)} ( c_{d-2j} ) $ and $ U^{(2j-1)} (- c_{d-2j} ) $ can also combine into an electric $(2j-1)$-form global symmetry operator, where the $(2j-1)$-form is the Chern-Simons form. The dual magnetic $(d-2j)$-form global symmetry is generated by the $D(d-2j)$ charge. We also study nontrivial $1$-form bundles in $(d+1)$-dimensional $2$-form nonabelian gauge theories, where the defect operators are $\mathcal{U}^{(2j)} ( c_{d-2j-1} ) $. With the field strength of the $1$-form taken as the flat connection of the $2$-form, we classify the topological sectors in $2$-form theories.</description>

      <title>The Edge of Random Tensor Eigenvalues with Deviation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07731v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The largest eigenvalue of random tensors is an important feature of systems involving disorder, equivalent to the ground state energy of glassy systems or to the injective norm of quantum states. For symmetric Gaussian random tensors of order 3 and of size $N$, in the presence of a Gaussian noise, continuing the work [arXiv:2310.14589], we compute the genuine and signed eigenvalue distributions, using field theoretic methods at large $N$ combined with earlier rigorous results of [arXiv:1003.1129]. We characterize the behaviour of the edge of the two distributions as the variance of the noise increases. We find two critical values of the variance, the first of which corresponding to the emergence of an outlier from the main part of the spectrum and the second where this outlier merges with the corresponding largest eigenvalue and they both become complex. We support our claims with Monte Carlo simulations. We believe that our results set the ground for a definition of pseudospectrum of random tensors based on $Z$-eigenvalues.</description>

      <title>Higher spin swampland conjecture for massive AdS$_{3}$ gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09151v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we show that a possible version of the swampland weak gravity conjecture for higher spin (HS) massive topological AdS$_{3}$ gravity can be expressed in terms of mass $M_{hs}$, charge $Q_{hs}$ and coupling constant $g_{hs}$ of 3D gravity coupled to higher spin fields as $M_{hs} \leq \sqrt{2}$ $Q_{hs}$ $g_{hs}$ $M_{Pl}$. The higher spin charge is given by the $SO(1,2)$ quadratic Casimir $Q_{hs}^{2}=s\left (s-1\right) $ and the HS coupling constant by ${\large g}_{hs} ^{2}=2/\left (M_{Pl}^{2} l_{AdS_{3}}^{2}\right )$ while the mass expressed like $\left( l_{AdS_{3}} \text{M}_{hs}\right) ^{2}$ is defined as $ \left (1+\mu l_{AdS_{3}} \right ) ^{2} s \left ( s-1 \right ) +[1- \left ( \mu l_{AdS_{3}} \right ) ^{2} \left ( s-1 \right ) ]$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10169v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Since the relic gravitons are produced in entangled states of opposite (comoving) three-momenta, their distributions and their averaged multiplicities must determine the maximal frequency of the spectrum above which the created pairs are exponentially suppressed. The absolute upper bound on the maximal frequency derived in this manner coincides with the THz domain and does not rely on the details of the cosmological scenario. The THz limit also translates into a constraint of the order of $10^{-33}$ on the minimal chirp amplitudes that should be effectively reached by all classes of hypothetical detectors aiming at the direct scrutiny of a signal in the frequency domain that encompasses the MHz and the GHz bands. The obtained high-frequency limit is deeply rooted in the quantumness of the produced gravitons whose multiparticle final sates are macroscopic but always non-classical. Since the unitary evolution preserves their coherence, the quantumness of the gravitons can be associated with an entanglement entropy that is associated with the loss of the complete information on the underlying quantum field. It turns out that the reduction of the density matrix in different bases leads to the same Von Neumann entropy whose integral over all the modes of the spectrum is dominated by the maximal frequency. Thanks to the THz bound the total integrated entropy of the gravitons can be comparable with the cosmic microwave background entropy but not larger. Besides the well known cosmological implications, we then suggest that a potential detection of gravitons between the MHz and the THz may therefore represent a direct evidence of macroscopic quantum states associated with the gravitational field.</description>

Abstract: General Relativity predicts the existence of quadratic quasi-normal modes at second order in perturbation theory. Building on our recent work, we compute the amplitudes and polarizations of these modes for non-rotating black holes, showing that they are completely determined by the amplitudes and polarizations of linear modes. We obtain the ratio of quadratic to linear amplitudes, which still depends on the initial conditions of the merger through the polarization of linear modes. However, we demonstrate that this dependence is captured by four fundamental numbers, independent of initial conditions, representing four different combinations of linear modes parities. Additionally, we prove two selection rules regarding the vanishing of classes of quadratic modes. Our results are available online as a package which provides the ratio of amplitudes across a broad spectrum of angular momenta.</description>

      <title>Holographic Einstein Ring of Deformed AdS-Schwarzschild Black Holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09069v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, the wave optics is employed to investigate the Einstein ring of a deformed AdS-Schwarzschild black hole (BH). When the source is fixed on the AdS boundary, one can obtain the corresponding response function generated on the antipodal side of the boundary. By utilizing a virtual optical system equipped with a convex lens, we are able to capture an image of the BH's holographic Einstein ring on the screen. The influence of the relevant physical parameters and the observer's position on the characteristics of the Einstein ring is also investigated, revealing that variations in the observer's position result in a transition of the displayed image from an axisymmetric ring to an arc, ultimately converging into a solitary point of luminosity. In addition, variations in the relevant physical parameters naturally exert influences on the Einstein ring. The photon ring of the BH was also investigated from a geometric optics perspective, and the numerical results indicate that the incident angle of the photon ring aligns with that of the Einstein ring. In the context of modified gravity theories, the investigation of Einstein rings formed by deformed AdS-Schwarzschild BH is expected to not only contribute to advancing the development of gravitational theories but also facilitate a more comprehensive understanding of spacetime geometry and the physical properties of BHs, thereby distinguishing them from Schwarzschild BH.</description>

      <title>Critical reassessment of the restricted Weyl symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02763v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A class of globally scale-invariant scalar-tensor theories have been proposed to be invariant under a larger class of transformations that take the form of local Weyl transformations supplemented by a restriction that the conformal factor satisfies a covariant Klein-Gordon equation. The action of these theories indeed seems to be invariant under such transformations up to boundary terms, this property being referred to as ``restricted Weyl symmetry''. However, we find that corresponding equations of motion are not invariant under these transformations. This is a paradox, that is explained by realizing that the restriction condition on the conformal factor forces the restricted Weyl transformation to be a nonlocal transformation. For nonlocal transformations would-be boundary terms cannot in general be discarded from the action. Moreover, variations of trajectories cannot be assumed to vanish at boundaries of the action when deriving equations of motion. We illustrate both of these less known properties by considering a series of simple examples. Finally, we apply these observations to the case of globally scale-invariant scalar-tensor theories to demonstrate that restricted Weyl transformations are, in fact, not symmetries of the full system.</description>

      <title>Unraveling the Physical Meaning Behind Elko's Dual structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16196v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we shall analyze the necessity of a proper definition of the dual structure for Elko spinors, and singular spinors in general. We examine in detail why the Dirac dual structure fails and it is not functional for these cases, highlighting all the physical consequences of this misdirection. The approach considered here is different from the one usually taken in current literature. We pinpoint the shortcomings that this dual structure brings to particle interpretation, and propagator structure, as well as the implications in non-locality, and the existence of negative energy levels. This investigation furnishes a background for the successful achievements in the field associated with such proper dual formulation.</description>

      <title>Holographic Non-Hermitian Lattices and Junctions with PT-Restoring RG Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13584v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct and study inhomogenoeus non-Hermitian strongly coupled holographic field theories. We consider two models: a lattice where in each site there is some inflow/outflow of matter and a Hermitian/non-Hermitian/Hermitian junction. Depending on whether we turn on a complex external gauge field, we find solutions that spontaneously break PT (thus hinting at a lack of unitary evolution) and solutions that do not. The former present an imaginary current responsible for the spontaneous breaking of PT. We also study the IR geometry of these solutions finding that they flow to a PT-unbroken fixed point. This leads us to claim that there is a PT-symmetry restoration in the IR, similar to the one observed in the perturbative setup of arXiv:2110.05289.</description>

      <title>String Theory in a Pinch: Resolving the Gregory-Laflamme Singularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14998v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thin enough black strings are unstable to growing ripples along their length, eventually pinching and forming a naked singularity on the horizon. We investigate how string theory can resolve this singularity. First, we study the string-scale version of the static non-uniform black strings that branch off at the instability threshold: "string-ball strings", which are linearly extended, self-gravitating configurations of string balls obtained in the Horowitz-Polchinski (HP) approach to near-Hagedorn string states. We construct non-uniform HP strings in spatial dimensions $d\leq 6$ and show that, as the inhomogeneity increases, they approach localized HP balls. We also examine the thermodynamic properties of the different phases in the canonical and microcanonical ensembles. We find that, for a sufficiently small mass, the uniform HP string will be stable and not evolve into a non-uniform or localized configuration. Building on these results and independent evidence from the evolution of the black string instability with $\alpha'$ corrections, we propose that, at least in $d=4,5$, string theory slows and eventually halts the pinching evolution at a classically stable stringy neck. In $d\geq 6$ this transition is likely to occur into a puffed-up string ball. The system then enters a slower phase in which the neck gradually evaporates into radiation. We discuss this scenario as a framework for understanding how string theory resolves the formation of naked singularities.</description>

      <title>Tensor global symmetries and the Stueckelberg mechanism for tensor fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16928v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the concept of tensor global symmetries, featuring conserved currents of mixed symmetry and higher spin Nambu-Goldstone bosons. We develop a Stueckelberg mechanism for mixed symmetry tensor fields at the linearized level, focusing on the massive graviton, the massive $(2,1)$ Curtright field and the massive $(2,2)$ field. Counting degrees of freedom, we identify the set of fields that necessarily appear in the gauge invariant Stueckelberg action in each case. These fields transform under shift symmetries and they are a vector and a scalar in the first case, a graviton, a Kalb-Ramond field and a vector in the second case and a Curtright field and a graviton in the third case. The analysis results in gauge invariant and fully conserved currents of mixed symmetry for the corresponding gauge theories, which are linked to their tensor global symmetries and they can be minimally coupled to suitable background fields. Viewing the graviton and the Kalb-Ramond field as Nambu-Goldstone bosons for constant symmetric and antisymmetric shift symmetries, we use a nonminimal coupling to uncover a 't Hooft anomaly in linearized gravity.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we present the black hole solution of the Einstein-Yang-Mills model incorporating a non-minimal coupling between the Ricci tensor and the Yang-Mills field strength tensor using a perturbative method. We then explore the thermodynamic phase transitions of the black hole within an extended phase space, examining both canonical and grand canonical ensembles. Our findings reveal that altering the sign of the perturbation coefficient $\lambda$ leads to a significant shift in the thermodynamic behavior of the black hole, transitioning between Van der Waals-like fluid phase transitions and Hawking-Page-like transitions.</description>

      <title>Binary systems in massive scalar-tensor theories: Next-to-leading order gravitational wave phase from effective field theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.04274v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neutron star binaries and their associated gravitational wave signal facilitate precision tests of General Relativity. Any deviation of the detected gravitational waveform from General Relativity would therefore be a smoking gun signature of new physics, in the form of additional forces, dark matter particles, or extra gravitational degrees of freedom. To be able to probe new theories, precise knowledge of the expected waveform is required. In our work, we consider a generic setup by augmenting General Relativity with an additional, massive scalar field. We then compute the inspiral dynamics of a binary system, for circular orbits, by employing an effective field theoretical approach, while giving a detailed introduction to the computational framework. Finally, we derive the modified TaylorF2 phase of the gravitational wave signal at next-to-leading order in the post-Newtonian expansion, and leading order in the parameters of the scalar sector, such as the scalar charge. As a consequence of our model-agnostic approach, our results are readily adaptable to a plethora of new physics scenarios, including modified gravity theories and scalar dark matter models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08811v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the stability of the Standard Model vacuum, and investigate its quantum effective potential using the highest available orders in perturbation theory and the most accurate determination of input parameters to date. We observe that the stability of the electroweak vacuum centrally depends on the values of the top mass and the strong coupling constant. We estimate that reducing their uncertainties by a factor of two to three is sufficient to establish or refute SM vacuum stability at the $5\sigma$ level. We further investigate vacuum stability for a variety of singlet scalar field extensions with and without flavor using the Higgs portal mechanism. We identify the BSM parameter spaces for stability and find sizable room for new physics. We further study the phenomenology of Planck-safe models at colliders, and determine the impact on the Higgs trilinear, the Higgs-to-electroweak-boson, and the Higgs quartic couplings, some of which can be significant. The former two can be probed at the HL-LHC, the latter requires a future collider with sufficient energy and precision such as the FCC-hh.</description>

      <title>Solutions of tetrahedron equation from quantum cluster algebra associated with symmetric butterfly quiver</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08814v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a new solution to the tetrahedron equation by further pursuing the quantum cluster algebra approach in our previous works. The key ingredients include a symmetric butterfly quiver attached to the wiring diagrams for the longest element of type $A$ Weyl groups and the implementation of quantum $Y$-variables through the $q$-Weyl algebra. The solution consists of four products of quantum dilogarithms, incorporating a total of seven parameters. By exploring both the coordinate and momentum representations, along with their modular double counterparts, our solution encompasses various known three-dimensional (3D) $R$-matrices. These include those obtained by Kapranov-Voevodsky ('94) utilizing the quantized coordinate ring, Bazhanov-Mangazeev-Sergeev ('10) from a quantum geometry perspective, Kuniba-Matsuike-Yoneyama ('23) linked with the quantized six-vertex model, and Inoue-Kuniba-Terashima ('23) associated with the Fock-Goncharov quiver. The 3D $R$-matrix presented in this paper offers a unified perspective on these existing solutions, coalescing them within the framework of quantum cluster algebra.</description>

Abstract: Quadratic quasi-normal modes, generated at second order in black hole perturbation theory, are a promising target for testing gravity in the nonlinear regime with next-generation gravitational wave detectors. While their frequencies have long been known, their amplitudes remain poorly studied. We introduce regular variables and compute amplitudes for Schwarzschild black holes with the Leaver algorithm. We find a nonlinear ratio $\mathcal{R}\simeq0.154e^{-0.068i}$ for the most excited $\ell=4$ mode, matching results from Numerical Relativity. We also predict new low-frequency $\ell=2$ quadratic modes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04408v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pixelated dark energy is a string theory scenario with a quantum mechanically stable cosmological constant. The number of pixels that make up the universe slowly increases, manifesting as a time-dependent source of dark energy. DESI has recently reported evidence for dynamical dark energy that fits within this framework. In light of this, we perform the first cosmological analysis of the pixelated model. We find that the simplest model where the pixel growth rate is constant is able to accommodate the data, providing a marginally better fit than $\Lambda$CDM; and we show that models where the pixel growth rate is increasing and of order the Hubble constant today could provide better fits. Our analysis helps to clarify the features of UV constructions of dark energy necessary to accommodate the data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07636v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use a numerical cooling algorithm to study fractional instantons in $SU(2)$ pure Yang-Mills on $\mathbb{R}^2\times\mathbb{T}^2_*$, $\mathbb{R}^3\times S^1$, and $\mathbb{R}\times \mathbb{T}^2_* \times S^1$. We confirm that the fractional instantons are center vortices on $\mathbb{R}^2\times\mathbb{T}^2_*$ and monopoles on $\mathbb{R}^3\times S^1$, and we calculate several properties relevant to using these solutions for semiclassical calculations. On $\mathbb{R}\times \mathbb{T}^2_* \times S^1$, we interpolate between the large $\mathbb{T}^2_*$ limit and the large $S^1$ limit to study how the solutions interpolate between center vortices and monopoles. We find that they are separated by a sharp transition, with 't Hooft's constant field strength solutions living at the transition point. These results contrast but do not contradict recent results suggesting continuity between vortices and monopoles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20658v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Light scalar fields play a variety of roles in modern physics, especially in cosmology and modified theories of gravity. For this reason, there is a zoo of experiments actively trying to find evidence for many scalar field models that have been proposed in theoretical considerations. Among those are setups in which the pressures expected to be induced by light scalar fields between two parallel plates are studied, for example, Casimir force experiments. While it is known that classical and quantum pressures caused by light scalar fields could have significant impacts on such experiments, in this article, we show that this can also be the case for thermal pressure. More specifically, we derive expressions for the quantum and thermal pressures induced by exchanges of light scalar field fluctuations between two thin parallel plates. As particular examples, we then look at screened scalar fields. For chameleon, symmetron and environment-dependent dilaton models, we find large regions in their parameter spaces that allow for thermal pressures to equal or exceed the quantum pressures. By comparing with earlier constraints from quantum pressure calculations, we conclude that thermal pressures induced by chameleons are actually of experimental significance.</description>

      <title>The effect of quantum decoherence on inflationary gravitational waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02563v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The theory of inflation provides a mechanism to explain the structures we observe today in the Universe, starting from quantum-mechanically generated fluctuations. However, this leaves the question of: how did the quantum-to-classical transition, occur? During inflation, tensor perturbations interact (at least gravitationally) with other fields, meaning that we need to view these perturbations as an open system that interacts with an environment. In this paper, the evolution of the system is described using a Lindblad equation, which describes the quantum decoherence of the system. This is a possible mechanism for explaining the quantum-to-classical transition. We show that this quantum decoherence leads to a scale-dependent increase of the gravitational wave power spectrum, depending on the strength and time dependence of the interaction between the system and the environment. By using current upper bounds on the gravitational wave power spectrum from inflation, obtained from CMB and the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA constraints, we find an upper bound on the interaction strength. Furthermore, we compute the decoherence criterion, which indicates the minimal interaction strength needed for a specific scale to have successfully decohered by the end of inflation. Assuming that the CMB modes have completely decohered, we indicate a lower bound on the interaction strength. In addition, this decoherence criterion allows us to look at which scales might not have fully decohered and could still show some relic quantum signatures. Lastly, we use sensitivity forecasts to study how future gravitational-wave detectors, such as LISA and ET, could constrain the decoherence parameter space. Due to the scale-dependence of the power spectrum, LISA could only have a very small impact. However, ET will be able to significantly improve our current constraints for specific decoherence scenarios.</description>

      <title>Consequences of Minimal Entanglement in Bosonic Field Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13030v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a recently discovered connection between scattering that minimally entangles and emergent symmetries. In a perturbative expansion, we have generalized the constraints of minimal entanglement scattering, beyond qubits, to general qudits of dimension $d.$ Interestingly, projecting on any qubit subspaces, the constraints factorize, so that it is consistent to analyze minimal entanglement by looking at all such subspaces. We start by looking at toy models with two scalar fields, finding that minimal entanglement only allows quartic couplings which have instabilities at large field values and no symmetries. For the two Higgs doublet model, by considering $H^+ H^-\to H^+ H^-$ scattering, we show that minimal entanglement in this channel does not allow an interacting parameter point with enhanced symmetries. These results show that the connection between minimal entanglement and symmetries depends strongly on the scattering channels analyzed and we speculate on the potential resolutions.</description>

      <title>Relaxation dynamics of integrable field theories after a global quantum quench</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00682v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We apply the linked cluster expansion as well as the quench action approach to study the time evolution of one-point functions after a quantum quench in integrable field theories. We argue that the relaxation towards the stationary value fundamentally differs depending on the locality properties of the considered observable: while for local operators both exponential and power-law decaying terms are present in the dynamics, for semi-local operators the latter are absent. We explicitly confirm this for the Ising field theory, the sinh-Gordon model, and the repulsive sine-Gordon model.</description>

      <title>No-hair and almost-no-hair results for static axisymmetric black holes and ultracompact objects in astrophysical environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08128v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: No-hair theorems are uniqueness results constraining the form of the metric of black holes in general relativity. These theorems are typically formulated under idealized assumptions, involving a mixture of local (regularity of the horizon) and global aspects (vacuum spacetime and asymptotic flatness). This limits their applicability to astrophysical scenarios of interest such as binary black holes and accreting systems, as well as their extension to horizonless objects. A previous result due to G\"urlebeck constrains the asymptotic multipolar structure of static spacetimes containing black holes surrounded by matter although not revealing the possible structure of the metric itself. In this work, we disentangle some of these assumptions in the static and axisymmetric case. Specifically: i) we show that only a one-parameter family of black-hole geometries is compatible with a given external gravitational field, ii) we also analyze the case in which the central object is close to forming an event horizon but is still horizonless and show that the deviations from the natural black-hole shape have to die off as one approaches the black hole limit under the physical principle that curvatures are bounded.</description>

      <title>Two-loop corrections in power spectrum in models of inflation with PBHs formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10253v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We calculate the two-loop corrections in primordial power spectrum in models of single field inflation incorporating an intermediate USR phase employed for PBHs formation. Among the total eleven one-particle irreducible Feynman diagrams, we calculate the corrections from the "double scoop" two-loop diagram involving two vertices of quartic Hamiltonians. We demonstrate that the fractional two-loop correction in power spectrum scales like the square of the fractional one-loop correction. We confirm our previous findings that the loop corrections become arbitrarily large in the setup where the transition from the intermediate USR to the final slow-roll phase is very sharp. This suggests that in order for the analysis to be under perturbative control against loop corrections, one requires a mild transition with a long enough relaxation period towards the final attractor phase.</description>

      <title>Do Observations Prefer Thawing Quintessence?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13637v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In light of recent observations by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), we study evidence for thawing quintessence over a cosmological constant as dark energy, with emphasis on the effect of the choice of priors. Working with a parametrization for the equation of state parameter motivated by the theory, we analyse the DESI BAO data jointly with Planck 2018 and Pantheon+ supernovae data, and find a preference for thawing quintessence compared to a bare cosmological constant only if we use priors which are heavily informed by the data itself. If we extend the priors to physically better motivated ranges, the evidence for thawing quintessence disappears.</description>

      <title>Critical behavior of the Schwinger model via gauge-invariant VUMPS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03569v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the lattice Schwinger model by combining the variational uniform matrix product state (VUMPS) algorithm with a gauge-invariant matrix product ansatz that locally enforces the Gauss law constraint. Both the continuum and lattice versions of the Schwinger model with $\theta=\pi$ are known to exhibit first-order phase transitions for the values of the fermion mass above a critical value, where a second-order phase transition occurs. Our algorithm enables a precise determination of the critical endpoint in the continuum theory. We further analyze the scaling in the simultaneous critical and continuum limits and confirm that the data collapse aligns with the Ising universality class to remarkable precision.</description>

      <title>Bayesian evidence for two peaks in the sound speed in cold dense QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08760v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I show that in addition to the well-known peak inside massive neutron stars, the sound speed in cold dense QCD matter likely exhibits another peak above neutron star densities before it asymptotes to $c_s=\sqrt{C_s}=\sqrt{1/3}$. Based on the framework reported in arxiv:2408.16738, this approach does not rely on any assumption about the ultra-dense matter not realized in nature. Current multimessenger observation of neutron stars favors the two-peak scenario with a Bayes factor $5.1_{-0.7}^{+0.9}$, where the uncertainties are systematics due to models of neutron star inner cores. This evidence grows to $27_{-8}^{+11}$ if the $2.6M_\odot$ component of GW190814 is a neutron star. The trough in $C_s$ separating the two peaks is inferred to be below $0.05^{+0.04}_{-0.02}$ (at the $50\%$ level) if $2.6M_\odot$ neutron stars exist. The second peak above $1/3$ beyond baryon chemical potential $\mu_B=1.6-1.9$ GeV most likely signals non-perturbative effects in cold quark matter, for instance color superconductivity.</description>
