      <title>FinBloom: Knowledge Grounding Large Language Model with Real-time Financial Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18471v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at generating human-like responses but often struggle with interactive tasks that require access to real-time information. This limitation poses challenges in finance, where models must access up-to-date information, such as recent news or price movements, to support decision-making. To address this, we introduce Financial Agent, a knowledge-grounding approach for LLMs to handle financial queries using real-time text and tabular data. Our contributions are threefold: First, we develop a Financial Context Dataset of over 50,000 financial queries paired with the required context. Second, we train FinBloom 7B, a custom 7 billion parameter LLM, on 14 million financial news articles from Reuters and Deutsche Presse-Agentur, alongside 12 million Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings. Third, we fine-tune FinBloom 7B using the Financial Context Dataset to serve as a Financial Agent. This agent generates relevant financial context, enabling efficient real-time data retrieval to answer user queries. By reducing latency and eliminating the need for users to manually provide accurate data, our approach significantly enhances the capability of LLMs to handle dynamic financial tasks. Our proposed approach makes real-time financial decisions, algorithmic trading and other related tasks streamlined, and is valuable in contexts with high-velocity data flows.</description>

      <title>Corporate Fraud Detection in Rich-yet-Noisy Financial Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19305v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Corporate fraud detection aims to automatically recognize companies that conduct wrongful activities such as fraudulent financial statements or illegal insider trading. Previous learning-based methods fail to effectively integrate rich interactions in the company network. To close this gap, we collect 18-year financial records in China to form three graph datasets with fraud labels. We analyze the characteristics of the financial graphs, highlighting two pronounced issues: (1) information overload: the dominance of (noisy) non-company nodes over company nodes hinders the message-passing process in Graph Convolution Networks (GCN); and (2) hidden fraud: there exists a large percentage of possible undetected violations in the collected data. The hidden fraud problem will introduce noisy labels in the training dataset and compromise fraud detection results. To handle such challenges, we propose a novel graph-based method, namely, Knowledge-enhanced GCN with Robust Two-stage Learning (${\rm KeGCN}_{R}$), which leverages Knowledge Graph Embeddings to mitigate the information overload and effectively learns rich representations. The proposed model adopts a two-stage learning method to enhance robustness against hidden frauds. Extensive experimental results not only confirm the importance of interactions but also show the superiority of ${\rm KeGCN}_{R}$ over a number of strong baselines in terms of fraud detection effectiveness and robustness.</description>
