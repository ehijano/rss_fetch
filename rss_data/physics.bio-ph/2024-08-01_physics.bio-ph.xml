      <title>Propagation of Enzyme-driven Active Fluctuations in Crowded Milieu</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00578v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigated the energy transfer from active enzymes to their surroundings in crowded environments by measuring the diffusion of passive microscopic tracers in active solutions of ficoll and glycerol. Despite observing lower rates of substrate turnover and relatively smaller enhancement of passive tracer diffusion in artificial crowded media compared to those in aqueous solutions, we found a significantly higher relative diffusion enhancement in crowded environments in the presence of enzymatic activity. Our experimental observations, coupled with supporting analytical estimations, underscored the critical role of the intervening media in facilitating mechanical energy distribution around active enzymes.</description>

      <title>Predicting the Progression of Cancerous Tumors in Mice: A Machine and Deep Learning Intuition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19277v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study explores Artificial Intelligence (AI) powered modeling to predict the evolution of cancer tumor cells in mice under different forms of treatment. The AI models are analyzed against varying ambient and systemic parameters, e.g. drug dosage, volume of the cancer cell mass, and time taken to destroy the cancer cell mass. The data required for the analysis have been synthetically extracted from plots available in both published and unpublished literature (primarily using a Matlab architecture called "Grabit"), that are then statistically standardized around the same baseline for comparison. Three forms of treatment are considered - saline (multiple concentrations used), magnetic nanoparticles (mNPs) and fluorodeoxyglycose iron oxide magnetic nanoparticles (mNP-FDGs) - analyzed using three Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), Multilinear Regression (MLR), and a Deep Learning (DL) module, the Adaptive Neural Network (ANN). The AI models are trained on 60-80% data, the rest used for validation. Assessed over all three forms of treatment, ANN consistently outperforms other predictive models. Our models predict mNP-FDG as the most potent treatment regime that kills the cancerous tumor completely in ca 13 days from the start of treatment. The models can be generalized to other forms of cancer treatment regimens.</description>

      <title>A hierarchical dynamical low-rank algorithm for the stochastic description of large reaction networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11792v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The stochastic description of chemical reaction networks with the kinetic chemical master equation (CME) is important for studying biological cells, but it suffers from the curse of dimensionality: The amount of data to be stored grows exponentially with the number of chemical species and thus exceeds the capacity of common computational devices for realistic problems. Therefore, time-dependent model order reduction techniques such as the dynamical low-rank approximation are desirable. In this paper we propose a dynamical low-rank algorithm for the kinetic CME using binary tree tensor networks. The dimensionality of the problem is reduced in this approach by hierarchically dividing the reaction network into partitions. Only reactions that cross partitions are subject to an approximation error. We demonstrate by two numerical examples (a 5-dimensional lambda phage model and a 20-dimensional reaction cascade) that the proposed method drastically reduces memory consumption and shows improved computational performance and better accuracy compared to a Monte Carlo method.</description>

      <title>Analyzing the Brain's Dynamic Response to Targeted Stimulation using Generative Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19737v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative models of brain activity have been instrumental in testing hypothesized mechanisms underlying brain dynamics against experimental datasets. Beyond capturing the key mechanisms underlying spontaneous brain dynamics, these models hold an exciting potential for understanding the mechanisms underlying the dynamics evoked by targeted brain-stimulation techniques. This paper delves into this emerging application, using concepts from dynamical systems theory to argue that the stimulus-evoked dynamics in such experiments may be shaped by new types of mechanisms distinct from those that dominate spontaneous dynamics. We review and discuss: (i) the targeted experimental techniques across spatial scales that can both perturb the brain to novel states and resolve its relaxation trajectory back to spontaneous dynamics; and (ii) how we can understand these dynamics in terms of mechanisms using physiological, phenomenological, and data-driven models. A tight integration of targeted stimulation experiments with generative quantitative modeling provides an important opportunity to uncover novel mechanisms of brain dynamics that are difficult to detect in spontaneous settings.</description>

      <title>Microscopic model for aging of biocondensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21710v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Biomolecular condensates are membraneless compartments in the cell that are involved in a wide diversity of biological processes. These phase-separated droplets usually exhibit a viscoelastic mechanical response. A behavior rationalized by modeling the complex molecules that make up a condensate as stickers and spacers, which assemble into a network-like structure. The proper functioning of biocondensates requires precise control over their composition, size, and mechanical response. For example, several neurodegenerative diseases are associated with dysfunctional condensates that solidify over a long period of time (days) until they become solid. A phenomenon usually described as aging. The emergence of such a long timescale of evolution from microscopic events, as well as the associated microscopic reorganization leading to aging, remains mostly an open question. In this article, we explore the connection between the mechanical properties of the condensates and their microscopic structure. We propose a minimal model for the dynamic of stickers and spacers, and show that entropy minimization of spacers leads to an attractive force between stickers. Our system displays a surprisingly slow relaxation toward equilibrium, reminiscent of glassy systems and consistent with the liquid-to-solid transition observed. To explain this behavior, we study the clustering dynamic of stickers and successfully explain the origin of glassy relaxation.</description>
