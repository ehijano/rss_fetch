      <title>Nonanalytic Fermi-liquid correction to the specific heat of RuO$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The magnetic nature of the altermagnet candidate RuO$_2$ remains under debate. It has been recently shown from quantum oscillations and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) that the high-quality RuO$_2$ bulk single crystal is a paramagnetic metal. However, the low-temperature specific heat exhibits a clear deviation from the conventional $C(T)$=$\gamma T$ + $\beta T^3$ dependence; it is well described with nonanalytic Fermi-liquid correction for a clean paramagnetic metal: $C(T)$ = $\gamma T$ + $\beta T^3$ + $\delta T^3 \textrm{ln}(T/T^*)$. Correspondingly, the magnetic susceptibility is well fitted with the inclusion of $T^2\textrm{ln}T$ term as well as $H^2\mathrm{ln}H$ term. In contrast to the spin fluctuation mechanism applicable to some heavy-electron compounds with positive $\delta$, RuO$_2$ shows negative $\delta$ suggesting a different origin. The observation of such nonanalytic Fermi liquid corrections is attributable to the availability of an ultra-clean sample. The electronic specific heat, the magnetic susceptibility, and the $T^2$ coefficient in resistivity point to a weakly-correlated 3D Fermi-liquid state with a modest electron correlation, as supported by the Wilson and Kadowaki-Woods ratios.</description>

      <title>Dipole Moments using Dirac-Coulomb-Breit Molecular Mean-Field Coupled Cluster Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Materials utilized by novel energy systems are often studied using weakly correlated mean-field theories. However, if these systems incorporate heavy elements or strongly correlated topological materials, relativistic effects must be included. Therefore, we present an unrestricted coupled-cluster with single and double excitation formalism (CCSD) within a molecular mean-field exact-two component framework (X2Cmmf) using a restricted Dirac-Hartree-Fock (DHF) reference state. Our mean-field transformation utilizes the one-electron, Dirac-Coulomb, Dirac-Coulomb-Gaunt and Dirac-Coulomb-Breit Hamiltonian. The code was bench-marked against DIRAC which also uses DHF-X2Cmmf accounting for the Dirac-Coulomb and Dirac-Coulomb-Gaunt Hamiltonian. The dipole moments of Li-H, and Cl-F were calculated using an approximate molecular to atomic basis transformation and compared to experiment. The CCSD energy showed agreement with DIRAC to around ten to the power of minus four Hartree and exhibited a small variation of the dipole moment with the introduction of higher order electron-electron interactions. This paper allows for study of relativistic processes within this mean-field approach and lays the foundation for future theoretical development of relativistic Coupled-Cluster Theory using a DHF reference state within this framework.</description>

      <title>Computer Simulation of the Growth of a Metal-Organic Framework Proto-crystal at Constant Chemical Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) synthesis protocols is currently largely driven by trial-and-error, since we lack fundamental understanding of the molecular level mechanisms that underlie their self-assembly processes. Previous works have studied the nucleation of MOFs, but their growth has never been studied by means of computer simulations, which provide molecular level detail. In this work, we combine constant chemical potential simulations with a particle insertion method to model the growth of the ZIF-8 MOF at varying synthesis temperatures and concentrations of the reactants. Non-classical growth mechanisms triggered by oligomer attachments were detected, with a higher predominance in the most concentrated setups. The newly formed layers preserve the pore-like density profile of the seed crystal but contain defective sites characterized by the presence of 3, 5 and 7 membered rings, typical of amorphous phases. Compared to the amorphous intermediate species obtained at the nucleation part of the self-assembly process previously investigated in our group [Chem. Mater., doi: 10.1021/acs.chemmater.5c02028, 2025], larger-sized rings are more common in the grown layer. Moreover, these are favored by increasing reactant concentration and temperature, as is the degree of deviation with respect to the original crystal structure. We computed growth rates for the steady-state regime, and the non-linear tendency with respect to concentration leads us to hypothesize that in these conditions the growth is controlled by the adsorption rather than by the diffusion processes.</description>

      <title>Digital-Alloy-Based Bragg Mirrors in High-Q Microcavities for Polariton Lasing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an approach to the molecular-beam epitaxy of high-Q planar GaAs-based microcavities in which the AlGaAs high-index layers of the distributed Bragg reflectors (DBRs) are replaced by short-period GaAs/AlAs superlattices (digital alloys) with similar optical properties. This design enables a significant reduction of interface roughness, precise control of the quarter-wavelength optical thickness and the effective Al content, suppression of the propagation of structural defects, and efficient tuning of intrinsic absorption at the polariton emission wavelength via optimization of the superlattice parameters.
  Using this approach, we fabricate a microcavity with a low polariton-lasing threshold of approximately 200 W/cm$^2$ and a high experimental quality factor of about 5.4 x $10^4$. This value exceeds by almost a factor of two the theoretical estimate obtained within an equivalent ternary-alloy model. We demonstrate that accurate modeling of the stop-band characteristics and the Q factor requires incorporating the modified electronic density of states in the superlattice, including quantum-confinement and excitonic effects.</description>

      <title>Novel phases in the Fe-Si-O system at terapascal pressures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Fe-Si-O ternary system, central to modeling the interiors of terrestrial planets, remains poorly constrained at Terapascal (TPa) pressures characteristic of super-Earth mantles. Using a combination of crystal-structure prediction and ab initio calculations, we identify three ternary compounds stable near 1 TPa: P3 FeSiO4, P3 Fe4Si5O18, and P-3 FeSi2O6. The first two phases are thermodynamically stable at low temperatures, whereas P-3 FeSi2O6 becomes favored above approximately 2000 K. All three are metallic, paramagnetic, and adopt pseudo-binary arrangements derived from the FeO2 and SiO2 end-member structures. Their crystal structures emerge through substitutions of Fe for Si in Fe2P-type SiO2 or of Si for Fe in Pnma-type FeO2, the stable elemental oxides at ~1 TPa. This structural continuity suggests that Fe preferentially substitutes for Si in the canonical Mg-silicates expected at TPa pressures. Notably, these new pseudo-binaries accommodate Fe in six- and nine-fold coordination, in contrast to the eight-fold cubic coordination found in FeO at similar pressures. The thermodynamic conditions under which these phases form from FeO2 and SiO2 mixtures are clarified through quasi-harmonic free energy calculations. Their prevalence in super-Earth's mantles is found to depend on the abundance of FeO2, which may be generated by the dehydrogenation of FeOOH goethite as in the Earth's deep mantle. The existence of these phases implies a markedly different pattern of Fe incorporation in high-pressure Mg-silicates at TPa pressures, compared with the behavior inferred at the GPa pressures of the Earth's mantle.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Hall effect in an amorphous antiferromagnet with inverted hysteresis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stemming from antiferromagnetic coupling, exchange bias allows inverted hysteresis in a magnetic system. Such room temperature magnetic reversal has yet to be observed in an amorphous antiferromagnet. Furthermore, the impact of this exchange bias effect on its magnetoelectric transport behavior remains a mystery. Here we discovered a zero-field magnetization switching effect in an exchange-biased amorphous antiferromagnet with inverted magnetic hysteresis. This zero-field magnetic reversal was further evidenced by its inverted large anomalous Hall effect. Notably, this collective spin flipping at zero field can occur at room temperature or above room temperature, which may be associated with quantum interference effect due to thermal fluctuation enhanced disorder. Our experimental results offer a way to design room-temperature exchange-biased amorphous antiferromagnets with zero-field multi magnetic-states and large anomalous Hall effect, holding potential for low-power and high-density memory applications.</description>

      <title>Generative Refinement:A New Paradigm for Determining Single Crystal Structures Directly from HKL Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SC-XRD) is the gold standard technique to characterize crystal structures in solid state. Despite significant advances in automation for structure solution, the refinement stage still depends heavily on expert intervention and subjective judgment, limiting accessibility and scalability. Herein, we introduce RefrActor, an end-to-end deep learning framework that enables crystal structure determination directly from HKL data. By coupling a physics-informed reciprocal-space encoder (ReciEncoder) with a symmetry-aware diffusion-based generator (StruDiffuser), RefrActor produces fully refined atomic models without requiring initial structural guesses or manual input. Comprehensive evaluations on the GenRef-10k benchmark demonstrates that RefrActor achieves low R1-factors across diverse systems, including low-symmetry, light-atom, and heavy-atom crystals. Case studies further confirm that RefrActor can correctly resolve hydrogen positions, elemental assignments, and moderate disorder. This work establishes a new data-driven paradigm for autonomous crystallographic analysis, offering a foundation for fully automated, high-throughput crystal structure determination.</description>

      <title>On the Accuracy of Atomic Resolution Electrostatic Measurements in 2D Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of differential phase contrast (DPC) in scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) has shown much promise for directly investigating the functional properties of a material system, leveraging the natural coupling between the electron probe and atomic-scale electric fields to map the electrostatic configuration within a sample. However, the high sensitivity of these measurements makes them particularly vulnerable to variations in both sample properties and the configuration of the instrument, stressing the need for robust methodologies to ensure more accurate analyses. In this work, the influence of key instrumental parameters - probe convergence angle, defocus and two-fold astigmatism - on atomic-resolution segmented-detector DPC-STEM measurements is evaluated through extensive image simulations. Results show that the limit of interpretability for a 21 mrad defocused probe is found at a magnitude of 4 nm, where electrostatic field magnitude can be underestimated by about 16 % in overfocus and just above 10 % in underfocus. Equivalent results for a 30 mrad probe demonstrate underestimated values around 30 % at overfocus and 20 % for underfocus, at a lower interpretability limit of 3 nm. Two-fold astigmatism introduces orientation dependent variations that surpass 40 % for magnitudes below 3 nm, but a reduction in sensitivity to the aberration is observed when oriented along detector-segment edges. Overall, the analysis confirms the sensitivity and usefulness of the scattergram-based method and underscores the importance of optimized instrumental alignment for accurate CoM based STEM imaging.</description>

      <title>Tetragonal Fe2O: the stable iron oxide at Earth's core conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Fe-O system is fundamental to understanding the composition and properties of the Earth's core. Recent studies have suggested the possible existence of stable, iron-rich FenO compounds at around 215 GPa. Here, we performed crystal-structure searches and fully anharmonic free-energy calculations to investigate the Fe-FeO system under inner-core conditions. We identified Fe2O as a stable phase and constructed its high P-T phase diagram. Fe2O undergoes a hexagonal-to-tetragonal transition with increasing pressure and temperature. It remains thermodynamically stable against decomposition into Fe and FeO from 200 to 400 GPa and at high temperatures. Although oxygen has been considered nearly absent in the inner core due to its limited solubility, these results suggest that oxygen can, in fact, be incorporated into the solid inner core in the form of an Fe+Fe2O mixture, and can match PREM densities for 53 mol% Fe2O. Our work has the potential to lead to a significant revision of the current understanding of the core's structure and composition.</description>

      <title>Origin of shallow n-type doping in AlN and Al-rich AlGaN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving efficient n-type doping in AlN, a representative ultrawide bandgap (UWBG) semiconductor, remains a longstanding challenge that limits its application in high-power electronics and deep-ultraviolet optoelectronics. Conventional dopants in AlN often introduce deep levels or form compensating complexes, leading to low free-carrier concentrations. In this work, we combine first-principles defect calculations with a structural search method tailored to explore metastable configurations to systematically investigate donor-type defects in AlN. Our results reveal that the aluminum interstitial ($Al_i$) can exhibit shallow-donor behavior in specific metastable configurations that were previously overlooked. This discovery expands the understanding of n-type dopability in AlN, and highlights the critical role of metastable defects in modulating electronic properties.</description>

      <title>Unconventional Magneto-Optical Effects in Altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ideal altermagnets are a class of collinear, crystal-symmetry-enforced fully compensated magnets with nonrelativistic spin-split bands, in which contributions from Berry curvature to magneto-optical effects (MOEs) are strictly forbidden by an effective time-reversal symmetry. Here we show that, in such systems, MOEs are exclusively induced by the quantum metric and, in realistic altermagnets, are typically dominated by it. We refer to Berry-curvature-induced MOEs as conventional MOEs and to quantum-metric-dominated MOEs as unconventional MOEs. We derive general formulas that incorporate both Berry curvature and quantum metric for unconventional MOEs in altermagnets, enabling a quantitative evaluation of their respective contributions. Through symmetry analysis, we prove that ideal altermagnets are constrained to exhibit only unconventional MOEs. Using the three-dimensional canonical altermagnet MnTe and the emerging two-dimensional bilayer twisted altermagnet CrSBr as illustrative examples, we demonstrate that unconventional MOEs are prevalent in altermagnets. Our results establish altermagnets as a natural platform for quantum-metric-driven optical phenomena, substantially broadening the scope of MOEs and providing concrete predictions that can be tested in future experimental studies.</description>

      <title>Layered XZnBi (X = Rb, Cs) with Pudding-Mold Bands, Complex Fermi Surfaces and Low Thermal Conductivity: A First-Principles Study of Thermoelectric Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Layered Zintl compounds exhibit significant tunability of thermoelectric (TE) parameters facilitated by their multiple elemental combinations and flexibility in stacking order within the layers. In this work, the effect of stacking order on TE properties of theoretically predicted layered Zintl compounds XZnBi (X = Rb, Cs) is studied using 1st-principles calculations and Boltzmann equations. The materials are semiconductors having moderate band gaps ranging from 0.44 to 0.52 eV. There exist six identical hole pockets for valence band maxima due to the crystal symmetry. This leads to high band degeneracy but simultaneously promotes intervalley scatterings. While as for conduction bands, the Fermi surface consists of a single but highly anisotropic, quasi-two dimensional electron pockets with cylindrical shape along z-axis. This kind of Fermi surface is a characteristic of a pudding mold band shape. It facilitates a unique combination of heavy and light electron masses, simultaneously optimizing Seebeck coefficient and electrical conductivity. At first, electronic transport coefficients are calculated using constant relaxation time approximation (CRTA) or electron-phonon coupling matrix elements (el-ph). The calculated relaxation times are then integrated with transport results to get the realistic values of TE parameters. The analysis of three-phonon scattering reveals low thermal conductivity ($k_{l}$) below 2 W/m/K in these compounds. The $k_{l}$ also depends on stacking order with the values of nearly half in AB stacking as compared to that of AA stacking. These combined factors lead to a high ZT at 900 K, reaching to a maximum of 2.42 using CRTA and 0.52 when el-ph are included. The study highlights the potential of XZnBi systems as promising TE materials as well as the critical roles of stacking and el-ph in accurately evaluating TE properties.</description>

      <title>Static and dynamic properties of the frustrated spin-1/2 depleted-kagome antiferromagnet Cu$_7$(TeO$_3$)$_2$(SO$_4$)$_2$(OH)$_6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The structural and magnetic properties of the two-dimensional spin-$1/2$ depleted-kagome compound Cu$_7$(TeO$_3$)$_2$(SO$_4$)$_2$(OH)$_6$ are investigated using x-ray diffraction, magnetization, heat capacity, and $^1$H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) measurements. From the analysis of magnetic susceptibility, we found a large Curie-Weiss temperature [$\theta_{\rm CW} = -50(2)$ K] and the co-existence of antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic interactions. The value of $\theta_{\rm CW}$ gives an estimate of the average nearest-neighbour antiferromagnetic interaction of $J/k_{\rm B} \simeq 66$ K. The NMR relaxation rates ($1/T_1$ and $1/T_2$) exhibit a peak, providing evidence for a magnetic long-range order at $T^*\simeq 4$ K which appears to be canted antiferromagnetic type. Heat capacity also features a broad maximum at $T^*$ that moves towards higher temperatures with increasing magnetic field, reflecting defect induced Schottky anomaly. The frustration parameter $f_r = \lvert \theta_{\rm CW} \lvert/{T^{*}}\simeq 12.5$ renders the compound a highly frustrated low-dimensional magnet.</description>

      <title>High Pressure and Compositionally Directed Route to a Hexagonal GeSn Alloy Class</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite their electronic dominance, cubic diamond structured Si and Ge, are optoelectronically deficient. Recent work indicates, however, that a volume-expanded hexagonal Ge modification can exhibit intensely sought, superior optoelectronic characteristics. If larger Sn could form a hexagonal solid solution with Ge, this would achieve this expansion. But this was not expected because Ge and Sn are unreactive at ambient conditions, Sn does not have an ambient hexagonal symmetry, and only cubic or tetragonal binary modifications could be prepared under any conditions including thin film processing. This state of affairs is categorically changed here by subjecting Ge and Sn to pressures of 9 and 10 GPa and temperatures up to 1500 K using large-volume press methods. Synchrotron angle-dispersive X-ray diffraction, precession electron diffraction and chemical analysis using electron microscopy reveal ambient pressure recovery of hexagonal 2H, 4H and 6H Ge-Sn solid solutions (P63/mmc). Formation of this new binary materials landscape is correlated with Sn uptake, with the hexagonal symmetry being accessible below 21 atom % Sn and the cubic diamond symmetry at or above this value. The findings form fertile routes to advanced materials, by in tandem creating reactivity with pressure and directing production of needed crystal symmetries with composition, as well as opportunity to tune properties based on crystal symmetry, composition, and stacking sequence for optoelectronic applications.

      <title>Evaluation of Foundational Machine Learned Interatomic Potentials for Migration Barrier Predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast, and accurate prediction of ionic migration barriers ($E_m$) is crucial for designing next-generation battery materials that combine high energy density with facile ion transport. Given the computational costs associated with estimating $E_m$ using conventional density functional theory (DFT) based nudged elastic band (NEB) calculations, we benchmark the accuracy in $E_m$ and geometry predictions of five foundational machine learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs), which can potentially accelerate predictions of ionic transport. Specifically, we assess the accuracy of MACE-MP-0, Orb-v3, SevenNet, CHGNet, and M3GNet models, coupled with the NEB framework, against DFT-NEB-calculated $E_m$ across a diverse set of battery-relevant chemistries and structures. Notably, MACE-MP-0 and Orb-v3 exhibit the lowest mean absolute errors in $E_m$ predictions across the entire dataset and over data points that are not outliers, respectively. Importantly, Orb-v3 and SevenNet classify `good' versus `bad' ionic conductors with an accuracy of $&gt;$82\%, based on a threshold $E_m$ of 500~meV, indicating their utility in high-throughput screening approaches. Notably, intermediate images generated by MACE-MP-0 and SevenNet provide better initial guesses relative to conventional interpolation techniques in $&gt;$71\% of structures, offering a practical route to accelerate subsequent DFT-NEB relaxations. Finally, we observe that accurate $E_m$ predictions by MLIPs are not correlated with accurate (local) geometry predictions. Our work establishes the use-cases, accuracies, and limitations of foundational MLIPs in estimating $E_m$ and should serve as a base for accelerating the discovery of novel ionic conductors for batteries and beyond.</description>

      <title>DHICA ion-modified melanin based porous Si solar cell</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work studies photosensitivity and current-voltage characteristics under illumination of water-soluble eumelanin films based on DHICA tetramers and hybrid eumelanin/porous Si photovoltaic cells aimed at optimizing their characteristics. By using DMSO to dissolve melanin containing protonated carboxyl groups and to remove ammonium cations, it became possible to significantly reduce the ionic component of conductivity, thus improved the electron transport. It was found out that dissolution in DMSO provides a denser {\pi}-{\pi} stacking of DHICA tetramers, which led to a significant improvement in the photovoltaic cell parameters. In particular, the efficiency increased from 0.023 % to 4.4 % and the series resistance decreased from 119 {\Omega} to 42.6 {\Omega}. Modeling demonstrated that high-temperature annealing, which causes decarboxylation, leads to a structural rearrangement of tetramers from a Christmas tree-like configuration to a "toothed helix". At this, one of the planes partially straightens. This emphasizes the critical importance of the morphology of the organic layer for photogeneration of carriers in a heterojunction.</description>

      <title>Tuning spin currents in collinear antiferromagnets and altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin current generation through non-relativistic spin splittings, found in uncompensated magnets and d-wave altermagnets, is desirable for low-power spintronics. Such spin currents, however, are symmetry forbidden in conventional collinear antiferromagnets and higher-order altermagnets. Using spin point group analysis, we demonstrate that finite spin currents can be induced in these materials via magnetoelectric, piezomagnetic, and piezomagnetoelectric-like couplings. We utilize electric fields, strain, and their combinations to drive symmetry-lowering phase transitions into uncompensated magnetic or d-wave altermagnetic states, thereby enabling finite spin conductivity in a broader class of magnetic materials. We further substantiate this framework using density functional theory and Boltzmann transport calculations on representative magnetic materials - KV2Se2O, RuF4 , Cr2O3 , FeS2 , and MnPSe3 - spanning these different cases. The charge-to-spin conversion ratio reaches up to almost 100% via uncompensated magnetism and about 40% via d-wave altermagnetism under realistic conditions, highlighting the effectiveness of this approach for efficient spin current generation.</description>

      <title>Terahertz light driven coherent excitation of a zone-folded Raman-active phonon mode in the Spin-Ladder System $\alpha'$-NaV$_2$O$_5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the out-of-equilibrium lattice dynamics in the spin-ladder system $\alpha'$-NaV$_2$O$_5$ using intense terahertz (THz) pump and near-infrared (NIR) probe spectroscopy. When quasi-single-cycle THz pulses interact with $\alpha'$-NaV$_2$O$_5$ in its low-temperature, dimerized charge-ordered phase, they induce coherent oscillations in the time domain at the zone-folded Raman-active phonon frequency of 1.85 THz. By combining pump-probe measurements with lattice dynamics modeling based on equation-of-motion approach, we propose that these oscillations arise from a nonlinear coupling between Raman-active and infrared (IR)-active phonon modes, with the latter being resonantly excited by the THz pulses. In contrast, excitation with NIR femtosecond laser pulses does not produce measurable vibrational dynamics, highlighting the unique potential of THz-driven, nonlinear light-matter interactions for the coherent and selective control of structural dynamics in quantum materials.</description>

      <title>DEM Simulations of Spheres Flowing Through a Hopper: Validation of Beverloo Law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a detailed investigation of the discharge behavior of spherical granular materials through a conical--cylindrical hopper using \emph{Discrete Element Method (DEM)} simulations. The aim is to assess the applicability limits of the empirical \emph{Beverloo law}. The system was modeled with a monodisperse particles whose mechanical properties correspond to the $Al_{95}Fe_2Cr_2Ti_1$ alloy, and interparticle contacts were described using the Hertz--Mindlin (no slip) model. The simulations systematically explored the influence of particle diameter ($d$) and bed height ($h$) on the resulting mass flow rate ($Q$).
  The results reveal the coexistence of transient and steady-state discharge regimes. Good agreement with the Beverloo scaling was observed for relatively small diameter ratios ($D/d = 10$) and sufficiently large bed heights, where the flow stabilizes rapidly. For larger $D/d$ ratios, the discharge rate decays exponentially, indicating a breakdown of the constant-hydrostatic-pressure assumption underlying the Beverloo model. A dimensionless criterion for the validity of the Beverloo law is proposed as $\Pi_h = h/D &gt; 2$, or equivalently $N = h/d &gt; 20$. The quantitative agreement between DEM simulations and experimental measurements for polydisperse particle size distributions further validates the computational model and demonstrates its predictive capability for granular discharge in confined geometries.</description>

      <title>Revealing Nanoscale Molecular Organization in Liquid Crystals via Cryogenic Atom Probe Tomograph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While liquid crystals (LCs) have been extensively studied, obtaining a comprehensive nanoscale picture of their molecular organization remains challenging, as conventional techniques face an intrinsic trade-off between spatial and chemical resolution. Here, cryogenic atom probe tomography (cryo-APT) is introduced as a new analytical approach for LC materials, using 4'-Pentyl-4-cyanobiphenyl (5CB) and 4'-Octyl-4-cyanobiphenyl (8CB) as representative model compounds. This was enabled by a tailored cryogenic focused ion beam (cryo-FIB) protocol optimized for small organic molecules. The method enables controlled field evaporation of both intact molecules and diagnostic fragments, achieving over 90% molecular retention while preserving four characteristic dissociation patterns. By spatially correlating these fragmentation profiles with the local electric field derived from the tip geometry, we reveal field-directed dissociation pathways of CB molecules. In parallel, the distribution of intact molecular ions enables nanoscale visualization of material structure: we resolve homogeneous mixing of 5CB and 8CB in the nematic phase and directly observe the sub-nanometer crystalline layering in a supercooled 8CB sample, with contrast to the surrounding amorphous matrix suggesting the presence of a solid-liquid interface. This work establishes cryo-APT as a new powerful analytical platform for LC research and reveals its broad potential for application in soft matter systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.03780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Research on diamond has intensified due to its exceptional thermal, optical, and mechanical properties, making it a key material in quantum technologies and high-power applications. Diamonds with engineered nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers represent a very sensitive platform for quantum sensing, while high-optical quality diamond windows represent a fundamental safety component inside Electron Cyclotron Resonance Heating (ECRH) systems in nuclear fusion reactors. A major challenge is the development of ultra-low-loss, high-optical-quality single-crystal diamond substrates to meet growing demands for quantum coherence and power handling. Traditionally, dielectric losses ($\tan \delta$) in diamonds are evaluated using Fabry-Perot microwave resonators, in which the resonance quality factors Q of the cavity with and without the sample are compared. These devices are limited to resolutions around 10$^{-5}$ by the need to keep the resonator dimensions within a reasonable range. In contrast, superconducting thin-film micro-strip resonators, with Q factors exceeding 10$^6$, are stated to provide higher sensitivity for assessing ultra-low-loss materials. This study examines four diamond samples grown through different processes, analyzing their dielectric losses at extreme low temperatures (sub-Kelvin) within the Two-Level System (TLS) framework. Complementary Raman spectroscopy measurements allowed us not only to associate higher nitrogen content with increased losses, but also to investigate how the different growth process influence the way these defects are incorporated in the crystal lattice.</description>

      <title>Interfacial Control of Orbital Occupancy and Spin State in LaCoO$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transition metal oxides exhibit a wide range of tunable electronic properties arising from the complex interplay of charge, spin, and lattice degrees of freedom, governed by their $d$ orbital configurations, making them particularly interesting for oxide electronics and (electro)catalysis. Perovskite oxide heterointerfaces offer a promising route to engineer these orbital states. In this work, we tune the Co $3d$ orbital occupancy in LaCoO$_3$ from a partial $d^7$ to a partial $d^5$ state through interfacial engineering with LaTiO$_3$, LaMnO$_3$, LaAlO$_3$ and LaNiO$_3$. Using X-ray absorption spectroscopy combined with charge transfer multiplet calculations, we identify differences in the Co valence and spin state for the series of oxide heterostructures. LaTiO$_3$ and LaMnO$_3$ interfaces result in interfacial charge transfer towards LaCoO$_3$, resulting in a partial $d^7$ orbital occupancy, while a LaNiO$_3$ interface results in a partial Co $d^5$ occupancy. Strikingly, a LaAlO$_3$ spacer layer between LaNiO$_3$ and LaCoO$_3$ results in a Co $d^6$ low spin state. These results indicate that the Co spin state, like the valence state, is governed by the interfacial environment. High-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy imaging reveals a clear connection between strain and spin configuration, emphasizing the importance of structural control at oxide interfaces. Overall, this work demonstrates that interfacial engineering simultaneously governs orbital occupancy and spin state in correlated oxides, advancing spin-engineering strategies in correlated oxides and offering new insights for the rational design of functional oxide heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Resolving Structural Transitions in Lanthanide High-Entropy Oxides</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.03881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a temperature-composition phase diagram for the chemically disordered and CeO2-LA2O3 high entropy oxides (HEOs), where LA denotes equimolar Y, La, Sm, and Pr, delineating stability regions for bixbyite, disordered fluorite, and intermediate vacancy-ordered fluorite phases. The diagram is constructed from a characterization package applied to bulk ceramics including X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) electron diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, energy-dispersive spectroscopy, X-ray absorption near-edge structure spectroscopy, and ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy, to quantify crystal structure at multiple length-scales, local coordination environments, and electronic structures across the formulation space. This comprehensive measurement suite is critical to identify boundaries between the closely related phases. For example, Raman scattering reveals local structural and defect environments unique to bixbyite local order that persist to ~50% Ce under equilibrium synthesis conditions but are invisible to XRD and TEM. We also report a companion thin film study to demonstrate that quenched kinetic energy from a physical deposition process can metastabilize the high symmetry, and thus high entropy, fluorite phase with only 20% Ce. This is noteworthy because electroneutrality constraints demand an exceptionally vacated oxygen sublattice; we estimate 16.7%, approaching that of delta-Bi2O3. Together, our equilibrium ceramics and far-from-equilibrium thin films show that when synthesis is coupled with rigorously chosen, multi-length-scale characterization, now one can identify the phase stability thermodynamic drivers and simultaneously derive practical guidelines for experimentally realizing targeted phases and structures - and thereby deliberately engineer properties in CeO2-LA2O3 HEOs, whose broad defect chemistries demand such an approach.</description>

      <title>Influence of a generative parameter on the mechanical performance of topological interlocking assemblies of a hexagonal block</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A topological interlocking assembly is an arrangement of blocks, where all blocks are kinematically constrained by their neighboring blocks and a fixed frame. This concept has been known for a long time, attracting recent interest due to its advantageous mechanical properties, such as reusability, redundancy and limited crack propagation. New mathematical methods enable the generation of vast numbers of new topologically interlocking blocks. A natural next question is the quantification of the mechanical performance of these new blocks. We conduct a numerical study of topological interlocking assemblies whose blocks are constructed based on the hexagonal grid. By varying a design parameter used in the generation of these blocks, we study its influence on the structural performance of the entire assembly. The results improve our understanding of the link between the block parameters and the mechanical performance. This enhances the ability to custom design blocks for certain mechanical requirements of the topological interlocking assemblies.</description>

      <title>Non-radiative energy transfer between boron vacancies in hexagonal boron nitride and other 2D materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.03970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Boron vacancies ($V_B^-$) in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) have emerged as a promising platform for two-dimensional quantum sensors capable of operating at atomic-scale proximity. However, the mechanisms responsible for photoluminescence quenching in thin hBN sensing layers when placed in contact with absorptive materials remain largely unexplored. In this Letter, we investigate non-radiative F\"orster resonance energy transfer (FRET) between $V_B^-$ centers and either monolayer graphene or 2D semiconductors. Strikingly, we find that the FRET rate is negligible for hBN sensing layers thicker than 3 nm, highlighting the potential of $V_B^-$ centers for integration into ultra-thin quantum sensors within van der Waals heterostructures. Furthermore, we experimentally extract the intrinsic radiative decay rate of $V_B^-$ defects.</description>

      <title>Construction of irreducible integrity basis for anisotropic hyperelasticity via structural tensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a straightforward analytical-numerical methodology for determining polynomially complete and irreducible scalar-valued invariant sets for anisotropic hyperelasticity. By applying the proposed technique, we obtain irreducible integrity bases for all common anisotropies in hyperelasticity via the structural tensor concept, i.e., invariants are formed from a measure of deformation (symmetric 2nd order tensor) and a set of structural tensors describing the material's symmetry. Our work covers results for the 11 types of anisotropy that arise from the classical 7 crystal systems, as well as findings for 4 additional non-crystal anisotropies derived from the cylindrical, spherical, and icosahedral symmetry systems. Polynomial completeness and irreducibility of the proposed integrity bases are proven using the Molien series and, in addition, with established results for scalar-valued invariant sets from the literature. Furthermore, we derive relationships between a set of multiple structural tensors that specify a symmetry group and a description using only a single structural tensor. Both can be used to construct irreducible integrity bases by applying the proposed analytical-numerical method. The provided invariant sets are of great importance for modeling anisotropic materials via the structural tensor concept using both classical models as well as modern approaches based on machine learning. Alongside the results presented, this article also aims to provide an introductory overview of the complex field of modeling anisotropic materials.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic Phonon Dynamics and Directional Transport in Actinide van der Waals Semiconductor USe$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Direction-dependent charge transport and optical responses are characteristic of van der Waals (vdW) materials with strong in-plane anisotropy. While transition-metal trichalcogenides (TMTCs) exemplify this behavior, heavier analogs remain largely unexplored. In this study we examine USe$_3$ as an anisotropic vdW material and a heavier analog of the well-studied TMTCs. We reveal strong in-plane anisotropy using polarization-resolved Raman spectroscopy, investigate strain-induced shifts of phonon modes, and quantify direction-dependent charge-carrier mobility through transport measurements on field-effect devices. First-principles calculations based on density-functional theory corroborate our findings, providing a theoretical basis for our experimental observations. Casting USe$_3$ as an actinide analog of a TMTC establishes a platform for exploring low-dimensional semiconductors that combine strong in-plane anisotropy with f-electron physics.</description>

      <title>The Loss Landscape of Powder X-Ray Diffraction-Based Structure Optimization Is Too Rough for Gradient Descent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solving crystal structures from powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) is a central challenge in materials characterization. In this work, we study the powder XRD-to-structure mapping using gradient descent optimization, with the goal of recovering the correct structure from moderately distorted initial states based solely on XRD similarity. We show that commonly used XRD similarity metrics result in a highly non-convex landscape, complicating direct optimization. Constraining the optimization to the ground-truth crystal family significantly improves recovery, yielding higher match rates and increased mutual information and correlation scores between structural similarity and XRD similarity. Nevertheless, the landscape may remain non-convex along certain symmetry axes. These findings suggest that symmetry-aware inductive biases could play a meaningful role in helping learning models navigate the inverse mapping from diffraction to structure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent capability to use THz pulses to control the nuclear quantum degrees of freedom in crystals has opened promising avenues for the advanced manipulation of material properties. While numerical approaches exist for studying the time evolution of the quantum nuclear density matrix, an interpretable analytical framework to explicitly analyze the influence of quantum fluctuations on nuclear dynamics remains lacking. In this work, we present an analytical quantum theory of nonlinear phononics. This framework is a basis for deriving models of realistic materials, allowing for exact solutions of the nuclear time evolution with full consideration of quantum fluctuations. This is accomplished by treating for all possible third- and fourth-order phonon couplings and expressing forces as analytic functions of such fluctuations. We provide an analytic proof that, in general, a strong pulse displacing a phonon mode from equilibrium induces the quenching, or squeezing, of its quantum lattice fluctuations. This finding, which establishes a systematization of the mechanism observed in Ref. 1, introduces a new paradigm in nonlinear phononics, harnessing this cooling effect to drive symmetry breaking in quantum paraelectric materials.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Pipeline for Denoising Low Signal-To-Noise Ratio and Out-of-Distribution Transmission Electron Microscopy Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) is crucial for observing material's structural and morphological evolution at Angstrom scales, but the electron beam can alter these processes. Devices such as CMOS-based direct-electron detectors operating in electron-counting mode can be utilized to substantially reduce the electron dosage. However, the resulting images often lead to low signal-to-noise ratio, which requires frame integration that sacrifices temporal resolution. Several machine learning (ML) models have been recently developed to successfully denoise HRTEM images. Yet, these models are often computationally expensive and their inference speeds on GPUs are outpaced by the imaging speed of advanced detectors, precluding in situ analysis. Furthermore, the performance of these denoising models on datasets with imaging conditions that deviate from the training datasets have not been evaluated. To mitigate these gaps, we propose a new self-supervised ML denoising pipeline specifically designed for time-series HRTEM images. This pipeline integrates a blind-spot convolution neural network with pre-processing and post-processing steps including drift correction and low-pass filtering. Results demonstrate that our model outperforms various other ML and non-ML denoising methods in noise reduction and contrast enhancement, leading to improved visual clarity of atomic features. Additionally, the model is drastically faster than U-Net-based ML models and demonstrates excellent out-of-distribution generalization. The model's computational inference speed is in the order of milliseconds per image, rendering it suitable for application in in-situ HRTEM experiments.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Machine Learning for Steel Development: A Computational Framework and CCT Diagram Modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03050v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) has emerged as a powerful tool for accelerating the computational design and production of materials. In materials science, ML has primarily supported large-scale discovery of novel compounds using first-principles data and digital twin applications for optimizing manufacturing processes. However, applying general-purpose ML frameworks to complex industrial materials such as steel remains a challenge. A key obstacle is accurately capturing the intricate relationship between chemical composition, processing parameters, and the resulting microstructure and properties. To address this, we introduce a computational framework that combines physical insights with ML to develop a physics-informed continuous cooling transformation (CCT) model for steels. Our model, trained on a dataset of 4,100 diagrams, is validated against literature and experimental data. It demonstrates high computational efficiency, generating complete CCT diagrams with 100 cooling curves in under 5 seconds. It also shows strong generalizability across alloy steels, achieving phase classification F1 scores above 88% for all phases. For phase transition temperature regression, it attains mean absolute errors (MAE) below 20 {\deg}C across all phases except bainite, which shows a slightly higher MAE of 27 {\deg}C. This framework can be extended with additional generic and customized ML models to establish a universal digital twin platform for heat treatment. Integration with complementary simulation tools and targeted experiments will further support accelerated materials design workflows.</description>

      <title>Analytical approach to the magneto-fluorescence of triplet excitons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.03261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The fluorescence of triplet excitons and color-centers is strongly dependent on magnetic field that mixes the zero field spin eigenstates that determine the radiative recombination rates back into the singlet ground state through spin-orbit coupling. For films of molecules, and polycristaline color-centers samples an average over molecular orientations has to be performed to model the magneto-fluorescence lineshapes. This limits our analytical understanding of the lineshapes and complicates the analysis of the fluorescence dependence on magnetic field. Here, we present a framework that allows to average over triplet molecular orientations analytically. Our approach achieves provides very accurate numerical routines computing precisely the averages matrix elements that appear in magneto-fluorescence and semi-analytical approximations that can be used to model experimental traces.</description>

      <title>Curvature Potential Formulation for Thin Elastic Sheets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thin elastic sheets appear in systems ranging from graphene to biological membranes, where phenomena such as wrinkling, folding, and thermal fluctuations originate from geometric nonlinearities. These effects are treated within weakly nonlinear theories, such as the Foppl-von Karman equations, which require small slopes and fail when deflections become large even if strains remain small. We introduce a methodological progress via a geometric reformulation of thin-sheet elasticity based on a stress potential and a curvature potential. This formulation preserves the structure of the classical equations while extending their validity to nonlinear, multivalued configurations, and geometrically frustrated states. The framework provides a unified description of thin-sheet mechanics in regimes inaccessible to existing theories and opens new possibilities for the study of elastic membranes and two-dimensional materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.03306v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrating semiconducting and magnetic materials could combine transistor-like operation with nonvolatility and enable architectures such as logic-in-memory. Here, we employ correlated electrical transport and scanning nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center magnetic imaging to elucidate a spin transistor concept that amalgamates both vertical and lateral transport in a 2D antiferromagnetic semiconductor, distinct from purely vertical tunneling devices. Our device, based on a monolayer-bilayer junction in CrSBr, displays giant, gate-tunable magnetoresistance driven by the dual action of electrostatic doping on space-charge-limited lateral conduction and interlayer exchange coupling. Moreover, we visualize a field-trainable, layer-sharing effect that selects between coherent or domain-wall reversal at the spin-flip transition, enabling multilevel, memristive conductance states. These findings open opportunities for 2D magnetic semiconductors to address limitations in contemporary computing.</description>

      <title>Short-Range Modulated Electron Lattice and d-Wave Superconductivity in Cuprates: A Phenomenological Ginzburg-Landau Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03368v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a phenomenological Ginzburg-Landau (GL) framework for high-$T_c$ cuprates in which a short-range modulation of the electronic charge density couples to a $d$-wave superconducting condensate. The resulting modulated electron lattice (MEL) state is distinct from long-range static charge density wave order: it is short range, partially phase coherent, and linked to superconducting coherence. A preferred wave vector $q^{\ast} \approx 0.3$ reciprocal lattice units along the Cu-O bond direction emerges from the interplay between a momentum-dependent susceptibility and bond-stretching phonons, consistent with neutron and x-ray data on YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$ and related cuprates. The GL free energy contains coupled $d$-wave superconducting and charge sectors with parameters constrained by optimally doped YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$. We identify an MEL enhancement window in doping, temperature, MEL correlation length, and disorder where a coherence linked modulation enhances the superfluid stiffness. Classical Monte Carlo simulations yield an in-plane stiffness enhancement of order ten percent, which we treat as a qualitative prediction to be tested by self-consistent Bogoliubov de Gennes calculations. The MEL framework yields falsifiable experimental signatures. For scanning tunneling spectroscopy in Bi-based cuprates we highlight two predictions: the Fourier-transformed local density of states should exhibit a $q^{\ast} \approx 0.3$ peak whose spectral weight sharpens as superconducting phase coherence develops below $T_c$, in contrast to static charge scenarios, and the local gap magnitude $\Delta(r)$ should correlate positively with the local MEL amplitude. The framework implies correlations between MEL correlation length, superfluid stiffness, disorder, and vortex pinning, and organizes cuprate observations into testable STM/STS predictions.</description>

      <title>Zero-Waste Biorefinery: Pyrolysis of Fermentation Residues into Catalytic Biochar for Circular Biohydrogen Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents a closed-loop biorefinery strategy that thermochemically upcycles fermentation residues (FRs) from photo-fermentative biohydrogen production (PFHP) into functional biochar catalysts, thereby enhancing the efficiency of the initial PFHP process. Four FRs derived from hydrothermal and ethylene glycol-pretreated corn stover were pyrolyzed at 700{\deg}C. Multi-model kinetic analyses revealed diffusion-controlled mechanisms with activation energies ranging from 157 to 278 kJ/mol, while thermodynamic profiling highlighted the influence of feedstock composition on reaction spontaneity and entropy. Pyrolysis effectively restored porosity compromised during fermentation, yielding biochar with tailored properties: microporous BC3 (185 m2/g) from oxygen-rich precursors and mesoporous BC4 (76.58 m2/g) from graphitized residues. When reintroduced into PFHP, BC3 maximized cumulative hydrogen yield (570 mL) via pH buffering, and BC4 achieved the highest production rate (14.91 mL/h) through electron shuttle mechanisms. The integrated process concurrently generated syngas, bio-oil, and catalytic biochar, enabling waste valorization, renewable energy output, and process enhancement within a circular bioeconomy framework.</description>

      <title>Universally Converging Representations of Matter Across Scientific Foundation Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.03750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning models of vastly different modalities and architectures are being trained to predict the behavior of molecules, materials, and proteins. However, it remains unclear whether they learn similar internal representations of matter. Understanding their latent structure is essential for building scientific foundation models that generalize reliably beyond their training domains. Although representational convergence has been observed in language and vision, its counterpart in the sciences has not been systematically explored. Here, we show that representations learned by nearly sixty scientific models, spanning string-, graph-, 3D atomistic, and protein-based modalities, are highly aligned across a wide range of chemical systems. Models trained on different datasets have highly similar representations of small molecules, and machine learning interatomic potentials converge in representation space as they improve in performance, suggesting that foundation models learn a common underlying representation of physical reality. We then show two distinct regimes of scientific models: on inputs similar to those seen during training, high-performing models align closely and weak models diverge into local sub-optima in representation space; on vastly different structures from those seen during training, nearly all models collapse onto a low-information representation, indicating that today's models remain limited by training data and inductive bias and do not yet encode truly universal structure. Our findings establish representational alignment as a quantitative benchmark for foundation-level generality in scientific models. More broadly, our work can track the emergence of universal representations of matter as models scale, and for selecting and distilling models whose learned representations transfer best across modalities, domains of matter, and scientific tasks.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Coupled Electron-Nuclear Dynamics of Chemical Bond Formation: Hydrogen Scattering from a Semiconductor Surface</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.03753v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A first-principles coupled electron-nuclear dynamics simulation based on real-time, time-dependent density functional theory and Ehrenfest dynamics quantitatively repro-duces bimodal translational energy loss and angular distributions observed in experiment for hydrogen atom scattering from Ge(111)-c(2*8). The theory elucidates a site-selective mechanism of electronically nonadiabatic energy transfer associated with the formation of different Ge-H bonds. When a hydrogen atom approaches a Ge rest-atom, it is strongly accelerated toward the potential minimum forming a transient Ge-H bond and then re-flected by the repulsive wall. This transient bond formation triggers an ultrafast electron transfer event from the rest-atom to an adjacent Ge-adatom, involving several crossings between valence and conduction bands of the substrate. Electronic equilibration is impos-sible within such a short time (Born-Oppenheimer failure) allowing the H-atom kinetic energy to be converted to inter-band electronic excitation of the substrate. H-atom colli-sions at other Ge atoms also form a transient bond but exhibit no electronic excitation, resulting in distinctly less efficient energy loss in scattered H-atoms. The nucle-ar-to-electronic energy transfer observed in this system reflects the electronic dynamics of covalent bond formation at a semiconductor surface, a mechanism that is quite distinct from previously identified nonadiabatic energy transfer mechanisms at metal surfaces mediated by electronic friction or transient negative ions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.03842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The binary metal borides provide a promising platform for searching unique materials with superconductivity and super-hardness under high pressure, owing to the distinctive bonding characters of boron. In this work, combined the first-principles calculations and crystal structure predictions, we predicted 4 exotic stoichiometries and 8 unique U-B compounds under high pressure. The predicted compounds have layered or caged structure units and 4 of them host high hardness under ambient pressure. By removal of the U atoms, we predicted three meta-stable boron clathrates at ambient pressure. Remarkably, the Vickers hardness of the predicted C2/m-B6 is estimated to be 49-53 GPa, and the C2/m-B12 is superconducting with the Tc value of 16.12 K. Our calculations enrich the phase diagram of binary metal borides and boron allotropes, providing insights for the future theoretical and experimental studies on unique materials.</description>

However, the performance of FASnI3 based solar cells is incomparable to lead perovskites for several reasons, including energy band mismatch between the perovskite absorber film and the charge transporting layers (CTLs) for both types of carriers, i.e., for electrons (ETLs) and holes (HTLs). However, the band diagrams in the literature are inconsistent, and the charge extraction dynamics are poorly understood. In this paper, we study the energy band positions of FASnI3 based perovskites using Kelvin probe (KP) and photoelectron yield spectroscopy (PYS) to provide a precise band diagram of the most used device stack. In addition, we analyze the defects within the current energetic landscape of tin perovskites. We uncover the role of bathocuproine (BCP) in enhancing the electron extraction at the fullerene C60/BCP interface. Furthermore, we used transient surface photovoltage (tr-SPV) for the first time for tin perovskites to understand the charge extraction dynamics of the most reported HTLs such as NiOx and PEDOT, and ETLs such as C60, ICBA, and PCBM. Finally, we used Hall effect, KP, and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) to estimate an accurate value of the p-doping concentration in FASnI3 and showed a consistent result of 1.5 * 1017 cm-3. Our findings prove that the energetic system of tin halide perovskites is deformed and should be redesigned independently from lead perovskites to unlock the full potential of tin perovskites.</description>

Abstract: Multi-particle correlations of exciton-polaritons and reservoir-excitons in the strong light-matter coupling regime dictate the quantum dynamics of optical microcavities. In this letter, we examine the many-body exciton-polariton dynamics in a Fabry-P\'erot microcavity of a two-dimensional metal-halide semiconductor over timescales involving polariton ($\ll 1$\,ps) and exciton ($\gg 1$\,ps) scattering. We find enhanced exciton nonlinear dynamics in the microcavity versus the bare semiconductor, concomitant with ultrafast polariton scattering dynamics. We measure, by means of coherent spectroscopy, the coupling between exciton-polaritons, bright excitons, and reservoir-excitons that highlight the complex scattering landscape that fundamentally drives polariton condensation.</description>

      <title>Orbital Current-Driven Magnetization Switching in a Magnetic Tunnel Junction</title>

Abstract: Spin-orbitronics, based on both spin and orbital angular momentum, presents a promising pathway for energy-efficient memory and logic devices. Recent studies have demonstrated the emergence of orbital currents in light transition metals such as Ti, Cr, and Zr, broadening the scope of spin-orbit torque (SOT). In particular, the orbital Hall effect, which arises independently of spin-obit coupling, has shown potential for enhancing torque efficiency in spintronic devices. However, the direct integration of orbital current into magnetic random-access memory (MRAM) remains unexplored. In this work, we design a light metal/heavy metal/ferromagnet multilayer structure and experimentally demonstrate magnetization switching by orbital current. Furthermore, we have realized a robust SOT-MRAM cell by incorporating a reference layer that is pinned by a synthetic antiferromagnetic structure. We observed a tunnel magnetoresistance of 66%, evident in both magnetic field and current-driven switching processes. Our findings underscore the potential for employing orbital current in designing next-generation spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Advances in Phonons: From Band Topology to Phonon Chirality</title>

Abstract: Phonons are ubiquitous quasiparticles in solid state systems describing the quantized vibrations of a crystal lattice. Phonons play a central role in a wide range of physical phenomena, from transport to symmetry-breaking orders, such as charge density waves and superconductivity. {Traditionally treated as spin-0 bosons that obey Bose-Einstein statistics,} phonons have recently emerged as a fertile ground for exploring topological physics, spurred by the rapid development of topological band theory initially formulated for fermionic systems. {It is now understood that the phonon eigenstates, characterized by their eigenvalues and eigenvectors, can carry nontrivial topological invariants, including the Berry phase and Chern number. This new understanding opens up avenues to investigate the interplay between lattice dynamics, topology, and chirality in bosonic systems. In this article, we review recent theoretical and experimental advances in the field of topological phonons and circularly polarized phonons. We introduce foundational concepts, including the classification of phononic band structures, symmetry-protected topological phases, and the definition of topological invariants in bosonic systems. We emphasize the concept of phonon angular momentum and its fundamental connection to Weyl phonons in $\mathcal{PT}$-breaking systems. Key experimental progresses on topological and circularly polarized phonons are discussed. We also outline outstanding challenges and promising directions for future research, such as the role of topology in phonon-mediated quasiparticle interactions and the manipulation of phonon angular momentum for potential applications in quantum technologies.}</description>

      <title>Angular Momentum Fluctuations in the Phonon Vacuum of Symmetric Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21801v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although time-reversal and inversion symmetry constrain the angular momentum of each phonon mode to vanish, we show that the vacuum state of crystals with such symmetries can nevertheless exhibit finite angular momentum fluctuations, {which persists at finite temperature}. These fluctuations arise from quantum coherence between nondegenerate, orthogonally polarized modes and are encoded in the off-diagonal components of the angular momentum operator. Their origin lies in the noncommutativity between the phonon Hamiltonian and angular momentum, which enables time-dependent rotational dynamics even in symmetric vacua. We provide intuitive insight into the coherence underlying this phenomenon by drawing an analogy with the beating between linearly polarized classical waves. Finally, we show that these angular momentum fluctuations produce distinct spectral signatures that can, in principle, be probed via established techniques sensitive to the polarization content and symmetry of lattice excitations, opening an uncharted avenue for accessing and leveraging rotational vacuum correlations in crystalline systems.</description>

      <title>Investigating the effects of local environment on nitrogen vacancies in high entropy metal nitrides</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21362v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High entropy metal nitrides are an important material class in a variety of applications, and the role of nitrogen vacancies is of great importance for understanding their stability and mechanical properties. We study six different high entropy nitrides with eight different metal species to build a predictive model of the nitrogen vacancy formation energy. We construct sets of supercells that maximize the number of unique nitrogen environments for a given chemistry, and then use density-functional theory to calculate the energy density for all nitrogen sites, and the vacancy formation energies for the highest, lowest, and a median subset based on the energy densities. The energy density of nitrogen sites correlates with the vacancy formation energies, for binary, ternary and high entropy nitrides. A linear regression model predicts the vacancy formation energies using only the nearest-neighbor composition; across our eight metals, we find the largest vacancy formation energies next to Hf, then Zr, Ti, V, Cr, Ta, Nb, and the lowest near Mo. Additionally, we see that binary nitride data shows qualitatively similar vacancy formation energy trends for high entropy nitrides; however, the binary data alone is insufficient to predict the complex nitride behavior. Our model is both predictive and easily interpretable, and correlates with experimental data.</description>

      <title>Predictive quantum vibrational spectra through active learning 4G-NNPs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.01543v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Predictive simulation of vibrational spectra of complex condensed-phase and interface systems with thousands of degrees of freedom has long been a challenging task of modern condensed matter theory. In this work, fourth-generation high-dimensional committee neural network potentials (4G-HDCNNPs) are developed using active learning and query-by-committee, and introduced to the essential nuclear quantum effects (NQEs) as well as conformational entropy and anharmonicities from path integral (PI) molecular dynamics simulations. Using representative bulk water and air-water interface test cases, we demonstrate the accuracy of the developed framework in infrared spectral simulations. Specifically, by seamlessly integrating non-local charge transfer effects from 4G-HDCNNPs with the NQEs from PI methods, our introduced methodology yields accurate infrared spectra using predicted charges from the 4G-HDCNNP architecture without explicit training of dipole moments. The framework introduced in this work is simple and general, offering a practical paradigm for predictive spectral simulations of complex condensed phases and interfaces, free from empirical parameterizations and ad hoc fitting.</description>

Abstract: Generative models for materials, especially inorganic crystals, hold potential to transform the theoretical prediction of novel compounds and structures. Advancement in this field depends on robust benchmarks and minimal, information-rich datasets that enable meaningful model evaluation. This paper critically examines common datasets and reported metrics for a crystal structure prediction task$\unicode{x2014}$generating the most likely structures given the chemical composition of a material. We focus on three key issues: First, materials datasets should contain unique crystal structures; for example, we show that the widely-utilized carbon-24 dataset only contains $\approx$40% unique structures. Second, materials datasets should not be split randomly if polymorphs of many different compositions are numerous, which we find to be the case for the perov-5 and MP-20 datasets. Third, benchmarks can mislead if used uncritically, e.g., reporting a match rate metric without considering the structural variety exhibited by identical building blocks. To address these oft-overlooked issues, we introduce several fixes. We provide revised versions of the carbon-24 dataset: one with duplicates removed, one deduplicated and split by number of atoms $N$, one with enantiomorphs, and two containing only identical structures but with different unit cells. We also propose new splits for datasets with polymorphs, ensuring that polymorphs are grouped within each split subset, setting a more sensible standard for benchmarking model performance. Finally, we present METRe and cRMSE, new model evaluation metrics that can correct existing issues with the match rate metric.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Deep Research with Local-Web RAG: Toward Automated System-Level Materials Discovery</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.18303v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a long-horizon, hierarchical deep research (DR) agent designed for complex materials and device discovery problems that exceed the scope of existing Machine Learning (ML) surrogates and closed-source commercial agents. Our framework instantiates a locally deployable DR instance that integrates local retrieval-augmented generation with large language model reasoners, enhanced by a Deep Tree of Research (DToR) mechanism that adaptively expands and prunes research branches to maximize coverage, depth, and coherence. We systematically evaluate across 27 nanomaterials/device topics using a large language model (LLM)-as-judge rubric with five web-enabled state-of-the-art models as jurors. In addition, we conduct dry-lab validations on five representative tasks, where human experts use domain simulations (e.g., density functional theory, DFT) to verify whether DR-agent proposals are actionable. Results show that our DR agent produces reports with quality comparable to--and often exceeding--those of commercial systems (ChatGPT-5-thinking/o3/o4-mini-high Deep Research) at a substantially lower cost, while enabling on-prem integration with local data and tools.</description>
