      <title>The role of wind asphericity in dynamical friction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamical friction (DF) may affect the dynamics of stars moving through dense media. This is the case for stars and compact objects (COs) crossing active galactic nuclei (AGN) discs, stellar clusters, and common envelopes (CE), driving stellar migration. DF may decelerate the moving stellar object and may also, under certain conditions, produce an acceleration. In this paper, we study the DF and its effects in the interaction between a star and the ambient gaseous medium through a set of two-dimensional, hydrodynamical numerical simulations using a wind tunnel configuration. Three different stellar wind configurations are considered: isotropic, polar, and equatorial. We confirm that the DF can decelerate and accelerate the star and find the critical value of the normalized velocity ($u_c$) that marks the transition between these regimes, for the three wind profiles. The value of $u_c$ for the isotropic wind differs slightly from that obtained in the thin shell approximation; for an aspherical wind, it may either be larger or smaller. Aspherical winds with small $u$ values produce larger accelerations than isotropic winds, while at high $u$ values, they lead to greater deceleration than the isotropic case. The timescale for DF to substantially affect the velocity of a stellar object is calculated. It is shown to be relevant in AGN discs and CEs.</description>

      <title>The kangaroo's first hop: the early fast cooling phase of EP250108a/SN 2025kg</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast X-ray transients (FXTs) are a rare and poorly understood population of events. Previously difficult to detect in real time, the launch of the Einstein Probe with its wide field X-ray telescope has led to a rapid expansion in the sample and allowed the exploration of these transients across the electromagnetic spectrum. EP250108a is a recently detected example linked to an optical counterpart, SN 2025kg, or 'the kangaroo'. Together with a companion paper (Rastinejad et al. 2025), we present our observing campaign and analysis of this event. In this letter, we focus on the early evolution of the optical counterpart over the first six days, including our measurement of the redshift of $z=0.17641$. We find that the source is well-modelled by a rapidly expanding cooling blackbody. We show the observed X-ray and radio properties are consistent with a collapsar-powered jet that is low energy ($\lesssim10^{51}$ erg) and/or fails to break out of the dense material surrounding it. The optical emission therefore likely arises from a shocked cocoon resulting from the trapped jet; however, we also examine the possibility that it emerges from the shock produced as the supernova ejecta expand into a dense shell of circumstellar material. We compare to other supernovae and fast transients showing similar features, finding significant similarities with SN 2006aj and SN 2020bvc. This suggests trapped jets could be more common than previously thought and SN 2025kg may herald a larger sample of similar transients.</description>

      <title>EP 250108a/SN 2025kg: Observations of the most nearby Broad-Line Type Ic Supernova following an Einstein Probe Fast X-ray Transient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With a small sample of fast X-ray transients (FXTs) with multi-wavelength counterparts discovered to date, the progenitors of FXTs and their connections to gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and supernovae (SNe) remain ambiguous. Here, we present photometric and spectroscopic observations of SN 2025kg, the supernova counterpart to the FXT EP 250108a. At $z=0.17641$, this is the closest known SN discovered following an Einstein Probe (EP) FXT. We show that SN 2025kg's optical spectra reveal the hallmark features of a broad-lined Type Ic SN. Its light curve evolution and expansion velocities are also comparable to those of GRB-SNe, including SN 1998bw, and several past FXT SNe. We present JWST/NIRSpec spectroscopy taken around SN 2025kg's maximum light, and find weak absorption due to He I $\lambda 1.0830, \lambda 2.0581$ $\mu$m and a broad, unidentified feature at $\sim$ 4-4.5 $\mu$m. Further, we observe clear evidence for broadened H$\alpha$ in optical data at 42.5 days that is not detected at other epochs, indicating interaction with hydrogen-rich material. From its light curve, we derive a $^{56}$Ni mass of 0.2 - 0.6 $M_{\odot}$. Together with our companion paper (Eyles-Ferris et al. 2025), our broadband data of EP 250108a/SN 2025kg are consistent with a trapped or low energy ($\lesssim 10^{51}$ ergs) jet-driven explosion from a collapsar with a zero-age main sequence mass of 15-30 $M_{\odot}$. Finally, we show that the sample of EP FXT SNe support past rate estimates that low-luminosity jets seen through FXTs are more common than successful (GRB) jets, and that similar FXT-like signatures are likely present in at least a few percent of the brightest Ic-BL SNe.</description>

      <title>The infrared counterpart and proper motion of magnetar SGR0501+4516</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Soft gamma repeaters (SGRs) are highly magnetised neutron stars (magnetars) notable for their gamma-ray and X-ray outbursts. In this paper, we use near-infrared (NIR) imaging of SGR 0501+4516 in the days, weeks, and years after its 2008 outburst to characterise the multi-wavelength emission, and to obtain a proper motion from our long temporal baseline observations. Unlike most magnetars, the source has only moderate foreground extinction with minimal crowding. Our observations began only 2 hours after the first activation of SGR 0501+4516 in August 2008, and continued for 4 years, including two epochs of Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging. The proper motion constraint is improved by a third HST epoch 10 years later. The near-infrared and X-rays faded slowly during the first week, thereafter following a steeper power-law decay. The behaviour is satisfactorily fit by a broken power-law. Three epochs of HST imaging with a 10-year baseline allow us to determine a quiescent level, and to measure a proper motion of 5.4+/-0.6 mas/yr. This corresponds to a low transverse peculiar velocity of 51+/-14 km/s (at 2 kpc). The magnitude and direction of the proper motion rules out supernova remnant HB9 as the birth-site. We can find no other supernova remnants or groups of massive stars within the region traversed by SGR 0501+4516 during its characteristic lifetime (20 kyr). Our observations of SGR 0501+4516 suggest that some magnetars may be either significantly older than expected, that their progenitors produce low supernova ejecta masses, or alternatively that they can be formed through accretion-induced collapse (AIC) or low-mass neutron star mergers. Although the progenitor of SGR 0501+4516 remains unclear, we propose that SGR 0501+4516 is the best Galactic candidate for a magnetar formed through a mechanism other than massive star core-collapse.</description>

      <title>Constraints on QCD-based equation of state of quark stars from neutron star maximum mass, radius, and tidal deformability observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: (Abridged) Neutron stars (NSs), the densest known objects composed of matter, provide a unique laboratory to probe whether strange quark matter is the true ground state of matter. We investigate the parameter space of the equation of state of strange stars using a quantum chromodynamics (QCD)-informed model. The parameters - related to the energy density difference between quark matter and the QCD vacuum, the strength of strong interactions, and the gap parameter for color superconductivity - are sampled via quasi-random Latin hypercube sampling to ensure uniform coverage. To constrain them, we incorporate observational data on the maximum mass of NSs (from binary and merger systems), the radii of $1.4$ M$_{\odot}$ NSs (from gravitational wave and electromagnetic observations), and tidal deformabilities (from GW170817). Our results show that quark strong interactions play a key role, requiring at least a $20\%$ deviation from the free-quark limit. We also find that color superconductivity is relevant, with the gap parameter reaching up to $\sim 84$ MeV for a strange quark mass of $100$ MeV. The surface-to-vacuum energy density jump lies in the range $(1.1-1.3)$ $\rho_{\rm{sat}}$, where $\rho_{\rm{sat}} \simeq 2.7 \times 10^{14}$ g cm$^{-3}$. Observational constraints also imply that a $1.4$ M$_{\odot}$ quark star has a radius of $(11.5-12.3)$ km and tidal deformability between $670$ and $970$. These are consistent with the low mass and radius inferred for the compact object XMMU J173203.3-344518. Our results provide useful inputs for future studies on quark and hybrid stars, including their tidal properties, thermal evolution, quasi-normal modes, and ellipticities.</description>

      <title>X-ray spectro-polarimetry analysis of the weakly magnetized neutron star X-ray binary GX 9+1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an X-ray spectro-polarimetric study of the weakly magnetized neutron star low-mass X-ray binary GX 9+1, utilizing data from the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE), alongside simultaneous NuSTAR, NICER, and INTEGRAL observations. GX 9+1, located in the Galactic bulge, is a persistently bright Atoll source known for its spectral variability along the color-color diagram. Our spectral analysis during the soft state confirms emission dominated by a soft blackbody and thermal Comptonization components, with no evidence of a hard X-ray tail. These observations suggest a relatively low-inclination system (23 deg &lt; i &lt; 46 deg) with a weak reflection component, consistent with emission from the accretion disk and neutron star boundary layer. Spectro-polarimetric analysis reveals no significant polarization in the 2-8 keV range, with a 3-sigma upper limit for the polarization degree of 1.9%. However, marginal evidence of polarization was detected in the 2-3 keV band at the 95.5% confidence level (2-sigma), suggesting potential contributions from scattering effects in the individual spectral components (disk, reflection, and Comptonization) that could cancel each other out due to the different orientations of their polarization angles. This behavior aligns with other Atoll sources observed by IXPE, which typically exhibit lower and less variable polarization degrees compared to Z-class sources.</description>

      <title>Crust composition and the Shallow Heat Source in KS 1731-260</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The presence of a shallow heat source of unknown origin in accreting neutron star crusts has been inferred by analyzing their cooling behavior in quiescence. To investigate a diverse bursting history for KS 1731-260 during accretion outbursts, we use realistic crust compositions and nuclear heating and cooling sources from detailed nuclear reaction network calculations to interpret observed cooling curves. We find that the required strength of the shallow heat source is reduced by more than a factor of 3 compared to previous analysis, and obtain constraints on the most likely dominant surface burning modes of KS 1731-260 over its history. Our analysis suggests an impure nuclear pasta layer in the inner crust, though future observations will provide more stringent constraints.</description>

      <title>Long-term evolution of BH-ULX candidates: An `unusual' $L_{\rm disc}$-$T_{\rm col}$ correlation associated with spectral states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the long-term spectral evolution of eight black hole ultra-luminous X-ray sources (BH-ULXs), namely NGC1313 X-1, NGC5408 X-1, NGC6946 X-1, IC342 X-1, NGC55 ULX1, NGC4395 ULX1, NGC5204 X-1 and NGC4190 ULX1 using {\it XMM-Newton} monitoring data spanning over a decade or more. An in-depth spectral modeling with thermal Comptonization ({\it nthComp}) and standard disc ({\it diskbb}) components reveals NGC5204 X-1, IC342 X-1, NGC4190 ULX1 and NGC1313 X-1 exhibiting harder spectral characteristics with dominant effect of Comptonization ($F_{nth}&gt;F_{disc}$, $\Gamma_{nth}\lesssim2$). However, NGC6946 X-1 and NGC55 ULX1 remain in a disc-dominated state ($F_{disc}\sim2F_{nth}$, $\Gamma_{nth}\gtrsim2$), while NGC5408 X-1 shows intermediate spectral characteristics. The spectral analyses indicate an anti-correlation between disc luminosity ($L_{disc}$) and temperature ($T_{col}$) for all sources except NGC5204 X-1. These anti-correlations follow a relation $L_{disc}\propto T_{col}^{\alpha}$ with steeper exponents of $\alpha=-6.01\pm0.25$ (NGC55 ULX1), $-8.93\pm0.11$ (NGC6946 X-1), and $-10.31\pm0.10$ (NGC5408 X-1) for sources with softer or intermediate spectral characteristics. For harder sources, NGC1313 X-1 and IC342 X-1, the combined results provide $\alpha=-3.58\pm0.04$. However, for NGC5204 X-1, a positive correlation is found, yielding $\alpha=1.4\pm0.1$, suggesting that the emission mechanism is associated with the transition from the `standard disc' to the `slim disc' scenario. These findings suggest that the observed $L_{disc}-T_{col}$ correlations, along with the overall spectro-temporal properties of BH-ULXs, seems to be governed by disc-corona-wind driven accretion processes at various inclinations. Finally, we report a QPO-like feature ($\sim20$ mHz) with $rms\%\sim6.6$, Q-factor $\sim6.7$ and significant $2.8\sigma$ in NGC55 ULX1.</description>

      <title>Looking into the Jet Cone of the Neutrino-Associated Very High Energy Blazar PKS 1424+240</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The acceleration process of massive particles as well as the production of very high energy (VHE) photons and neutrinos remains a fundamental challenge in astrophysics. We investigate the parsec-scale properties of the blazar PKS 1424+240, that has been selected on the basis of both gamma-ray and neutrino VHE radiation. We analyze VLBA observations of this BL Lac object, stacking 42 polarization-sensitive images collected in 2009-2025 to enhance the signal and reveal persistent parsec-scale structure. Our observations indicate that this object is viewed inside the jet cone, very close to the axis of its relativistic jet, with a viewing angle of &lt;0.6 deg. This effectively maximizes Doppler boosting to values ~30 and enhances both electromagnetic and neutrino emission in the observer's direction. Based on polarimetric observations, we unambiguously detect a net toroidal component of the jet's magnetic field. Blazars with very small jet viewing angles offer a solution to the longstanding mismatch between Doppler factors inferred from VLBI and those derived from VHE observations -- the so-called `Doppler factor crisis'. We show that relativistic beaming plays the critical role in the gamma-ray and neutrino emission of blazars, with direct implications for models of their multi-messenger emission.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Longitudinal Development of Electromagnetic Air Showers: Analytical Improvements to the Greisen Formalism with Zenith Angle Dependence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new analytical approach to the longitudinal development of electromagnetic air showers, offering improvements to the classical Greisen formalism. We introduce a novel profile for the slope function $\lambda_1(s)$ that achieves an agreement less than $0.75\%$ with the original $\lambda_1$ for shower age parameter $s$ between $0.3 &lt; s &lt; 1.4$, where $s$ represents the stage of shower development. Our new formalism provides an improved representation of shower evolution, particularly near and beyond the shower maximum. In addition, we derive a complete expression for the number of particles $N(t)$. Our implementation includes the zenithal angle dependence on the number of particles at the detector level at high altitudes, making it particularly useful for high-altitude observatories. This expression is suitable for implementing air shower simulation tool fitting procedures over a wide range of energies and geometries. Our analysis suggests that the proposed new formalism may provide better agreement with the expected evolution of particle numbers compared to the traditional Greisen formulation.</description>

      <title>Radiation Signatures of Electron Acceleration in the Decelerating Jet of MAXI J1348-630</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A discrete jet component (blob) ejection and its subsequent deceleration was observed in the 2019/2020 outburst in the low-mass X-ray binary MAXI J1348-630. A first kinematic analysis of the deceleration due to an abrupt transition from an evacuated cavity to the interstellar medium suggested a kinetic energy exceeding 1046 erg, surpassing estimates of the available total ejection energy. However, incorporating a transition layer with exponential density growth between the cavity and interstellar medium recently enabled a kinematic analysis with much more realistic energy requirements of approximately $10^{44}$ erg. Here, we study the expected radiative signatures of electrons accelerated within the decelerating blob by introducing a model akin to the relativistic blast wave model for gamma-ray bursts, considering radiative energy losses and radiation drag, to simulate the deceleration of a relativistically moving plasmoid. This model yields snap-shot spectral energy distributions and multi-wavelength light curves from synchrotron and Synchrotron-Self-Compton (SSC) emission. Notably, the synchrotron emission peaks in the X-rays, and the predicted Radio and X-ray light curves closely resemble the observed ones during the jet decleration phase following the outburst in 2019/2020.</description>

      <title>Energy-resolved polarisation study of the Crab Nebula with IXPE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a new detailed study on the energy-dependent variation in the X-ray polarisation of the Crab Pulsar Wind Nebula (PWN), obtained using data from the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE). For the entire PWN, we observed a linear variation in polarisation degree (PD), and detected the rotation of the polarisation angle (PA) with the energy at higher than 99.9999\% of the confidence level. This energy-dependent polarisation variation is in line with the indication found in Vela PWN by IXPE, and it can be interpreted as the emitting region of the polarised photons shrinks with increasing energy, leading to higher PD because they are less influenced by the turbulence of the magnetic field. We compared the IXPE polarisation results with those of other hard X-ray/gamma observatories (PoGO+, Intregral, AstroSat) for the PWN, finding the same trend from soft-X to hard-X with the PD increasing with the energy and the PA approaching the pulsar's spin axis. In fact, in this wide energy band, the fitting results show an energy trend for the PA compatible with the estimated pulsar's spin axis within 3$\sigma$ of confidence level.</description>

      <title>Observing boson stars in binary systems: The case of Gaia BH1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Gaia experiment recently reported the observation of a binary system composed of a Sun-like star orbiting a dark compact object, known as Gaia BH1. The nature of the compact object remains uncertain. While the Gaia mission identifies it as a black hole candidate, the absence of X-ray or radio detections challenges that interpretation, and alternative exotic compact objects such as boson stars have also been suggested. In this paper, we study whether a boson star could account for the observed properties of the source. To do so we compute the X-ray luminosity of the central dark object as a result of spherically symmetric (Bondi-Michel) accretion of matter, comparing our results for the cases in which the dark object is a Schwarzschild black hole or a non rotating boson star. Our model incorporates realistic interstellar medium properties, ranging from hot ionized gas to dense molecular clouds. By solving the governing equations numerically, we calculate mass accretion rates and derive the resulting Bremsstrahlung X-ray luminosities. Black holes and boson stars fundamentally differ by the absence of an event horizon in the latter, which directly impacts accretion dynamics as there is an accumulation of mass in regions closer to the boson star, which will significantly change the observed X-ray emission. For the Gaia BH1 system we find that accretion onto a black hole yields luminosities of $\sim10^{27} \ \text{erg}\, \text{cm}^{-2}\, \text{s}^{-1}$ which corresponds to an X-ray flux undetectable by Chandra sensitivity. On the other hand, boson star accretion can produce observable luminosities in the order of $10^{27} \ \text{to} \ 10^{41} \ \text{erg}\, \text{cm}^{-2}\, \text{s}^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>Spatially resolved polarization variation of the Crab Nebula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examined the spatially resolved polarization variations in the Crab Nebula over 2 yr, using observational data from the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer, and offer key insights into its magnetic field structures and evolution. The results show significant temporal changes in the polarization degree (PD) across three regions of interest in the 2-8 keV energy band. Regions (a) and (b), located in the northern and the southwestern parts of the study area, exhibit PD variations with significance levels greater than 4 sigma and 3 sigma , respectively. Region (c), located in the southwest,shows a notable decrease in PD with a significance greater than 5 sigma. However, no significant variation in the polarization angle was observed. Meanwhile, notable flux variations were detected, likely influenced by dynamic processes such as magnetized turbulence within the nebula.</description>

      <title>Investigating the emission mechanism in the spatially-resolved jet of two z $\approx$ 3 radio-loud quasars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study focuses on high-redshift, z &gt; 3, quasars where resolved X-ray jets remain underexplored in comparison to nearby sources. Building upon previous work, we identify and confirm extended kpc-scale jets emission in two quasars (J1405+0415, z = 3.215 ; J1610+1811, z = 3.122) through meticulous analysis of Chandra X-ray data. To deepen our understanding, high-resolution radio follow- up observations were conducted to constrain relativistic parameters, providing valuable insights into the enthalpy flux of these high-redshift AGN jets. The investigation specifically aims to test the X-ray emission mechanism in these quasars by exploring the inverse Compton scattering of cosmic microwave background (IC/CMB) photons by synchrotron-emitting electrons. Our novel method uses a prior to make a Bayesian estimate of the unknown angle of the jet to our line of sight, thus breaking the usual degeneracy of the bulk Lorentz factor and the Doppler beaming factor.</description>

      <title>A census of galactic spider binary millisecond pulsars with the Nan\c{c}ay Radio Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spider pulsars are systems in which a millisecond pulsar (MSP) tightly orbits (Pb $\lesssim$ 1 day) a low mass (mc $\lesssim$ 0.5 M$_\odot$) semi-degenerate star. Spider often display eclipses around superior conjunction. This eclipse phenomenon is currently poorly understood. We analyzed eclipses via pulsar timing. The eclipses were fit with a phenomenological model which gives a measurement of the duration and asymmetry of the eclipses. These parameters were then compared to other eclipse and system measurements to discuss the potential link between the presence of eclipses and orbital inclination, eclipsing systems being known to have higher mass functions than non-eclipsing ones. We present here a comprehensive review of the NRT NUPPI backend spider pulsars dataset. We also present the first review and systematic analysis of a large sample of eclipsers, monitored with the NRT over several years. The phenomenological fit allowed us to compare the eclipsers with each other, which led to the categorization of eclipsers depending on the shape of their eclipses. We present the polarimetric properties of the 19 spiders in the sample alongside their profiles, which were previously unpublished in some cases. For the eclipsing systems, we found evidence for a positive correlation between eclipse duration and mass function, as expected if more eclipsing material crosses the line-of-sight in higher inclination systems. For the entire sample, we found marginal evidence for increasing pulse profile width with decreasing mass function. We finally conducted a comprehensive literature review of the published inclination measurements for the pulsars in the sample and compared the inclinations to eclipse parameters. Nevertheless, the small number of available orbital inclination constraints, contradicting each other in some cases, hinders such searches for correlations</description>

      <title>Searching for quasi-periodicities in short transients: the curious case of GRB 230307A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are the most powerful explosions in the Universe; their energy release reache s us from the end of the re-ionization era, making them invaluable cosmological probes. GRB 230307A i s the second-brightest GRB ever observed in the 56 years of observations since the discovery of the phenomenon in 1967. Follow-up observations of the event at longer wavelengths revealed a lanthanide-ri ch kilonova with long-lasting X-ray emission immediately following the prompt gamma-rays. Moreover, t he gamma-ray light curve of GRB 230307A collected with INTEGRAL's SPectrometer of INTEGRAL AntiCoincidence Shield (SPI-ACS) and Fermi's Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor (GBM). We use Fourier analysis, wavelets and Gaussian Processes to search for periodic and quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) in the prompt gamma-ray emission of GRB 230307A. We critically assess all three methods in terms of their robustness for detections of QPOs in fast transients such as GRBs. Our analyses reveal QPOs at a frequency of $\sim 1.2$ Hz (0.82s period) near the burst's peak emission phase, consistent across instruments and detection methods. We also identify a second, less significant QPO at $\sim 2.9$ Hz (0.34s) nearly simultaneously. We hypothesise that the two QPOs originate from the transition epoch at the end of the jet acceleration phase. These QPOs re present plasma circulation periods in vorticity about the jet axis carried outwards to the prompt radiation zone at much larger radii. They are sampled by colliding structures (e.g., shocks) in the spinning jet, possibly marking the evolution of plasma rotation during the final stages of the progenitor neutron star coalescence event.</description>

      <title>Search for Kink Events in Variable Fermi-LAT Blazars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the detection of Quasi-Periodic Oscillations (QPOs) in blazars as a method to identify kink events within their jets, utilizing both $\gamma$-ray and polarized light observations. Focusing on a sample of 9 blazars, we analyze $\gamma$-ray light curves to identify significant QPOs. In addition to $\gamma$-ray data, we incorporated polarized light data corresponding to the same temporal segments to cross-validate the presence of QPOs. However, the limited availability of comprehensive polarized data restricted our ability to perform a thorough analysis across all datasets. Despite these limitations, our analysis reveals a segment where QPOs in polarized light coincided with those observed in $\gamma$-rays, providing preliminary evidence supporting the kink origin of these oscillations.</description>

      <title>On the universality of the split monopole black hole magnetosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Black holes can acquire magnetic flux from their magnetized progenitor or via prolonged accretion. We study the evolution of black hole magnetospheres by means of axisymmetric general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations. We show that all simulated initial magnetic field geometries of varying complexity ultimately evolve into a split monopole magnetosphere. The magnetospheric evolution consists of two phases. In the first phase, the magnetosphere evolves toward pressure equilibrium accompanied by a large magnetic flux decrease on the event horizon on a fast Alfv\'enic timescale of $\sim 60$ light-crossing times of the gravitational radius. The second phase proceeds in a pressure balance in which the magnetic flux decays and current sheets shift in polar angle over the event horizon on slower resistive timescales. We present an analytic model for the second phase. Furthermore, we show that in a split monopole magnetosphere the magnetic flux on the event horizon decays exponentially with a timescale that depends on the black hole spin, where higher spin results in slower decay. Our results can have an implications for the timescales of reconnection-powered flares and for multimessenger counterparts to gravitational wave events.</description>

      <title>Cosmogenic Neutrino Point Source and KM3-230213A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmogenic neutrinos (CNs) are produced by ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) interacting with cosmic background radiation. We investigated the properties of CN point/extended sources, i.e, the neutrino spectrum, and angular profile as functions of time, by assuming that UHECR sources are transient events, such as gamma-ray bursts. The properties depend much on the intergalactic magnetic field (IGMF), but the angular extent is in general sub-degree, within which the CN flux can overshoot the diffuse CN flux in early time. The nearby CN point sources could be detected for the low IGMF case by future neutrino telescopes. The recent KM3-230213A event is possible to account for by a nearby transient CN source, rather than diffuse CN emission. Observations of CN point sources will provide a chance to search for UHECR sources.</description>

      <title>The response of warm absorbers to the variations in the ionizing continuum in the active galaxy NGC4051</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08924v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the response of warm absorbers to variations in the ionizing continuum of the Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC 4051 using time-resolved X-ray observations from the \textit{Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer} (\textit{NICER}). In this work, we have demonstrated we can perform time-resolved spectroscopic studies of warm absorbers of about $\sim 5500$ s time resolution using NICER data. We have extracted 15 spectra for this source, corresponding to 15 different visits to the source, or pointings, each separated by a longer Earth occultation. By modeling the spectral variability of the warm absorber with the \texttt{{\sc {\sc warmabs}}} analytic model, we detect significant variations in the ionization parameter that correlate with changes in the ionizing flux. A time lag of approximately 5500 seconds is observed between the flux variations and the absorber's ionization response, suggesting that the gas is out of photoionization equilibrium during these periods. Using this time lag, we estimate the lower limit of the gas density $8.91 \times 10^6 \, \text{cm}^{-3}$ and constrain the location of the warm absorber to within $7.02 \times 10^{16} \, \text{cm}$ ($\sim 0.02$ parsec) from the central black hole. This study uses time-resolved spectral analysis to contribute to our understanding of the physical conditions of ionized AGN outflows, such as density and location.</description>

      <title>Observational strategies for ultrahigh-energy neutrinos: the importance of deep sensitivity for detection and astronomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08973v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detecting ultrahigh-energy neutrinos can take two complementary approaches with different trade-offs. 1)~Wide and shallow: aim for the largest effective volume, and to be cost-effective, go for wide field-of-view but at the cost of a shallow instantaneous sensitivity -- this is less complex conceptually, and has strong discovery potential for serendipitous events. However, it is unclear if any source can be identified, following detection. And 2)~Deep and narrow: here one uses astrophysical and multi-messenger information to target the most likely sources and populations that could emit neutrinos -- these instruments have deep instantaneous sensitivity albeit a narrow field of view. Such an astrophysically-motivated approach provides higher chances for detection of known/observed source classes, and ensures multi-messenger astronomy. However, it has less potential for serendipitous discoveries. In light of the recent progress in multi-messenger and time-domain astronomy, we assess the power of the deep and narrow instruments, and contrast the strengths and complementarities of the two detection strategies. We update the science goals and associated instrumental performances that envisioned projects can include in their design in order to optimize discovery potential.</description>

      <title>[C II]-deficit caused by self-absorption in an ionized carbon-filled bubble in RCW79</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent spectroscopic observations of the [C\,{\tiny II}] 158$\,\mathrm{\mu m}$ fine-structure line of ionized carbon (C$^+$), using the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA), have revealed expanding [C\,{\tiny II}] shells in Galactic H\,{\tiny II} regions. We report the discovery of a bubble-shaped source (S144 in RCW79), associated with a compact H\,{\tiny II} region, excited by a single O7.5--9.5V/III star, which is consistent with a scenario that the bubble is still mostly ``filled'' with C$^+$. This indicates most likely a very early evolutionary state, in which the stellar wind has not yet blown material away, as it is the case for more evolved H\,{\tiny II} regions. Using the SimLine non-LTE radiative transfer code, the [C\,{\tiny II}] emission can be modeled to originate from three regions. First, a central H\,{\tiny II} region with little C$^+$ in the fully ionized phase, followed by two layers with gas density around $2500\,\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$ of partially photo-dissociated gas. The second layer is a slowly expanding [C\,{\tiny II}] shell with an expansion velocity of $\sim\,$$2.6\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$. The outermost layer exhibits a temperature and velocity gradient that produces the observed self-absorption features in the optically thick [C\,{\tiny II}] line ($\tau \sim 4$) leading to an apparent deficit in [C\,{\tiny II}] emission and a low ratio of [C\,{\tiny II}] to total far-infrared (FIR) emission. We developed a procedure to approximate the missing [C\,{\tiny II}] flux and find a linear correlation between [C\,{\tiny II}] and FIR without a [C\,{\tiny II}]-deficit. This demonstrates that at least some of the [C\,{\tiny II}]-deficit found in Galactic H\,{\tiny II} bubbles can be attributed to self-absorption.</description>

      <title>Black holes with electroweak hair -- the detailed derivation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09304v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a very detailed derivation of solutions describing hairy black holes within the gravity-coupled Weinberg-Salam theory, which were previously reported in \href{https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.133.171402}{Phys.Rev.Lett. 133 (2024) 171402}. These black holes support a strong magnetic field that polarizes the electroweak vacuum and creates a condensate of massive fields carrying superconducting currents along the black hole horizon. The currents, in turn, generate a ``corona'' of magnetic vortex segments attached to the horizon at both ends. The condensate and corona together constitute the black hole hair. The extremal solutions approach, in the far field, the magnetic Reissner-Nordstr\"om configuration, with a total mass that is {\it lower} than the total charge, $M&lt;|Q|$, due to the negative Zeeman energy of the condensate. This makes the removal of the hair energetically unfavorable. The maximally hairy black holes exhibit masses comparable to terrestrial values, with approximately 11\% of their total mass stored in the hair. Given that these solutions arise within a well-tested theoretical framework, they are likely to have physical relevance.</description>

      <title>The Thousand-Pulsar-Array programme on MeerKAT -- XVI. Mapping the Galactic magnetic field with pulsar observations</title>

Abstract: Measuring the magnetic field of the Milky Way reveals the structure and evolution of the galaxy. Pulsar rotation measures (RMs) provide a means to probe this Galactic magnetic field (GMF) in three dimensions. We use the largest single-origin data set of pulsar measurements, from the MeerKAT Thousand-Pulsar-Array, to map out GMF components parallel to pulsar lines of sight. We also present these measurements for easy integration into the consolidated RM catalogue, RMTable. Focusing on the Galactic disk, we investigate competing theories of how the GMF relates to the spiral arms, comparing our observational map with five analytic models of magnetic field structure. We also analyse RMs to extragalactic radio sources, to help build up a three-dimensional picture of the magnetic structure of the galaxy. In particular, our large number of measurements allows us to investigate differing magnetic field behaviour in the upper and lower halves of the Galactic plane. We find that the GMF is best explained as following the spiral arms in a roughly bisymmetric structure, with antisymmetric parity with respect to the Galactic plane. This picture is complicated by variations in parity on different spiral arms, and the parity change location appears to be shifted by a distance of 0.15 kpc perpendicular to the Galactic plane. This indicates a complex relationship between the large-scale distributions of matter and magnetic fields in our galaxy. Future pulsar discoveries will help reveal the origins of this relationship with greater precision, as well as probing the locations of local magnetic field inhomogenities.</description>

      <title>Magneto-Hydrodynamic Simulations of Eccentric Binary Neutron Star Mergers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10228v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Highly eccentric binary neutron star mergers exhibit unique dynamical and observational signatures compared to quasi-circular ones in terms of their gravitational wave signal and the ejection of matter, leading to different electromagnetic counterparts. In this article, we present general relativistic magneto-hydrodynamic simulations of binary neutron star systems on highly eccentric orbits. While in quasi-circular binaries, the influence of the magnetic field is too weak to affect the general pre-merger dynamics, the close encounters in eccentric systems could potentially trigger magneto-hydrodynamic instabilities. Therefore, we investigate possible effects before, during, and after the merger for a total of three different systems with varying initial eccentricity.
  We study the f-mode oscillations excited by tidal interaction in close encounters and find good agreement with predicted f-mode frequency estimates. However, our simulations reveal no significant differences compared to results neglecting the magnetic field. Although we observe a rearrangement of the poloidal structure of the magnetic field inside the stars, there is no relevant increase in the magnetic energy during the encounters. Also, during the merger, the amplification of the magnetic field seems to be largely independent of the eccentricity in our systems. Consistent with studies of merging non-magnetized binary neutron stars, we find a correlation between eccentricity and mass ejection, with a higher impact parameter leading to a larger amount of unbound material.</description>

      <title>Synthetic Spectra from Particle-in-cell Simulations of Relativistic Jets containing an initial Toroidal Magnetic Field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07392v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The properties of relativistic jets, their interaction with the environment, and their emission of radiation can be self-consistently studied by using collisionless particle-in-cell (PIC) numerical simulations. Using three-dimensional (3D), relativistic PIC simulations, we present the first self-consistently calculated synthetic spectra of head-on and off-axis emission from electrons accelerated in cylindrical, relativistic plasma jets containing an initial toroidal magnetic field. The jet particles are initially accelerated during the linear stage of growing plasma instabilities, which are the Weibel instability (WI), kinetic Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (kKHI), and mushroom instability (MI). In the nonlinear stage, these instabilities are dissipated and generate turbulent magnetic fields which accelerate particles further. We calculate the synthetic spectra by tracing a large number of jet electrons in the nonlinear stage, near the jet head where the magnetic fields are turbulent. Our results show the basic properties of jitter-like radiation emitted by relativistic electrons when they travel through a magnetized plasma with the plasma waves driven by kinetic instabilities (WI, kKHI, and MI) growing into the nonlinear regime. At low frequencies, the slope of the spectrum is ~ 0.94, which is similar to that of the jitter radiation, rather than that of the classical synchrotron radiation which is ~ 1/3. Although, we start with a weak magnetized plasma, the plasma magnetization increases locally in regions where the magnetic field becomes stronger due to kinetic instabilities. The results of this study may be relevant for probing photon emission from low energies up to, at least, low energies in the X-ray domain in AGN/blazar and GRB jets, as the peak frequency of synthetic spectra increases as the Lorentz factor of the jet increases from 15 to 100.</description>

      <title>PKS 2131-021 -- Discovery of Strong Coherent Sinusoidal Variations from Radio to Optical Frequencies: Compelling Evidence for a Blazar Supermassive Black Hole Binary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09647v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Haystack and Owens Valley Radio Observatory (OVRO) observations recently revealed strong, intermittent, sinusoidal total flux-density variations that maintained coherence between 1975 and 2021 in the blazar PKS 2131$-$021 ($z=1.283$). This was interpreted as possible evidence of a supermassive black hole binary (SMBHB). Extended observations through 2023 show coherence over 47.9 years, with an observed period $P_\textrm{15 GHz}=(1739.8 \pm 17.4)$ days}. We reject, with $p$-value = $2.09 \times 10^{-7}$, the hypothesis that the variations are due to random fluctuations in the red noise tail of the power spectral density. There is clearly a physical phenomenon in PKS 2131$-$021 producing coherent sinusoidal flux density variations. We find the coherent sinusoidal intensity variations extend from below 2.7 GHz to optical frequencies, from which we derive an observed period $P_\textrm{optical}=(1764 \pm 36)$ days. Across this broad frequency range there is a smoothly-varying monotonic phase shift in the sinusoidal variations with frequency. Hints of periodic variations are also observed at $\gamma$-ray energies. The importance of well-vetted SMBHB candidates to searches for gravitational waves is pointed out. We estimate the fraction of blazars that are SMBHB candidates to be &gt; 1 in 100. Thus monitoring programs covering tens of thousands of blazars could discover hundreds of SMBHB candidates.</description>

      <title>The traveling-PWN modeling attempt on the enigmatic LHAASO dumbbell-like structure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02070v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The first LHAASO catalog presents six enigmatic ultra-high-energy (UHE) gamma-ray sources with lonely &gt; 25 TeV emission being detected, which are indicated as 1LHAASO: J0007+5659u, J0206+4302u, J0212+4254u, J0216+4237u, J1740+0948u, and J1959+1129u. No counterparts of the six sources have been observed, except two energetic pulsars, PSR J0218+4232 and PSR J1740+1000. Among them, 1LHAASO: J0206+4302u, J0212+4254u, and J0216+4237u are connected on the significance map and constituted a dumbbell-like structure. They are close in position and show a similar spectral shape, suggesting a physical association among them. To explain the origin of the six LHAASO sources, especially the intriguing dumbbell-like structure, we conducted the leptonic and hadronic modeling research according to our multiwavelength and multimessenger study. For the dumbbell-like structure, models with traveling-PWNe were considered. The multiwavelength and multimessenger study was based on the Fermi-LAT, Swift-XRT, Planck, CfA 12CO survey, and IceCube neutrino datasets. In the traveling-PWN modeling research, we assumed an isotropic and homogeneous diffusion condition and discussed the influence of diffusion coefficient, distance, and proper motion velocity. No counterparts are discovered in our multiwavelength and multimessenger study, except the two known pulsars. The traveling-PWN modeling attempt with a single PWN appears implausible to explain the dumbbell-like structure, as the diffusion coefficient needs to be much lower than the Bohm limit. A double traveling-PWNe model is also explored and can account for the results of LHAASO-KM2A observation. However, the probability of occurrence of this explanation is significantly lower than that of a conventional triple PWNe explanation.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the coincidence between gravitational waves and fast radio bursts from neutron star - black hole mergers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02534v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are mysterious astrophysical transients whose origin and mechanism remain unclear. Compact object mergers may be a promising channel to produce some FRBs. Neutron star-black hole (NSBH) mergers could produce FRBs through mechanisms involving neutron star tidal disruption or magnetospheric disturbances. This could present an opportunity for multi-messenger gravitational-wave observations, providing new insight into the nature of FRBs and nuclear matter. However, some of the gravitational-wave signals may be marginal detections with signal-to-noise ratios &lt; 8 or have large sky location and distance uncertainties, making it less straightforward to confidently associate an FRB with the gravitational-wave signal. One must therefore take care to avoid a false positive association. We demonstrate how to do this with simulated data. We calculate the posterior odds -- a measurement of our relative belief for a common versus unrelated origin of a coincident NSBH and FRB. We find that a coincident FRB+NSBH from a common source can yield a statistically significant posterior odds in a network with at least two observatories, but only if we require a coincidence in time and and sky location, rather than time alone. However, we find that for our model, we require a network signal-to-noise ratio greater than 10 to be confident in the common-source detection, when using a threshold of ln odds &gt; 8. We suggest that a coincident NSBH+FRB detection could help distinguish between FRB engines by discriminating between disrupting and non-disrupting models.</description>

      <title>Rapid, strongly magnetized accretion in the zero-net-vertical-flux shearing box</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05467v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that there exist two qualitatively distinct turbulent states of the zero-net-vertical-flux shearing box. The first, which has been studied in detail previously, is characterized by a weakly magnetized ($\beta\sim50$) midplane with slow periodic reversals of the mean azimuthal field (dynamo cycles). The second, the 'low-$\beta$ state,' which is the main subject of this paper, is characterized by a strongly magnetized $\beta\sim 1$ midplane dominated by a coherent azimuthal field with much stronger turbulence and much larger accretion stress ($\alpha \sim 1$). The low-$\beta$ state emerges in simulations initialized with sufficiently strong azimuthal magnetic fields. The mean azimuthal field in the low-$\beta$ state is quasi steady (no cycles) and is sustained by a dynamo mechanism that compensates for the continued loss of magnetic flux through the vertical boundaries; we attribute the dynamo to the combination of differential rotation and the Parker instability, although many of its details remain unclear. Vertical force balance in the low-$\beta$ state is dominated by the mean magnetic pressure except at the midplane, where thermal pressure support is always important (this holds true even when simulations are initialized at $\beta \ll 1$, provided the thermal scale height of the disk is well resolved). The efficient angular momentum transport in the low-$\beta$ state may resolve long-standing tension between predictions of magnetorotational turbulence (at high $\beta$) and observations; likewise, the bifurcation in accretion states we identify may be important for understanding the state transitions observed in dwarf novae, X-ray binaries, and changing-look AGN. We discuss directions for future work, including the implications of our results for global accretion disk models and simulations.</description>

      <title>A detailed dive into fitting strategies for GRB afterglows with contamination: A case study with kilonovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07539v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Observations of gamma-ray burst afterglows have begun to readily reveal contamination from a kilonova or a supernova. This contamination presents significant challenges towards traditional methods of inferring the properties of these phenomena from observations. Given current knowledge of kilonova and afterglow modelling, observations (as expected) with near-infrared bands and at early observing times provide the greatest diagnostic power for both observing the presence of a kilonova and inferences on its properties in gamma-ray burst afterglows. However, contemporaneous observations in radio and X-ray are critical for reducing the afterglow parameter space and for more efficient parameter estimation. We compare different methods for fitting joint kilonova and afterglow observations under different scenarios. We find that ignoring the contribution of one source (even in scenarios where the source is sub-dominant) can lead to significantly biased estimated parameters but could still produce great light curve fits that do not raise suspicion. This bias is also present for analyses that fit data where one source is "subtracted". In most scenarios, the bias is smaller than the systematic uncertainty inherent to kilonova models but significant for afterglow parameters, particularly in the absence of high-quality radio and X-ray observations. Instead, we show that the most reliable method for inference in any scenario where contamination can not be confidently dismissed is to jointly fit for both an afterglow and kilonova/supernova, and showcase a Bayesian framework to make this joint analysis computationally feasible.</description>

      <title>HOLESOM: Constraining the Properties of Slowly-Accreting Massive Black Holes with Self-Organizing Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11951v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accreting massive black holes (MBHs, with M$_\bullet &gt; 10^3$ M$_{\odot}$) are known for their panchromatic emission, spanning from radio to gamma rays. While MBHs accreting at significant fractions of their Eddington rate are readily detectable, those accreting at much lower rates in radiatively inefficient modes often go unnoticed, blending in with other astrophysical sources. This challenge is particularly relevant for gas-starved MBHs in external galaxies and those possibly wandering in the Milky Way. We present HOLESOM, a machine learning-powered tool based on the Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs) algorithm, specifically designed to identify slowly-accreting MBHs using sparse photometric data. Trained on a comprehensive set of $\sim$ 20, 000 spectral energy distributions (SEDs), HOLESOM can (i) determine if the photometry of a source is consistent with slowly-accreting MBHs and (ii) estimate its black hole mass and Eddington ratio, including uncertainties. We validate HOLESOM through extensive tests on synthetic data and real-world cases, including Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*), demonstrating its effectiveness in identifying slowly-accreting MBHs. Additionally, we derive analytical relations between radio and X-ray luminosities to further constrain physical parameters. The primary strength of HOLESOM lies in its ability to accurately identify MBH candidates, which can then be targeted for follow-up photometric and spectroscopic observations. Fast and scalable, HOLESOM offers a robust framework for automatically scanning large multi-wavelength datasets, making it a valuable tool for unveiling hidden MBH populations in the local Universe.</description>

      <title>Multi-Peaked Non-Thermal Light Curves from Magnetar-Powered Gamma-Ray Bursts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12272v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Binary neutron star mergers and collapsing massive stars can both create millisecond magnetars. Such magnetars are candidate engines to power gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). The non-thermal light curve of the resulting transients can exhibit multiple components, including: the GRB afterglow, pulsar wind nebula (PWN), and ejecta afterglow. We derive the timescales for the peak of each component and show that the PWN is detectable at radio frequencies, dominating the emission for $\sim$ 6 years for supernova/long GRBs (SN/LGRBs) and $\sim$ 100 days for kilonova/short GRBs (KN/SGRBs) at 1 GHz, and $\sim$ 1 year for SN/LGRBs and $\sim$ 15 days for KN/SGRBs at 100 GHz. The PWN emission has an exponential, frequency-dependent rise to peak that cannot be replicated by an ejecta afterglow. We show that PWNe in SN/LGRBs can be detected out to $z \sim 0.06$ with current instruments and $z \sim 0.3$ with next-generation instruments and PWNe in KN/SGRBs can be detected out to $z \sim 0.3$ with current instruments and $z \sim 1.5$ with next-generation instruments. We find that the optimal strategy for detecting PWNe in these systems is a multi-band, high cadence radio follow-up of nearby KN/SGRBs with an x-ray plateau or extended prompt emission from 10 - 100 days post-burst.</description>

      <title>Dependence of the estimated electric potential in thunderstorms observed at GRAPES-3 on the hadronic interaction generators used in simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18167v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A potential difference of 1.3 Giga-Volts (GV) was inferred across a thundercloud using data from the GRAPES-3 muon telescope (G3MT) [1]. This was the first-ever estimation of gigavolt potential in thunderstorms, confirming prediction of C.T.R. Wilson almost a century ago. To infer the thundercloud potential required acceleration of muons in atmospheric electric field to be incorporated in the Monte Carlo simulation software CORSIKA. The G3MT records over 4 billion muons daily that are grouped into 169 directions covering 2.3 sr sky. This enabled changes as small as 0.1% in the muon flux on minute timescale, caused by thunderstorms to be accurately measured. But that requires high statistics simulation of muon fluxes in thunderstorm electric fields. The CORSIKA offers a choice of several generators for low- (FLUKA, GHEISHA, and UrQMD) and high-energy (SIBYLL, EPOS-LHC, and QGSJETII) hadronic interactions. Since it is unclear which combination of the low- and high-energy generators provides the correct description of hadronic interactions, all nine combinations of generators were explored, and they yielded thundercloud potentials ranging from 1.3 GV to 1.6 GV for the event recorded on 1 December 2014. The result of SIBYLL-FLUKA combination yielded the lowest electric potential of 1.3 GV was reported. Furthermore, another seven major thunderstorm events recorded between April 2011 and December 2020 were analyzed to measure the dependence of their thundercloud potential on the hadronic interaction generators. It is observed that the low-energy generators produce larger variation ($\sim$14%) in thundercloud potential than the high-energy generators ($\sim$8%). This probably reflects the fact that the GeV muons are predominantly produced in low-energy ($&lt;$80 GeV) interactions, which effectively magnifies the differences in the meson production cross-sections among the low-energy generators.</description>

      <title>Propagation Delays of Ultra-High-Energy Cosmic Ray from Active Galactic Nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01022v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the time delay incurred during ultra-high energy cosmic ray (UHECR) propagation over cosmological distances and its potential impact on the correlation between UHECR directions of arrival and sources such as Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs), the UHECR chemical composition, and extragalactic magnetic field constraints. We propagate particles in different magnetic field configurations, spanning over an extended range of particle Larmor radii and magnetic field coherence lengths, also including attenuation losses. We find that UHECR delays could easily be comparable to (and longer than) AGN duty cycles, effectively erasing the correlation between known AGNs and UHECR anisotropies. We finally consider how strong constraints on the chemical composition of the heaviest UHECRs could enable a better characterization of extragalactic magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Comparing observed properties of winds in low-luminosity active galactic nuclei with theoretical predictions</title>

Abstract: Theoretical and numerical simulations of black hole hot accretion flows have shown the ubiquitous existence of winds and predicted their properties such as velocity and mass flux. In this paper, we have summarized from literature the physical properties of winds launched from low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (LLAGN), which are believed to be powered by hot accretion flows, and compared them with theoretical predictions. We infer that for both ultra-fast outflows and hot winds, the observed wind velocity as a function of their launching radius and the ratio between wind mass flux and black hole accretion rate show good consistency with theoretical predictions. For the prototype LLAGN M81* with abundant observational data, we have examined various observed properties of wind in detail, including velocity, mass flux of the wind, the power-law index of the radial profile of inflow rate, and the jet-to-wind power ratio. Good agreements are found with theoretical predictions, providing strong support to the theory of wind launched from hot accretion flows.</description>

      <title>The discovery of a 41s radio pulsar PSR J0311+1402 with ASKAP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07936v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The emerging population of long-period radio transients (LPTs) show both similarities and differences with normal pulsars. A key difference is that their radio emission is too bright to be powered solely by rotational energy. Various models have been proposed (including both white-dwarf or neutron star origins), and their nature remains uncertain. Known LPTs have minutes to hours long spin periods, while normal pulsars have periods ranging from milliseconds to seconds. Here, we report the discovery of PSR J0311+1402, an object with an intermediate spin period of 41 seconds, bridging the gap between LPTs and normal pulsars. PSR J0311+1402 exhibits low linear ($\sim25\%$) and circular polarisation ($\sim5\%$) and a relatively steep spectral index ($\sim-2.3$), features similar to normal pulsars. However, its observed spin-down properties place it below the pulsar death line, where pair production and thus radio emission are expected to cease. The discovery of PSR J0311+1402 suggests the existence of a previously undetected population within this intermediate period range, presumably missed due to selection biases in traditional pulsar search methods. Finding more such objects is important to fill the current gap in neutron star spin periods, improving our understanding of the relationships among rotation-powered pulsars and LPTs.</description>

      <title>A multi-messenger hierarchical triple merger gravitational-wave event pair GW190514-GW190521 inside AGN J124942.3 + 344929</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16864</link>

Abstract: There is a candidate electromagnetic counterpart to the binary black hole merger GW190521, identified as ZTF19abanrhr within AGN J124942.3 + 344929. Additionally, GW190514 is proposed as a plausible precursor merger to GW190521 within a hierarchical merger scenario. In this study, we investigate the potential association between GW190514 and GW190521 as a hierarchical triple merger associated with ZTF19abanrhr, taking into account of sky position, distance, and mass of the sources using a Bayesian criterion. Our analysis reveals that the association is favored over a random coincidence, with a log Bayes factor of 16.8, corresponding to an odds ratio of $\sim$$199:1$, assuming an astrophysical prior odds of $10^{-5}$. Notably, when accounting for the primary masses of the two gravitational wave events as potential products of mergers in the AGN formation channel, the Bayes factor increases significantly, further enhancing the preference for this association by a factor of $\sim$$10^2$, corresponding to a log Bayes factor of 21.5 and an odds ratio of $\sim$$2\times10^4:1$. Our results suggest strong evidence for the first hierarchical triple merger associated with an electromagnetic counterpart in the AGN formation channel. This work is crucial for understanding the formation mechanisms of massive black holes, the role of AGNs in hierarchical mergers, and the implications of multi-messenger astronomy.</description>

      <title>Novel Polarimetric Analysis of Near Horizon Flaring Episodes in M87* in Millimeter Wavelength</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04695v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent multi-wavelength observations of M87* \citep{2024A&amp;A...692A.140A} revealed a high-energy $\gamma$-ray flare without a corresponding millimeter counterpart. We present a theoretical polarimetric study to evaluate the presence and nature of a potential millimeter flare in M87*, using a suite of general relativistic magnetohydrodynamical simulations with varying black hole (BH) spins and magnetic field configurations. We find that the emergence of a millimeter flare is strongly influenced by both spin and magnetic structure, with limited sensitivity to the electron distribution (thermal vs. non-thermal). We model the intensity light curve with a damped random walk (DRW) and compare the characteristic timescale ($\tau$) with recent SMA observations, finding that the simulated $\tau$ exceeds observed values by over an order of magnitude. In a flaring case with BH spin a=+0.5, we identify a distinct millimeter flare followed by an order-of-magnitude flux drop. All Stokes parameters show variability near the flare, including a sign reversal in the electric vector position angle. While most $\beta_m$ modes remain stable, the $EB$-correlation phase is highly sensitive to both the flare peak and decay. We examine polarimetric signatures in photon sub-rings, focusing on modes ns=0 and ns=1. The ns=0 signal closely matches the full image, while ns=1 reveals distinct behaviors, highlighting the potential of space VLBI to isolate sub-ring features. Finally, we analyze the magnetic and velocity field evolution during the flare, finding that magnetic reconnection weakens during the flux decay, and the clockwise velocity flow transitions into an outflow-dominated regime. These results suggest that transient radio variability near flares encodes key information about black hole spin and magnetic field structure, offering a novel probe into the physics of active galactic nuclei.</description>

      <title>X-ray variability of VHE detected FSRQs: A comparative study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05083v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Flat Spectrum Radio Quasars (FSRQs) are weak sources of very high energy (VHE; E&gt;100 GeV) emission, despite exhibiting strong MeV-GeV emissions that dominate their radiative output. To date, only ten FSRQs have been detected at VHEs, primarily during bright optical phases. In this study, we perform a detailed and systematic, temporal, and spectral analysis of the nine VHE-detected FSRQs, using the Swift X-ray Telescope (XRT) data. Our findings show no correlation between VHE activity and the X-ray flux or spectral state of the sources. However, investigation of spectral properties with X-ray brightness shows anti-correlation between flux and spectral index. The X-ray, generally with a different spectral shape lies at the farther end of the optical-UV synchrotron spectrum which typically shows a declining power-law spectrum, and thus, the X-ray spectrum is generally explained by Synchrotron Self-Compton (SSC) process. However, if optical-UV synchrotron emission extends into the X-ray band, it can soften the X-ray spectrum. While most sources in our sample exhibit rising X-ray SEDs, indicative of non-synchrotron origins or minimal synchrotron contributions, many display softer or flat X-ray spectra, mainly during low X-ray flux states (e.g., 4C +21.35, 3C 279, TON 0599, PKS 1441+25, and PKS 0346-27) suggesting potential synchrotron contributions. These synchrotron continuations influence the gamma-ray spectrum, implying extension into the VHE range for inverse Compton (IC) scattering in the Thomson scattering limit. If the extended component corresponds to an underlying low-level emission, these FSRQs could represent potential candidates for persistent VHE activity.</description>

      <title>The population of tidal disruption events discovered with eROSITA</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08424v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a systematic study of X-ray-selected canonical tidal disruption events (TDEs) discovered in the western Galactic hemisphere of the first two eROSITA all-sky surveys (eRASS1 and eRASS2) performed between Dec 2019 and Dec 2020. We compiled a TDE sample from the catalog of eROSITA's extragalactic transients and variables eRO-ExTra, which includes X-ray sources with a variability significance and fractional amplitude over four between eRASS1 and eRASS2, not associated with known AGNs. Each X-ray source is associated with an optical counterpart from the Legacy Survey DR10. Canonical TDEs were selected based on their X-ray light-curve properties (single flare or decline), soft X-ray spectra ($\Gamma&gt;3$), and the absence of archival X-ray variability and AGN signatures in their host photometry and spectroscopy. The sample includes 31 X-ray-selected TDE candidates with redshifts of $0.02&lt; z&lt;0.34$ and luminosities of $5.7 \times 10^{41}&lt;L_X&lt;5.3 \times 10^{44}$ erg/s in the 0.2-6.0 keV rest frame, of which 30 are canonical TDEs and one is an off-nuclear TDE candidate. The derived X-ray luminosity function is best fit by a double power law with a luminosity break at $10^{44}$ erg/s, corresponding to the Eddington-limiting prediction. This corresponds to a TDE volumetric rate of $ (2.3^{+1.2}_{-0.9})\times10^{-7}\,Mpc^{-3} yr^{-1}$ ($\approx1.2\times 10^{-5}$ events per galaxy per year). TDE host galaxies show a green-valley overdensity. In addition, 20%, 30%, and 15% of the sample exhibit flares in the optical, mid-infrared (mid-IR), or radio bands, respectively. We discuss the differences between X-ray, optical, and mid-IR TDE populations and the origins of multiwavelength flares in the context of the obscuring envelope and stream-stream collision models. Finally, we highlight TDE subpopulations that are not included in the canonical sample and should be explored in the future.</description>

      <title>A systematic analysis of the radio properties of 22 X-ray selected tidal disruption event candidates with the Australia Telescope Compact Array</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08426v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a systematic analysis of the radio properties of an X-ray selected sample of tidal disruption event (TDE) candidates discovered by the eROSITA telescope. We find radio sources coincident with half of the transient events (11 TDEs), with 8 radio sources showing statistically significant variability over a 6-month period. We model the radio spectra of 6 sources with sufficiently bright radio emission and find the sources show radio spectra consistent with optically thin synchrotron emission and radio outflow minimum radii of $10^{16}$--$10^{17}$ cm, velocities 0.01--0.05 c, and energies $10^{48}$--$10^{51}$ erg. On comparison with the radio properties of an optically-selected TDE sample at similar late times, we find no significant difference in the radio luminosity range or radio detection rate. We find a tentative positive trend with peak radio and X-ray luminosity, but require further observations to determine if this is real or due to observational bias due to the large range in distances of the events. Interestingly, none of the X-ray selected events show late rising radio emission, compared to 45% of radio-detected sources of an optically-selected sample that showed late rising radio emission. We propose that this may indicate that many TDEs launch radio outflows at or near peak X-ray luminosity, which can be significantly delayed from peak optical luminosity. This study presents the first systematic analysis of the radio properties of an X-ray selected sample of TDEs, and gives insight into the possible link between the physical processes that power X-ray and radio emission in TDEs.</description>

      <title>TESS photometry of the nova eruption in V606 Vul: asymmetric photosphere and multiple ejections?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.04903v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lightcurves of many classical novae deviate from the canonical "fast rise - smooth decline" pattern and display complex variability behavior. We present the first TESS-space-photometry-based investigation of this phenomenon. We use Sector 41 full-frame images to extract a lightcurve of the slow Galactic nova V606 Vul that erupted nine days prior to the start of the TESS observations. The lightcurve covers the first of two major peaks of V606 Vul that was reached 19 days after the start of the eruption. The nova reached its brightest visual magnitude V=9.9 in its second peak 64 days after the eruption onset, following the completion of Sector 41 observations. To increase the confidence level of the extracted lightcurve, we performed the analysis using four different codes implementing the aperture photometry (Lightkurve, VaST) and image subtraction (TESSreduce, tequila_shots) and find good agreement between them. We performed ground-based photometric and spectroscopic monitoring to complement the TESS data. The TESS lightcurve reveals two features: periodic variations (0.12771 d, 0.01 mag average peak-to-peak amplitude) that disappeared when the source was within 1 mag of peak optical brightness and a series of isolated mini-flares (with peak-to-peak amplitudes of up to 0.5 mag) appearing at seemingly random times. We interpret the periodic variations as the result of azimuthal asymmetry of the photosphere engulfing the nova-hosting binary that was distorted by and rotating with the binary. Whereas we use spectra to associate the two major peaks in the nova lightcurve with distinct episodes of mass ejection, the origin of mini-flares remains elusive.</description>

      <title>Exploring the AGN Fraction of a Sample of JWST's Little Red Dots at $5 &lt; z &lt; 8$: Overmassive Black Holes Are Strongly Favored</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10329v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: JWST is revolutionizing our view of the early Universe by pushing the boundaries of detectable galaxies and black holes in redshift (upward) and mass (downward). The Little Red Dots (LRDs), detected by several surveys at $z &gt; 4$, present a significant interpretational challenge, as their Spectral Energy Distributions (SED) can mimic both AGN and stellar population templates. This study analyzes 19 LRDs from the JADES survey, utilizing NIRCam and MIRI photometry. By performing SED fitting across a vast parameter space, we explore a broad range of AGN fractions, defined as the ratio of the monochromatic luminosities (AGN, galaxy, and dust) over a specified wavelength range, 0.4 - 0.7 $\mu m$ rest-frame. We find that 17 of the 19 LRDs investigated are consistent with having significant AGN contributions, with best-fitting AGN fractions ranging between 20% and 70%, while one galaxy shows a low AGN contribution (2%) and another appears to be purely star-forming. Moreover, assuming these LRDs do indeed host AGN, we can place limits on their black hole masses using the inferred AGN bolometric luminosities and adopting the Eddington limit. We find that, independent of the specific AGN fraction adopted, the LRDs' black holes are significantly overmassive relative to their host galaxies (by $\sim 1$ dex, and up to $\sim 4$ dex in the most extreme cases) compared to the local $M_{\bullet} - M_{\star}$ relation. The presence of overmassive black holes in the high-$z$ Universe may provide the strongest evidence yet of heavy black hole seeding occurring during the cosmic dark ages.</description>

      <title>Properties of a kaon-condensed phase in hyperon-mixed matter with three-baryon forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09967v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Coexistent phase of kaon condensates and hyperons [($Y$+$K$) phase] in beta equilibrium with electrons and muons is investigated as a possible form of dense hadronic phase with multi-strangeness. The effective chiral Lagrangian for kaon-baryon and kaon-kaon interactions is utilized within chiral symmetry approach in combination with the interaction model between baryons. For the baryon-baryon interactions, we adopt the minimal relativistic mean-field theory with exchange of scalar mesons and vector mesons between baryons without including the nonlinear self-interacting meson field terms. In addition, the universal three-baryon repulsion and the phenomenological three-nucleon attraction are introduced as density-dependent effective two-body potentials. The repulsive effects leading to stiff equation of state at high densities consist of both the two-baryon repulsion via the vector-meson exchange and the universal three-baryon repulsion. Interplay of kaon condensates with hyperons through chiral dynamics in dense matter is clarified, and resulting onset mechanisms of kaon condensation in hyperon-mixed matter and the equation of state with the ($Y$+$K$) phase and characteristic features of the system are presented. It is shown that the slope $L$ of the symmetry energy controls the two-baryon repulsion beyond the saturation density and resulting stiffness of the equation of state. The stiffness of the equation of state in turn controls admixture of hyperons and the onset and development of kaon condensates as a result of competing effect between kaon condensates and hyperons. The equation of state with the ($Y$+$K$) phase becomes stiff enough to be consistent with recent observations of massive neutron stars. Static properties of neutron stars with the ($Y$+$K$) phase are discussed.</description>

      <title>Parameter estimation of microlensed gravitational waves with Conditional Variational Autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00566v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational lensing of gravitational waves (GWs) provides a unique opportunity to study cosmology and astrophysics at multiple scales. Detecting microlensing signatures, in particular, requires efficient parameter estimation methods due to the high computational cost of traditional Bayesian inference. In this paper we explore the use of deep learning, namely Conditional Variational Autoencoders (CVAE), to estimate parameters of microlensed binary black hole (simulated) waveforms. We find that our CVAE model yields accurate parameter estimation and significant computational savings compared to Bayesian methods such as Bilby (up to five orders of magnitude faster inferences). Moreover, the incorporation of CVAE-generated priors into Bilby, based on the 95% confidence intervals of the CVAE posterior for the lensing parameters, reduces Bilby's average runtime by around 48% without any penalty on accuracy. Our results suggest that a CVAE model is a promising tool for future low-latency searches of lensed signals. Further applications to actual signals and integration with advanced pipelines could help extend the capabilities of GW observatories in detecting microlensing events.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopy of AT 2016blu's recurring supernova impostor outbursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13117v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present spectra of the supernova (SN) impostor AT 2016blu spanning over a decade. This transient exhibits quasiperiodic outbursts with a $\sim$113 d period, likely triggered by periastron encounters in an eccentric binary system where the primary star is a luminous blue variable (LBV). The overall spectrum remains fairly consistent during quiescence and eruptions, with subtle changes in line-profile shapes and other details. Some narrow emission features indicate contamination from a nearby H~{\sc ii} region in the host galaxy, NGC 4559. Broader H$\alpha$ profiles exhibit Lorentzian shapes with full width at half-maximum intensity (FWHM) values that vary significantly, showing no correlation with photometric outbursts or the 113 d phase. At some epochs, H$\alpha$ exhibits asymmetric profiles with a stronger redshifted wing, while broad and sometimes multicomponent P Cygni absorption features occasionally appear, but are again uncorrelated with brightness or phase. These P Cygni absorptions have high velocities compared to the FWHM of the H$\alpha$ emission line, perhaps suggesting that the absorption component is not in the LBV's wind, but is instead associated with a companion. The lack of phase dependence in line-profile changes may point to interaction between a companion and a variable or inhomogeneous primary wind, in an orbit with only mild eccentricity. Recent photometric data indicate that AT 2016blu experienced its \nth{21} outburst around 2023 May/June, as predicted based on its period. This type of quasiperiodic LBV remains poorly understood, but its spectra and erratic light curve resemble some pre-SN outbursts like those of SN 2009ip.</description>

      <title>Correlations between the Neutron Star Mass-Radius Relation and the Equation of State of Dense Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14645v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop an analytic method of inverting the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) relations to high accuracy. In principle, a specified $\mathcal{E}\mbox{-}P$ relation gives a unique $M\mbox{-}R$ relation, and vice-versa. Our method is developed from the strong correlations that are shown to exist between the neutron star mass-radius curve and the equation of state (EOS) or pressure-energy density relation. Selecting points that have masses equal to fixed fractions of the maximum mass, we find a semi-universal power-law relation between the central energy densities, pressures, sound speeds, chemical potentials and number densities of those stars, with the maximum mass and the radii of one or more fractional maximum mass points. Root-mean-square fitting accuracies, for EOSs without large first-order phase transitions, are typically 0.5% for all quantities at all mass points. The method also works well, although less accurately, in reconstructing the EOS of hybrid stars with first-order phase transitions. These results permit, in effect, an analytic method of inverting an arbitrary mass-radius curve to yield its underlying EOS. We discuss applications of this inversion technique to the inference of the dense matter EOS from measurements of neutron star masses and radii as a possible alternative to traditional Bayesian approaches.</description>

      <title>Bayesian analysis of hybrid neutron star EOS constraints within an instantaneous nonlocal chiral quark matter model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00115v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a physics-informed Bayesian analysis of equation of state constraints using observational data for masses, radii and tidal deformability of pulsars and a generic class of hybrid neutron star equation of state with color superconducting quark matter on the basis of a recently developed nonlocal chiral quark model. The nuclear matter phase is described within a relativistic density functional model of the DD2 class and the phase transition is obtained by a Maxwell construction. We find the region in the two-dimensional parameter space spanned by the vector meson coupling and the scalar diquark coupling, where three conditions are fulfilled: (1) the Maxwell construction can be performed, \mbox{(2) the maximum} mass of the hybrid neutron star is not smaller than \mbox{2.0 M$_\odot$} and (3) the onset density of the phase transition is not below the nuclear saturation density $n_0=0.15$ fm$^{-3}$. The result of this study shows that the favorable neutron star equation of state has low onset masses for the occurrence of a color superconducting quark matter core between 0.5-0.7 $M_\odot$ and maximum masses in the range 2.15-2.22 $M_\odot$. In the typical mass range of 1.2-2.0 $M_\odot$, the radii of these stars are between 11.9 and 12.4 km, almost independent of the mass. In principle, hybrid stars would allow for larger maximum masses than provided by the hadronic reference equation of state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09548v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss the constraints on superluminal neutrino Lorentz Invariance Violation (LIV) parameters from the observation of the ultra-high-energy event KM3-230213A by KM3NeT collaboration in cases of linear $n=1$ and quadratic $n=2$ LIV scenarios. Assuming extragalactic origin of the event, we obtain the constraints on LIV mass scale $\Lambda_{n=1} = 1.1 \times 10^{30}\, \mbox{GeV}$ and $\Lambda_{n=2} = 1.1 \times 10^{19}\, \mbox{GeV}$ from the absence of neutrino splitting.</description>

      <title>Sampling the full hierarchical population posterior distribution in gravitational-wave astronomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12156v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a full sampling of the hierarchical population posterior distribution of merging black holes using current gravitational-wave data. We directly tackle the the most relevant intrinsic parameter space made of the binary parameters (masses, spin magnitudes, spin directions, redshift) of all the events entering the GWTC-3 LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA catalog, as well as the hyperparameters of the underlying population of sources. This results in a parameter space of about 500 dimensions, in contrast with current investigations where the targeted dimensionality is drastically reduced by marginalizing over all single-event parameters. In particular, we have direct access to (i) population parameters, (ii) population-informed single-event parameters, and (iii) correlations between these two sets of parameters. We quantify the fractional contribution of each event to the constraints on the population hyperparameters. Our implementation relies on modern probabilistic programming languages and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, with a continuous interpolation of single-event posterior probabilities. Sampling the full hierarchical problem is feasible, as demonstrated here, and advantageous as it removes some (but not all) of the Monte Carlo integrations that enter the likelihood together with the related variances.</description>

      <title>Sleeping Giants Arise: Monitoring the Return of Three Changing-Look Quasars to Their High States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06065v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Changing-look quasars challenge many models of the quasar central engine. Their extreme variability in both the continuum and broad emission-line fluxes on timescales on the order of years is difficult to explain. To investigate the cause of the observed transitions, we present new contemporaneous optical and X-ray observations of three faded changing-look quasars as they return to the high state. Two of these three faded changing-look quasars remained in a quiescent state for more than ten years before returning to a new high state. We find that before, during, and after transition, the spectral energy distributions of all three follow predictions for quasars based on X-ray binary outbursts, suggesting that the mechanism for the change is likely a changing accretion rate causing changes in the accretion flow structure. We also find that, in two of the three cases, the transition between the initial high and low state and the transition between the low and new high state took nearly identical amounts of time, on the order of hundreds of days. This transition timescale is useful for testing theoretical models that attempt to explain the short time scale for the state transition.</description>
