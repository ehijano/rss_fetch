      <title>Protected Income and Inequality Aversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Imagine that a large increment can be given to an individual in a society. We ask: what is the maximal sacrifice that can be imposed on another individual according to an evaluator for the sake of this increment? We show that the answer can reveal how inequality averse an evaluator is. In particular, all Kolm-Pollak evaluators would sacrifice the full income of the sacrificed individual if their income was low enough and a declining fraction of their income otherwise. Kolm-Atkinson evaluators would sacrifice the full income of the sacrificed individual, for all income levels, if their inequality aversion was no greater than one, and sacrifice a constant fraction of their income otherwise. Motivated by these findings, we propose a class of social preferences that, starting from a baseline level of protection, protect a higher fraction of the sacrificed individual's income the lower their income. In addition to relating levels of protected income to coefficients of inequality, we also characterize the classes of additively separable social welfare functions that guarantee specific (absolute or relative) levels of protection.</description>

      <title>Recurrent Stochastic Fluctuations with Financial Speculation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Throughout history, many countries have repeatedly experienced large swings in asset prices, which are usually accompanied by large fluctuations in macroeconomic activity. One of the characteristics of the period before major economic fluctuations is the emergence of new financial products; the situation prior to the 2008 financial crisis is a prominent example of this. During that period, a variety of structured bonds, including securitized products, appeared. Because of the high returns on such financial products, many economic agents were involved in them for speculative purposes, even if they were riskier, producing macro-scale effects.
  With this motivation, we present a simple macroeconomic model with financial speculation. Our model illustrates two points. First, stochastic fluctuations in asset prices and macroeconomic activity are driven by the repeated appearance and disappearance of risky financial assets, rather than expansions and contractions in credit availability. Second, in an economy with sufficient borrowing and lending, the appearance of risky financial assets leads to decreased productive capital, while in an economy with severely limited borrowing and lending, it leads to increased productive capital.</description>

      <title>A Geometric Nash Approach in Tuning the Learning Rate in Q-Learning Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a geometric approach for estimating the $\alpha$ value in Q learning. We establish a systematic framework that optimizes the {\alpha} parameter, thereby enhancing learning efficiency and stability. Our results show that there is a relationship between the learning rate and the angle between a vector T (total time steps in each episode of learning) and R (the reward vector for each episode). The concept of angular bisector between vectors T and R and Nash Equilibrium provide insight into estimating $\alpha$ such that the algorithm minimizes losses arising from exploration-exploitation trade-off.</description>

      <title>Non-Standard Choice in Matching Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.06815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.06815v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the possibility of designing matching mechanisms that can accommodate non-standard choice behavior. We pin down the necessary and sufficient conditions on participants' choice behavior for the existence of stable and incentive compatible mechanisms. Our results imply that well-functioning matching markets can be designed to adequately accommodate a plethora of choice behaviors, including the standard behavior consistent with preference maximization. To illustrate the significance of our results in practice, we show that a simple modification in a commonly used matching mechanism enables it to accommodate non-standard choice behavior.</description>

      <title>Homophily and infections: static and dynamic effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.11934v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the effect of homophily in the diffusion of a harmful state between two groups of agents that differ in immunization rates. Homophily has a very different impact on the steady state infection level (that is increasing in homophily when homophily is small, and decreasing when high), and on the cumulative number of infections generated by a deviation from the steady state (that, instead, is decreasing in homophily when homophily is small, and increasing when high). If immunization rates are endogenous, homophily has the opposite impact on the two groups. However, the sign of the group-level impact is the opposite if immunization is motivated by infection risk or by peer pressure. If motivations are group-specific, homophily can be harmful to both groups.</description>
