      <title>Data-Driven Surrogate Modeling of DSMC Solutions Using Deep Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a deep neural network (DNN) framework that accelerates Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) computations for rarefied-gas flows, while maintaining high physical fidelity. First, a fully connected deep neural network is trained on high-quality DSMC data for seven temperatures (200-650 K) to reproduce the Maxwell-Boltzmann speed distribution of argon. Injecting the physical boundary point into the training set enforces the correct low-speed limit. It reduces the mean-squared error to below 10^-5, thereby decreasing inference time from tens of minutes per DSMC run to milliseconds. For one-dimensional shock waves, a multi-output network equipped with learnable Fourier features learns the complete profiles of density, velocity, and temperature. Trained only on Mach numbers 1.4-1.9, it predicts a Mach 2 and 2.5 case with near-perfect agreement to DSMC, demonstrating robust out-of-training generalization. In a lid-driven cavity, the large parametric spread in Knudsen number is handled by a "family-of-experts" strategy: separate specialist models are trained at discrete Knudsen (Kn) values, and log-space interpolation fuses their outputs. This hybrid surrogate recovers the full 2-D velocity and temperature fields at unseen Kn with less than 2% spatial error. Key innovations include (i) explicit injection of physical constraints during data preprocessing, (ii) learnable Fourier feature mapping to capture steep shock gradients, and (iii) a modular expert-interpolation scheme to cover wide Knudsen ranges. Together, they establish a general recipe for trustworthy, rapid surrogate models that can be extended to non-equilibrium phenomena, gas mixtures, and design optimization workflows</description>

      <title>Extending OpenMC Validation to Spent Fuel Canisters: A Criticality Benchmark Against MCNP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: OpenMC is an open-source Monte Carlo code with increasing relevance in criticality safety and reactor physics applications. While its validation has covered a broad range of systems, its performance in spent nuclear fuel storage scenarios remains limited in the literature. This work benchmarks OpenMC against MCNP for eleven configurations based on the KBS-3 disposal concept, involving variations in geometry, fuel composition (fresh vs spent), and environmental conditions (e.g., air, argon, flooding scenarios). Effective multiplication factors (k-eff) and leakage fractions were evaluated for both codes. Results show strong agreement, with code-to-code k-eff differences below 0.8% in dry storage conditions, and consistent trends across all cases. Notably, OpenMC successfully captures inter-canister neutron interaction effects under periodic boundary conditions, demonstrating its applicability to dry storage configurations. This benchmark supports the extension of the validation domain of OpenMC toward SNF transport and disposal applications.</description>

      <title>On the Structure of Carbon Nanotubes: Results from Computer-Assisted Proofs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a toolbox based on computer-assisted proofs to rigorously study the structure of capped carbon nanotubes. We model nanotubes as minimizers of an interatomic potential. Numerical simulations and validated computations produce rigorous mathematical results about atomic distances and structural variations. In particular, we rigorously measure the diameter, bond lengths, and bond angles of nanotubes and thereby precisely quantify oscillations near the caps, differences between interaction potentials, and effects of nanotube size or chirality. As an example, we observe that the caps induce diameter oscillations along the tube (rather than a monotonous diameter equilibration) with increasing spatial extent for less smooth interaction potentials.</description>

      <title>AirCANS: CFD 2D Mesh Optimisation-based Airfoil Classification and Assessment using Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the possibilities of automating the loading, classification and assessment of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) mesh data by Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The research aim is finding a feasible way to quickly make classification and assessment on airfoil mesh data. For this purpose, this study designed a new framework named CFD-based airfoil Classification and Assessment Network (AirCANS) for CFD mesh data which including the data loader and improved the CNN structure to achieve our target. In our research, we found that CNNs are fully adaptable as well as understandable to CFD airfoil mesh data structures, which suggests that our hypothesis is successful and that neural networks can be used to have a greater positive impact on the CFD industry, such as it can be used to refine the mesh and accelerate the solution. This could allow CFD to spend much less time.</description>

      <title>Generating Moving Field Initial Conditions with Spatially Varying Boost</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel class of algorithms, the ``spatially varying boost'', for generating dynamical field initial conditions with prescribed bulk velocities. Given (non-moving) initial field data, the algorithm generates new initial data with the given velocity profile by performing local Lorentz boosts. This algorithm is generic, with no restriction on the type of the field, the equation of motion, and can endow fields with ultra-relativistic velocities. This algorithm enables new simulations in different branches of physics, including cosmology and condensed matter physics. For demonstration, we used this algorithm to (1) boost two Sine-Gordon solitons to ultra-relativistic speeds for subsequent collision, (2) generate a relativistic transverse Proca field with random velocities, and (3) set up a spin-$1$ Schr\"{o}dinger-Poisson field with velocity and density perturbations consistent with dark matter in matter dominated universe.</description>

      <title>Variational PINNs with tree-based integration and boundary element data in the modeling of multi-phase architected materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The current contribution develops a Variational Physics-Informed Neural Network (VPINN)-based framework for the analysis and design of multiphase architected solids. The elaborated VPINN methodology is based on the Petrov-Galerkin approach, with a deep neural network acting as trial function and local polynomials as test functions. For the analysis, a Galerkin Boundary Element Method (GBEM) scheme is developed to generate the mechanical field data, employing solely domain boundary information. The VPINN methodology is complemented by an adaptive, tree-based integration scheme for the evaluation of the weak-form integrals. Different double-phase material architectures are considered, with the VPINNs demonstrating their ability to capture the deformation fields with considerable accuracy. Moreover, the performance enhancement by the incorporation of additional semi-analytical information at auxiliary internal points is analyzed. Tree-based integration schemes are shown to be capable of robustly capturing inner material discontinuities upon substantial computational cost reductions. The results suggest that the proposed VPINN formulation offers comparative advantages in the modeling of multiphase architected materials compared to classical PINN formulations. The analysis paves the way for the development of variational physics-informed computational models for the mechanical analysis of complex architected multiphase materials and structures.</description>

      <title>Graph Neural Networks to Predict Coercivity of Hard Magnetic Microstructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNN) are a promising tool to predict magnetic properties of large multi-grain structures, which can speed up the search for rare-earth free permanent magnets. In this paper, we use our magnetic simulation data to train a GNN to predict coercivity of hard magnetic microstructures. We evaluate the performance of the trained GNN and quantify its uncertainty. Subsequently, we reuse the GNN architecture for predicting the maximum energy product. Out-of-distribution predictions of coercivity are also performed, following feature engineering based on the observed dependence of coercivity on system size.</description>

      <title>Efficient snap-to-contact computations for van der Waals interacting fibers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider van der Waals interactions between in-plane fibers, where the computational model employs the Lennard-Jones potential and the coarse-grained approach. The involved 6D integral over two interacting fibers is split into a 4D analytical pre-integration over cross sections and the remaining 2D numerical integration along the fibers' axes. Two section-section interaction laws are implemented, refined, and compared. Fibers are modeled using the Bernoulli-Euler beam theory and spatially discretized with isogeometric finite elements. We derive and solve the weak form of both quasi-static and dynamic boundary value problems. Four numerical examples involving highly nonlinear and dynamic snap-to-contact phenomena are scrutinized. We observe that the coarse-graining and pre-integration of interaction potentials enable the efficient modeling of complex phenomena at small length scales.</description>

      <title>Learning robust parameter inference and density reconstruction in flyer plate impact experiments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Estimating physical parameters or material properties from experimental observations is a common objective in many areas of physics and material science. In many experiments, especially in shock physics, radiography is the primary means of observing the system of interest. However, radiography does not provide direct access to key state variables, such as density, which prevents the application of traditional parameter estimation approaches. Here we focus on flyer plate impact experiments on porous materials, and resolving the underlying parameterized equation of state (EoS) and crush porosity model parameters given radiographic observation(s). We use machine learning as a tool to demonstrate with high confidence that using only high impact velocity data does not provide sufficient information to accurately infer both EoS and crush model parameters, even with fully resolved density fields or a dynamic sequence of images. We thus propose an observable data set consisting of low and high impact velocity experiments/simulations that capture different regimes of compaction and shock propagation, and proceed to introduce a generative machine learning approach which produces a posterior distribution of physical parameters directly from radiographs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach in estimating parameters from simulated flyer plate impact experiments, and show that the obtained estimates of EoS and crush model parameters can then be used in hydrodynamic simulations to obtain accurate and physically admissible density reconstructions. Finally, we examine the robustness of the approach to model mismatches, and find that the learned approach can provide useful parameter estimates in the presence of out-of-distribution radiographic noise and previously unseen physics, thereby promoting a potential breakthrough in estimating material properties from experimental radiographic images.</description>

      <title>A hybrid numerical algorithm based on the stochastic particle Shakhov and DSMC method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method is widely employed for simulating rarefied nonequilibrium gas flows. With advances in aerospace engineering and micro/nano-scale technologies, gas flows exhibit the coexistence of rarefied and continuum/near-continuum regimes, which calls for larger time steps and coarser spatial grids for efficient numerical simulation. However, the mesh sizes and time steps in DSMC are constrained by the single-scale nature of the Boltzmann equation and the explicit treatment of collision term following operator splitting. To overcome the resulting computational inefficiency, the Time-Relaxed Monte Carlo (TRMC) method introduces a suitable time discretization of the Boltzmann equation, allowing for significantly larger time steps. Besides, domain decomposition methods leverage the complementary strengths of continuum and particle-based approaches, facilitating the efficient simulation of multi-scale gas flows. However, in TRMC method, the physically accurate high-order terms are truncated and approximated through convergence to a local Maxwellian distribution. Meanwhile, the continuum breakdown criteria employed in hybrid methods are either empirical or semi-empirical. Recently, a timescale-based decomposition of the Boltzmann equation has been proposed to enable a more rational coupling between DSMC and Navier-Stokes. Inspired by this strategy, a novel hybrid particle method is proposed to couple the stochastic particle Shakhov with DSMC, in which the collision operator is decomposed into two sub-steps based on local observation timescale and the relaxation time. The validity and accuracy of the proposed method are demonstrated through a series of benchmark cases, including 1-D sod shock tube, 2-D hypersonic flow around cylinder and jet expansion into the vacuum, 3-D hypersonic flows around sphere and X-38 like vehicle in near-continuum flow regimes.</description>

      <title>Modified non-local damage model: resolving spurious damage evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.24099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of damage and fracture evolution is critical for the safety design and preventive maintenance of engineering structures, however existing computational methods face significant limitations. On one hand, discrete damage and phase-field models are often computationally prohibitive for real world applications and they are less generalizable across different material classes. On the other hand, conventional gradient damage models which are based on phenomenological laws, though more computationally efficient, they suffer from unrealistic widening of the damage-band as damage progresses. This paper presents a modified non-local gradient damage model (MNLD) that overcomes these shortcomings by introducing modifications to the stress degradation function and forcing term in the Helmholtz free energy expression. These two modifications ensure that as damage approaches its maximum value, both the thermodynamic damage driving force for damage vanishes and the evolution of the forcing term decays. Consequently, the damage band retains a non-growing constant width throughout its evolution. The proposed approach builds on insights gained from two intermediate models, which addressed the necessary conditions separately before integrating them into a unified formulation. Numerical validation is performed on several 1D and 2D benchmark problems, demonstrating that the proposed model can reliably produce fixed-width damage bands. The proposed approach can be implemented within existing gradient damage-based finite element frameworks with minimal implementation changes. The results highlight the potential of this approach to resolve the decades-long challenge of spurious widening in gradient damage models, offering an effective and practical solution for engineering applications.</description>

      <title>Scalable Bayesian Optimization for High-Dimensional Coarse-Grained Model Parameterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coarse-grained (CG) force field models are extensively utilised in material simulations due to their scalability. Traditionally, these models are parameterized using hybrid strategies that integrate top-down and bottom-up approaches; however, this combination restricts the capacity to jointly optimize all parameters. While Bayesian Optimization (BO) has been explored as an alternative search strategy for identifying optimal parameters, its application has traditionally been limited to low-dimensional problems. This has contributed to the perception that BO is unsuitable for more realistic CG models, which often involve a large number of parameters. In this study, we challenge this assumption by successfully extending BO to optimize a high-dimensional CG model. Specifically, we show that a 41-parameter CG model of Pebax-1657, a copolymer composed of alternating polyamide and polyether segments, can be effectively parameterized using BO, resulting in a model that accurately reproduces key physical properties of its atomistic counterpart. Our optimization framework simultaneously targets density, radius of gyration, and glass transition temperature. It achieves convergence in fewer than 600 iterations, resulting in a CG model that shows consistent improvements across all three properties.</description>

      <title>Computing excited eigenstates using inexact Lanczos methods and tree tensor network states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22574v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Excited eigenstates are crucial to understand the dynamics of quantum many-body systems. Tensor network states are one of the workhorses to compute ground states of many-body systems, yet the accurate computation of excited eigenstates is still challenging. Here, we develop a combination of the inexact Lanczos method, which aims at efficiently computing excited states, to tree tensor network states (TTNSs). We demonstrate our approach by computing excited vibrational states for three challenging problems: (1) 84 states in different energy intervals of acetonitrile (12-dimensional), (2) Fermi resonance states of the fluxional Zundel ion (15-dimensional), and (3) selected excited states of the fluxional and very correlated Eigen ion (33-dimensional). The proposed TTNS inexact Lanczos method is directly applicable to other quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Accelerated discovery and design of Fe-Co-Zr magnets with tunable magnetic anisotropy through machine learning and parallel computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rare earth (RE)-free permanent magnets, as alternative substitutes for RE-containing magnets for sustainable energy technologies and modern electronics, have attracted considerable interest. We performed a comprehensive search for new hard magnetic materials in the ternary Fe-Co-Zr space by leveraging a scalable, machine learning-assisted materials discovery framework running on GPU-enabled exascale computing resources. This framework integrates crystal graph convolutional neural network (CGCNN) machine learning (ML) method with first-principles calculations to efficiently navigate the vast composition-structure space. The efficiency and accuracy of the ML approach enable us to reveal 9 new thermodynamically stable ternary Fe-Co-Zr compounds and 81 promising low-energy metastable phases with their formation energies within 0.1 eV/atom above the convex hull. The predicted compounds span a wide range of crystal symmetries and magnetic behaviors, providing a rich platform for tuning functional properties. Based on the analysis of site-specific magnetic properties, we show that the Fe6Co17Zr6 compound obtained from our ML discovery can be further optimized by chemical doping. Chemical substitutions lead to a ternary Fe5Co18Zr6 phase with a strong anisotropy of K1 = 1.1 MJ/m3, and a stable quaternary magnetic Fe5Co16Zr6Mn4 compound.</description>

      <title>Protein Drift-Diffusion in Membranes with Non-equilibrium Fluctuations arising from Gradients in Concentration or Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate proteins within heterogeneous cell membranes where non-equilibrium phenomena arises from spatial variations in concentration and temperature. We develop simulation methods building on non-equilibrium statistical mechanics to obtain stochastic hybrid continuum-discrete descriptions which track individual protein dynamics, spatially varying concentration fluctuations, and thermal exchanges. We investigate biological mechanisms for protein positioning and patterning within membranes and factors in thermal gradient sensing. We also study the kinetics of Brownian motion of particles with temperature variations within energy landscapes arising from heterogeneous microstructures within membranes. The introduced approaches provide self-consistent models for studying biophysical mechanisms involving the drift-diffusion dynamics of individual proteins and energy exchanges and fluctuations between the thermal and mechanical parts of the system. The methods also can be used for studying related non-equilibrium effects in other biological systems and soft materials.</description>

      <title>Insights into Ionic Diffusion in C-S-H Gel Pore from MD Simulations: Spatial Distributions, Energy Barriers, and Structural Descriptor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23089v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding transport behavior in nanoconfined environments is critical to many natural and engineering systems, including cementitious materials, yet its molecular-level mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were used to investigate Na+, Cl-, and water diffusion inside a 4 nm calcium-silicate-hydrate (C-S-H) pore channel over temperatures ranging from 300 K to 360 K. Spatially resolved analysis revealed strong suppression of diffusivity near the solid-liquid interface and gradual recovery toward the pore center. Arrhenius analysis further quantified the spatial variation of activation energy barriers and intrinsic mobilities across the pore channel, showing distinct confinement effects. The spatially resolved structural analysis uncovers a mechanistic transition from structure-controlled to hydrodynamics-controlled transport regimes with increasing distance from the pore surface. A structural descriptor, total coordination strength (TCS), was introduced, providing a predictive link between local liquid structure and molecular mobility within approximately 1 nm of the interface. Beyond 1 nm, suppressed diffusivities were well captured by an exponential decay model based on the Darcy-Brinkman framework. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first MD study to comprehensively resolve the spatial heterogeneity of transport, thermal kinetics, and structure within cementitious nanopores. These findings deepen the fundamental understanding of nanoscale transport phenomena and suggest that tailoring the nanochannel structure and interfacial chemistry of cementitious gels, such as surface coordination environments, pore size distributions, and adsorption sites, may offer a promising strategy to suppress ionic ingress and enhance the durability of cement-based materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As hybrid quantum-classical models gain traction in machine learning, there is a growing need for tools that assess their effectiveness beyond raw accuracy. We present QMetric, a Python package offering a suite of interpretable metrics to evaluate quantum circuit expressibility, feature representations, and training dynamics. QMetric quantifies key aspects such as circuit fidelity, entanglement entropy, barren plateau risk, and training stability. The package integrates with Qiskit and PyTorch, and is demonstrated via a case study on binary MNIST classification comparing classical and quantum-enhanced models. Code, plots, and a reproducible environment are available on GitLab.</description>

      <title>High-Performance Contraction of Quantum Circuits for Riemannian Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work focuses on optimizing the gates of a quantum circuit with a given topology to approximate the unitary time evolution governed by a Hamiltonian. Recognizing that unitary matrices form a mathematical manifold, we employ Riemannian optimization methods -- specifically the Riemannian trust-region algorithm -- which involves second derivative calculations with respect to the gates. Our key technical contribution is a matrix-free algorithmic framework that avoids the explicit construction and storage of large unitary matrices acting on the whole Hilbert space. Instead, we evaluate all quantities as sums over state vectors, assuming that these vectors can be stored in memory. We develop HPC-optimized kernels for applying gates to state vectors and for the gradient and Hessian computation. Further improvements are achieved by exploiting sparsity structures due to Hamiltonian conservation laws, such as parity conservation, and lattice translation invariance. We benchmark our implementation on the Fermi-Hubbard model with up to 16 sites, demonstrating a nearly linear parallelization speed-up with up to 112 CPU threads. Finally, we compare our implementation with an alternative matrix product operator-based approach.</description>

      <title>Sociophysics models inspired by the Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Ising model, originally developed for understanding magnetic phase transitions, has become a cornerstone in the study of collective phenomena across diverse disciplines. In this review, we explore how Ising and Ising-like models have been successfully adapted to sociophysical systems, where binary-state agents mimic human decisions or opinions. By focusing on key areas such as opinion dynamics, financial markets, social segregation, game theory, language evolution, and epidemic spreading, we demonstrate how the models describing these phenomena, inspired by the Ising model, capture essential features of collective behavior, including phase transitions, consensus formation, criticality, and metastability. In particular, we emphasize the role of the dynamical rules of evolution in the different models that often converge back to Ising-like universality. We end by outlining the future directions in sociphysics research, highlighting the continued relevance of the Ising model in the analysis of complex social systems.</description>

      <title>Half-metallicity and anomalous Slater-Pauling behaviour in half-Heusler CrMnSb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23993v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study provides a first-principles insight into half-Heusler CrMnSb to understand its deviation from the conventional Slater-Pauling semiconducting behavior. CrMnSb, having a valence electron count of 18, has been proposed to exhibit compensated ferrimagnetic character instead of the expected nonmagnetic semiconducting ground state. As half-Heusler systems with a valence electron count of 18 are not known to exhibit magnetic ordering, we have investigated the electronic and magnetic properties of CrMnSb using a combination of density functional theory and Green's function-based multiple-scattering theory. We show that, despite satisfying the 18 valence electron Slater-Pauling rule, CrMnSb does not exhibit ground-state nonmagnetic semiconducting behavior. Instead, it reveals a half-metallic, fully compensated ferrimagnetic ground state. This anomaly originates from the presence of localized sublattice moments, resulting from antiparallel alignment between Cr and Mn sublattices, which enforces half-metallic ferrimagnetism despite its ideal 18 valence electron count.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.13655v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The memory effect, which quantifies the interconnection between the target system and its environment, correlates states between distinct Hamiltonians. In this paper, we propose the diffusion process derived from Smoluchowski equation that can manifest the evolution of memory effect integration in non Markovian regime. The master equation from the Smoluchowski picture, within the framework of Stochastic Thermodynamics, justifies the use of the diffusion process. The numerical experiments using collision between semiflexible polymers like single walled carbon nanotubes(SWCNT) confirm the derivation and the justification of the usage of the heat diffusion to compensate the correlated momentum between two Hamiltonians that compose coarse grained system of SWCNT. The diffusion process governs the nonlinear motion in both equilibrium and far from equilibrium states.</description>

      <title>Shifting sands of hardware and software in exascale quantum mechanical simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11881v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The era of exascale computing presents both exciting opportunities and unique challenges for quantum mechanical simulations. Although the transition from petaflops to exascale computing has been marked by a steady increase in computational power, it is accompanied by a shift towards heterogeneous architectures, with graphical processing units (GPUs) in particular gaining a dominant role. The exascale era, therefore, demands a fundamental shift in software development strategies. This Perspective examines the changing landscape of hardware and software for exascale computing, highlighting the limitations of traditional algorithms and software implementations in light of the increasing use of heterogeneous architectures in high-end systems. We discuss the challenges of adapting quantum chemistry software to these new architectures, including the fragmentation of the software stack, the need for more efficient algorithms (including reduced precision versions) tailored for GPUs, and the importance of developing standardized libraries and programming models.</description>

Abstract: We perform deep variational free energy calculations to investigate the dense hydrogen system at 1200 K and high pressures. In this computational framework, neural networks are used to model the free energy through the proton Boltzmann distribution and the electron wavefunction. By directly minimizing the free energy, our results reveal the emergence of a crystalline order associated with the center of mass of hydrogen molecules at approximately 180 GPa. This transition from atomic liquid to a molecular solid is marked by discontinuities in both the pressure and thermal entropy. Additionally, we discuss the broader implications and limitations of these findings in the context of recent studies of dense hydrogen under similar conditions.</description>

      <title>Calculation of Photocarrier Generation from Optical Absorption for Time-domain Simulation of Optoelectronic Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.06702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2102.06702v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Photocarrier generation rate in optoelectronic materials is often calculated using the Poynting vector in the frequency domain. However, this approach is not accurate in time-domain simulations of photoconductive devices because the instantaneous Poynting vector does not distinguish between power flux densities of optical and low-frequency electromagnetic fields. The latter is generated by photocurrents and is not supposed to contribute to the photocarrier generation since the corresponding photon energy is smaller than the bandgap energy of the optoelectronic material. This work proposes an optical absorption-based model to accurately calculate the generation rate in time-domain simulations. The proposed approach considers the material dispersion near the optical frequency corresponding to the bandgap energy of the optoelectronic material and calculates the instantaneous optical absorption from the polarization current density associated with this dispersion model. Numerical examples show that the proposed method is more accurate than the Poynting vector-based approach in calculating the instantaneous optical absorption. The method is further validated against experimental results via simulations of a photoconductive device, where the Poynting vector-based approach results in divergent carrier densities when the low-frequency fields are strong.</description>

      <title>Solving Systems of Linear Equations: HHL from a Tensor Networks Perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.05290v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new approach for solving systems of linear equations with tensor networks based on the quantum HHL algorithm. We first develop a novel HHL in the qudits formalism, the generalization of qubits, and then transform its operations into an equivalent classical HHL, taking advantage of the non-unitary operations that they can apply. The main novelty of this proposal is to perform a classical simulation as efficiently as possible of the HHL to benchmark the algorithm steps according to its input parameters and the input matrix. We apply this algorithm to three simulation problems, comparing it with an exact inversion algorithm, and we compare its performance against an implementation of the original HHL simulated in the Qiskit framework, providing both codes. Our results show that our approach can achieve a promising performance in computational efficiency to simulate HHL process without quantum noise, providing a lower bound.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the statistical recovery of missing physics and turbulent phenomena in fluid flows using generative machine learning. Here we develop a two-stage super-resolution method using spectral filtering to restore the high-wavenumber components of a Kolmogorov flow. We include a rigorous examination of generated samples through the lens of statistical turbulence. By extending the prior methods to a combined super-resolution and conditional high-wavenumber generation, we demonstrate turbulence recovery on a 8x upsampling task, effectively doubling the range of recovered wavenumbers.</description>

Abstract: We perform a comprehensive analysis of the quantum-enhanced Monte Carlo method [Nature, 619, 282-287 (2023)], aimed at identifying the optimal working point of the algorithm. We observe an optimal mixing Hamiltonian strength and analyze the scaling of the total evolution time with the size of the system. We also explore extensions of the circuit, including the use of time-dependent Hamiltonians and reverse digitized annealing. Additionally, we propose that classical, approximate quantum simulators can be used for the proposal step instead of the original real-hardware implementation. We observe that tensor-network simulators, even with unconverged settings, can maintain a scaling advantage over standard classical samplers. This may extend the utility of quantum-enhanced Monte Carlo as a quantum-inspired algorithm, even before the deployment of large-scale quantum hardware.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18374v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The study of strongly correlated electron systems remains a fundamental challenge in condensed matter physics, particularly in two-dimensional (2D) systems hosting various exotic phases of matter including quantum spin liquids, unconventional superconductivity, and topological orders. Although Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) has established itself as a pillar for simulating one-dimensional quantum systems, its application to 2D systems has long been hindered by the notorious ``local minimum'' issues. Recent methodological breakthroughs have addressed this challenge by incorporating Gutzwiller-projected wavefunctions as initial states for DMRG simulations. This hybrid approach, referred to as DMRG guided by Gutzwiller-projected wave functions (or Gutzwiller-guided DMRG), has demonstrated remarkable improvements in accuracy, efficiency, and the ability to explore exotic quantum phases such as topological orders. This review examines the theoretical underpinnings of this approach, details key algorithmic developments, and showcases its applications in recent studies of 2D quantum systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16225v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a formal framework for understanding and unifying the concept of observers across physics, computer science, philosophy, and related fields. Building on cybernetic feedback models, we introduce an operational definition of minimal observers, explore their role in shaping foundational concepts, and identify what remains unspecified in their absence. Drawing upon insights from quantum gravity, digital physics, second-order cybernetics, and recent ruliological and pregeometric approaches, we argue that observers serve as indispensable reference points for measurement, reference frames, and the emergence of meaning. We show how this formalism sheds new light on debates related to consciousness, quantum measurement, and computational boundaries; by way of theorems on observer equivalences and complexity measures. This perspective opens new avenues for investigating how complexity and structure arise in both natural and artificial systems.</description>

      <title>Role of defects in atom probe analysis of sol-gel silica</title>

Abstract: Silicon dioxide is a suitable material to encapsulate proteins at room temperature so that they can be analysed at the atomic level using laser-assisted atom probe tomography (La-APT). To achieve this goal, in this study we show that UV and deep UV lasers can achieve a high success rate in La-APT of silica in terms of chemical resolution and three-dimensional image volume, with both lasers providing comparable results. Since the La-APT analyses are driven by photon absorption, in order to understand the mechanisms behind the enhanced absorption of UV light, we performed density functional theory calculations to model the electronic and optical properties of amorphous silica matrices generated using a Monte Carlo approach to structural optimisation. In particular, we have investigated the role of various defects introduced during sample preparation, such as substitutional and interstitial carbon, sodium and gallium ions, and hydrogen. Our results show that the presence of defects increases the absorption of silica in the UV and deep-UV range and thus improves the La-APT capabilities of the material. However, due to the low density of free charge carriers resulting from the absorption of laser energy by defects, deviations from the nominal chemical composition and suboptimal chemical resolution may occur, potentially limiting the optimal acquisition of APT mass spectra.</description>

      <title>Mechanisms and Stability of Li Dynamics in Amorphous Li-Ti-P-S-Based Mixed Ionic-Electronic Conductors: A Machine Learning Molecular Dynamics Study</title>

Abstract: Mixed ionic-electronic conductors (MIECs) exhibit both high ionic and electronic conductivity to improve the battery performance. In this work, we investigate the mechanism and stability of transport channels in our recently developed MIEC material, amorphous Ti-doped lithium phosphorus sulfide (LPS), using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with a 99\% accurate machine-learning force field (MLFF) trained on \textit{ab-initio} MD data. The achieved MLFF helps efficient large-scale MD simulations on LPS with three Ti concentrations (10\%, 20\%, and 30\%) and six temperatures (25$^\mathrm{o}$C to 225$^\mathrm{o}$C) to calculate ionic conductivity, activation energy, Li-ion transport mechanism, and configurational entropy. Results show that ionic conductivities and activation energies are consistent with our recent experimental values. Moreover, Li-ion transport occurs via free-volume diffusion facilitated by the formation of disordered Li-S polyhedra. The enhanced stability of transport channels at 10\% and 20\% Ti doping, compared to 0\% and 30\%, is observed by analyzing the vibrational and configurational entropy of these disordered Li-S polyhedra. Overall, this study highlights the utility of MLFF-based large-scale MD simulations in explaining the transport mechanism and the stability of Li-ion in Ti-doped LPS electrolyte with significant computational efficiency.</description>
