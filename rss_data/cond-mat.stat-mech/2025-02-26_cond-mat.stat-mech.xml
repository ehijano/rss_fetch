      <title>Higher-order contagion processes in 1.99 dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Higher-order interactions have recently emerged as a promising framework for describing new dynamical phenomena in heterogeneous contagion processes. However, a fundamental open question is how to understand their contribution in the eyes of the physics of critical phenomena. Based on mesoscopic field-theoretic Langevin descriptions, we show that: (i) pairwise mechanisms as facilitation or thresholding are formally equivalent to higher-order ones, (ii) pairwise interactions at coarse-grained scales govern the higher-order contact process and, (iii) classical Imry-Ma arguments hold for networks with low spectral dimension. In short, we demonstrate that classical field theories, grounded on model symmetries and/or network dimensionality, still capture the nature of the phase transition, also predicting finite-size effects in real and synthetic networks.</description>

      <title>Scrutinizing the Mori memory function for diffusion in periodic quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion is an ubiquitous phenomenon. It is a widespread belief that as long as the area under a current autocorrelation function converges in time, the corresponding spatiotemporal density dynamics should be diffusive. This may be viewed as a result of the combination of linear response theory with the Einstein relation. However, attempts to derive this statement from first principles are notoriously challenging. We first present a counterexample by constructing a correlation functions of some density wave, such that the area under the corresponding current autocorrelation function converges, but the dynamics do not obey a diffusion equation. Then we will introduce a method based on the recursion method and the Mori memory formalism, that may help to actually identify diffusion. For a decisive answer, one would have to know infinitely many so called Lanczos coefficients, which is unattainable in most cases. However, in the examples examined in this paper, we find that the practically computable number of Lanczos coefficients suffices for a strong guess.</description>

      <title>Controlling dynamics of stochastic systems with deep reinforcement learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A properly designed controller can help improve the quality of experimental measurements or force a dynamical system to follow a completely new time-evolution path. Recent developments in deep reinforcement learning have made steep advances toward designing effective control schemes for fairly complex systems. However, a general simulation scheme that employs deep reinforcement learning for exerting control in stochastic systems is yet to be established. In this paper, we attempt to further bridge a gap between control theory and deep reinforcement learning by proposing a simulation algorithm that allows achieving control of the dynamics of stochastic systems through the use of trained artificial neural networks. Specifically, we use agent-based simulations where the neural network plays the role of the controller that drives local state-to-state transitions. We demonstrate the workflow and the effectiveness of the proposed control methods by considering the following two stochastic processes: particle coalescence on a lattice and a totally asymmetric exclusion process.</description>

      <title>Reaction-diffusion dynamics of the weakly dissipative Fermi gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the one-dimensional Fermi gas subject to dissipative reactions. The dynamics is governed by the quantum master equation, where the Hamiltonian describes coherent motion of the particles, while dissipation accounts for irreversible reactions. For lattice one-dimensional fermionic systems, emergent critical behavior has been found in the dynamics in the reaction-limited regime of weak dissipation. Here, we address the question whether such features are present also in a gas in continuum space. We do this in the weakly dissipative regime by applying the time-dependent generalized Gibbs ensemble method. We show that for two body $2A\to \emptyset$ and three $3A\to \emptyset$ body annihilation, as well as for coagulation $A+A\to A$, the density features an asymptotic algebraic decay in time akin to the lattice problem. In all the cases, we find that upon increasing the temperature of the initial state the density decay accelerates, but the asymptotic algebraic decay exponents are not affected. We eventually consider the competition between branching $A\to A+A$ and the decay processes $A\to \emptyset$ and $2A\to \emptyset$. We find a second-order absorbing-state phase transition in the mean-field directed percolation universality class. This analysis shows that emergent behavior observed in lattice quantum reaction-diffusion systems is present also in continuum space, where it may be probed using ultra-cold atomic physics.</description>

      <title>Single file dynamics of tethered random walkers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the single-file dynamics of $N$ identical random walkers moving with diffusivity $D$ in one dimension (walkers bounce off each other when attempting to overtake). Additionally, we require that the separation between neighboring walkers cannot exceed a threshold value $\Delta$ and therefore call them ``tethered walkers'' (they behave as if bounded by strings which tighten fully when reaching the maximum length $\Delta$). For finite $\Delta$, we study the diffusional relaxation to the equilibrium state and characterize the latter [the long-time relaxation is exponential with a characteristic time that scales as $(N\Delta)^2/D$]. In particular, our approximate approach for the $N$-particle probability distribution yields the one-particle distribution function of the central and edge particles [the first two positional moments are given as power expansions in $\Delta/\sqrt{4Dt}$]. For $N=2$, we find an exact solution (both in the continuum case and on-lattice) and use it to test our approximations for one-particle distributions, positional moments, and correlations. For finite $\Delta$ and arbitrary $N$, edge particles move with an effective long-time diffusivity $D/N$, in sharp contrast with the $1/\ln(N)$-behavior observed when $\Delta=\infty$. Finally, we compute the probability distribution of the equilibrium system length and the associated entropy. We find that the force required to change this length by a given amount is linear in this quantity, the (entropic) spring constant being $6k_BT/(N\Delta^2)$. In this respect, the system behaves like an ideal polymer. Our main analytical results are confirmed by Monte Carlo simulations.</description>

      <title>Boundary Perturbation Effects in Quantum Systems with Conserved Energy and Continuous Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16252v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate one-dimensional systems with both energy conservation and a continuous symmetry, focusing on the impact of a boundary perturbation that breaks the continuous symmetry. Our study examines the quantum dynamics resulting from this boundary perturbation and identifies two distinct phases: one in which the corresponding charge exhibits extensive fluctuations, and another where the charge remains conserved. These phenomena are observed in both free and interacting models. The emergence of the charge-frozen phase is attributed to energy conservation, and we demonstrate that this phase disappears when energy conservation is broken or replaced by other symmetries. We provide an explanation using the effective Hamiltonian derived from degenerate perturbation theory.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolic Monopoles, (Semi-)Holomorphic Chern-Simons Theories, and Generalized Chiral Potts Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17545v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the relation between spectral data of magnetic monopoles in hyperbolic space and the curve of the spectral parameter of generalized chiral Potts models (gCPM) through the lens of (semi-)holomorphic field theories. We realize the identification of the data on the two sides, which we call the hyperbolic monopole/gCPM correspondence. For the group $\text{SU}(2)$, this correspondence had been observed by Atiyah and Murray in the 80s. Here, we revisit and generalize this correspondence and establish its origin. By invoking the work of Murray and Singer on hyperbolic monopoles, we first generalize the observation of Atiyah and Murray to the group $\text{SU}(n)$. We then propose a technology to engineer gCPM within the 4d Chern-Simons (CS) theory, which explains various features of the model, including the lack of rapidity-difference property of its R-matrix and its peculiarity of having a genus$\,\ge 2$ curve of the spectral parameter. Finally, we investigate the origin of the correspondence. We first clarify how the two sides of the correspondence can be realized from the 6d holomorphic CS theory on $\mathbb{P}S(M)$, the projective spinor bundle of the Minkowski space $M=\mathbb{R}^{1,3}$, for hyperbolic $\text{SU}(n)$-monopoles, and the Euclidean space $M=\mathbb{R}^4$, for the gCPM. We then establish that $\mathbb{P}S(M)$ can be holomorphically embedded into $\mathbb{P}S(\mathbb{C}^{1,3})$, the projective spinor bundle of $\mathbb{C}^{1,3}$, of complex dimension five with a fixed complex structure. We finally explain how the 6d CS theory on $\mathbb{P}S(M)$ can be realized as the dimensional reduction of the 10d holomorphic CS theory on $\mathbb{P}S(\mathbb{C}^{1,3})$. As the latter theory is only sensitive to the complex structure of $\mathbb{P}S(\mathbb{C}^{1,3})$, which has been fixed, we realize the correspondence as two incarnations of the same physics in ten dimensions.</description>

      <title>Maximal Magic for Two-qubit States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17550v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magic is a quantum resource essential for universal quantum computation and represents the deviation of quantum states from those that can be simulated efficiently using classical algorithms. Using the Stabilizer R\'enyi Entropy (SRE), we investigate two-qubit states with maximal magic, which are most distinct from classical simulability, and provide strong numerical evidence that the maximal second order SRE is $\log (16/7)\approx 0.827$, establishing a tighter bound than the prior $\log(5/2)\approx 0.916$. We identity 480 states saturating the new bound, which turn out to be the fiducial states for the mutually unbiased bases (MUBs) generated by the orbits of the Weyl-Heisenberg (WH) group, and conjecture that WH-MUBs are the maximal magic states for $n$-qubit, when $n\neq 1$ and 3. We also reveal a striking interplay between magic and entanglement: the entanglement of maximal magic states is restricted to two possible values, $1/2$ and $1/\sqrt{2}$, as quantified by the concurrence; none is maximally entangled.</description>

      <title>Emergent Hydrodynamic Mode on SU(2) Plaquette Chains and Quantum Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17551v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We search for emergent hydrodynamic modes in real-time Hamiltonian dynamics of $2+1$-dimensional SU(2) lattice gauge theory on a quasi one dimensional plaquette chain, by numerically computing symmetric correlation functions of energy densities on lattice sizes of about $20$ with the local Hilbert space truncated at $j_{\rm max}=\frac{1}{2}$. Due to the Umklapp processes, we only find a mode for energy diffusion. The symmetric correlator exhibits transport peak near zero frequency with a width proportional to momentum squared at small momentum, when the system is fully quantum ergodic, as indicated by the eigenenergy level statistics. This transport peak leads to a power-law $t^{-\frac{1}{2}}$ decay of the symmetric correlator at late time, also known as the long-time tail, as well as diffusion-like spreading in position space. We also introduce a quantum algorithm for computing the symmetric correlator on a quantum computer and find it gives results consistent with exact diagonalization when tested on the IBM emulator. Finally we discuss the future prospect of searching for the sound modes.</description>

      <title>The Moving Born-Oppenheimer Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17557v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a mixed quantum-classical framework, dubbed the Moving Born-Oppenheimer Approximation (MBOA), to describe the dynamics of slow degrees of freedom (DOFs) coupled to fast ones. As in the Born-Oppenheimer Approximation (BOA), the fast degrees of freedom adiabatically follow a state that depends on the slow ones. Unlike the BOA, this state depends on both the positions and the momenta of the slow DOFs. We study several model systems: a spin-1/2 particle and a spinful molecule moving in a spatially inhomogeneous magnetic field, and a gas of fast particles coupled to a piston. The MBOA reveals rich dynamics for the slow degree of freedom, including reflection, dynamical trapping, and mass renormalization. It also significantly modifies the state of the fast DOFs. For example, the spins in the molecule are entangled and squeezed, while the gas of fast particles develops gradients that are synchronized with the motion of the piston for a long time. The MBOA can be used to describe both classical and quantum systems and has potential applications in molecular dynamics, state preparation, and quantum sensing.</description>

      <title>Onset of Quantum Chaos and Ergoditicy in Spin Systems with Highly Degenerate Hilbert Spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17594v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that in systems with highly degenerate energy spectra, such as the 2D transverse-field Ising model (2DTFIM) in the strong-field limit, quantum chaos can emerge in finite systems for arbitrary small perturbations. In this regime, the presence of extensive quasi-conserved quantities can prevent finite systems from becoming ergodic. We study the ensuing transition to ergodicity in a family of models that includes the 2DTFIM, in which the onset of ergodic behavior exhibits universality and occurs for perturbation strengths that decrease polynomially with increasing system size. We discuss the behaviors of quantum chaos indicators, such as level spacing statistics and bipartite entanglement, and of the fidelity susceptibilities and spectral functions across the transitions.</description>

      <title>Wind-driven collisions between floes explain the observed dispersion of Arctic sea ice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17668v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The transport of sea ice over the polar oceans plays an important role in climate. This transport is driven predominantly by turbulent winds, leading to stochastic motion of ice floes. Observed diffusivities and velocity distributions of sea ice deviate by orders of magnitude from Brownian models, making it challenging to predict ice transport. We fully resolve these gaps through stochastic granular simulations that account for interactions between ice floes as they respond to a noisy wind. Using only directly measured quantities as model inputs, we reproduce the dispersion, diffusivity, velocity distribution, and power spectra of sea ice observed in the Fram Strait with remarkable quantitative accuracy. We understand these features as direct consequences of collisions between floes, which rapidly dissipate the energy injected by wind. A kinetic theory provides insights into these dynamics in terms of environmental properties, and makes predictions in close agreement with observations. The ideas and tools developed here pave the way for a new predictive understanding of global sea ice transport in terms of local floe-scale processes.</description>

      <title>Spectral Efficiency Expression for the Non-Linear Schr\"{o}dinger Channel in the Low Noise Limit Using Scattering Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transmission through optical fibers offers ultra-fast and long-haul communications. However, the search for its ultimate capacity limits in the presence of distributed amplifier noise is complicated by the competition between wave dispersion and non-linearity. In this paper, we exploit the integrability of the Nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger Equation, which accurately models optical fiber communications, to derive an expression for the spectral efficiency of an optical fiber communications channel, expressed fully in the scattering data domain of the Non-linear Fourier Transform and valid in the limit of low amplifier noise. We utilize the relationship between the derived noise-covariance operator and the Jacobian of the mapping between the signal and the scattering data to obtain the properties of the former. Emerging from the structure of the covariance operator is the significance of the Gordon-Haus effect in moderating and finally reversing the increase of the spectral efficiency with power. This effect is showcased in numerical simulations for Gaussian input in the high-bandwidth regime.</description>

Abstract: We propose a framework to quantify and utilize interdisciplinarity in science and engineering curricula in the case of university-level higher education. We analyze interdisciplinary relations by standardizing large-scale official educational data in Korea using a cutting-edge large language model and constructing knowledge maps for disciplines of scientific education. We design and evaluate single-field and integrated dual-field curricula by adapting pedagogical theory and utilizing information theory-based metrics. We develop standard curricula for individual disciplines and integrated curricula combining two fields, with their interdisciplinarity quantified by the curriculum synergy score. The results indicate higher interdisciplinarity for combinations within or across closely related fields, especially in engineering fields. Based on the analysis, engineering fields constitute the core structure of our design for curriculum interdisciplinarity, while basic natural science fields are located at peripheral stems to provide fundamental concepts.</description>

      <title>Exactly solvable model of the square-root price impact dynamics under the long-range market-order correlation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In econophysics, there are two enigmatic empirical laws: (i) Due to the order-splitting behavior by institutional traders, the market-order flow has strong and predictable persistence (called the long-range order-sign correlation $C_\tau\propto \tau^{-\alpha-1}$ with $1&lt;\alpha&lt;2$), well formulated as the Lillo-Mike-Farmer model. This phenomenon seems contradictory against the diffusive and unpredictable price dynamics. (ii) The price impact $I(Q)$ by a large metaorder $Q$ has strong nonlinearlity called the the square-root law, $I(Q)\propto \sqrt{Q}$. In this Letter, we propose an exactly solvable model of the price impact dynamics unifying these two empirical laws. We generalize the Lillo-Mike-Farmer model naturally toward the nonliner price impact dynamics: All traders are assumed to be order splitters and their price impact obeys the nonlinear scaling $I(Q)\propto Q^{\delta}$. This model is mapped to the exactly solvable L\'evy-walk model with nonlinear walking speed. Our exact solution shows that the price dynamics is shown always diffusive for $\delta=1/2$ even in the presence of order splitters. Our results suggest that the square-root law plays a crucial role in mitigating large price movements in the presence of order splitters, thereby leading to normal diffusive price dynamics, which aligns with the efficient market hypothesis over long timescales.</description>

      <title>Quantum entanglement of fermionic gapless symmetry protected topological phases in one dimension</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18178v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum entanglement can be an effective diagnostic tool for probing topological phases protected by global symmetries. Recently, the notion of nontrivial topology in critical systems has been proposed and is attracting growing attention. In this work, as a concrete example, we explore the quantum entanglement properties of fermionic gapless topological states by constructing exactly solvable models based on stacked multiple Kitaev chains. We first analytically establish the global phase diagram using entanglement entropy and reveal three topologically distinct gapped phases with different winding numbers, along with three topologically distinct transition lines separating them. Importantly, we unambiguously demonstrate that two transition lines exhibit fundamentally different topological properties despite sharing the same central charge. Specifically, they display nontrivial topological degeneracy in the entanglement spectrum under periodic boundary conditions, thereby generalizing the Li-Haldane bulk-boundary correspondence to a broader class of fermionic gapless topological states. Additionally, we identify a novel Lifshitz multicritical point at the intersection of the three transition lines, which also exhibits nontrivial topological degeneracy. This work provides a valuable reference for investigating gapless topological phases of matter from the perspective of quantum entanglement.</description>

      <title>Agnostic calculation of atomic free energies with the descriptor density of states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new method to evaluate vibrational free energies of atomic systems without a priori specification of an interatomic potential. Our model-agnostic approach leverages descriptors, high-dimensional feature vectors of atomic structure. The entropy of a high-dimensional density, the descriptor density of states, is accurately estimated with conditional score matching. Casting interatomic potentials into a form extensive in descriptor features, we show free energies emerge as the Legendre-Fenchel conjugate of the descriptor entropy, avoiding all high-dimensional integration. The score matching campaign requires less resources than fixed-model sampling and is highly parallel, reducing wall time to a few minutes, with tensor compression schemes allowing lightweight storage. Our model-agnostic estimator returns differentiable free energy predictions over a broad range of potential parameters in microseconds of CPU effort, allowing rapid forward and back propagation of potential variations through finite temperature simulations, long desired for uncertainty quantification and inverse design. We test predictions against thermodynamic integration calculations over a broad range of models for BCC, FCC and A15 phases of W, Mo and Fe at high homologous temperatures. Predictions pass the stringent accuracy threshold of 1-2 meV/atom (1/40-1/20 kcal/mol) for phase prediction with propagated score uncertainties robustly bounding errors. We also demonstrate targeted fine-tuning, reducing the alpha-gamma transition temperature in a non-magnetic machine learning model of Fe from 2030 K to 1063 K through back-propagation, with no additional sampling. Applications to liquids and fine-tuning foundational models are discussed along with the many problems in computational science which estimate high-dimensional integrals.</description>

      <title>The Simply Uninformed Thermodynamics of Erasure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18231v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 1. Strong and weak notions of erasure are distinguished according to whether the single erasure procedure does or does not leave the environment in the same state independently of the pre-erasure state.
  2. Purely thermodynamic considerations show that strong erasure cannot be dissipationless.
  3. The main source of entropy creation in erasure processes at molecular scales is the entropy that must be created to suppress thermal fluctuations ("noise").
  4. A phase space analysis recovers no minimum entropy cost for weak erasure and a positive minimum entropy cost for strong erasure.
  5. An information entropy term has been attributed mistakenly to pre-erasure states in the Gibbs formalism through the neglect of an additive constant in the "-k sum p log p" Gibbs entropy formula.</description>

Abstract: We present a quantum theory of Casimir forces between perfect electrical conductors, based on quantum electrodynamics and quantum statistical physics. This theory utilizes Kapusta's finite-temperature quantum field theory, combined with the Faddeev-Popov ghost formalism. This approach allows us to calculate Casimir forces at finite temperatures, providing both previously known and new physical insights from a unified perspective. Furthermore, our method enables us to compute the stress tensor associated with Casimir forces, in accordance with the Helmholtz free energy of an equilibrium quantum electromagnetic field. Using this methodology, we calculate the excess surface tension on the walls of slit-like pores due to the Casimir effect.</description>

      <title>Self-congruent point in critical matrix product states: An effective field theory for finite-entanglement scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03954v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We set up an effective field theory formulation for the renormalization flow of matrix product states (MPS) with finite bond dimension, focusing on systems exhibiting finite-entanglement scaling close to a conformally invariant critical fixed point. We show that the finite MPS bond dimension $\chi$ is equivalent to introducing a perturbation by a relevant operator to the fixed-point Hamiltonian. The fingerprint of this mechanism is encoded in the $\chi$-independent universal transfer matrix's gap ratios, which are distinct from those predicted by the unperturbed Conformal Field Theory. This phenomenon defines a renormalization group self-congruent point, where the relevant coupling constant ceases to flow due to a balance of two effects; When increasing $\chi$, the infrared scale, set by the correlation length $\xi(\chi)$, increases, while the strength of the perturbation at the lattice scale decreases. The presence of a self-congruent point does not alter the validity of the finite-entanglement scaling hypothesis, since the self-congruent point is located at a finite distance from the critical fixed point, well inside the scaling regime of the CFT. We corroborate this framework with numerical evidences from the exact solution of the Ising model and density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations of an effective lattice model.</description>

      <title>Multi-impurity method for the bond-weighted tensor renormalization group</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13998v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a multi-impurity method for the bond-weighted tensor renormalization group (BWTRG) to compute the higher-order moment of physical quantities in a two-dimensional system. The replacement of the bond weight with an impurity matrix in a bond-weighted triad tensor network represents a physical quantity such as the magnetization and the energy. We demonstrate that the accuracy of the proposed method is much higher than the conventional tensor renormalization group for the Ising model and the five-state Potts model. Furthermore, we perform the finite-size scaling analysis and observe that the dimensionless quantity characterizing the structure of the fixed point tensor satisfies the same scaling relation in the critical region as the Binder parameter. The estimated critical temperature dependence on the bond dimension indicates that the exponent relating the correlation length to the bond dimension varies continuously with respect to the BWTRG hyperparameter. We find that BWTRG with the optimal hyperparameter is more efficient in terms of computational time than alternative approaches based on the matrix product state in estimating the critical temperature.</description>

      <title>Critical heat current fluctuations in Curie-Weiss model in and out of equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19643v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In some models of nonequilibrium phase transitions, fluctuations of the analyzed currents have been observed to diverge with system size. To assess whether this behavior is universal across phase transitions, we examined heat current fluctuations in the Curie-Weiss model, a paradigmatic model of the paramagnetic-ferromagnetic phase transition, coupled to two thermal baths. This model exhibits phase transitions driven by both the temperature and the magnetic field. We find that at the temperature-driven phase transition, the heat current noise consists of two contributions: the equilibrium part, which vanishes with system size, and the nonequilibrium part, which diverges with system size. For small temperature differences, this leads to nonmonotonic scaling of fluctuations with system size. In contrast, at the magnetic-field-driven phase transition, heat current fluctuations do not diverge when observed precisely at the phase transition point. Instead, out of equilibrium, the noise is enhanced at the magnetic field values away but close to the phase transition point, due to stochastic switching between two current values. The maximum value of noise increases exponentially with system size, while the position of this maximum shifts towards the phase transition point. Finally, on the methodological side, the paper demonstrates that current fluctuations in large systems can be effectively characterized by combining a path integral approach for macroscopic fluctuations together with an effective two-state model describing subextensive transitions between the two macroscopic states involved in the phase transition.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium thermodynamics of populations of weakly-coupled low-temperature-differential Stirling engines with synchronous and asynchronous transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03185v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study developed the theory of nonequilibrium thermodynamics for populations of low-temperature-differential (LTD) Stirling engines weakly-coupled in a general class of networks to clarify the effects of synchronous and asynchronous transitions on the power and thermal efficiency. We first show that synchronous (asynchronous) transitions increase (decrease) the power and thermal efficiency of weakly-coupled LTD Stirling engines based on quasilinear response relations between formally defined thermodynamic fluxes and forces. After that, we construct a conceptual model satisfying the quasilinear response relations to give a physical interpretation of the changes in power and thermal efficiency due to synchronous and asynchronous transitions, and justify the use of this conceptual model. We then show that the conceptual model, rather than the quasilinear response relations, preserves the thermodynamic irreversibility of the original model and thus gives more accurate results than those using the quasilinear response relations. Finally, we compare the dynamics between the original and the conceptual models for two-engine systems and show that the conceptual models roughly preserve the dynamical characteristics leading up to the synchronous transitions, while some detailed dynamical structures are lost.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14485v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hair cells actively drive oscillations of their mechanosensitive organelles--the hair bundles that enable hearing and balance sensing in vertebrates. Why and how some hair cells expend energy by sustaining this oscillatory motion in order to fulfill their function as signal sensors and others--as amplifiers, remains unknown. We develop a stochastic thermodynamic theory to describe energy flows in a periodically-driven hair bundle. Our analysis of thermodynamic fluxes associated with hair bundles' motion and external sinusoidal stimulus reveals that these organelles operate as thermodynamic work-to-work machines under different operational modes. One operational mode transduces the signal's power into the cell, whereas another allows the external stimulus to harvest the energy supplied by the cell. These two regimes might represent thermodynamic signatures of signal sensing and amplification respectively. In addition to work transduction and energy harvesting, our model also substantiates the capability of hair-cell bundles to operate as heaters and, at the expense of external driving, as active feedback refrigerators. We quantify the performance and robustness of the work-to-work conversion by hair bundles, whose efficiency in some conditions exceeds 80 % of the applied power.</description>

      <title>Emergent Dynamical Ising Transition in Diffusive Sandpiles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16893v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Minimally stable site (MSS) clusters play a dominant role in shaping avalanches in the self-organized critical (SOC) systems. The manipulation of MSS clusters through local smoothings (diffusion) alter the MSS landscape, suppressing rare avalanches and postponing them until they manifest as spanning avalanches. By leveraging the Inverse Ising problem, we uncover a duality between diffusive sandpiles and equilibrium statistical physics. Our analysis reveals an emergent magnetic instability in the dual Ising model, coinciding with the formation of spanning avalanches and marking a transition to a correlated percolation regime. At this point, the MSS loop soups exhibit fractal self-similarity and power-law distributions, while the effective pairwise interactions in the dual system vanish, signaling a magnetic transition characterized by abrupt changes in magnetization and spin susceptibility. Crucially, we show that diffusion fundamentally reshapes avalanche dynamics: the spatial anti-correlations of MSSs in standard SOC systems transform into positive correlations when diffusion is introduced. These findings bridge self-organized criticality, percolation theory, and equilibrium phase transitions, shedding new light on emergent criticality and large-scale correlations in non-equilibrium systems.</description>

Abstract: We propose a natural, parameter-free, discrete-variable formulation of Feynman path integrals. We show that for discrete-variable quantum systems, Feynman path integrals take the form of walks on the graph whose weighted adjacency matrix is the Hamiltonian. By working out expressions for the partition function and transition amplitudes of discretized versions of continuous-variable quantum systems, and then taking the continuum limit, we explicitly recover Feynman's continuous-variable path integrals. We also discuss the implications of our result.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12911v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the Heisenberg $S=1/2$ chain with random ferro- and antiferromagnetic couplings using quantum Monte Carlo simulations at ultra-low temperatures, converging to the ground state. Finite-size scaling of correlation functions and excitation gaps demonstrate an exotic critical state in qualitative agreement with previous strong-disorder renormalization group calculations but with scaling exponents depending on the coupling distribution. We find dual scaling regimes of the transverse correlations versus the distance, with an $L$ independent form $C(r)=r^{-\mu}$ for $r \ll L$ and $C(r,L)=L^{-\eta}f(r/L)$ for $r/L &gt; 0$, where $\mu &gt; \eta$ and the scaling function is delivered by our analysis. These results are at variance with previous spin-wave and density-matrix renormalization group calculations, thus highlighting the power of unbiased quantum Monte Carlo simulations.</description>

      <title>Error Thresholds in Presence of Epistatic Interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11944v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Models for viral populations with high replication error rates (such as RNA viruses) rely on the quasispecies concept, in which mutational pressure beyond the so-called "Error Threshold" leads to a loss of essential genetic information and population collapse, an effect known as the "Error Catastrophe". We explain how crossing this threshold, as a result of increasing mutation rates, can be understood as a second order phase transition, even in the presence of lethal mutations. In particular, we show that, in fitness landscapes with a single peak, this collapse is equivalent to a ferro-paramagnetic transition, where the back-mutation rate plays the role of the external magnetic field. We then generalize this framework to rugged fitness landscapes, like the ones that arise from epistatic interactions, and provide numerical evidence that there is a transition from a high average fitness regime to a low average fitness one, similarly to single-peaked landscapes. The onset of the transition is heralded by a sudden change in the susceptibility to variations in the mutation rate. We use insight from Replica Symmetry Breaking mechanisms in spin glasses, in particular by considering the fluctuations of the genotype similarity distribution as the order parameter.</description>

      <title>One Loop Thermal Effective Action</title>

Abstract: We compute the one loop effective action for a Quantum Field Theory at finite temperature, in the presence of background gauge fields, employing the Heat-Kernel method. This method enables us to compute the thermal corrections to the Wilson coefficients associated with effective operators up to arbitrary mass dimension, which emerge after integrating out heavy scalars and fermions from a generic UV theory. The Heat-Kernel coefficients are functions of non-zero background `electric', `magnetic' fields, and Polyakov loops. A major application of our formalism is the calculation of the finite temperature Coleman-Weinberg potential in effective theories, necessary for the study of phase transitions. A novel feature of this work is the systematic calculation of the dependence of Polyakov loops on the thermal factors of Heat-Kernel coefficients and the Coleman-Weinberg potential. We study the effect of Polyakov loop factors on phase transitions and comment on future directions in applications of the results derived in this work.</description>

      <title>Topology-driven deconfined quantum criticality in magnetic bilayers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08709v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional quantum antiferromagnets are believed to host phases of matter whose excitations are more fundamental than those of the ordered phases. When combining two such spin systems in a bilayer, strong interaction between the emergent excitations can produce phases not realized in either of its subsystems. We show that the critical fluctuations of a two-dimensional spin liquid state can induce a deconfined quantum critical point in a proximate antiferromagnet. The most relevant coupling between the associated effective field theories is given by a mixed Chern-Simons term of the emergent gauge fields in each layer. This describes a topological current-current interaction. In contrast to the local spin-spin interaction, it strongly modifies the renormalization group flow of the theory describing the N\'eel-valence-bond-solid transition of the antiferromagnet. In particular, the protected coupling constant associated with it implies non-trivial quantum critical scaling characterized by a non-universal power-law divergence of the correlation length in the critical domain and Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless divergence approaching it.</description>

      <title>Correlated Growth of Causal Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16647v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The study of causal structure in complex systems has gained increasing attention, with many recent studies exploring causal networks that capture cause-effect relationships across diverse fields. Despite increasing empirical evidence linking causal structures to network topological correlations, the mechanisms underlying the emergence of these correlations in causal networks remain poorly understood. In this work, we propose a general growth framework for causal networks, incorporating two key types of correlations: causal and dynamic. We analytically demonstrate that degree correlations emerge as a consequence of marginal dependencies on these correlations. Our theoretical predictions align quantitatively with empirical data from four large-scale innovation networks. Our theory not only sheds light on the origins of topological correlations but also provides a general framework for understanding correlated growth across causal systems.</description>

      <title>Grassmann tensor approach for two-dimensional QCD in the strong-coupling expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19192v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a tensor-network approach for the strong-coupling expansion of two-dimensional QCD with staggered quarks at non-zero chemical potential. After expanding the Boltzmann factor in the gauge and fermion actions, all gauge fields can be integrated out exactly and the partition function can be evaluated using the Grassmann higher-order tensor renormalization group approach. The method is modified to compute the $\mu$ dependence of the quark number density and the chiral condensate up to order $\beta^3$ with complete absence of higher-order terms infiltrating the result. Although the expansion itself is only a good approximation to the full theory at small $\beta&lt;0.1$, the range can be extended, by using judiciously chosen fits. Moreover, these fits also yield a valuable expansion in $\beta$ for the critical chemical potential.</description>
