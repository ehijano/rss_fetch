      <title>Analysis Of A Long Memory Circular Convolution Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A stochastic model, the product of a circulant matrix and a random normal vector, is shown to produce an evolutive long memory time series with a power law spectral density. The distribution of the time series, a beta location scale family of distributions, provides a connection to the unit centered spherical distribution and directional statistics. The eigenanalysis of the deterministic circulant matrix is shown to provide estimates of the discrete Fourier spectral trend, the intrinsic dimension, the probability density shape parameter of the resulting time series, the condition number of the matrix and a principle component analysis. Examples of the R code, used as the constructive exploratory element of the work are given as constructive elements of the paper. The R code may be copied, pastedinto a R editor, and explored.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of four families of methods with the same weight function to solve nonlinear equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of four families of methods obtained with a weight function from a convex combination of Newton's method and a Newton-Halley type method on polynomials with two roots. We find the analytical expressions for the fixed and critical points. We study the stable and unstable behavior of the strange fixed points. Also, parameters spaces for identify methods with good behavior are presented. Then, several dynamic planes are presented to confirm the results obtained. Finally, some periodic orbits with period two for a selected method are presented.</description>

      <title>Spectral Geometry of Fourier Curves with Prime Frequencies: A Comparative Experimental Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comparative experimental study of planar curves arising from a Fourier series whose frequencies are the prime numbers, together with several randomized control models. Starting from the series $F_n(t)=\sum_{p\le n} v_p(n!)\, e^{i p t},~t\in[-\pi,\pi]$, introduced and motivated in a companion work, we investigate the geometric complexity of the associated planar curves obtained by sampling in the complex plane. To test whether the observed multiscale behavior reflects arithmetic structure or can be reproduced as a generic consequence of sparsity or density, we compare the prime frequency model with randomized alternatives, including random frequency sets, a Cram\'er type random model, and a shuffled coefficient model. Using consistent box counting protocols and Monte Carlo ensembles, we observe stable scale dependent behavior for the prime frequency curves that is not reproduced by the randomized models. All results are experimental and are presented as evidence motivating further theoretical investigation.</description>

      <title>Chebyshev polynomials and a refinement of the local residue/non-residue structure at a prime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The basic power function $t_n(x)=x^n$ is in some sense a classical limit for large $x$, of the monictised Chebyshev polynomial of the first kind $T_n(x)/2^{n-1}$. A theorem of Ritt says they are the only two families of polynomials $p_n(x)$ over $\mathbb{C}$ which satisfies the commutativity relation $p_n(p_m(x))=p_m(p_n(x))$. The commutativity $t_n(t_m(x))=t_m(t_n(x))$ is the reason why the RSA scheme allow also digital signature but the Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol depends only on the commutativity. The DH scheme and many results in elementary local (at a fixed prime) multiplicative number theory is about properties of the power function $t_n(x)$ and they have natural analogue extension to $T_n(x)$. Recently we discovered a Chebyshev version of Euler's primality criterion , which however depends on two quadratic characters $\epsilon_p(a)=\left ( \frac{a^2-1}{p} \right)$ and $\delta_p(a)=\left( \frac{2(a+1)}{p} \right)$. This gives rise to a local partition of the integers mod an odd prime $p$ in two distinct ways into 4 disjoint sets $A_{\epsilon \delta}$ of smaller size about $p/4$ over which the exponential sum still have squar root cancellations. This can be thought of as a real refinement of the residue/non-residue as it arise from viewing $T_n(x)$ is the "real" part of the $n$th power of the unit $\omega_x=x+\sqrt{x^2-1}$, namely $\omega_x^n=T_n(x)+U_{n-1}(x)\sqrt{x^2-1}$. There are obvious analogue of Chebyshev version of pseudoprimes, Wieferich primes, Lucas-Lehmer, AKS, Diffie-Hellman, cyclotomic expansions and probably many others which hopefully some may give improved resuts on the original version.</description>

      <title>Representation of similar triangles in $\mathbb{R}^{3}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1994, Dhar and Sinha provided a graphic representation in $\mathbb{R}^{2}$ of the classification of triangles based on similarity. In this article, we briefly recall their treatment and offer a generalization by providing a graphic representation in $\mathbb{R}^{3}$. Towards the end of this article, we make an attempt to offer a quantitative analysis of some particular class of triangles.</description>

      <title>Internal Symmetry Group in Categorial Topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interdefinability of the universal concepts of category theory has been introduced by Lawvere. The perfect interdefinability between the objects and arrows of some category, defines the class of Perfectly Symmetric Categories (PSC) where each category can be represented equivalently by its arrows or by its objects only.
  Such symmetry, differently from the global categorial symmetry ( categorial-symmetry group $CS(\mathbb{Z})$ of all comma-propagation transformations), ia a local internal symmetry inside a given PSC category.
  Given a PSC category (as a "geometric object") $\textbf{C}$ we can consider its properties (the categorial commutative diagrams) preserved under actions of a particular endofunctor $E$ which transforms any commutative diagram into an invariant "up to isomorphism" diagram. We show that this kind of internal categorial invariance is a phenomena of a local categorial symmetry under an Internal Catergorial Symmetry group $ICS(\mathbb{N})$ of all local enfdofunctorial transformations. Then we establish the relationships between this local internal symmetry and global general symmetry between n-dimensional levels (the comma categories obtained from a PSC category $\textbf{C}$) . We show that if a base category $\textbf{C}$ is a PSC, then all its ne-dimensional levels are PSC as well.</description>

      <title>Steady Flow of Natural Gas in Pipeline Networks via Solution of a Nonlinear Differential-Algebraic System of Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the consideration of steady-state flow of gas in pipeline networks, the exclusion of gravity and nonlinear inertial effects (convective acceleration) leads to a fortuitous simplification in the governing equations to yield a system of nonlinear algebraic equations. Consequently, there are no studies that quantify the effect of gravity and inertial effects on the flow of gas in pipeline networks or delineate regimes of flow conditions wherein the effects are significant or negligible. In addressing this need, we consider the steady-state flow equations in pipeline networks without neglecting the gravitational and inertial terms and in place of a system of algebraic equations (one for each pipe), this approach results in a nonlinear system of first-order ordinary differential equations (ODEs) which are coupled through algebraic equations that appear in the form of boundary conditions on the pressure and balance of mass flows at either end. One of our main contributions in this article is to demonstrate how the Newton-Raphson algorithm can still be used to solve the coupled nonlinear differential-algebraic system by utilizing the appropriate forward sensitivity ODEs to evaluate the Jacobian terms arising in the iterative scheme. We also propose a variable transformation that alleviates the poor scaling of the ODE, and we introduce a two-point collocation scheme as a coarse approximation of the system from which to find initial guesses for the Newton iterations. Simulation studies were conducted for a single pipe as well as a large-scale pipeline network with real data. From these studies, we concluded that while the effect of gravity is important, the inertial effect was negligible in all cases. The proposed methodology is applicable to a wide class of pipeline and thermal-fluid networks beyond natural gas, including liquid pipelines and hydrogen transport.</description>

      <title>On admissible pairs of aggregation functions based on quasi-linear means and related families</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15928v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Admissible orders play a key role in ranking subintervals of the unit interval. In 2013, Bustince et al. proposed constructing such relations by means of admissible pairs of aggregation functions. The only significant example in the literature is a pair of weighted arithmetic means with different weights. In this paper, we present a method for constructing admissible pairs of aggregation functions, which allows us to verify the admissibility of various function classes, including quasi-linear means, Archimedean t-norms (and t-conorms), and certain strictly Schur-convex (or Schur-concave) functions. Furthermore, we examine the relationship between admissible orders generated by admissible pairs of aggregation functions and the ({\alpha}, \b{eta})-order, identifying cases where these two notions do not coincide.</description>
