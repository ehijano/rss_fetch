      <title>Dispersion relation for hadronic light-by-light scattering: subleading contributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present an evaluation of subleading effects in the hadronic light-by-light contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon. Using a recently derived optimized basis, we first study the matching of axial-vector contributions to short-distance constraints at the level of the scalar basis functions, finding that also the tails of the pseudoscalar poles and tensor mesons play a role. We then develop a matching strategy that allows for a combined evaluation of axial-vector and short-distance constraints, supplemented by an estimate of tensor-meson contributions based on simplified assumptions for their transition form factors. Uncertainties are primarily propagated from the axial-vector transition form factors and the variation of the matching scale, but we also consider estimates of the low-energy effect of hadronic states not explicitly included. In total, we obtain $a_\mu^\text{HLbL}\big|_\text{subleading}=33.2(7.2)\times 10^{-11}$, which in combination with previously evaluated contributions in the dispersive approach leads to $a_\mu^\text{HLbL}\big|_\text{total}=101.9(7.9)\times 10^{-11}$.</description>

      <title>Extra dimensional axion patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study for the first time the $\textit{complete}$ parameter space of a bulk extra-dimensional axion. We find novel regimes where no single KK mode is produced along the canonical QCD axion line, and instead, it is maximally deviated along with several other axions that constitute a multiple solution to the strong CP problem. In the most common extra-dimensional models, namely for flat and curved Randall-Sundrum scenarios, and assuming that all Peccei-Quinn breaking comes from QCD, we find that these solutions are however subject to tight phenomenological constraints. In light of these results, only one -- canonical -- pattern can be expected from a bulk axion in one or more extra spacetime dimensions. As a byproduct, we generalize the axions eigenvalue and eigenvector equations for an arbitrary number of spacetime dimensions and compactifications.</description>

      <title>Strong Constraints on Dark Photon and Scalar Dark Matter Decay from INTEGRAL and AMS-02</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the decay of bosonic dark matter with masses between 1 MeV and 2 TeV into Standard Model final states. We specifically focus on dark photons that kinetically mix with the Standard Model, as well as scalar dark matter models that have Yukawa couplings with the Standard Model. Using INTEGRAL and AMS-02 data, we constrain the dark matter decay lifetime into final states that include photons or positrons, setting strong constraints on the dark matter lifetime that reach 10$^{25}$ s for dark matter below 10 GeV and up to 10$^{29}$ s for dark matter above 10 GeV.</description>

      <title>Conformal Freeze-In from Neutrino Portal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a scenario where a dark sector, described by a Conformal Field Theory (CFT), interacts with the Standard Model through the neutrino portal. In this setup, conformal invariance breaks below the electroweak scale, causing the theory to transition into a confined (hadronic) phase. One of the hadronic excitations in this phase can act as dark matter. In the "Conformal Freeze-In" cosmological framework, the dark sector is populated through interactions with the Standard Model at temperatures where it retains approximate conformal symmetry. The dark matter relic density depends on the CFT parameters, such as the dimension of the operator coupled to the Standard Model. We demonstrate that this model can reproduce the DM relic density and meet all observational constraints. The same neutrino portal interaction may also generate masses for the active neutrinos. The dark matter candidate could either be a pseudo-Goldstone boson (PGB) or a composite fermion with the quantum numbers of a sterile neutrino. In the latter case, the model is consistent with the current X-ray constraints, and may be detectable with future X-ray observations.</description>

      <title>A complete dispersive evaluation of hadronic light-by-light scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hadronic light-by-light scattering (HLbL) defines one of the critical contributions in the Standard-Model prediction of the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon. In this work, we present a complete evaluation using a dispersive formalism, in which the HLbL tensor is reconstructed from its discontinuities, expressed in terms of simpler hadronic matrix elements that can be extracted from experiment. Profiting from recent developments in the determination of axial-vector transition form factors, short-distance constraints for the HLbL tensor, and the vector-vector-axial-vector correlator, we obtain $a_\mu^\text{HLbL}=101.9(7.9)\times 10^{-11}$, which meets the precision requirements set by the final result of the Fermilab experiment.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous CP Violation and Flavor Changing Neutral Currents in Minimal SO(10)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore spontaneous CP violation (SCPV) in the minimal non-supersymmetric SO(10) grand unified theory (GUT), with a scalar sector comprising a CP-even $45_H$, a $126_H$, and a complex $10_H$. All renormalizable couplings are real due to CP symmetry, and the Kobayashi-Maskawa phase arises solely from complex electroweak vacuum expectation values. The model requires an additional Higgs doublet fine-tuned below 500 GeV and constrains new Yukawa couplings, linking certain flavor-violating (FV) processes. Future proton decay observations may reveal correlated FV decay ratios, offering insights into minimal SO(10).</description>

Abstract: The light, strange baryons have been studied through various approaches and attempted to be looked for rigorously in experiments. The screened potential has been applied to heavy baryon sector as well as meson systems in earlier works. Here, this article attempts to compare the results for linear and screened potential for light strange baryons. Also, the Regge trajectories depict the linear nature.</description>

      <title>The impact of LHC precision measurements of inclusive jet and dijet production on the CTEQ-TEA global PDF fit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the impact of new LHC inclusive jet and dijet measurements on parton distribution functions (PDFs) that describe the proton structure, with a particular focus on the gluon distribution at large momentum fraction, $x$, and the corresponding partonic luminosities. We assess constraints from these datasets using next-to-next-to-leading-order (NNLO) theoretical predictions, accounting for a range of uncertainties from scale dependence and numerical integration. From the scale choices available for the calculations, our analysis shows that the central predictions for inclusive jet production show a smaller scale dependence than dijet production. We examine the relative constraints on the gluon distribution provided by the inclusive jet and dijet distributions and also explore the phenomenological implications for inclusive $H$, $t\bar{t}$, and $t\bar{t}H$ production at the LHC at 14 TeV.</description>

      <title>A Non-linear Representation of General Scalar Extensions of the Standard Model for HEFT Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a non-linear representation of ultraviolet~(UV) complete model, $U$ representation, under which matching HEFT to general scalar extensions of the standard model is straightforward. The main idea is to express a scalar multiplet in its linear form rotated by $U$ matrices, where $U$ matrix is exponential form of Goldstones based on Pauli matrices and meanwhile is a special $SU(2)_L$ rotation. All together the doublet is expressed in $U$ matrix multiplying a doublet column or bidoublet matrix, which is composed of physical Higgs. We show a complete matching between HEFT and real triplet extension. Meanwhile, under tensor notation, we give $U$ representation for general scalar extensions.</description>

      <title>Helicity correlation of neighboring dihadron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spin correlation of final-state hadrons provides a novel platform to explore the hadronization mechanism of polarized partons in unpolarized high-energy collisions. In this work, we investigate the helicity correlation of two hadrons originating from the same single parton. The production of such a dihadron system is formally described by the interference dihadron fragmentation function, in which the helicity correlation between the two hadrons arise from both the long-distance nonperturbative physics and the perturbative QCD evolution. Beyond the extraction of the dihadron fragmentation function, we demonstrate that it is also a sensitive observable to the longitudinal spin transfer, characterized by the single hadron fragmentation function $G_{1L}$. This intriguing connection opens up new opportunities for understanding the spin dynamics of hadronization and provides a complementary approach to corresponding studies using polarized beams and targets.</description>

      <title>Impact of nonextensivity on the transport coefficients of strongly interacting QCD matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tsallis nonextensive statistics is applied to study the transport coefficients of strongly interacting matter within the Polyakov chiral SU(3) quark mean field model (PCQMF). Nonextensivity is introduced within the PCQMF model through a dimensionless $q$ parameter to examine the viscous properties such as shear viscosity ($\eta$), bulk viscosity ($\zeta_b$), and conductive properties, including electrical conductivity ($\sigma_{el}$) and thermal conductivity ($\kappa$). Additionally, some key thermodynamic quantities relevant to the transport coefficients, like the speed of sound ($c_{sq}^2$) and specific heat at constant volume ($c_{vq}$), are calculated. The temperature dependence of the transport coefficients is explored through a kinetic theory approach with the relaxation time approximation. The results are compared to the extensive case where $q$ approaches 1. The nonextensive $q$ parameter is found to have a significant effect on all transport coefficients. We find that the nonextensive behaviour of the medium enhances both specific shear viscosity $\eta/s_q$ as well as conductive coefficients $\sigma_{el}/T$ and $\kappa/T^2$. In contrast, the normalised bulk viscosity $\zeta_b/s_q$ is found to decrease as the nonextensivity of the medium increases. We have also studied the transport coefficients for finite values of chemical potentials. The magnitude of $\eta$, $\sigma_{el}$, and $\kappa$ increases at lower temperatures while $\zeta$ is found to decrease for systems with non-zero chemical potential.</description>

      <title>Extension of the integrated HydroKinetic Model to BES RHIC and GSI-FAIR nuclear collision energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The work presented is devoted to developing the integrated hydrokinetic approach (iHKM) for relativistic nucleus-nucleus collisions. While the previous cycle of works on this topic focused on ultra-relativistic collisions at the top RHIC and different LHC energies, the current work addresses relativistic collisions at lower energies, specifically ranging from approximately 1 to 50 GeV per nucleon pair in the center-of-mass colliding system. The formation times for the initial state of dense matter in such collisions can be up to three orders of magnitude longer than those in ultra-relativistic collisions. This reflects a fundamentally different nature and formation process, particularly concerning the possible stages of initial state evolution, including thermalization (which may be only partial at very low collision energies), subsequent hydrodynamic expansion, and the final transition of matter evolution into a hadronic cascade. These stages, which are fully realized in ultra-relativistic reactions, can also occur within the energy range of BES RHIC, albeit with distinct time scales. This publication not only advances the theoretical development of iHKM (referred to, if necessary, as the extended version of integrated Hydrokinetic Model, iHKMe), but also provides examples of model applications for calculating observables. A systematic description across a wide range of experimental energies, which is preliminary yet quite satisfactory, for spectra, flow, and femtoscopy, will follow this work.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Under the assumption that the various evidences of a `95 GeV' excess, seen in data at the Large Electron Positron (LEP) collider as well as the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), correspond to actual signals of new physics Beyond the Standard Model (BSM), we characterise the underlying particle explaining these in terms of its Charge/Parity (CP) quantum numbers in a model independent way. In doing so, we assume the new object having spin-0 and test the CP-even (scalar) and CP-odd (pseudoscalar) hypotheses as well superpositions of these in its $\tau^+\tau^-$ decays. We prove that the High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) will be in a position to disentangle the CP nature of such a new particle.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the form factors of $B_c\rightarrow D^{(*)}$, $D_{s}^{(*)}$ and their nonleptonic decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article is devoted to calculating the form factors of $B_c \to D^{*}$, $B_c \to D$, $B_c \to D_s^{*}$ and $B_c \to D_s$ transitions in the framework of three-point QCD sum rules. In QCD side the vacuum condensates up to 6-dimension are taken into account. With the obtained form factors, the decay widths and branching ratios of several two-body nonleptonic decay processes $B_c \to \eta_c D^{*}$, $\eta_c D$, $ J/\psi D^{*}$, $ J/\psi D$, $\eta_c D_s^{*}$, $\eta_c D_s$, $J/\psi D_s^{*}$ and $J/\psi D_s$ are predicted. These results about the form factors and decay properties of $B_c$ meson provide useful information for us to study the heavy-quark dynamics.</description>

      <title>Correlating EDMs and $A\to \gamma\gamma$ in the 2HDM in light of the diphoton excesses at 95 GeV and 152 GeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the correlations between Higgs decays to photons and electric dipole moments (EDMs) in the CP-violating flavor-aligned two-Higgs-doublet model (2HDM). It is convenient to work in the Higgs basis $\{H_1,H_2\}$ where only the first Higgs doublet field $H_1$ acquires a vacuum expectation value. In light of the LHC Higgs data, which agree well with Standard Model (SM) predictions, it follows that the parameters of the 2HDM are consistent with the Higgs alignment limit. In this parameter regime, the observed SM-like Higgs boson resides almost entirely in ${H}_1$, and the other two physical neutral scalars, which reside almost entirely in ${H}_2$, are approximate eigenstates of CP (denoted by the CP-even $H$ and the CP-odd $A$). In the Higgs basis, the scalar potential term $\bar{Z}_7 {H}_1^\dagger {H}_2 {H}_2^\dagger {H}_2+{\rm h.c.}$ governs the charged-Higgs loop contributions to the decay of $H$ and $A$ to photons. If $\Re \bar{Z}_7 \Im\ \bar{Z}_7 \neq 0$, then CP-violating effects are present and allow for an $H^+ H^- A$ coupling, which can yield a sizable branching ratio for $A\to\gamma\gamma$. These CP-violating effects also generate non-zero EDMs for the electron, the neutron and the proton. We examine these correlations for the cases of $m_{A}=95$ GeV and $m_{A}=152$ GeV where interesting excesses in the diphoton spectrum have been observed at the LHC. These excesses can be explained via the decay of $A$ while being consistent with the experimental bound for the electron EDM in regions of parameter space that can be tested with future neutron and proton EDM measurements. This allows for the interesting possibility where the 95 GeV diphoton excess can be identified with $A$, while $m_H\simeq 98$ GeV can account for the best fit to the LEP excess in $e^+e^-\to ZH$ with $H\to b\bar b$.</description>

      <title>Quantum thermalization of Quark-Gluon Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The thermalization of quark gluon plasma created in relativistic heavy-ion collisions is a crucial theoretical question in understanding the onset of hydrodynamics, and in a broad sense, a key step to the exploration of thermalization in isolated quantum systems. Addressing this problem theoretically, in a first principle manner, requires a real-time, non-perturbative method. To this end, we carry out a fully quantum simulation on a classical hardware, of a massive Schwinger model, which well mimics QCD as it shares the important properties such as confinement and chiral symmetry breaking. We focus on the real-time evolution of the Wigner function, namely, the two-point correlation function, which approximates quark momentum distribution. In the context of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis and the evolution of entropy, our solution reveals the emergence of quantum thermalization in quark-gluon plasma with a strong coupling constant, while thermalization fails progressively as a consequence of the gradually increased significance of quantum many-body scar states in a more weakly coupled system. More importantly, we observe the non-trivial role of the topological vacuum in thermalization, as the thermalization properties differ dramatically in the parity-even and parity-odd components of the Wigner function.</description>

      <title>Angular modulation of nonlinear Breit-Wheeler yield by vacuum dichroism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vacuum polarization is numerically investigated for the interaction between a GeV electron beam and a counterpropagating ultraintense laser pulse in the quantum radiation dominated-regime (QRDR). We identify a signal of vacuum polarization in pair density using a straightforward one-stage setup, circumventing the challenge of preparations of highly polarized probe photons or precise measurements of photon polarization. In our scheme, most electrons are scattered in the direction of laser propagation while emitting substantial linearly polarized gamma photons. These photons undergo vacuum birefringence and dichroism before decaying into electron-positron pairs via the nonlinear Breit-Wheeler process. We demonstrate that vacuum dichroism enhances the purity of linear polarization, which suppresses the overall yield of electron-positron pairs and allows energetic photons to penetrate deeper into the laser pulse. The pairs produced by these energetic photons are more likely to be deflected into small-angle regions rather than being reflected, leading to an enhancement of pair yield in forward scattering. The difference in positron yield may have potential applications in measuring vacuum polarization effect in future laser-particle experiments.</description>

      <title>Plasmon-polaritons on a single electron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The explicit expression for the photon polarization operator in the presence of a single electron is found in the $in$-$in$ formalism in the one-loop approximation out of the photon mass-shell. This polarization operator describes the dielectric permittivity of a single electron wave packet in coherent scattering processes. The plasmons and plasmon-polaritons supported by a single electron wave packet are described. The two limiting cases are considered: the wavelength of the external electromagnetic field is much smaller than the typical scale of variations of the electron wave packet and the wavelength of the external electromagnetic field is much larger than the size of the electron wave packet. In the former case, there are eight independent plasmon-polariton modes. In the latter case, the plasmons boil down to the dynamical dipole moment attached to a point electron. Thus, in the infrared limit, the electron possesses a dynamical electric dipole moment manifesting itself in coherent scattering processes.</description>

      <title>Neutrino Diffusion within Dark Matter Spikes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-messenger observations of astrophysical transients provide powerful probes of the underlying physics of the source as well as beyond the Standard Model effects. We explore transients that can occur in the vicinity of supermassive black holes at the center of galaxies, including tidal disruption events (TDEs), certain types of blazars, or even supernovae. In such environments, the dark matter (DM) density can be extremely high, resembling a dense spike or core. We study a novel effect of neutrino diffusion sustained via frequent scatterings off DM particles in these regions. We show that for transients occurring within DM spikes or cores, the DM-neutrino scattering can delay the arrival of neutrinos with respect to photons, but this also comes with a suppression of the neutrino flux and energy loss. We apply these effects to the specific example of TDEs, and demonstrate that currently unconstrained parameter space of DM-neutrino interactions can account for the sizable $O$(days) delay of the tentative high-energy neutrinos observed from some TDEs.</description>

      <title>Transverse densities of the energy-momentum tensor and the gravitational form factors the pion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present general features of the transverse densities of the stress-energy-momentum tensor $\Theta^{\mu\nu}$ in the pion. We show positivity of the transverse density of $\Theta^{++}$ (analogous to the positivity of the transverse density of the electromagnetic current $J^+$) and discuss its consequences in conjunction with analyticity and quark-hadron duality, as well as the connection to $\pi\pi$ scattering at low energies. Our analysis takes into account the perturbative QCD effects, dominating at high momenta (or low transverse coordinate $b$), the effects of Chiral Perturbation Theory, dominating at low momenta (high $b$), and meson dominance in the intermediate region. We incorporate constraints form analyticity, leading to sum rules for the spectral densities of the corresponding form factors, which {\em i.a.} are relevant for the high-momentum (or the low-$b$) asymptotics. With the obtained high- and low-$b$ behavior, we deduce that the scalar (trace-anomaly) gravitational transverse density $\Theta^{\mu}_\mu(b)$ must change sign, unlike the case of the positive definite $J^+(b)$ or $\Theta^{++}(b)$. We also discuss the transverse pressure in the pion, which is positive and singular at low $b$, and negative at high $b$, in harmony with the stability criterion. The results for the form factors for space-like momenta are compared to the recent lattice QCD data.</description>

      <title>Non-Perturbative Contributions to Low Transverse Momentum Drell-Yan Pair Production Using the Parton Branching Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The non-perturbative processes - the internal transverse motion of partons inside hadrons, which gives rise to their intrinsic transverse momentum (intrinsic-kT) - and multiple soft gluon emissions that need to be resummed, are dominant contributions to the low transverse momentum of the Drell-Yan (DY) pair cross section. Therefore, this part of the DY spectra serves as a powerful tool for a better understanding of such processes, which is the focus of the study presented here. The study is conducted using the Parton Branching Method, which describes Transverse Momentum Dependent (TMD) Parton Densitity Functions (PDF) and provides a very precise description of DY pair transverse momentum distributions across a wide range of collision energies and pair invariant masses. In contrast to the energy dependence of intrinsic kT observed in shower-based Monte Carlo event generators, the CASCADE3 event generator - based on the Parton Branching Method - has provided an intrinsic-kT distribution that is independent of the center of mass energy. Further studies conducted within the Parton Branching Method have sought to understand the origin of this energy dependence, indicating that the dependence is mainly a consequence of the interplay between two main processes: internal transverse motion and soft gluon emission. The latter has been reduced in shower-based event generators, primarily due to the non-perturbative Sudakov form factor, which is often neglected. Since the Sudakov form factor depends on the evolution scale, this paper explores this dependence through the interplay of the two processes and attempts to explain it. Additionally, since QED final state radiation affects the profile of the DY pair transverse momentum distribution, we investigate its impact in both the high and low DY pair invariant mass regions.</description>

      <title>On the Square Speed of Sound in High-Energy Collisions: Range of Values and How to Understand It</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: After reviewing the sound speeds in various forms and conditions of matter, we investigate the sound speed of hadronic matter that has decoupled from the hot and dense system formed during high-energy collisions. We comprehensively consider factors such as energy loss of the incident beam, rapidity shift of leading nucleons, and the Landau hydrodynamic model for hadron production. The sound speed is related to the width or standard deviation of the Gaussian rapidity distribution of hadrons. The extracted square speed of sound lies within a range from 0 to 1/3 in most cases. For scenarios exceeding this limit, we also provide an explanation.</description>

Abstract: This work presents an asymmetric dark matter model with relic density determined by the freeze-out of asymmetric semi-annihilations into long-lived particles slowly decaying into the standard model. We carefully consider the $CPT$ symmetry and unitarity constraints to the asymmetries entering the Boltzmann equation, pointing out a critical inconsistency in the previous literature.</description>

      <title>Associated production of $J/{\psi}$ and direct photon in the NRQCD and the ICEM using the high-energy factorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the associated $J/{\psi}$ and direct photon production in the high-energy factorization, as it is formulated in the parton Reggeization approach, using two different models for the hadronization of a heavy quark-antiquark pair into a heavy quarkonium, namely the non-relativistic quantum chromodynamics (NRQCD) and the improved color evaporation model (ICEM). We find essential differences in the predictions for cross-section and transverse momenta spectra obtained using the NRQCD and the ICEM, which can be used to discriminate between these models. Our prediction for cross-sections of the associated $J/{\psi}$ and direct photon production at the LHC energies slightly overestimates the results obtained early in the next-to-leading order (NLO) calculation in the collinear parton model (CPM). We predict different two-particle correlation spectra in the associated $J/{\psi}$ and direct photon production which may be of interest for experimental study.</description>

      <title>Linear Standard Model extensions in the SMEFT at one loop and Tera-Z</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Linear Standard Model (SM) extensions, defined as new particles that can couple linearly to SM fields, form a motivated and finite set of simplified models for exploring phenomenology Beyond the SM (BSM). Heavy BSM particles may be integrated out to obtain their low-energy effects in the SM Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) parametrised by the Wilson coefficients of higher-dimensional operators. We compute and map the dimension-6 SMEFT operator structure of all scalar and fermion linear SM extensions up to one-loop order, thus extending the existing tree-level dictionary of results. Explicit analytic matching expressions for the Wilson coefficients are provided as both Python and Mathematica code in a GitHub repository accessible through links embedded in our main table for each coefficient and within a Python package. We apply our map to highlight the sensitivity to heavy new physics of a $Z$-pole run at a future Tera-$Z$ factory; at one loop, with unit couplings, all linear SM extensions can be indirectly probed by electroweak precision measurements up to $\mathcal{O}(10)$ TeV.</description>

      <title>Vector-Like Quarks at the LHC: A Unified Perspective from ATLAS and CMS Exclusion Limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present a comprehensive review of the most up-to-date exclusion limits on Vector-Like Quarks (VLQs) derived from ATLAS and CMS data at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Our analysis encompasses both pair and single production modes, systematically comparing results from the two collaborations to identify and employ the most stringent bounds at each mass point. We evaluate the excluded parameter space for VLQs under singlet, doublet, and triplet representations. For top-like VLQs ($T$), the exclusion limits rule out masses up to 1.49 TeV in singlet scenarios, while single production constrains the mixing parameter $\kappa$ to values below 0.26 at $m_T \sim 1.5$ TeV and up to 0.42 for $m_T \sim 2$ TeV. For bottom-like VLQs ($B$), the strongest exclusion limits from pair production exclude masses up to 1.52 TeV in doublet configurations, with single production constraining $\kappa$ values between 0.2 and 0.7 depending on the mass. For exotic VLQs, such as $X$ and $Y$, pair production excludes masses up to 1.46 TeV and 1.7 TeV, respectively. The constraints on $\kappa$ from these analyses become increasingly restrictive at higher masses, reflecting the enhanced sensitivity of single production channels in this regime. For $X$, $\kappa$ is constrained below 0.16 for masses between 0.8 and 1.6 TeV and further tightens to $\kappa &lt; 0.2$ as the mass approaches 1.8 TeV. Similarly, for $Y$, $\kappa$ values are constrained below 0.26 around $m_Y \sim 1.7$ TeV, with exclusions gradually relaxing at higher masses. These exclusion regions, derived from the most stringent LHC search results, offer a unified and up-to-date perspective on VLQ phenomenology. The results were computed using \texttt{VLQBounds}, a new Python-based tool specifically developed for this purpose.</description>

      <title>Bootstrapping leading hadronic muon anomaly</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00187v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We bootstrap the leading order hadronic contribution to muon anomalous magnetic moment. The leading hadronic contribution comes from the hadronic vacuum polarization function (HVP). We explore the bootstrap constraints, namely unitarity, analyticity, crossing symmetry and finite energy sum rules (FESR) from quantum chromodynamics (QCD). The unitarity appears as a positive semi-definite condition among the pion partial waves, form factor and spectral density function of HVP, which establishes a lower bound on leading order hadronic contribution to muon anomalous magnetic moment. We also impose chiral symmetry breaking to improve the bound slightly. By combining the lower bound with the remaining extensively calculated contributions, we achieve a bound on anomalous magnetic moment $a_\mu^\text{bootstrap-min}=11659176.3^{+3}_{-3}\times 10^{-10}$ and standard model prediction saturates this bound within the error bars. We also present a possible improvement that is saturated by both lattice computation and measured value within the error bars.</description>

      <title>Improving the performance of weak supervision searches using data augmentation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00198v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Weak supervision combines the advantages of training on real data with the ability to exploit signal properties. However, training a neural network using weak supervision often requires an excessive amount of signal data, which severely limits its practical applicability. In this study, we propose addressing this limitation through data augmentation, increasing the training data's size and diversity. Specifically, we focus on physics-inspired data augmentation methods, such as $p_{\text{T}}$ smearing and jet rotation. Our results demonstrate that data augmentation can significantly enhance the performance of weak supervision, enabling neural networks to learn efficiently from substantially less data.</description>

      <title>More on scattering processes of dressed particles with a time-dependent mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss the scattering process of a scalar field having a time-dependent mass with another scalar field having a constant mass as a toy model of the scattering problems during preheating after inflation. Despite a general difficulty of analytically solving such models, in our previous work [1], we considered an exactly calculable model of such scattering processes with a time-dependent mass of the form $m^2(t)\supset \mu^4t^2$ and the time-dependence never disappears formally. In this work, we discuss another exactly calculable model with a time-dependent mass that has a spike/peak but asymptotes to a constant, which effectively appears in the preheating model of Higgs inflation with a non-minimal coupling. Thanks to the localized time-dependence of the mass, the daughter particle number density behaves in a physically reasonable way contrary to the one in our previous model due to the infinite time-dependent mass in the asymptotic future. On the other hand, we find that the daughter particle experiences the kinematically forbidden process, which is a non-perturbative phenomenon found in our previous work. As in the previous model, the kinematically forbidden process produces daughter particles exponentially more than the parent particle having the time-dependent mass, which never happens for particle decay processes without time-dependent backgrounds. This result supports the existence of such a non-perturbative particle production process in general time-dependent backgrounds.</description>

      <title>Methodology for constraining ultralight vector bosons with gravitational wave searches targeting merger remnant black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultralight bosons are a hypothetical class of particles predicted under various extensions of Standard Model physics. As a result of the superradiance mechanism, we expect ultralight bosons, should they exist in certain mass ranges, to form macroscopic clouds around rotating black holes, so that we can probe their existence by looking for the long-transient gravitational wave emission produced by such clouds. In this paper, we propose a statistically robust framework for constraining the existence of ultralight vector bosons in the absence of detecting such a signal from searches targeting merger remnant black holes, effectively marginalizing over the uncertainties present in the properties of the target black holes. We also determine the impact of weak kinetic mixing with the ordinary photon and vector mass generation through a hidden Higgs mechanism on the constraining power of these searches. We find that individual follow-up searches, particularly with the next-generation gravitational wave detectors, can probe regions of parameter space for such models where robust constraints are still lacking.</description>

      <title>Impact of Sub-MeV Dark Matter on the Cooling of Pulsating White Dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00470v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In our galaxy, white dwarfs inevitably undergo scattering and capture processes with the interstellar diffuse dark matter. The captured dark matter forms a dark halo that eventually evaporates or annihilates. Theoretical pulsation modes and observations of pulsating white dwarfs provide predictions about their evolution. This motivates us to study the impact of sub-MeV interstellar dark matter on the cooling processes of white dwarfs. In this work, we consider the collisions between dark matter and relativistic degenerate electrons inside white dwarfs, numerically calculating the energy input and output results from scattering, capture, evaporation, and annihilation processes. Based on observational data from G117-B15, we conclude that the maximum cooling luminosity of the interstellar sub-MeV dark matter is approximately $10^{22} \, \text{erg}/\text{s}$, which is insufficient to provide an effective cooling mechanism for white dwarfs. Finally, if future observations detect a pulsating white dwarf in the Galactic center, the potential sensitivity of this scenario could extend to the region$10^{-3}\,\text{MeV} &lt; m_\chi &lt; 10 \, \text{MeV}$ and $6.02 \times 10^{-38}\,\text{cm}^2 &gt; \sigma_0 \geq 1.5 \times 10^{40} \, \text{cm}^2$.</description>

      <title>Spectra of magnetic fields from electroweak symmetry breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00641v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We characterize magnetic fields produced during electroweak symmetry breaking by non-dynamical numerical simulations based on the Kibble mechanism. The generated magnetic fields were thought to have an energy spectrum $\propto k^3$ for small wavenumbers $k$, but here we show that it is actually a spectrum $\propto k^4$ along with characteristic fluctuations in the magnetic helicity. Using scaling results from MHD simulations for the evolution and assuming that the initial magnetic field is coherent on the electroweak Hubble scale, we estimate the magnetic field strength to be $\sim 10^{-13}\, {\rm G}$ on kpc scales at the present epoch for non-helical fields. For maximally helical fields we obtain $\sim 10^{-10}\, {\rm G}$ on Mpc scales. We also give scalings of these estimates for partially helical fields.</description>

      <title>Quantum simulation of the phase transition of the massive Thirring model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid development of quantum computing technology has made it possible to study the thermodynamic properties of fermionic systems at finite temperatures through quantum simulations on a quantum computer. This provides a novel approach to the study of the chiral phase transition of fermionic systems. Among these, the quantum minimally entangled typical thermal states (QMETTS) algorithm has recently attracted considerable interest. The massive Thirring model, which exhibits a variety of phenomena at low temperatures, includes both a chiral phase transition and a topologically non-trivial ground state. It therefore raises the intriguing question of whether its phase transition can be studied using a quantum simulation approach. In this study, the chiral phase transition of the massive Thirring model and its dual topological phase transition are studied using the QMETTS algorithm. The results show that QMETTS is able to accurately reproduce the phase transition and thermodynamic properties of the massive Thirring model.</description>

      <title>Toward extracting scattering phase shift from integrated correlation functions III: coupled-channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The formalism developed in Refs.\cite{Guo:2023ecc,Guo:2024zal} that connects integrated correlation function of a trapped two-particle system to infinite volume scattering phase shift is further extended to coupled-channel systems in the present work. Using a trapped non-relativistic two-channel system as an example, a new relation is derived that retains the same structure as in the single channel, and has explicit dependence on the phase shifts in both channels but not on the inelasticity. The relation is illustrated by an exactly solvable coupled-channel quantum mechanical model with contact interactions. It is further validated by path integral Monte Carlo simulation of a quasi-one-dimensional model that can admit general interaction potentials. In all cases, we found rapid convergence to the infinite volume limit as the trap size is increased, even at short times, making it potentially a good candidate to overcome signal-to-noise issues in Monte Carlo applications.</description>

      <title>Meson spectroscopy in the $Sp(4)$ gauge theory with three antisymmetric fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the results of an extensive numerical study of the $Sp(4)$ lattice gauge theory with three (Dirac) flavors of fermion in the two-index antisymmetric representation. In the presence of (degenerate) fermion masses, the theory has an enhanced global $SU(6)$ symmetry, broken explicitly and spontaneously to its $SO(6)$ subgroup. This symmetry breaking pattern makes the theory interesting for applications in the context of composite Higgs models, as well as for the implementation of top partial compositeness. It can also provide a dynamical realisation of the strongly interacting massive particle paradigm for the origin of dark matter. We adopt the standard plaquette gauge action with the Wilson-Dirac formulation for the fermions and apply the (rational) hybrid Monte Carlo algorithm in our ensemble generation process. We monitor the autocorrelation and topology of the ensembles. We explore the bare parameter space, and identify the weak and strong coupling regimes separated by a line of first-order bulk phase transitions.
  We measure two-point correlation functions between meson operators that transform as non-trivial representations of $SO(6)$, and extract the ground-state masses and the decay constants, in all accessible spin and parity channels. In addition, we measure the mass of the first excited state for the vector meson by solving a generalised eigenvalue problem. Spectral quantities show a mass dependence that is compatible with the expectation that, at long distances, the theory undergoes confinement, accompanied by the spontaneous breaking of the approximate global symmetries acting on the matter fields. Finally, we discuss the continuum and massless extrapolations, after setting the physical scale using the gradient flow method, and compare the results to those of existing studies in the quenched approximation, as well as to the literature on closely related theories.</description>

      <title>Estimating the gravitational wave background anisotropy: a Bayesian approach boosted by cross-correlation angular power spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new method designed for Bayesian inference of the angular power spectrum of the Gravitational Wave Background (GWB) anisotropy. This scheme works with time-series data and can optionally incorporate the cross-correlations between the GWB anisotropy and other cosmological tracers, enhancing the significance of Bayesian inference. We employ the realistic LISA response and noise model to demonstrate the validity of this approach. The findings indicate that, without considering any cross-correlations, the 4-year LISA data is insufficient to achieve a significant detection of multipoles. However, if the anisotropies in the GWB are strongly correlated with the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), the 4-year data can provide unbiased estimates of the quadrupole moment ($\ell = 2$). This reconstruction process is generic and not restricted to any specific detector, offering a new framework for extracting anisotropies in the GWB data from various current and future gravitational wave observatories.</description>

      <title>A simultaneous explanation of XTE J1814-338 and HESS J1731-347 objects using ${K^{-}}$ and ${\bar{K^{0}}}$ condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent observation of the compact star XTE J1814-338 with a mass of $M=1.2^{+0.05}_{-0.05}~{\rm M_{\odot}}$ and a radius of $R=7^{+0.4}_{-0.4}$ km, together with the HESS J1731-347, which has a mass of $M=0.77^{+0.20}_{-0.17}~{\rm M_{\odot}}$ and a radius of $R=10.4^{+0.86}_{-0.78}$ km, they provide evidence for the possible presence of exotic matter in the core of neutron stars and significantly enhance our understanding of the equation of state for the dense nuclear matter. In the present srtudy, we investigate the possible existence of neutral anti-kaons and negative charged kaons in neutron stars by employing the Relativistic Mean Field model with first order kaonic (${K^{-}}$ and ${\bar{K^{0}}}$) condensates. To the best of our knowledge, this represents a first alternative attempt aimed to explain the bulk properties of the XTE J1814-338 object and at the same time the HESS J1731-347 object, using a mixture of kaons condensation in dense nuclear matter. In addition, we compare our analysis approach with the recent observation of PSR J0437-4715 and PSR J1231-1411 pulsars, proposing that to explain all objects simultaneously, it is essential to consider two distinct branches, each corresponding to a different composition of nuclear matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01535v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We determine the nucleon axial, scalar and tensor charges and the nucleon $\sigma$-terms using twisted mass fermions. We employ three ensembles with approximately equal physical volume of about 5.5~fm, three values of the lattice spacing, approximately 0.06~fm, 0.07~fm and 0.08~fm, and with the mass of the degenerate up and down, strange and charm quarks tuned to approximately their physical values. We compute both isovector and isoscalar charges and $\sigma$-terms and their flavor decomposition including the disconnected contributions. We use the Akaike Information Criterion to evaluate systematic errors due to excited states and the continuum extrapolation. For the nucleon isovector axial charge we find $g_A^{u-d}=1.250(24)$, in agreement with the experimental value. Moreover, we extract the nucleon $\sigma$-terms and find for the light quark content $\sigma_{\pi N}=41.9(8.1)$~MeV and for the strange $\sigma_{s}=30(17)$~MeV.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01740v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We apply an Internal Robustness (iR) analysis to the recently released Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) baryon acoustic oscillations dataset. This approach examines combinations of data subsets through a fully Bayesian model comparison, aiming to identify potential outliers, subsets possibly influenced by systematic errors, or hints of new physics. Using this approach, we identify three data points at $z= 0.295,\,0.51,\,0.71$ as potential outliers. Excluding these points improves the internal robustness of the dataset by minimizing statistical anomalies and enables the recovery of $\Lambda$CDM predictions with a best-fit value of $w_0 = -1.050 \pm 0.128$ and $w_a = 0.208 \pm 0.546$. These results raise the intriguing question of whether the identified outliers signal the presence of systematics or point towards new physics.</description>

Abstract: The Monte Carlo for lepton pair production and tau decays consist of KKMC for lepton pair production, tauola for tau lepton decays and photos for radiative corrections in decays.
  An effort for adaptation of the system for precision data to be collected at Belle II experiment lead to extension of phase space generation modules both in photos and tauola to enable decays and/or radiative corrections of additional light lepton pairs. The phase-space and matrix element parts of the programs are separated, that is why extension to processes where lepton pair is produced through narrow resonances, like dark photon, was straight forward.
  In the present version of tauola, list of tau decay channels is enriched with multitude of exotic ones, useful for searches of new physics. The hadronic currents parametrizations of main decay channels is prepared for basic simulation in the experiment. The basis for future work on precise fits of hadronic currents including Machine Learning is retained, but development of necessary software solutions is left for the forthcoming years.
  Presented programs versions are available in stand-alone format from gitlab or through the basf2 system of Belle II software. Official distribution web pages, documenting programs tests, are retained but not necessarily up to the date.</description>

Abstract: The anomalous magnetic moment of the tau lepton, a_tau = (g_tau - 2)/2, is a sensitive probe of new physics but is extremely difficult to measure precisely in contrast to electron and muon moments. The best experimental limits were set by the DELPHI collaboration more than 15 years ago in studies of the ditau production in the e+e -&gt; e+e+tau+tau process. Ultra-peripheral collisions (UPCs) of heavy ions at the LHC may provide a unique opportunity to improve the a_tau constraints in the studies of Pb+Pb -&gt; Pb+Pb+tau+tau process. We review recent proposals to study ditau production via semi-leptonic tau decays in Pb-Pb UPC with the available ATLAS and CMS data and discuss the feasibility to explore this process down to low transverse momenta of decay leptons with the ALICE and LHCb experiments.</description>

Abstract: The principle of maximum conformality (PMC) is used to remove uncertainties in the renormalization scale and scheme, thus eliminating unnecessary systematic errors for high-precision perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics (pQCD) predictions. In this work, we use PMC method to improve the determination of the decay width of the $W$ boson in hadrons by working on the corrections coming from pQCD theory at the four-loop level. In conventional scale setting, we find that the initial scaling dependence of the renormalization is small only at high correction orders, whereas in single-scale PMC method we obtain a scaling-independent initial result. Finally, the wide hadronic decay of $W$ is used for an indirect determination of the charm-strange mixing parameter.</description>

In the massless limit, we find that the thermal chiral phase transition is of the second order in the four-quark flavor system. In the case with the massive charm quark and the massless light and strange quarks, the order of the phase transition changes to the first order. This is due to the quark flavor symmetry breaking which is associated with the violation of the $U(1)$ axial symmetry. Once the light and strange quarks get massive, the explicit chiral symmetry breaking becomes eminent, then the crossover phase transition is realized at the physical quark masses. We also map the order of the phase transition on a phase diagram in the quark mass plane where the light- and strange-quark masses are degenerate but differ from the value of the charm quark mass. This phase diagram is an extension of the conventional Columbia plot to the four-quark flavor system. The critical exponents related to the chiral phase transition are also addressed.</description>

      <title>Differential torsion sensor for direct detection of ultralight vector dark matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08935v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultralight bosons with masses in the range from $\sim 10^{-22}$ eV/$c^2$ to $\sim 1$ eV/$c^2$, are well-motivated, wave-like dark matter candidates. Particles on the lower-mass end are less explored in experiments due to their vanishingly small mass and weak coupling to the Standard Model. We propose a sensor with dual torsion pendulums for the direct detection of U(1)$_{B\!-\!L}$ gauge boson dark matter, which can achieve an enhanced differential torque sensitivity in a frequency band of $\sim 10^{-2}$-$10$ Hz due to its advantages in common-mode rejection and differential angular sensitivity. We describe the design of the differential torsion sensor and present the estimated sensitivity to an ultralight dark matter field coupled to baryon minus lepton ($B\!-\!L$) number, in a mass range of $\sim 10^{-17}$-$10^{-13}$ eV/$c^2$. Given a setup with meter-scale torsion pendulum beams and kg-scale test masses, the projected constraints on the coupling constant $g_{B\!-\!L}$ can reach $\sim 10^{-27}$ for a boson mass of $\sim 10^{-15}$ eV/$c^2$.</description>

      <title>Large CP violation in charmed baryon decays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19166v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present novel and comprehensive numerical predictions of CP violation in antitriplet charmed baryon decays, which are the first of their kind. Larger-than-expected CP violations are found in the framework of final state re-scattering, similar in magnitude to those in $D^0 \to \pi^+\pi^- ,K^+K^-$. This makes it promising to observe CP violation for the first time in baryon decays and provides valuable tests for the Standard Model. Utilizing the $SU(3)_F$ symmetry and final state re-scattering, we relate the CKM-suppressed amplitudes to the leading ones, which are proportional to $\lambda_b$ and $\lambda_d$, respectively, with $\lambda_q = V_{uq}V^*_{cq}$. We find that re-scattering effects generate previously undetermined CKM-suppressed amplitudes and enhance CP violation by an order of magnitude, with $A_{CP} (\Xi_c^0 \to p K^-) - A_{CP} (\Xi_c^0 \to \Sigma^+ \pi^-)$ reaching a value as large as $-3.68 \cdot 10^{-3}$. This makes it promising to observe CP violation for the first time in baryon decays.</description>

      <title>Darker matter generating from the dark</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19431v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The non-detection of dark matter may be attributed to the dark matter residing in a darker hidden sector. We explore the possibility that a hidden sector produced through the freeze-in mechanism, can further generate an even more hidden sector via an additional freeze-in process. Such a two-step freeze-in process produces dark matter coupled weaker-than-ultraweakly to the standard model particles, and is thus referred to as the "darker matter". To illustrate the two-step freeze-in process, we study a model featuring two $U(1)$ hidden sectors. The first $U(1)$ sector is directly coupled to the standard model with feeble interactions, while the second $U(1)$ sector is directly coupled to the first $U(1)$ sector and thus only indirectly to the standard model, rendering it darker. Remarkably, darker matter candidates residing in the second darker $U(1)$ sector, generated from the two-step freeze-in process, can account for almost the entire observed dark matter relic density. The darker matter, interacted with standard model particles through ultraweak couplings, can exhibit velocity-dependent self-interacting cross-sections, which potentially provides an explanation for addressing problems associated with cosmic small-scale structures. Additionally, the dark photon darker matter residing in the darker hidden sector can be responsible for the galactic 511 keV photon signal, consistent with various dark matter density profiles.</description>

      <title>Light Higgs signal strengthes in the B-LSSM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01926v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There are two light Higgs bosons within the framework of the $B-L$ supersymmetric model (B-LSSM), where one of them corresponds to the observed 125 GeV Higgs, and the mass of the other one ranges from tens GeV to hundreds GeV. This study investigates two possible scenarios: 1, the lightest Higgs boson refers to the observed 125 GeV Higgs; 2, the lightest Higgs boson mass is around 95 GeV to account for the excesses observed in the diphoton and $b\bar b$ data, while the next-to lightest Higgs is the observed 125 GeV Higgs. The mixings between these two light Higgs states play important roles in explaining the light Higgs signal strengthes, which arise from the gauge kinetic mixing effect. And new bounds on the parameter space of the model are obtained by fitting the Higgs signal strengthes in the experimental $2\sigma$ intervals. In order to take into account the mixing effects and the light Higgs boson masses more precisely, we consider the two-loop effective potential corrections to the squared Higgs mass matrix in the calculations.</description>

      <title>Study of semileptonic $B\to DP\ell^+\nu_\ell$ decays based on the SU(3) flavor symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00372v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Decays $B\to DP\ell^+\nu_\ell~(\ell=e,\mu,\tau)$ with the non-resonance, the charmed vector resonances, the charmed scalar resonances and the charmed tensor resonances are calculated by using the SU(3) flavor symmetry. Firstly, the decay amplitudes of different modes are related by the SU(3) flavor symmetry. Then, relevant experiential data are used to constrain nonperturbative coefficients in the non-resonant and various resonant $B\to DP\ell^+\nu_\ell$ decays. Finally, using the constrained nonperturbative coefficients, the branching ratios of not-yet-measured $B\to D^*P\ell^+\nu_\ell$ decays with the non-resonant and various charmed resonant contributions are predicted. Many branching ratios are predicted for the first time. We find that $B\to D\eta'\ell^+\nu_\ell, B_s\to D_s\eta'\ell^+\nu_\ell$ decays only receive the non-resonant contributions, $B\to D_sK\ell^+\nu_\ell$, $B_s\to DK\ell^+\nu_\ell$, $B\to D\eta\ell^+\nu_\ell$ and $B_s\to D_s\eta\ell^+\nu_\ell$ decays receive both non-resonant and charmed tensor resonant contributions, $B^+\to D^-\pi^+\ell^+\nu_\ell$ decays receive the non-resonant, the charmed scalar resonant and the charmed tensor resonant contributions, and other $B\to D\pi\ell^+\nu_\ell$ decays receive all four kinds of contributions. These results can be used to test the SU(3) flavor symmetry approach in the four-body semileptonic decays by the future LHCb and Belle-II experiments.</description>

      <title>Probing axion-like particles in leptonic decays of heavy mesons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05298v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the possibility of finding the axion-like particles (ALPs) through the leptonic decays of heavy mesons. The Standard Model (SM) predictions of the branching ratios of the leptonic decays of heavy mesons are less than the corresponding experimental upper limits. This provides some room for the existence of decay channels, of which the ALP is one of the products. Three scenarios are considered: First, the ALP is only coupled to one single charged fermion, namely, the quark, the antiquark, or the charged lepton; second, the ALP is only coupled to quark and antiquark with the same strength; and third, the ALP is coupled to all the charged fermions with the same strength. The constraints of the coupling strength in different scenarios are obtained by comparing the experimental data of the branching ratios of leptonic decays of $B^-$, $D^+$, and $D_s^+$ mesons with the theoretical predictions achieved by using the Bethe-Salpeter (BS) method. These constraints are further applied to predict the upper limits of the leptonic decay processes of the $B_c^-$ meson in which the ALP participates.</description>

      <title>Constraining $|V_{cs}|$ and physics beyond the Standard Model from exclusive (semi)leptonic charm decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06145v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the available data on exclusive leptonic and semileptonic $c\to s\ell^+\nu$ decays within the Standard Model and beyond. Our analysis accounts for theory correlations between the relevant hadronic matrix elements through application of dispersive bounds. We find that, within a global analysis, the dispersive bounds are generally well respected and only mildly affect the extraction of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix element $|V_{cs}|$. Assuming Standard Model dynamics, we obtain $$
  |V_{cs}| = 0.957 \pm 0.003\,, $$ which is compatible with the HFLAV/PDG reference value $|V_{cs}| = 0.975 \pm 0.006$ at the $2.7\,\sigma$ level. Our findings lead to significant deficits in the second-row and second-column unitarity relations of the CKM matrix. Allowing for beyond the SM contributions in the Weak Effective Theory, we find very strong constraints on potential (pseudo)scalar and tensor effects. However, the data still permits sizeable CP-violating right-handed currents.</description>

      <title>Radiative symmetry breaking from the on-shell perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07437v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Models with classical scale symmetry, which feature radiative symmetry breaking, generically lead to a supercooled first-order phase transition in the early Universe resulting in a strong gravitational-wave signal, potentially observable by LISA. This is thanks to the absence of mass terms in the potential and the resulting logarithmic structure of the zero-temperature effective potential. It is known that imposing a symmetry at classical level does not prohibit breaking it by quantum corrections. In the case of scale symmetry, a mass term can in principle appear through renormalisation. This is not the case in the commonly used $\overline{\mathrm{MS}}$ or Coleman-Weinberg schemes. In this work, we renormalise a scale-invariant model in the on-shell scheme to check whether parameterising it with the physical masses will introduce mass terms to the potential. We find that indeed mass terms appear for an arbitrary choice of the physical masses. However, we formulate an on-shell condition for radiative symmetry breaking, sufficient and necessary for the cancellation of mass terms in the renormalised potential, yielding a logarithmic potential needed for supercooled phase transitions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08523v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the dilepton production rates from annihilation processes of charged pion pairs with modified pion dispersion relations in the inhomogeneous chiral condensed phase. We assume a dual chiral density wave as an inhomogeneous chiral condensate, and obtain the dispersion relations of the Nambu-Goldstone modes in the inhomogeneous chiral condensed phase. We use a low energy effective Lagrangian based on the O(4) symmetry which is expanded by the order parameter up to the sixth order. The obtained dispersion relations are anisotropic and quadratic for the momentum. We evaluate the electron-positron production rates by charged pion-pair annihilations as functions of an invariant mass using the obtained dispersion relations. Basically, the production rate in the inhomogeneous chiral condensed phase has a steeper overall slope with respect to an invariant mass than that in the homogeneous chiral condensed phase. Therefore, the production rate may be enhanced when the invariant mass is around twice the pion mass.</description>

      <title>A Phenomenological Analysis of LHC Neutrino Scattering at NLO Accuracy Matched to Parton Showers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09611v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform a detailed phenomenological study of high-energy neutrino deep inelastic scattering (DIS) focused on LHC far-forward experiments such as FASER$\nu$ and SND@LHC. To this aim, we parametrise the neutrino fluxes reaching these LHC far-forward experiments in terms of `neutrino PDFs' encoding their energy and rapidity dependence by means of the LHAPDF framework. We integrate these neutrino PDFs in the recently developed POWHEG-BOX-RES implementation of neutrino-induced DIS to produce predictions accurate at next-to-leading order (NLO) in the QCD coupling matched to parton showers (PS) with Pythia8. We present NLO+PS predictions for final-state distributions within the acceptance of FASER$\nu$ and SND@LHC as well as for two experiments of the proposed Forward Physics Facility (FPF), FASER$\nu$2 and FLArE. We quantify the impact of NLO QCD corrections, of the parton showering and hadronisation settings in Pythia8, of the QED shower, and of the incoming neutrino flavour for the description of these observables, and compare our predictions with the GENIE neutrino event generator. Our work demonstrates the relevance of modern higher-order event generators to achieve the key scientific targets of the LHC neutrino experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16061v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An extension of the xFitter open-source program for QCD analyses is presented, allowing for a polynomial parameterization of the dependence of physical observables on theoretical parameters. This extension enables simultaneous determination of parton distribution functions (PDFs) and new physics parameters within the framework of the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). The functionalities of the code are illustrated in a sensitivity study, where a simultaneous determination of the PDFs, top quark mass and the couplings of selected dimension-6 SMEFT operators is addressed using projections for measurements of top quark-antiquark pair production at the High-Luminosity LHC. The importance of considering all the correlations of the parton distributions, top quark mass and the EFT parameters in a simultaneous QCD+SMEFT analysis is demonstrated. This work serves as a new platform for simultaneous extraction of the PDFs and the SM/SMEFT parameters based on xFitter.</description>

Our results are compared with the predictions of the light-cone helicity formalism within the framework of SU(3) flavor symmetry. We observe a good agreement between the two approaches. The obtained multipole moments of tensor mesons provide deeper insights into their properties and better understanding of the strong and electromagnetic decay channels of these mesons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16044v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given the absence of a definitive top-down indication for understanding the peculiar structure of the lepton sector, discrete flavor symmetries offer a profound perspective for examining the intricate patterns of lepton masses and mixings. In this work, drawing upon previous studies on the interplay of flavor symmetries with the potential UV completions from a purely bottom-up perspective, three well-motivated discrete flavor groups, suitable for portraying the leptonic sector as well as the neutrino masses, specifically $A_4$, $A_5$ and $S_4$, are explored within this framework, leading to the comprehensive classification of the NP mediators, along with the tree-level matching relations onto dimension-6 SMEFT operators. Particular emphasis is placed on the discrete leptonic directions, for which a phenomenological analysis is carried out in order to constrain various NP mediators, where significant focus is directed towards the examination of the cLFV operators, which, for the wide range of applicable cases, offer the leading constraint.</description>

      <title>Small-$x$ gluon GPD constrained from deeply virtual $J/\psi$ production and gluon PDF through universal-moment parameterization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17231v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We phenomenologically constrain the small-$x$ and small-$\xi$ gluon generalized parton distributions (GPDs) with the deeply virtual $J/\psi$ production (DV$J/\psi$P) in the framework of GPDs through universal moment parameterization (GUMP). We use a hybrid cross-section formula combining collinear factorization to the next-to-leading order (NLO) accuracy of the strong coupling $\alpha_s$, with corrections from non-relativistic QCD to account for the power corrections due to the heavy $J/\psi$ mass. We reach reasonable fit to the measured differential cross-sections of DV$J/\psi$P by H1 at Hadron-Electron Ring Accelerator (HERA) as well as forward gluon PDFs from JAM22 global analysis. We find that both NLO and non-relativistic corrections are significant for heavy vector meson productions. Of course, the gluon GPD we obtain still contain considerable freedom in need of inputs from other constraints, particularly in the distribution-amplitude-like region.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic radiation from scalar and axion fields: distinguishability and detectability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17186v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we analyze the characteristics of electromagnetic (EM) radiation associated with scalar and axion field oscillations in different background field setups. Because the scalar field and axion field have different parity and couple with the EM field in different forms, the EM signals generated by the scalar and axion can be used to distinguish them. More interestingly, resonance effects amplify the difference between the two fields and consequent EM signal strength, which helps us distinguish and detect them in future observations.</description>

      <title>Hadron production in the charged current semi-inclusive deeply inelastic scattering of $N=Z$ nuclei</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18080v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The charged current weak interaction can distinguish quark flavors, it provides a valid method to determine (transverse momentum dependent) parton distribution functions in high energy reactions by utilizing tagged hadrons. In this paper, we calculate the charged current semi-inclusive deeply inelastic neutrino and anti-neutrino scattering of $N=Z$ nuclei. Semi-inclusive means that a spin-1 hadron is also measured in addition to the scattered charged lepton. The target nucleus has the same number of neutrons and protons and is assumed as unpolarized. According to calculations, we find that only chiral-even terms survive and chiral-odd terms vanish in the differential cross section for this charged current deeply inelastic (anti-)neutrino nucleus scattering process. Furthermore, we introduce a universal measurable quantity, the yield asymmetry of the produced hadron $A^h$, to determine the muclear transverse momentum dependent parton distribution functions. Numerical estimates show that the yield asymmetry is independent of the type of target nucleus if it has the same number of neutrons and protons. Numerical estimates also show that the isospin symmetry works very successfully in the $N=Z$ nuclei and sea quark distribution functions and disfavored fragmentation functions have significant influence on measurable quantities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18869v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We implement a variational quantum algorithm to investigate the chiral condensate in a 1+1 dimensional SU(2) non-Abelian gauge theory. The algorithm is evaluated using a proposed Monte Carlo sampling method, which allows the extension to large qubit systems. The obtained results through quantum simulations on classical and actual quantum hardware are in good agreement with exact diagonalization of the lattice Hamiltonian, revealing the phenomena of chiral symmetry breaking and restoration as functions of both temperature and chemical potential. Our findings underscore the potential of near-term quantum computing for exploring QCD systems at finite temperature and density in non-Abelian gauge theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2112.09123v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We obtain the full-color four-loop three-point form factor of the stress-tensor supermultiplet in N=4 SYM, based on the color-kinematics (CK) duality and generalized unitarity method. The CK-dual solution, while manifesting all dual Jacobi relations and satisfying the minimal power-counting of loop momenta, lies in a 133-dimensional solution space. We also show that the planar form factor integrand satisfies precisely a directional dual conformal symmetry in the lightlike limit of the operator momentum, which is supported by explicit four-loop calculations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.02410v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We bootstrap the symbol of the maximal-helicity-violating four-particle form factor for the chiral part of the stress-tensor supermultiplet in planar $\mathcal{N}=4$ super-Yang-Mills theory at two loops. When minimally normalized, this symbol involves only 34 letters and obeys the extended Steinmann relations in all partially-overlapping three-particle momentum channels. In addition, the remainder function for this form factor exhibits an antipodal self-duality: it is invariant under the combined operation of the antipodal map defined on multiple polylogarithms -- which reverses the order of the symbol letters -- and a simple kinematic map. This self-duality holds on a four-dimensional parity-preserving kinematic hypersurface. It implies the antipodal duality recently noticed between the three-particle form factor and the six-particle amplitude in this theory.</description>

      <title>Modified Kerr black holes surrounded by dark matter spike</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.12896v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study supermassive black holes (SMBH), surrounded by a dark matter (DM) spike, that can be found at the centers of Milky Way and $\text{M87}$ galaxies and are accompanied by a specific kind of topological defect. The investigation is developed within the framework of Bumblebee Gravity with a global monopole (BGGM). The dark matter spike is described by a power-law density profile. Our main objective is to assess how the background arising from spontaneous Lorentz symmetry breaking and the presence of a global monopole influence the properties of the Kerr BH within the region affected by the spike. Using a spherically symmetric static BH with BGGM properties as the seed metric, we construct a non-rotating spacetime with a DM spike, resulting in a BGGM-motivated Schwarzschild-like BH by solving the modified Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations (TOV). Next, we extend this approach to the case of a rotating spacetime resulting in the BGGM-motivated Kerr-like BH (BGMKLBH). This approach allows us to explore the spacetime structure, and the BGMKLBH shadows. Then, using available observational data for the DM spike density and considering the effects of BGGM on $\text{Sgr A}^{*}$ and $\text{M87}^{*}$ SMBHs, we analyse the shapes of their shadows and put constraints on the BGGM parameter. Thus, we infer that the BGMKLBHs could be reliable candidates for the astrophysical BHs.</description>

      <title>Extended Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model for quark and nuclear matters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19331v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we extend the two-flavor Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model to one capable of exploring quark and nuclear matter consistently. With an extra term standing for quark-nucleon interactions, nucleons could automatically emerge as color-singlet three-quark entities by following a process similar to mesons. Besides the quark part in mean field approximation, both mesons and nucleons could contribute to the thermodynamic potential thus possibly give rise to quarkyonic matter beyond mean field. In the study, two kinds of "confining" couplings are adopted for the new interaction term and two different quark masses are considered for comparison. It turns out that only confined nuclear matter or deconfined quark matter is possible for all the cases at zero temperature, thus quarkyonic matter is not favored at all. Even more strictly, only the case with stronger confinement effect and a smaller quark mass admits a physical first-order phase transition from nuclear matter to quark matter around twice saturation density.</description>

      <title>Dilaton generation in propagation of magnetic dipole waves of pulsar in a galactic magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13070v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study is devoted to dilaton generation in propagation of magnetic dipole waves of pulsar in a galactic magnetic field. It is shown that in this process it's necessary to take into account the presence of a reflective index of matter distributed in the galaxy. According to obtained estimates influence of the gravitational field of pulsars and magnetars on radiation of magnetic dipole waves is negligible and tends to a small change of their amplitude, near about 1 per cent. That's why in this study one can neglect the impact of gravitational field on process of dilaton generation.
  Exact solution of the dilaton equation is found and angular distribution of dilaton radiation is obtained in propagation of magnetic dipole waves of pulsar in galactic magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Vavilov-Cherenkov radiation for parallel motion in three-dimensional topological insulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15906v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Our study delves into the modifications observed in Vavilov-Cherenkov radiation when its generating charged particle moves parallel to an interface formed by two generic magnetoelectric media, focusing on topological insulators. We compute the electromagnetic field through the Green's function. Applying the far-field approximation and the steepest descent method, we derive analytical expressions for the electric field, revealing contributions from spherical and lateral waves with topological origins. Subsequently, we analyze the angular distribution of the radiation, particularly focusing on parallel motions in close proximity to the interface. Our findings indicate that the radiation along the Vavilov-Cherenkov cone is inhomogeneous and asymmetric. We analyze the radiated energy at both sides of the interface. Finally, we discuss the particle's retarding force, which is notably enhanced in the ultrarelativistic regime. We illustrate these results for the topological insulator TlBiSe$_2$ and the magnetoelectric TbPO$_4$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04220v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the evolution of cosmological scalar perturbations in the case that the background radiation is weakly coupled to a light scalar field $\phi$. The light scalar $\phi$ is a homogeneous background field with a large initial value. In the radiation-dominated Universe, the coupling term introduces an effective mass to $\phi$ and the background ultra-relativistic particles. The oscillations of $\phi$ result in the periodic change of the equation of state parameter and the sound speed, which provides a novel mechanism to amplify subhorizon scalar perturbations through parametric resonance. The amplification of scalar perturbations leads to a stochastic gravitational-waves background~(SGWB) expected to be observed by multiband gravitational wave observers. The observation of the SGWB helps to determine the initial value of $\phi$ and the coupling strength of the interaction. This mechanism is generally applicable to the interactions that introduce an effective mass, and we take the interaction between $\phi$ and electrons as a concrete example to illustrate the result. We find that under the condition that the coupling coefficient $\lambda=10^{-16}$ and the initial value $\phi_i=10^{18}$ GeV, the resulting SGWB spectrum is expected to be observed by the future observers including LISA, $Taiji$, DECIGO and BBO.</description>

      <title>Extracting the symmetries of nonequilibrium quantum many-body systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17913v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Symmetries play a pivotal role in our understanding of the properties of quantum many-body systems. While there are theorems and a well-established toolbox for systems in thermal equilibrium, much less is known about the role of symmetries and their connection to dynamics out of equilibrium. This arises due to the direct link between a system's thermal state and its Hamiltonian, which is generally not the case for nonequilibrium dynamics. Here we present a pathway to identify the effective symmetries and to extract them from data in nonequilibrium quantum many-body systems. Our approach is based on exact relations between correlation functions involving different numbers of spatial points, which can be viewed as nonequilibrium versions of (equal-time) Ward identities encoding the symmetries of the system. We derive symmetry witnesses, which are particularly suitable for the analysis of measured or simulated data at different snapshots in time. To demonstrate the potential of the approach, we apply our method to numerical and experimental data for a spinor Bose gas. We investigate the important question of a dynamical restoration of an explicitly broken symmetry of the Hamiltonian by the initial state. Remarkably, it is found that effective symmetry restoration can occur long before the system equilibrates. We also use the approach to define and identify spontaneous symmetry breaking far from equilibrium, which is of great relevance for applications to nonequilibrium phase transitions. Our work opens new avenues for the classification and analysis of quantum as well as classical many-body dynamics in a large variety of systems, ranging from ultracold quantum gases to cosmology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15088v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An exact derivation of relativistic hydrodynamics from an underlying microscopic theory has been shown to be an all-order theory. From the relativistic transport equation of kinetic theory, the full expressions of hydrodynamic viscous fluxes have been derived which turn out to include all orders of out-of-equilibrium derivative corrections. It has been shown, that for maintaining causality, it is imperative that the temporal derivatives must include all orders, which can be resummed in non-local, relaxation operator-like forms and finally `integrated in' introducing newer degrees of freedom. The theory can of course be truncated at any higher spatial orders, but the power over the the infinite temporal sum increases correspondingly such that the causality is respected. As a result, the theory truncated at any higher order of spatial gradient, requires newer degrees of freedom for each increasing order.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16283v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A variety of high-energy events can take place in the seconds leading up to a binary neutron-star merger. Mechanisms involving tidal resonances, electrodynamic interactions, or shocks in mass-loaded wakes have been proposed as instigators of these precursors. With a view of gravitational-wave and multimessenger astrophysics more broadly, premerger observations and theory are reviewed emphasising how gamma-ray precursors and dynamical tides can constrain the neutron-star equation of state, thermodynamic microphysics, and evolutionary pathways. Connections to post-merger phenomena, notably gamma-ray bursts, are discussed together with how magnetic fields, spin and misalignment, crustal elasticity, and stratification gradients impact observables.</description>

Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) may have formed through the gravitational collapse of cosmological perturbations that were generated and stretched during the inflationary era, later entering the cosmological horizon during the decelerating phase, if their amplitudes were sufficiently large. In this review paper, we will briefly introduce the basic concept of PBHs and review the formation dynamics through this mechanism, the estimation of the initial spins of PBHs and the time evolution of type II fluctuations, with a focus on the radiation-dominated and (early) matter-dominated phases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14598v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the strong-interaction dynamics of a class of $4D$ chiral $SU(N)$ gauge theories with a fermion in a symmetric second-rank tensor representation and a number of fermions in an anti-antisymmetric tensor representation, extending the previous work on chiral gauge theories such as the Bars-Yankielowicz and the generalized Georgi-Glashow models. The main tool of our analysis is the anomalies obstructing the gauging of certain 1-form color-flavor-locked center symmetry, together with some flavor symmetries. The matching requirement for these mixed-anomalies strongly favors dynamical Higgs phases caused by bifermion condensate formation, against a confinement phase with no condensates and no symmetry breaking, or a confinement phase with multifermion color-singlet condensates only. Dynamical gauge symmetry breaking and the spontaneous breaking of a $U(1)$ symmetry caused by such condensates mean that the color-flavor-locked 1-form center symmetry itself is lost in the infrared. One is led to a solution, if not unique, which satisfies fully the conventional as well as the new, generalized 't Hooft anomaly matching requirements.</description>

      <title>Further support for $S_8$ increasing with effective redshift</title>

Abstract: In Adil et al. 2023, we reported an increasing trend in $S_8$ with effective redshift $z_{\textrm{eff}}$ based on $f \sigma_8(z)$ constraints over the redshift range $0 \lesssim z \lesssim 2$, and predicted that this trend would be observable in independent datasets. Recently, the studies by Artis et al. and the ACT+DESI collaboration appeared, presenting data that aligns with the expected trends. In this letter, we quantify the statistical significance of the increasing $S_8$ trends in recent studies by fitting a linear model to estimate the slope $\Delta\,S_8/\Delta\, z_{\textrm{eff}}$, and comparing the results to mock simulations. We find probabilities of $p = 0.0163$ and $p = 0.01893$, corresponding to approximately $2.1\sigma$ for each dataset. Using Fisher's method to combine the independent probabilities, we obtained $p=0.0027$ ($2.8 \sigma$). When we incorporate our earlier findings, the combined statistical significance reaches between $3\sigma$ and $3.7\sigma$. Finally, we discuss how ``scatter" in $\sigma_8$/$S_8$ constraints from recent DESI full-shape galaxy clustering fits this picture at low statistical significance. This letter continues a series of studies initiated in 2020 that explore redshift-dependent $\Lambda$CDM parameters as an indication of a breakdown in the standard cosmological model.</description>

      <title>Krylov Complexity in early universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18405v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Lanczos algorithm offers a method for constructing wave functions for both closed and open systems based on their Hamiltonians. Given that the entire early universe is fundamentally an open system, we apply the Lanczos algorithm to investigate Krylov complexity across different phases of the early universe, including inflation, the radiation-dominated period (RD), and the matter-dominated period (MD). Notably, we find that Krylov complexity differs between the closed and open system approaches. To effectively capture the impact of potentials during the RD and MD phases, we analyze various inflationary potentials, including the Higgs potential, the \(R^2\) inflationary potential, and chaotic inflationary potential, which is taking into account the violations of slow-roll conditions. This analysis is conducted in terms of conformal time through the preheating process. Our numerical results indicate that the evolution of Krylov complexity and Krylov entropy is remarkably similar within distinctive potentials in RD and MD. Additionally, we rigorously construct what is referred to as an open two-mode squeezed state, utilizing the second kind of Meixner polynomials. Based on this construction, we are the first to calculate the evolution equations for \(r_k\) and \(\phi_k\) as they relate to the scale factor. Our findings suggest that dissipative effects lead to a rapid decoherence-like behavior. Moreover, our results indicate that inflation behaves as a strongly dissipative system, while both the radiation-dominated and matter-dominated phases exhibit characteristics of weak dissipation. This research provides new insights into exploring the universe from the perspective of quantum information.</description>
