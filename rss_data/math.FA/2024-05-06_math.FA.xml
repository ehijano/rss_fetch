      <title>A modified proximal contraction principle with applications to variational inequality problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the notions of proximally completeness, proximally closedness and proximally continuity and utilize the same to prove a result on existence and uniqueness of best proximity points in the setting of metric space (not necessarily complete). Our newly proved result enriches, sharpens, improves and modifies the proximal contraction principle of Basha [J. Optim. Theory Appl. 2011:151 (2011), 210-216]. In order to illustrate the effectiveness of our finding, we discuss the sufficient conditions ensuring the existence of a unique solution of certain variational inequality problem.</description>

      <title>Rellich identities for the Hilbert transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove Hilbert transform identities involving conformal maps via the use of Rellich identity and the solution of the Neumann problem in a graph Lipschitz domain in the plane. We obtain as consequences new $L^2$-weighted estimates for the Hilbert transform, including a sharp bound for its norm as a bounded operator in weighted $L^2$ in terms of a weight constant associated to the Helson-Szeg\"o theorem.</description>

      <title>Weak Supercyclicity - An Expository Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is an exposition on supercyclicity and weak supercyclicity, especially designed to advance further developments in weakly supercyclicity, which is a recent research field showing significant momentum during the past two decades. For operators on a normed space, the present paper explores the relationship among supercyclicity and three versions of weak supercyclicity, namely, weak l-sequential, weak sequential, and weak supercyclicities, and their connection with strong stability, weak stability, and weak quasistability. A survey of the literature on weak supercyclicity is followed by an analysis of the interplay between supercyclicity and strong stability, as well as between weak supercyclicity and weak stability. A description of the spectrum of weakly l-sequentially supercyclic operators is also given.</description>

      <title>A note on the Huijsmans-de Pagter problem on finite dimensional ordered vector spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A classical problem posed in 1992 by Huijsmans and de Pagter asks whether, for every positive operator $T$ on a Banach lattice with spectrum $\sigma(T) = \{1\}$, the inequality $T \ge \operatorname{id}$ holds true. While the problem remains unsolved in its entirety, a positive solution is known in finite dimensions. In the broader context of ordered Banach spaces, Drnov\v{s}ek provided an infinite-dimensional counterexample. In this note, we demonstrate the existence of finite-dimensional counterexamples, specifically on the ice cream cone and on a polyhedral cone in $\mathbb{R}^3$. On the other hand, taking inspiration from the notion of $m$-isometries, we establish that each counterexample must contain a Jordan block of size at least $3$.</description>

      <title>Hermite expansions for spaces of functions with nearly optimal time-frequency decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish Hermite expansion characterizations for several subspaces of the Fr\'{e}chet space of functions on the real line satisfying the time-frequency decay bounds \[ |f(x)| \lesssim e^{-(\frac{1}{2} - \lambda) x^{2}} , \qquad |\widehat{f}(\xi)| \lesssim e^{-(\frac{1}{2} - \lambda) \xi^{2}} , \qquad \forall \lambda &gt; 0 . \] In particular, our results improve and extend upon recent Fourier characterizations of the so-called proper Pilpovi\'{c} spaces obtained in [J. Funct. Anal. 284 (2023), 109724]. The main ingredients in our proofs are the Bargmann transform and some optimal forms of the Phragm\'{e}n-Lindel\"{o}f principle on sectors, also provided in this article.</description>

      <title>On free bases of Banach spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We call a closed subset M of a Banach space X a free basis of X if it contains the null vector and every Lipschitz map from M to a Banach space Y, which preserves the null vectors can be uniquely extended to a bounded linear map from X to Y. We then say that two complete metric spaces M and N are Mol-equivalent if they admit bi-Lipschitz copies M' and N', respectively that are free bases of a common Banach space satisfying span M'=span N'.
  In this note, we compare Mol-equivalence with some other natural equivalences on the class of complete metric spaces. The main result states that Mol-equivalent spaces must have the same \v{C}ech-Lebesgue covering dimension. In combination with the work of Godard, this implies that two complete metric spaces with isomorphic Lipschitz-free spaces need not be Mol-equivalent. Also, there exist non-homeomorphic Mol-equivalent metric spaces, and, in contrast with the covering dimension, the metric Assouad dimension is not preserved by Mol-equivalence.</description>

      <title>Normed modules and the categorization of Lebesgue integration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02777v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the assignment of norms to $\Lambda$-modules over a finite-dimensional algebra $\Lambda$, resulting in the establishment of normed $\Lambda$-modules. Our primary contribution lies in constructing a new category $\mathscr{N}\!\!or^p$ related to normed modules along with its full subcategory $\mathscr{A}^p$. By examining the objects and morphisms in these categories, we establish a framework for understanding the categorization of Lebesgue integration.</description>

Abstract: We offer new results and new directions in the study of operator-valued kernels and their factorizations. Our approach provides both more explicit realizations and new results, as well as new applications. These include: (i) an explicit covariance analysis for Hilbert space-valued Gaussian processes, (ii) optimization results for quantum gates (from quantum information), (iii) new results for positive operator-valued measures (POVMs), and (iv) a new approach/result in inverse problems for quantum measurements.</description>

      <title>Rigged Hilbert Space formulation for quasi-Hermitian composite systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02848v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discussion in this study delves into Dirac's bra-ket formalism for a quasi-Hermitian quantum composite system based on the rigged Hilbert space (RHS). We establish an RHS with a positive definite metric suitable for a quasi-Hermite composite system. The obtained RHS is utilized to construct the bra and ket vectors for the non-Hermite composite system and produce the spectral decomposition of the quasi-Hermitian operator. We show that the symmetric relations regarding quasi-Hermitian operators can be extended to dual spaces, and all descriptions obtained using the bra-ket formalism are completely developed in the dual spaces. Our methodology is applied to a non-Hermitian harmonic oscillator composed of conformal multi-dimensional many-body systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2101.10867v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the properties of a family of distances between functions of a single variable. These distances are examples of integral probability metrics, and have been used previously for comparing probability measures on the line; special cases include the Earth Mover's Distance and the Kolmogorov Metric. We examine their properties for general signals, proving that they are robust to a broad class of deformations. We also establish corresponding robustness results for the induced sliced distances between multivariate functions. Finally, we establish error bounds for approximating the univariate metrics from finite samples, and prove that these approximations are robust to additive Gaussian noise. The results are illustrated in numerical experiments, which include comparisons with Wasserstein distances.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness when the $L_p$ curvature is close to be a constant for $p\in[0,1)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.03367v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For fixed positive integer $n$, $p\in[0,1]$, $a\in(0,1)$, we prove that if a function $g:\mathbb{S}^{n-1}\to \mathbb{R}$ is sufficiently close to 1, in the $C^a$ sense, then there exists a unique convex body $K$ whose $L_p$ curvature function equals $g$. This was previously established for $n=3$, $p=0$ by Chen, Feng, Liu \cite{CFL22} and in the symmetric case by Chen, Huang, Li, Liu \cite{CHLL20}. Related, we show that if $p=0$ and $n=4$ or $n\leq 3$ and $p\in[0,1)$, and the $L_p$ curvature function $g$ of a (sufficiently regular, containing the origin) convex body $K$ satisfies $\lambda^{-1}\leq g\leq \lambda$, for some $\lambda&gt;1$, then $\max_{x\in\mathbb{S}^{n-1}}h_K(x)\leq C(p,\lambda)$, for some constant $C(p,\lambda)&gt;0$ that depends only on $p$ and $\lambda$. This also extends a result from Chen, Feng, Liu \cite{CFL22}. Along the way, we obtain a result, that might be of independent interest, concerning the question of when the support of the $L_p$ surface area measure is lower dimensional. Finally, we establish a strong non-uniqueness result for the $L_p$-Minkowksi problem, for $-n&lt;p&lt;0$.</description>

      <title>A study on various generalizations of Generalized centers $\bm{(GC)}$ in Banach spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15818v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In [{\em Generalized centers of finite sets in Banach spaces}, Acta Math. Univ. Comenian. (N.S.) {\bf 66}(1) (1997), 83--115], Vesel\'{y} developed the idea of generalized centers for finite sets in Banach spaces. In this work, we explore the concept of {\it restricted $\mr{F}$-center property} for a triplet $(X,Y,\mc{F}(X))$, where $Y$ is a subspace of a Banach space $X$ and $\mc{F}(X)$ is the family of finite subsets of $X$. In addition, we generalize the analysis to include all closed, bounded subsets of $X$. Similar to how Lindenstrauss characterized $n.2.I.P.$, we characterize $n.X.I.P.$. So, it is possible to figure out that $Y$ has $n.X.I.P.$ in $X$ for all natural numbers $n$ if and only if $\tr{rad}_Y(F)=\tr{rad}_X(F)$ for all finite subsets $F$ of $Y$. It then turns out that, for all continuous, monotone functions $f$, the $f$-radii viz. $\tr{rad}_Y^f(F),\tr{rad}_X^f(F)$ are same whenever the generalized radii viz. $\tr{rad}_Y(F), \tr{rad}_X(F)$ are also same, for all finite subsets $F$ of $Y$. We establish a variety of characterizations of central subspaces of Banach spaces. With reference to an appropriate subfamily of closed and bounded subsets, it appears that a number of function spaces and subspaces exhibit the restricted weighted Chebyshev center property.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.15394v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: On the space of positive definite matrices, several operator means are popular and have been studied extensively. In this paper, we investigate the near order and the L\"owner order relations on the curves defined by the Wasserstein mean and the spectral geometric mean. We show that the near order $\preceq $ is stronger than the eigenvalue entrywise order, and that $A\natural_t B \preceq A\diamond_t B$ for $t\in [0,1]$. We prove the monotonicity properties of the curves originated from the Wasserstein mean and the spectral geometric mean in terms of the near order. The L\"owner order properties of the Wasserstein mean and the spectral geometric mean are also explored.</description>

      <title>$\ell_1$ spreading models and the FPP for Ces\`aro mean nonexpansive maps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18113v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $K$ be a nonempty subset of a Banach space $X$. A mapping $T\colon K\to K$ is called $\mathfrak{cm}$-nonexpansive if for any sequence $(u_i)_{i=1}^\infty$ and $y$ in $K$, $\limsup_{i\to\infty} \sup_{A\subset\{1,\dots, n\}}\|\sum_{k\in A} \big(T u_{i+k} - Ty\big)\|\leq \limsup_{i\to\infty} \sup_{A\subset\{1,\dots, n\}}\|\sum_{k\in A} (u_{i+k} - y)\|$ for all $n\in\mathbb{N}$. As a subclass of the class of nonexpansive maps, its FPP is well-established in a wide variety of spaces. The main result of this paper is a fixed point result relating $\mathfrak{cm}$-nonexpansiveness, $\ell_1$ spreading models and Schauder bases with not-so-large basis constants. As a consequence, we deduce that Banach spaces with the weak Banach-Saks property have the fixed point property for $\mathfrak{cm}$-nonexpansive maps.</description>

      <title>Limit-case admissibility for positive infinite-dimensional systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01275v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the context of positive infinite-dimensional linear systems, we systematically study $L^p$-admissible control and observation operators with respect to the limit-cases $p=\infty$ and $p=1$, respectively. This requires an in-depth understanding of the order structure on the extrapolation space $X_{-1}$, which we provide. These properties of $X_{-1}$ also enable us to discuss when zero-class admissibility is automatic. While those limit-cases are the weakest form of admissibility on the $L^p$-scale, it is remarkable that they sometimes follow from order theoretic and geometric assumptions. Our assumptions on the geometries of the involved spaces are minimal.</description>

Abstract: We answer in the affirmative the surprisingly difficult questions: If a complex Banach space possesses a real predual X, then is X a complex Banach space?
  If a complex Banach space possesses a real predual, then does it have a complex predual? We also answer the analogous questions for operator spaces, that is spaces of operators on a Hilbert space, up to complete isometry. Indeed we use operator space methods to solve the Banach space question above.</description>

      <title>On the uniform convergence of continuous semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.12759v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\Omega$ be a region in the complex plane $\mathbb C$ and let $\{\Phi_t \}_{t\ge 0}$ be a continuous semigroup of functions on $\Omega$; that is, $\Phi_t:\Omega\to\Omega$ is holomorphic for every $t\ge 0$, $\Phi_0(z)=z$, for every $z\in\Omega$, $\Phi_t\circ\Phi_s=\Phi_{s+t}$, for every $s$, $t\ge 0$, and \[ \Phi_t(z)\to z\,,\quad t\to0^+, \] uniformly on compact subsets of $\Omega$. Despite this definition only requires the uniform convergence on compact subsets, P. Gumenyuk proved in 2014 that, when $\Omega$ is the unit disc, the convergence is uniform on the whole $\mathbb D$. In this paper, we enhance Gumenyuk's result by proving that for every continuous semigroup $\{\Phi_t\}_{t\ge 0}$ on $\mathbb D$ we have $$ \sup_{z\in\mathbb D}|\Phi_t(z)-z|= O(\sqrt t), \ t\to0^+. $$ In addition, we provide an example showing that $O(\sqrt t)$ is the best possible rate of uniform convergence valid for all semigroups on $\mathbb D$.
  When $\Omega$ is the right half-plane $\mathbb C_+$, we consider semigroups $\{\Phi_t\}$ with $\infty$ as its Denjoy-Wolff point. It is not difficult to show that Gumenyuk's result is no longer true for these semigroups. Our second result characterises when such continuous semigroups converge uniformly to the identity, as $t\to0^+$, in terms of their infinitesimal generators. Namely, this convergence holds if and only if the infinitesimal generator of the semigroup is bounded in the half-plane $\{z\in \mathbb C:\, \Re z&gt;1\}$. In this case, we can also prove that the rate of convergence is again $O(\sqrt{t})$, as $t\to0^+$.
  An example of application of this result is when the semigroup is in the Gordon-Hedenmalm class (the one producing bounded composition operators on Hardy spaces of Dirichlet series).
  An important ingredient in the proofs of these results is harmonic measure, which we have done through a classic result of M. Lavrentiev.</description>

      <title>Phase space analysis of spectral multipliers for the twisted Laplacian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.00592v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove boundedness results on modulation and Wiener amalgam spaces for some families of spectral multipliers for the twisted Laplacian. We exploit the metaplectic equivalence relating the twisted Laplacian with a partial harmonic oscillator, leading to a general transference principle for the corresponding spectral multipliers. Our analysis encompasses powers of the twisted Laplacian and oscillating multipliers, with applications to the corresponding Schr\"odinger and wave flows. On the other hand, elaborating on the twisted convolution structure of the eigenprojections and its connection with the Weyl product of symbols, we obtain a complete picture of the boundedness of the heat flow for the twisted Laplacian. Results of the same kind are established for fractional heat flows via subordination.</description>

      <title>Phase retrieval on circles and lines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16255v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $f$ and $g$ be analytic functions on the open unit disc $\mathbb D$ such that $|f|=|g|$ on a set $A$. We give an alternative proof of the result of Perez that there exists $c$ in the unit circle $\mathbb T$ such that $f=cg$ when $A$ is the union of two lines in $\mathbb D$ intersecting at an angle that is an irrational multiple of $\pi$, and from this deduce a sequential generalization of the result. Similarly, the same conclusion is valid when $f$ and $g$ are in the Nevanlinna class and $A$ is the union of the unit circle and an interior circle, tangential or not. We also provide sequential versions of this result and analyse the case $A=r\mathbb T$. Finally, we examine the most general situation when there is equality on two distinct circles in the disc, providing a result or counterexample for each possible configuration.</description>

      <title>A nontrivial uniform algebra Dirichlet on its maximal ideal space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19583v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is shown that there exists a nontrivial uniform algebra that is Dirichlet on its maximal ideal space and has a dense set of elements that are exponentials. This answers a 64-year-old question of John Wermer and a 16-year-old question of Garth Dales and Joel Feinstein. Our example is P(X) for a certain compact set X in complex Euclidean 2-space ($\mathbb{C}^2$). It is also shown that there exists a logmodular uniform algebra with proper Shilov boundary but with no nontrivial Gleason parts. This answers a modified form of another 64-year-old question of Wermer.</description>

      <title>The search for NLS ground states on a hybrid domain: Motivations, methods, and results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07843v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss the problem of establishing the existence of the Ground States for the subcritical focusing Nonlinear Schr\"odinger energy on a domain made of a line and a plane intersecting at a point. The problem is physically motivated by the experimental realization of hybrid traps for Bose-Einstein Condensates, that are able to concentrate the system on structures close to the domain we consider. In fact, such a domain approximates the trap as the temperature approaches the absolute zero. The spirit of the paper is mainly pedagogical, so we focus on the formulation of the problem and on the explanation of the result, giving references for the technical points and for the proofs.</description>

      <title>Crossed products of dynamical systems; rigidity Vs. strong proximality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09803v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a dynamical system $(X, \Gamma)$, the corresponding crossed product $C^*$-algebra $C(X)\rtimes_{r}\Gamma$ is called reflecting, when every intermediate $C^*$-algebra $C^*_r(\Gamma)&lt;\mathcal{A} &lt; C(X)\rtimes_{r}\Gamma$ is of the form $\mathcal{A}=C(Y)\rtimes_{r}\Gamma$, corresponding to a dynamical factor $X \rightarrow Y$. It is called almost reflecting if $\mathbb{E}(\mathcal{A}) \subset \mathcal{A}$ for every such $\mathcal{A}$. These two notions coincide for groups admitting the approximation property (AP). Let $\Gamma$ be a non-elementary convergence group or a lattice in $\text{SL}_d(\mathbb{R})$ for some $d \ge 2$. We show that any uniformly rigid system $(X,\Gamma)$ is almost reflecting. In particular, this holds for any equicontinuous action. In the von Neumann setting, for the same groups $\Gamma$ and any uniformly rigid system $(X,\mathcal{B},\mu, \Gamma)$ the crossed product algebra $L^{\infty}(X,\mu)\rtimes\Gamma$ is reflecting. An inclusion of algebras $\mathcal{A}\subset\mathcal{B}$ is called $\textit{minimal ambient}$ if there are no intermediate algebras. As a demonstration of our methods, we construct examples of minimal ambient inclusions with various interesting properties in the $C^*$ and the von Neumann settings.</description>

      <title>Roman Domination on Graphings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19718v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a variant of domination, called Roman domination, where we must assign to each vertex one of the labels 0, 1, or 2 and require that every vertex with label 0 has a neighbour with label 2. We study the problem of finding a low-cost Roman dominating function on Lebesgue-measurable graphings, that is, on infinite graphs whose vertices are the points of a probability space. We provide a framework to tackle optimisation problems in the measurable combinatorial setting. In particular, we fully answer the Roman domination problem on irrational cycle graphs, a specific type of graphing on the space $\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}$ where an irrational number ${\alpha}$ is given and two vertices are adjacent if and only if their distance is ${\alpha}$.</description>
