      <title>Affine Quermassintegrals and Even Minkowski Valuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is shown that each continuous even Minkowski valuation on convex bodies of degree $1 \leq i \leq n - 1$ intertwining rigid motions is obtained from convolution of the $i$th projection function with a unique spherical Crofton distribution. In case of a non-negative distribution, the polar volume of the associated Minkowski valuation gives rise to an isoperimetric inequality which strengthens the classical relation between the $i$th quermassintegral and the volume. This large family of inequalities unifies earlier results obtained for $i = 1$ and $n - 1$. In these cases, isoperimetric inequalities for affine quermassintegrals, specifically the Blaschke-Santal\'o inequality for $i = 1$ and the Petty projection inequality for $i = n - 1$, were proven to be the strongest inequalities. An analogous result for the intermediate degrees is established here. Finally, a new sufficient condition for the existence of maximizers for the polar volume of Minkowski valuations intertwining rigid motions reveals unexpected examples of volume inequalities having asymmetric extremizers.</description>

      <title>Approximation of length metrics by conformally flat Riemannian metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23304v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a proof of the folklore result that any length metric on $\mathbb R^d$ can be approximated by conformally flat Riemannian distance functions in the uniform distance. This result is used to study Liouville quantum gravity in another paper by the same authors.</description>

      <title>Subcritical regimes in the Poisson Boolean percolation on Ahlfors regular spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23859v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Poisson Boolean percolation on a metric measure space is one of the percolation models. Intuitively, this model is obtained by collecting random balls whose centers form a Poisson point process. In 2008, Gou\'{e}r\'{e} proved that for $n \geq 2$, the Poisson Boolean percolation on $\mathbb{R}^n$ has the subcritical regime if and only if the radius distribution has finite $n$-th moment. In this paper, we extend Gou\'{e}r\'{e}'s result to Ahlfors regular metric measure spaces.</description>

      <title>The Z-Gromov-Wasserstein Distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08233v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) distance is a powerful tool for comparing metric measure spaces which has found broad applications in data science and machine learning. Driven by the need to analyze datasets whose objects have increasingly complex structure (such as node and edge-attributed graphs), several variants of GW distance have been introduced in the recent literature. With a view toward establishing a general framework for the theory of GW-like distances, this paper considers a vast generalization of the notion of a metric measure space: for an arbitrary metric space $Z$, we define a $Z$-network to be a measure space endowed with a kernel valued in $Z$. We introduce a method for comparing $Z$-networks by defining a generalization of GW distance, which we refer to as $Z$-Gromov-Wasserstein ($Z$-GW) distance. This construction subsumes many previously known metrics and offers a unified approach to understanding their shared properties. This paper demonstrates that the $Z$-GW distance defines a metric on the space of $Z$-networks which retains desirable properties of $Z$, such as separability, completeness, and geodesicity. Many of these properties were unknown for existing variants of GW distance that fall under our framework. Our focus is on foundational theory, but our results also include computable lower bounds and approximations of the distance which will be useful for practical applications.</description>

      <title>Uniform diameter estimates for Kaehler metrics in big cohomology classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18532v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We generalize previous diameter estimates and local non-vanishing of volumes for Kaehler metrics to the case of big cohomology classes. In our proof, among other things, we will prove a uniform diameter estimate for a family of smooth Kaehler metrics only involving an integrability condition. We also have to use fine stability properties of complex Monge-Ampere equations with prescribed singularities.</description>
