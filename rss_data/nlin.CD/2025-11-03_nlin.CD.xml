      <title>Boundary Layer Transition as Succession of Temporal and Spatial Symmetry Breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that both temporal and spatial symmetry breaking in canonical K-type transition arise as organized hydrodynamic structures rather than stochastic fluctuations. Before the skin-friction maximum, the flow is fully described by a periodic, spanwise symmetric, harmonic response to the Tollmien-Schlichting wave, forming a spatially compact coherent structure that produces hairpin packets. This fundamental harmonic response may visually resemble turbulence, but remains fully periodic and delimits the exact extent of the deterministic regime. A distinct regime change occurs after this point; a hierarchy of new (quasi-)periodic and aperiodic space-time structures emerges, followed shortly by anti-symmetric structures that develop similarly despite no anti-symmetric inputs, marking the onset of aperiodicity and spanwise asymmetry. We identify these structures as symmetry-decomposed spectral and space-time proper orthogonal modes that resolve the full progression from deterministic to broadband dynamics. The key insight is that laminar-turbulent transition can be viewed as a sequence of symmetry breaking events, each driven by energetically dominant, space-time coherent modes that gradually turn an initially harmonic flow into broadband turbulence.</description>

      <title>Higher-order phase reduction for delay-coupled oscillators beyond the phase-shift approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27524v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Network interactions between dynamical units are often subject to time delay. We develop a phase reduction method for delay-coupled oscillator networks. The method is based on rewriting the delay-differential equation as an ordinary differential equation coupled with a transport equation, expanding in the coupling strength, and solving the resulting equations order-by-order. This approach yields an approximation of the finite-dimensional phase dynamics to arbitrary order. While in the first-order approximation the time delay acts as a phase shift as expected, the higher-order phase reduction generally displays a less trivial dependence on the delay. In particular, exploiting second-order phase reduction, we prove the existence of a region of bistability in the synchronization dynamics of two delay-coupled Stuart-Landau oscillators.</description>

      <title>The effect of friction on the dynamics of targeted energy transfer by symmetric vibro-impact dampers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04420v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates the nonlinear dynamics of a symmetric vibro-impact nonlinear energy sink (VI-NES) subjected to dry friction, a crucial factor that remains insufficiently explored in previous research. The combined effect of impact and friction leads to intricate behaviors that require further investigation. To address this, the multiple scales method is extended to incorporate frictional effects and is complemented with a generalized impact map approach. This allows for a systematic exploration of periodic solutions, stability, and bifurcations, revealing critical transitions between impact-dominated and sliding-dominated regimes. The activation thresholds and amplitude levels for different response regimes, including stick-slip dynamics, are identified, offering new insights into friction-induced nonlinearities. The results bridge the gap between theoretical modeling and practical implementation, offering a more accurate predictive framework for VINES behavior. This improves design strategies for enhanced energy dissipation and robustness in real-world applications.</description>

      <title>On-Manifold Low-Thrust Rephasing of Quasi-Periodic Orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07940v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A bi-level optimal control framework is introduced to solve the low-thrust re-phasing problem on quasi-periodic invariant tori in multi-body environments where deviations away from the torus during maneuver are considered unsafe or irresponsible. It is shown for a large class of mechanical systems that conformity to the torus manifold during periods of non-zero control input is infeasible. The most feasible trajectories on the torus surface are generated through the minimization of fictitious control input in the torus space using phase space control variables mapped via the torus function. These reference trajectories are then transitioned to the phase space both through a minimum tracking error homotopy and minimum time patched solutions. Results are compared to torus agnostic low-thrust transfers using measures of fuel consumption, cumulative torus error, and coast time spent on the torus during maneuver. Modifications to the framework are made for the inclusion of quasi-periodically forced dynamical systems. Lastly, minimum time recovery trajectories with free final torus conditions expose the disparity between the proposed framework and torus agnostic approaches. Examples are drawn from the circular and elliptical restricted three-body problems.</description>

      <title>Conditional mutual information: A generalization of causal inference in quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12160v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The concept of causality is fundamental to numerous scientific explanations; however, its extension to the quantum regime has yet to be rigorously explored. This letter introduces the development of a quantum causal index, a novel extension of the classical causal inference framework, tailored to learn the causal relationships inherent in quantum systems. Our study focuses on the asymmetric quantum conditional mutual information (QCMI), incorporating the von Neumann entropy, as a directional metric of causal influence in quantum many-body systems. We analyze spin chains using the QCMI, implementing a projective measurement on one site as the intervention and monitoring its effect on a distant site conditioned on intermediate spins. Additionally, we study the effective causal propagation velocity, which is the speed at which QCMI becomes significant at distant sites. These findings indicate the presence of finite-speed propagation of causal influence, along with the emergence of coherent oscillations.</description>

      <title>Ergodicity, KAM, FPUT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18934v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Boltzmann introduced the microcanonical ensemble in
  1868, \cite{Bo868-a}, and immediately attempted to give an
  example of a system whose stationary states would be described
  by the emsemble (as suggested also by his ergodic
  hypothesis). The example, \cite{Bo868-b}, has been recently
  shown to be incorrect, if taken literally: the point was to
  suppose that constants of motion, if any besides the energy,
  would necessarily be smooth functions; and soon later he warned
  on the dangers implicit in a similar assumption. Fifty years
  later Fermi wrote a paper attempting to prove that in general a
  nonlinear system should be ergodic, \cite{Fe923}: but his proof
  relied again on Boltzmann's assumption. Thirty-four more years
  elapsed, and Fermi returned on the problem collaborating with
  Pasta, Ulam, Tsingou: the surprise was that the considered non
  linear chain was apparently not following the ergodic
  hypothesis. In the same year Kolmogorov had proved the
  conservation of many quasi periodic motions in nonlinear
  perturbations of integrable systems, \cite{Ko954}: his theorem was
  considered, already a few years later, a possible explanation
  of the FPUT work, \cite{Fo992}. This was only the beginning of intense
  research: here a brief sketch is presented to illustrate the
  above themes and the connection with the multiscale aspects of
  the problems, and the ``Renormalization group method'' intended
  as a map $\RR$ whose iterations can be interpreted as
  successive magnifications, zooming on ever smaller regions of
  phase space in which motions develop closer and closer to the
  searched quasi periodic motion of given spectrum.</description>
