      <title>Fault Detection and Identification via Monitoring Modules Based on Clusters of Interacting Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work introduces a novel control-aware distributed process monitoring methodology based on modules comprised of clusters of interacting measurements. The methodology relies on the process flow diagram (PFD) and control system structure without requiring cross-correlation data to create monitoring modules. The methodology is validated on the Tennessee Eastman Process benchmark using full Principal Component Analysis (f-PCA) in the monitoring modules. The results are comparable to nonlinear techniques implemented in a centralized manner such as Kernel PCA (KPCA), Autoencoders (AE), and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), or distributed techniques like the Distributed Canonical Correlation Analysis (DCCA). Temporal plots of fault detection by different modules show clearly the magnitude and propagation of the fault through each module, pinpointing the module where the fault originates, and separating controllable faults from other faults. This information, combined with PCA contribution plots, helps detection and identification as effectively as more complex nonlinear centralized or distributed methods.</description>

      <title>A mmWave Software-Defined Array Platform for Wireless Experimentation at 24-29.5 GHz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advanced millimeter-wave software-defined array (SDA) platforms, or testbeds at affordable costs and high performance are essential for the wireless community. In this paper, we present a low-cost, portable, and programmable SDA that allows for accessible research and experimentation in real time. The proposed platform is based on a 16-element phased-array transceiver operating across 24-29.5 GHz, integrated with a radio-frequency system-on-chip board that provides data conversion and baseband signal-processing capabilities. All radio-communication parameters and phased-array beam configurations are controlled through a high-level application program interface. We present measurements evaluating the beamforming and communication link performance. Our experimental results validate that the SDA has a beam scan range of -45 to +45 degrees (azimuth), a 3 dB beamwidth of 20 degrees, and support up to a throughput of 1.613 Gb/s using 64-QAM. The signal-to-noise ratio is as high as 30 dB at short-range distances when the transmit and receive beams are aligned.</description>

      <title>Improved Dynamic Response in Grid-Forming Converters with Current Limiting Control during Fault Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern power systems increasingly demand converter-driven generation systems that integrate seamlessly with grid infrastructure. Grid-based converters are particularly advantageous, as they operate in harmony with conventional synchronous machines. However, most existing research focuses on managing grid-forming converters (GFM) under normal conditions, often neglecting the converters' behavior during faults and their short-circuit capabilities. This paper addresses these gaps by introducing a power matching-based current limitation scheme, which ensures GFM converter synchronization while preventing over currents. It also highlights the limitations of grid-following techniques, which need to maintain robust grid-forming properties during fault conditions. Unlike conventional methods, no assumptions are made regarding outer power loops or droop mechanisms, and current references are immediately restricted to prevent wind-ups. A dynamic virtual damping algorithm is proposed to improve fault isolation further. This technique enhances fault-ride-through capability and maintains grid-forming properties even in weak grid conditions. The dynamic virtual damping controller and fault mode for GFMs are modeled and validated using detailed simulations in MATLAB. These results demonstrate that altering outer power sources, rather than internal structures, improves converter performance during faults, ensuring grid stability and reliability.</description>

      <title>Data-conforming data-driven control: avoiding premature generalizations beyond data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data-driven and adaptive control approaches face the problem of introducing sudden distributional shifts beyond the distribution of data encountered during learning. Therefore, they are prone to invalidating the very assumptions used in their own construction. This is due to the linearity of the underlying system, inherently assumed and formulated in most data-driven control approaches, which may falsely generalize the behavior of the system beyond the behavior experienced in the data. This paper seeks to mitigate these problems by enforcing consistency of the newly designed closed-loop systems with data and slow down any distributional shifts in the joint state-input space. This is achieved through incorporating affine regularization terms and linear matrix inequality constraints to data-driven approaches, resulting in convex semi-definite programs that can be efficiently solved by standard software packages. We discuss the optimality conditions of these programs and then conclude the paper with a numerical example that further highlights the problem of premature generalization beyond data and shows the effectiveness of our proposed approaches in enhancing the safety of data-driven control methods.</description>

      <title>Distributed Deep Koopman Learning for Nonlinear Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Koopman operator theory has proven to be highly significant in system identification, even for challenging scenarios involving nonlinear time-varying systems (NTVS). In this context, we examine a network of connected agents, each with limited observation capabilities, aiming to estimate the dynamics of an NTVS collaboratively. Drawing inspiration from Koopman operator theory, deep neural networks, and distributed consensus, we introduce a distributed algorithm for deep Koopman learning of the dynamics of an NTVS. This approach enables individual agents to approximate the entire dynamics despite having access to only partial state observations. We guarantee consensus not only on the estimated dynamics but also on its structure, i.e., the matrices encountered in the linear equation of the lifted Koopman system. We provide theoretical insights into the convergence of the learning process and accompanying numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>A novel pedestrian road crossing simulator for dynamic traffic light scheduling systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The major advances in intelligent transportation systems are pushing societal services toward autonomy where road management is to be more agile in order to cope with changes and continue to yield optimal performance. However, the pedestrian experience is not sufficiently considered. Particularly, signalized intersections are expected to be popular if not dominant in urban settings where pedestrian density is high. This paper presents the design of a novel environment for simulating human motion on signalized crosswalks at a fine-grained level. Such a simulation not only captures typical behavior, but also handles cases where large pedestrian groups cross from both directions. The proposed simulator is instrumental for optimized road configuration management where the pedestrians' quality of experience, for example, waiting time, is factored in. The validation results using field data show that an accuracy of 98.37 percent can be obtained for the estimated crossing time. Other results using synthetic data show that our simulator enables optimized traffic light scheduling that diminishes pedestrians' waiting time without sacrificing vehicular throughput.</description>

      <title>Modeling and Simulation of a Fully Autonomous Electric Vehicle (AEV)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With continuous advancements in science and technology, there is increasing focus on environmental sustainability, leading to heightened interest in autonomous electric vehicles (AEVs). AEVs hold significant potential for enhancing electric mobility, energy efficiency, environmental preservation, and driving capabilities. They offer numerous advantages that could revolutionize transportation and urban lifestyles, notably by improving road safety through the reduction of human error, a leading cause of accidents. This paper presents a comprehensive simulation of an AEV by developing and integrating models for the driving system, battery, motor, transmission, and vehicle body within the MATLAB/Simulink environment. Each component is configured and interconnected to create a pure vehicle model. The simulation is conducted under UDDS cycle conditions to evaluate the vehicle's performance in speed maintenance, driving distance, acceleration capabilities, and battery state-of-charge (SoC) dynamics. The results demonstrate that the vehicle exhibits strong output characteristics. Furthermore, the driver model incorporates an energy brake recovery function, which, when set to a 50% recovery efficiency, increases the driving distance by 25% compared to a vehicle without this function.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Building Occupancy Detection: a Switching Process with Markov Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Energy efficiency of buildings is considered to be one of the major means of achieving the net-zero carbon goal around the world. The big part of the energy savings are supposed to be coming from optimizing the operation of the building heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems. There is a natural trade-off between the energy efficiency and the indoor comfort level, and finding an optimal operating schedule/regime requires knowing the occupancy of different spaces inside of the building. Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic has also revealed the need to sustain the high quality of the indoor air in order to reduce the risk of spread of infection. Occupancy detection from indoor sensors is thus an important practical problem. In the present paper, we propose detection of occupancy based on the carbon dioxide measurements inside the building. In particular, a new approach based on the, so-called, switching auto-regressive process with Markov regime is presented and justified by the physical model of the carbon dioxide concentration dynamics. We demonstrate the efficiency of the method compared to simple Hidden Markov approaches on simulated and real-life data. We also show that the model is flexible and can be generalized to account for different ventilation regimes, simultaneously detecting the occupancy and the ventilation rate.</description>

      <title>Communication, Sensing and Control integrated Closed-loop System: Modeling, Control Design and Resource Allocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The wireless communication technologies have fundamentally revolutionized industrial operations. The operation of the automated equipment is conducted in a closed-loop manner, where the status of devices is collected and sent to the control center through the uplink channel, and the control center sends the calculated control commands back to the devices via downlink communication. However, existing studies neglect the interdependent relationship between uplink and downlink communications, and there is an absence of a unified approach to model the communication, sensing, and control within the loop. This can lead to inaccurate performance assessments, ultimately hindering the ability to provide guidance for the design of practical systems. Therefore, this paper introduces an integrated closed-loop model that encompasses sensing, communication, and control functionalities, while addressing the coupling effects between uplink and downlink communications. Through the analysis of system convergence, an inequality pertaining to the performances of sensing, communication, and control is derived. Additionally, a joint optimization algorithm for control and resource allocation is proposed. Simulation results are presented to offer an intuitive understanding of the impact of system parameters. The findings of this paper unveil the intricate correlation among sensing, communication, and control, providing insights for the optimal design of industrial closed-loop systems.</description>

      <title>Distributed Resilient Secondary Control for Microgrids with Attention-based Weights against High-density Misbehaving Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microgrids (MGs) have been equipped with large-scale distributed energy sources (DESs), and become more vulnerable due to the low inertia characteristic. In particular, high-density misbehaving DESs caused by cascading faults bring a great challenge to frequency synchronization and active power sharing among DESs. To tackle the problem, we propose a fully distributed resilient consensus protocol, which utilizes confidence weights to evaluate the level of trust among agents with a first-order filter and a softmax-type function. We pioneer the analysis of this nonlinear control system from the system operating range and the graph structure perspectives. Both necessary and sufficient conditions are provided to ensure DACC to be uniformly ultimately bounded, even in a robust network with low connectivity. Simulations on a modified IEEE33-bus microgrid testbed with 17 DESs validate that DACC outperforms existing methods in the presence of 8 misbehaving DESs.</description>

      <title>Robust Sensor-Limited Control with Safe Input-Output Constraints for Hydraulic In-Wheel Motor Drive Mobility Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In-wheel drive (IWD) systems enhance the responsiveness, traction, and maintenance efficiency of vehicles by enabling each wheel to operate independently. This paper proposes a novel robust torque-observed valve-based control (RTOVC) framework to address velocity tracking in hydraulic IWDs that actuate heavy-duty wheeled mobile robots (HWMRs), considering such challenges as wheel slippages, sensor limitations, rough terrains, and modeling uncertainties. To overcome the sensor-dependent control systems associated with the closed-loop torque/pressure in hydraulic IWD-actuated HWMRs, a robust observer network based on an adaptive barrier Lyapunov function (BLF) is proposed to estimate the required in-wheel motor torque to track the velocity references. Then, another adaptive BLF for valve control signals is employed to modulate the hydraulic fluid to generate the estimated torque for each IWD. The RTOVC strategy ensures user-defined safety within the logarithmic BLF framework by constraining the valve control signal, actual velocity, velocity tracking error, and torque of each hydraulic IWD in an HWMR to avoid exceeding specified limits. Despite its safety constraints, external disturbances, and modeling uncertainties, robustness and uniformly exponential stability of the RTOVC-applied hydraulic IWD mechanism are ensured in HWMRs. Experimental investigations using a 6,500-kg HWMR, actuated by four independent IWDs under intense disturbances and safety-defined constraints, validate the performance of the RTOVC.</description>

      <title>Model-Free Generic Robust Control for Servo-Driven Actuation Mechanisms with Experimental Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To advance theoretical solutions and address limitations in modeling complex servo-driven actuation systems experiencing high non-linearity and load disturbances, this paper aims to design a practical model-free generic robust control (GRC) framework for these mechanisms. This framework is intended to be applicable across all actuator systems encompassing electrical, hydraulic, or pneumatic servomechanisms, while also functioning within complex interactions among dynamic components and adhering to control input constraints. In this respect, the state-space model of actuator systems is decomposed into smaller subsystems that incorporate the first principle equation of actuator motion dynamics and interactive energy conversion equations. This decomposition operates under the assumption that the comprehensive model of the servo-driven actuator system and energy conversion, uncertainties, load disturbances, and their bounds are unknown. Then, the GRC employs subsystem-based adaptive control strategies for each state-variant subsystem separately. Despite control input constraints and the unknown interactive system model, the GRC-applied actuator mechanism ensures uniform exponential stability and robustness in tracking desired motions. It features straightforward implementation, experimentally evaluated by applying it to two industrial applications.</description>

      <title>System-Level Efficient Performance of EMLA-Driven Heavy-Duty Manipulators via Bilevel Optimization Framework with a Leader--Follower Scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The global push for sustainability and energy efficiency is driving significant advancements across various industries, including the development of electrified solutions for heavy-duty mobile manipulators (HDMMs). Electromechanical linear actuators (EMLAs), powered by permanent magnet synchronous motors, present an all-electric alternative to traditional internal combustion engine (ICE)-powered hydraulic actuators, offering a promising path toward an eco-friendly future for HDMMs. However, the limited operational range of electrified HDMMs, closely tied to battery capacity, highlights the need to fully exploit the potential of EMLAs that driving the manipulators. This goal is contingent upon a deep understanding of the harmonious interplay between EMLA mechanisms and the dynamic behavior of heavy-duty manipulators. To this end, this paper introduces a bilevel multi-objective optimization framework, conceptualizing the EMLA-actuated manipulator of an electrified HDMM as a leader--follower scenario. At the leader level, the optimization algorithm maximizes EMLA efficiency by considering electrical and mechanical constraints, while the follower level optimizes manipulator motion through a trajectory reference generator that adheres to manipulator limits. This optimization approach ensures that the system operates with a synergistic trade-off between the most efficient operating region of the actuation system, achieving a total efficiency of 70.3\%, and high manipulator performance. Furthermore, to complement this framework and ensure precise tracking of the generated optimal trajectories, a robust, adaptive, subsystem-based control strategy is developed with accurate control and exponential stability. The proposed methodologies are validated on a three-degrees-of-freedom manipulator, demonstrating significant efficiency improvements while maintaining high-performance operation.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consensus control of multiagent systems arises in various robotic applications such as rendezvous and formation control. For example, to compute the control inputs of individual agents, the difference in the positions in aligned coordinate frames i.e., the pairwise displacements are typically measured. However, the local coordinate frames might be subject to rotational ambiguities, such as a rotation or a reflection, particularly if the positions of the agent are not directly observed but reconstructed from e.g. pairwise Euclidean distances. This rotational ambiguity causes stability issues in practice, as agents have rotated perceptions of the environment. In this work, we conduct a thorough analysis of the stability in the presence of rotational ambiguities in several scenarios including e.g., proper and improper rotation, and the homogeneity of rotations. We give stability criteria and stability margin on the rotations, which are numerically verified with two traditional examples of consensus control.</description>

      <title>Data-Efficient Quadratic Q-Learning Using LMIs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has seen significant research and application results but often requires large amounts of training data. This paper proposes two data-efficient off-policy RL methods that use parametrized Q-learning. In these methods, the Q-function is chosen to be linear in the parameters and quadratic in selected basis functions in the state and control deviations from a base policy. A cost penalizing the $\ell_1$-norm of Bellman errors is minimized. We propose two methods: Linear Matrix Inequality Q-Learning (LMI-QL) and its iterative variant (LMI-QLi), which solve the resulting episodic optimization problem through convex optimization. LMI-QL relies on a convex relaxation that yields a semidefinite programming (SDP) problem with linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). LMI-QLi entails solving sequential iterations of an SDP problem. Both methods combine convex optimization with direct Q-function learning, significantly improving learning speed. A numerical case study demonstrates their advantages over existing parametrized Q-learning methods.</description>

      <title>ReLU Surrogates in Mixed-Integer MPC for Irrigation Scheduling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient water management in agriculture is important for mitigating the growing freshwater scarcity crisis. Mixed-integer Model Predictive Control (MPC) has emerged as an effective approach for addressing the complex scheduling problems in agricultural irrigation. However, the computational complexity of mixed-integer MPC still poses a significant challenge, particularly in large-scale applications. This study proposes an approach to enhance the computational efficiency of mixed-integer MPC-based irrigation schedulers by employing ReLU surrogate models to describe the soil moisture dynamics of the agricultural field. By leveraging the mixed-integer linear representation of the ReLU operator, the proposed approach transforms the mixed-integer MPC-based scheduler with a quadratic cost function into a mixed-integer quadratic program, which is the simplest class of mixed-integer nonlinear programming problems that can be efficiently solved using global optimization solvers. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated through comparative studies conducted on a large-scale agricultural field across two growing seasons, involving other machine learning surrogate models, specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and the widely used triggered irrigation scheduling method. The ReLU-based approach significantly reduces solution times -- by up to 99.5\% -- while achieving comparable performance to the LSTM approach in terms of water savings and Irrigation Water Use Efficiency (IWUE). Moreover, the ReLU-based approach maintains enhanced performance in terms of total prescribed irrigation and IWUE compared to the widely-used triggered irrigation scheduling method.</description>

      <title>The Unseen AI Disruptions for Power Grids: LLM-Induced Transients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11416v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent breakthroughs of large language models (LLMs) have exhibited superior capability across major industries and stimulated multi-hundred-billion-dollar investment in AI-centric data centers in the next 3-5 years. This, in turn, bring the increasing concerns on sustainability and AI-related energy usage. However, there is a largely overlooked issue as challenging and critical as AI model and infrastructure efficiency: the disruptive dynamic power consumption behaviour. With fast, transient dynamics, AI infrastructure features ultra-low inertia, sharp power surge and dip, and a significant peak-idle power ratio. The power scale covers from several hundred watts to megawatts, even to gigawatts. These never-seen-before characteristics make AI a very unique load and pose threats to the power grid reliability and resilience. To reveal this hidden problem, this paper examines the scale of AI power consumption, analyzes AI transient behaviour in various scenarios, develops high-level mathematical models to depict AI workload behaviour and discusses the multifaceted challenges and opportunities they potentially bring to existing power grids. Observing the rapidly evolving machine learning (ML) and AI technologies, this work emphasizes the critical need for interdisciplinary approaches to ensure reliable and sustainable AI infrastructure development, and provides a starting point for researchers and practitioners to tackle such challenges.</description>

Abstract: This paper aims to investigate the impact of interference in social network algorithms via user-bot interactions, focusing on the Stochastic Bounded Confidence Model (SBCM). This paper explores two approaches: positioning bots controlled by agents into the network and targeted advertising under various circumstances, operating with an advertising budget. This study integrates the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm and its variants to experiment with different Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). Finally, experimental results demonstrate that this approach can result in efficient opinion shaping, indicating its potential in deploying advertising resources on social platforms.</description>

      <title>Robust Attitude Estimation with Quaternion Left-Invariant EKF and Noise Covariance Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate estimation of noise parameters is critical for optimal filter performance, especially in systems where true noise parameter values are unknown or time-varying. This article presents a quaternion left-invariant extended Kalman filter (LI-EKF) for attitude estimation, integrated with an adaptive noise covariance estimation algorithm. By employing an iterative expectation-maximization (EM) approach, the filter can effectively estimate both process and measurement noise covariances. Extensive simulations demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method in terms of attitude estimation accuracy and robustness to initial parameter misspecification. The adaptive LI-EKF's ability to adapt to time-varying noise characteristics makes it a promising solution for various applications requiring reliable attitude estimation, such as aerospace, robotics, and autonomous systems.</description>

      <title>Three Degree-of-Freedom Soft Continuum Kinesthetic Haptic Display for Telemanipulation Via Sensory Substitution at the Finger</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11606v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sensory substitution is an effective approach for displaying stable haptic feedback to a teleoperator under time delay. The finger is highly articulated, and can sense movement and force in many directions, making it a promising location for sensory substitution based on kinesthetic feedback. However, existing finger kinesthetic devices either provide only one-degree-of-freedom feedback, are bulky, or have low force output. Soft pneumatic actuators have high power density, making them suitable for realizing high force kinesthetic feedback in a compact form factor. We present a soft pneumatic handheld kinesthetic feedback device for the index finger that is controlled using a constant curvature kinematic model. \changed{It has respective position and force ranges of +-3.18mm and +-1.00N laterally, and +-4.89mm and +-6.01N vertically, indicating its high power density and compactness. The average open-loop radial position and force accuracy of the kinematic model are 0.72mm and 0.34N.} Its 3Hz bandwidth makes it suitable for moderate speed haptic interactions in soft environments. We demonstrate the three-dimensional kinesthetic force feedback capability of our device for sensory substitution at the index figure in a virtual telemanipulation scenario.</description>

      <title>Anticipating Oblivious Opponents in Stochastic Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an approach for systematically anticipating the actions and policies employed by \emph{oblivious} environments in concurrent stochastic games, while maximizing a reward function. Our main contribution lies in the synthesis of a finite \emph{information state machine} whose alphabet ranges over the actions of the environment. Each state of the automaton is mapped to a belief state about the policy used by the environment. We introduce a notion of consistency that guarantees that the belief states tracked by our automaton stays within a fixed distance of the precise belief state obtained by knowledge of the full history. We provide methods for checking consistency of an automaton and a synthesis approach which upon successful termination yields such a machine. We show how the information state machine yields an MDP that serves as the starting point for computing optimal policies for maximizing a reward function defined over plays. We present an experimental evaluation over benchmark examples including human activity data for tasks such as cataract surgery and furniture assembly, wherein our approach successfully anticipates the policies and actions of the environment in order to maximize the reward.</description>

      <title>From exponential to finite/fixed-time stability: Applications to optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11713v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of finite/fixed-time stable optimization algorithms typically involves study of specific problem instances. The lack of a unified framework hinders understanding of more sophisticated algorithms, e.g., primal-dual gradient flow dynamics. The purpose of this paper is to address the following question: Given an exponentially stable optimization algorithm, can it be modified to obtain a finite/fixed-time stable algorithm? We provide an affirmative answer, demonstrate how the solution can be computed on a finite-time interval via a simple scaling of the right-hand-side of the original dynamics, and certify the desired properties of the modified algorithm using the Lyapunov function that proves exponential stability of the original system. Finally, we examine nonsmooth composite optimization problems and smooth problems with linear constraints to demonstrate the merits of our approach.</description>

Abstract: This paper investigates payload grasping from a moving platform using a hook-equipped aerial manipulator. First, a computationally efficient trajectory optimization based on complementarity constraints is proposed to determine the optimal grasping time. To enable application in complex, dynamically changing environments, the future motion of the payload is predicted using physics simulator-based models. The success of payload grasping under model uncertainties and external disturbances is formally verified through a robustness analysis method based on integral quadratic constraints. The proposed algorithms are evaluated in a high-fidelity physical simulator, and in real flight experiments using a custom-designed aerial manipulator platform.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Job Shop Scheduling in the Furniture Industry: A Reinforcement Learning Approach Considering Machine Setup, Batch Variability, and Intralogistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the potential application of Deep Reinforcement Learning in the furniture industry. To offer a broad product portfolio, most furniture manufacturers are organized as a job shop, which ultimately results in the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP). The JSSP is addressed with a focus on extending traditional models to better represent the complexities of real-world production environments. Existing approaches frequently fail to consider critical factors such as machine setup times or varying batch sizes. A concept for a model is proposed that provides a higher level of information detail to enhance scheduling accuracy and efficiency. The concept introduces the integration of DRL for production planning, particularly suited to batch production industries such as the furniture industry. The model extends traditional approaches to JSSPs by including job volumes, buffer management, transportation times, and machine setup times. This enables more precise forecasting and analysis of production flows and processes, accommodating the variability and complexity inherent in real-world manufacturing processes. The RL agent learns to optimize scheduling decisions. It operates within a discrete action space, making decisions based on detailed observations. A reward function guides the agent's decision-making process, thereby promoting efficient scheduling and meeting production deadlines. Two integration strategies for implementing the RL agent are discussed: episodic planning, which is suitable for low-automation environments, and continuous planning, which is ideal for highly automated plants. While episodic planning can be employed as a standalone solution, the continuous planning approach necessitates the integration of the agent with ERP and Manufacturing Execution Systems. This integration enables real-time adjustments to production schedules based on dynamic changes.</description>

      <title>Real-Time-Feasible Collision-Free Motion Planning For Ellipsoidal Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12007v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Online planning of collision-free trajectories is a fundamental task for robotics and self-driving car applications. This paper revisits collision avoidance between ellipsoidal objects using differentiable constraints. Two ellipsoids do not overlap if and only if the endpoint of the vector between the center points of the ellipsoids does not lie in the interior of the Minkowski sum of the ellipsoids. This condition is formulated using a parametric over-approximation of the Minkowski sum, which can be made tight in any given direction. The resulting collision avoidance constraint is included in an optimal control problem (OCP) and evaluated in comparison to the separating-hyperplane approach. Not only do we observe that the Minkowski-sum formulation is computationally more efficient in our experiments, but also that using pre-determined over-approximation parameters based on warm-start trajectories leads to a very limited increase in suboptimality. This gives rise to a novel real-time scheme for collision-free motion planning with model predictive control (MPC). Both the real-time feasibility and the effectiveness of the constraint formulation are demonstrated in challenging real-world experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12048v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Differential Dynamic Programming (DDP) is one of the indirect methods for solving an optimal control problem. Several extensions to DDP have been proposed to add stagewise state and control constraints, which can mainly be classified as augmented lagrangian methods, active set methods, and barrier methods. In this paper, we use an interior point method, which is a type of barrier method, to incorporate arbitrary stagewise equality and inequality state and control constraints. We also provide explicit update formulas for all the involved variables. Finally, we apply this algorithm to example systems such as the inverted pendulum, a continuously stirred tank reactor, car parking, and obstacle avoidance.</description>

      <title>Infinite-Horizon Reach-Avoid Zero-Sum Games via Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.10142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.10142v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the infinite-horizon reach-avoid zero-sum game problem, where the goal is to find a set in the state space, referred to as the reach-avoid set, such that the system starting at a state therein could be controlled to reach a given target set without violating constraints under the worst-case disturbance. We address this problem by designing a new value function with a contracting Bellman backup, where the super-zero level set, i.e., the set of states where the value function is evaluated to be non-negative, recovers the reach-avoid set. Building upon this, we prove that the proposed method can be adapted to compute the viability kernel, or the set of states which could be controlled to satisfy given constraints, and the backward reachable set, or the set of states that could be driven towards a given target set. Finally, we propose to alleviate the curse of dimensionality issue in high-dimensional problems by extending Conservative Q-Learning, a deep reinforcement learning technique, to learn a value function such that the super-zero level set of the learned value function serves as a (conservative) approximation to the reach-avoid set. Our theoretical and empirical results suggest that the proposed method could learn reliably the reach-avoid set and the optimal control policy even with neural network approximation.</description>

      <title>Robustness-Guaranteed Observer-Based Control Strategy with Modularity for Cleantech EMLA-Driven Heavy-Duty Robotic Manipulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15843v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces an innovative observer-based modular control strategy in a class of n_a-degree-of-freedom (DoF) fully electrified heavy-duty robotic manipulators (HDRMs) to (1) guarantee robustness in the presence of uncertainties and disturbances, (2) address the complexities arising from several interacting mechanisms, (3) ensure uniformly exponential stability, and (4) enhance overall control performance. To begin, the dynamic model of HDRM actuation systems, which exploits the synergy between cleantech electromechanical linear actuators (EMLAs) and permanent magnet synchronous motors (PMSMs), is investigated. In addition, the reference trajectories of each joint are computed based on direct collocation with B-spline curves to extract the key kinematic and dynamic quantities of HDRMs. To guarantee robust tracking of the computed trajectories by the actual motion states, a novel control methodology, called robust subsystem-based adaptive (RSBA) control, is enhanced through an adaptive state observer. The RSBA control addresses inaccuracies inherent in motion, including modeling errors, non-triangular uncertainties, and both torque and voltage disturbances, to which the EMLA-driven HDRM is susceptible. Furthermore, this approach is presented in a unified generic equation format for all subsystems to mitigate the complexities of the overall control system. By applying the RSBA architecture, the uniformly exponential stability of the EMLA-driven HDRM is proven based on the Lyapunov stability theory. The proposed RSBA control performance is validated through simulations and experiments of the scrutinized PMSM-powered EMLA-actuated mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Stability Mechanisms for Predictive Safety Filters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05496v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Predictive safety filters enable the integration of potentially unsafe learning-based control approaches and humans into safety-critical systems. In addition to simple constraint satisfaction, many control problems involve additional stability requirements that may vary depending on the specific use case or environmental context. In this work, we address this problem by augmenting predictive safety filters with stability guarantees, ranging from bounded convergence to uniform asymptotic stability. The proposed framework extends well-known stability results from model predictive control (MPC) theory while supporting commonly used design techniques. As a result, straightforward extensions to dynamic trajectory tracking problems can be easily adapted, as outlined in this article. The practicality of the framework is demonstrated using an automotive advanced driver assistance scenario, involving a reference trajectory stabilization problem.</description>

      <title>Roadside Units Assisted Localized Automated Vehicle Maneuvering: An Offline Reinforcement Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03935v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traffic intersections present significant challenges for the safe and efficient maneuvering of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs). This research proposes an innovative roadside unit (RSU)-assisted cooperative maneuvering system aimed at enhancing road safety and traveling efficiency at intersections for CAVs. We utilize RSUs for real-time traffic data acquisition and train an offline reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm based on human driving data. Evaluation results obtained from hardware-in-loop autonomous driving simulations show that our approach employing the twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient and behavior cloning (TD3+BC), achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art autonomous driving systems in terms of safety measures while significantly enhancing travel efficiency by up to 17.38% in intersection areas. This paper makes a pivotal contribution to the field of intelligent transportation systems, presenting a breakthrough solution for improving urban traffic flow and safety at intersections.</description>

      <title>Impact of Transmission Dynamics and Treatment Uptake, Frequency and Timing on the Cost-effectiveness of Directly Acting Antivirals for Hepatitis C Virus Infection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19229v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cost-effectiveness analyses, based on decision-analytic models of disease progression and treatment, are routinely used to assess the economic value of a new intervention and consequently inform reimbursement decisions for the intervention. Many decision-analytic models developed to assess the economic value of highly effective directly acting antiviral (DAA) treatments for the hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection do not incorporate the transmission dynamics of HCV, accounting for which is required to estimate the number of downstream infections prevented by curing an infection. In this study, we develop and validate a comprehensive agent-based simulation (ABS) model of HCV transmission dynamics in the Indian context and use it to: (a) quantify the extent to which the cost-effectiveness of a DAA is underestimated - as a function of its uptake rate - if disease transmission dynamics are not considered in a cost-effectiveness analysis model; and (b) quantify the impact of the frequency and timing of treatment with DAAs, also as a function of their uptake rate, within a disease surveillance period on its cost-effectiveness. The process of accomplishing the above research objectives also motivated the development of a novel random sampling and allocation based approach, along with associated theoretical grounding, to estimate individual-level outcomes within an ABS that incurs substantially lower computational expense than the benchmark incremental accumulation approach.</description>

      <title>Optimization and Simulation of Startup Control for Space Nuclear Power Systems with Closed Brayton Cycle based on NuHeXSys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07566v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents the development and optimization of a Space Nuclear Power System (SNPS) utilizing a helium-xenon gas-cooled Closed Brayton Cycle (CBC). A comprehensive dynamic system analysis code NuHeXSys (Nuclear Helium-Xenon Brayton Cycle Power System) was created, integrating non-ideal gas properties, a multi-channel thermal-hydraulic reactor core, and detailed turbo-machinery components. The innovation lies in parametrization of startup control sequence and application of an evolutionary algorithm (NSGA-II) to improve control performance, significantly reducing startup time and energy consumption. Model verification shows parameter deviations within 10%, confirming its accuracy. The optimized control strategy reduced startup time by 1260 seconds and lowered external energy demand by 17%, demonstrating improved efficiency and operational stability for deep space missions. This work provides a foundation for future advancements in optimizing space nuclear power systems.</description>

      <title>Data-driven Modeling of Combined Sewer Systems for Urban Sustainability: An Empirical Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11619v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Climate change poses complex challenges, with extreme weather events becoming increasingly frequent and difficult to model. Examples include the dynamics of Combined Sewer Systems (CSS). Overburdened CSS during heavy rainfall will overflow untreated wastewater into surface water bodies. Classical approaches to modeling the impact of extreme rainfall events rely on physical simulations, which are particularly challenging to create for large urban infrastructures. Deep Learning (DL) models offer a cost-effective alternative for modeling the complex dynamics of sewer systems. In this study, we present a comprehensive empirical evaluation of several state-of-the-art DL time series models for predicting sewer system dynamics in a large urban infrastructure, utilizing three years of measurement data. We especially investigate the potential of DL models to maintain predictive precision during network outages by comparing global models, which have access to all variables within the sewer system, and local models, which are limited to data from a restricted set of local sensors. Our findings demonstrate that DL models can accurately predict the dynamics of sewer system load, even under network outage conditions. These results suggest that DL models can effectively aid in balancing the load redistribution in CSS, thereby enhancing the sustainability and resilience of urban infrastructures.</description>

      <title>Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Multi-Cell Spectrum and Power Allocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.05746v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach to radio resource allocation in multi-cell wireless networks using a fully scalable multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework. A distributed method is developed where agents control individual cells and determine spectrum and power allocation based on limited local information, yet achieve quality of service (QoS) performance comparable to centralized methods using global information. The objective is to minimize packet delays across devices under stochastic arrivals and applies to both conflict graph abstractions and cellular network configurations. This is formulated as a distributed learning problem, implementing a multi-agent proximal policy optimization (MAPPO) algorithm with recurrent neural networks and queueing dynamics. This traffic-driven MARL-based solution enables decentralized training and execution, ensuring scalability to large networks. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed methods achieve comparable QoS performance to genie-aided centralized algorithms with significantly less execution time. The trained policies also exhibit scalability and robustness across various network sizes and traffic conditions.</description>

      <title>Single-Stage Optimization of Open-loop Stable Limit Cycles with Smooth, Symbolic Derivatives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10647v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Open-loop stable limit cycles are foundational to legged robotics, providing inherent self-stabilization that minimizes the need for computationally intensive feedback-based gait correction. While previous methods have primarily targeted specific robotic models, this paper introduces a general framework for rapidly generating limit cycles across various dynamical systems, with the flexibility to impose arbitrarily tight stability bounds. We formulate the problem as a single-stage constrained optimization problem and use Direct Collocation to transcribe it into a nonlinear program with closed-form expressions for constraints, objectives, and their gradients.
  Our method supports multiple stability formulations. In particular, we tested two popular formulations for limit cycle stability in robotics: (1) based on the spectral radius of a discrete return map, and (2) based on the spectral radius of the monodromy matrix, and tested five different constraint-satisfaction formulations of the eigenvalue problem to bound the spectral radius. We compare the performance and solution quality of the various formulations on a robotic swing-leg model, highlighting the Schur decomposition of the monodromy matrix as a method with broader applicability due to weaker assumptions and stronger numerical convergence properties.
  As a case study, we apply our method on a hopping robot model, generating open-loop stable gaits in under 2 seconds on an Intel Core i7-6700K, while simultaneously minimizing energy consumption even under tight stability constraints.</description>

      <title>Quantum Markov Decision Processes: General Theory, Approximations, and Classes of Policies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14649v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, the aim is to develop a quantum counterpart to classical Markov decision processes (MDPs). Firstly, we provide a very general formulation of quantum MDPs with state and action spaces in the quantum domain, quantum transitions, and cost functions. Once we formulate the quantum MDP (q-MDP), our focus shifts to establishing the verification theorem that proves the sufficiency of Markovian quantum control policies and provides a dynamic programming principle. Subsequently, a comparison is drawn between our q-MDP model and previously established quantum MDP models (referred to as QOMDPs) found in the literature. Furthermore, approximations of q-MDPs are obtained via finite-action models, which can be formulated as QOMDPs. Finally, classes of open-loop and classical-state-preserving closed-loop policies for q-MDPs are introduced, along with structural results for these policies. In summary, we present a novel quantum MDP model aiming to introduce a new framework, algorithms, and future research avenues. We hope that our approach will pave the way for a new research direction in discrete-time quantum control.</description>

      <title>Operational Wind Speed Forecasts for Chile's Electric Power Sector Using a Hybrid ML Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09263v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As Chile's electric power sector advances toward a future powered by renewable energy, accurate forecasting of renewable generation is essential for managing grid operations. The integration of renewable energy sources is particularly challenging due to the operational difficulties of managing their power generation, which is highly variable compared to fossil fuel sources, delaying the availability of clean energy. To mitigate this, we quantify the impact of increasing intermittent generation from wind and solar on thermal power plants in Chile and introduce a hybrid wind speed forecasting methodology which combines two custom ML models for Chile. The first model is based on TiDE, an MLP-based ML model for short-term forecasts, and the second is based on a graph neural network, GraphCast, for medium-term forecasts up to 10 days. Our hybrid approach outperforms the most accurate operational deterministic systems by 4-21% for short-term forecasts and 5-23% for medium-term forecasts and can directly lower the impact of wind generation on thermal ramping, curtailment, and system-level emissions in Chile.</description>
