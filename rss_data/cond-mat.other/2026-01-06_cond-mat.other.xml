      <title>Geometry-induced Exceptional Point Detached from Fermi Arcs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exceptional points (EPs), ubiquitous non-Hermitian degeneracies, are central features in band structures where non-Hermitian Fermi arcs connect EPs and eigenvalue knots encircle them. Under open boundary conditions (OBCs), non-Hermitian skin effects enforce complex momenta and yield non-Bloch band structures, introducing EPs unique to OBCs whose origins depend on boundary-driven mechanisms. Here, we reveal both theoretically and experimentally that geometry itself can induce such non-Bloch EPs in a reciprocal non-Hermitian Lieb lattice supporting geometry-dependent skin effects. By analyzing non-Bloch band structures, we find that geometry-induced EPs correspond to saddle points rather than branch points. Branch points, even while carrying OBC eigenenergies, do not yield EPs but manifest as Whitney cusps, a characteristic type of geometric singularity, and Fermi arcs connecting them remain crucial in determining eigenvalue knots. Our measurements of these knots confirm that geometry-induced EPs are detached from the branch points of Fermi arcs, contrasting with their unified counterparts in Bloch systems. Our results establish geometry as an additional degree of freedom for engineering EP-based devices and reveal its fundamental role in shaping non-Bloch band structures.</description>

      <title>Generalized Symmetries in Shallow Water</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09190v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent developments have extended the concept of global symmetries in several directions, offering new perspectives across a wide range of physical systems. This work shows that generalized global symmetries naturally emerge in shallow water systems. In particular, we demonstrate that two subsystem symmetries-previously studied primarily in exotic field theories-arise intrinsically in the dynamics of shallow water flows. A central result is that the local conservation of potential vorticity follows directly from the first subsystem symmetry, revealing that the classic Kelvin circulation theorem is rooted in these symmetries. Notably, the associated charge algebra forms a Kac-Moody current algebra, with the level determined by the spatial variation of the Coriolis parameter. Beyond the first subsystem symmetry, we also identify a second one, construct the corresponding Noether charges, and explore their potential applications.</description>

      <title>Breakdown of the symmetry constraint in a Floquet topological insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19992v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A topological insulator is regarded as an ideal candidate for information storage and high-speed lossless electrical transmission devices due to robust topological protected boundary modes. Previous studies revealed that symmetry exerts an unbreakable constraint on the existence, classes, and orders of its boundary modes. It severely limits the controllability and application of a topological insulator. Here, we propose a Floquet-engineering method to break this symmetry-imposed constraint on a topological insulator. By applying periodic driving on a system belonging to a symmetry class that prohibits the existence of first-order topological phases, we find that rich first-order boundary modes are created. Interestingly, exotic hybrid-order topological insulators with coexisting first-order helical boundary modes and second-order corner modes not only in two different quasienergy gaps but also in one single gap are generated easily by periodic driving. Refreshing the prevailing understanding of symmetry constraint on topological phases, our result opens an avenue for the creation of exotic topological insulators without altering symmetries. It greatly expands the scope of the fabricated materials that host topological insulators.</description>
