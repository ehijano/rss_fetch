      <title>The Boltzmann-Poisson equation with a central body: analytical solutions in one and two dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider an isothermal self-gravitating system surrounding a central body. This model can represent a galaxy or a globular cluster harboring a central black hole. It can also represent a gaseous atmosphere surrounding a protoplanet. In three dimensions, the Boltzmann-Poisson equation must be solved numerically in order to obtain the density profile of the gas [Chavanis {\it et al.}, Phys. Rev. E {\bf 109}, 014118 (2024)]. In one and two dimensions, we show that the Boltzmann-Poisson equation can be solved analytically. We obtain explicit analytical expressions of the density profile around a central body which generalize the analytical solutions found by Camm (1950) and Ostriker (1964) in the absence of a central body. Our results also have applications for self-gravitating Brownian particles (Smoluchowski-Poisson system), for the chemotaxis of bacterial populations (Keller-Segel model), and for two-dimensional point vortices (Onsager's model). In the case of bacterial populations, the central body could represent a supply of ``food'' that attracts the bacteria (chemoattractant). In the case of two-dimensional vortices, the central body could be a central vortex</description>

      <title>Exploring run-and-tumble movement in confined settings through simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motion in bounded domains is a fundamental concept in various fields, including billiard dynamics and random walks on finite lattices, with important applications in physics, ecology and biology. An important universal property related to the average return time to the boundary, the Mean Path Length Theorem (MPLT), has been proposed theoretically and confirmed experimentally in various contexts. In this discussion, we investigate a wide range of mechanisms that lead to deviations from this universal behavior, such as boundary effects, reorientation and memory processes. In particular, this study investigates the dynamics of run-and-tumble particles within a confined two-dimensional circular domain. Through a combination of theoretical approaches and numerical simulations, we validate the MPLT under uniform and isotropic particle inflow conditions. The research demonstrates that although the MPLT is generally applicable for different step length distributions, deviations occur for non-uniform angular distributions, non-elastic boundary conditions or memory processes. These results underline the crucial influence of boundary interactions and angular dynamics on the behaviour of particles in confined spaces. Our results provide new insights into the geometry and dynamics of motion in confined spaces and contribute to a better understanding of a broad spectrum of phenomena ranging from the motion of bacteria to neutron transport. This type of analysis is crucial in situations where inhomogeneity occurs, such as multiple real-world scenarios within a limited domain. This bridges the gap between theoretical models and practical applications in biological and physical systems since the study of the statistics of movement in confined settings can bring some light in explaining the mobility mechanism of active agents.</description>

      <title>Kinetic theory of stellar systems and two-dimensional vortices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the kinetic theory of stellar systems and two-dimensional vortices and stress their analogies. We recall the derivation of the Landau and Lenard-Balescu equations from the Klimontovich formalism. These equations take into account two-body correlations and are valid at the order $1/N$, where $N$ is the number of particles in the system. They have the structure of a Fokker-Planck equation involving a diffusion term and a drift term. The systematic drift of a vortex is the counterpart of the dynamical friction experienced by a star. At equilibrium, the diffusion and the drift terms balance each other establishing the Boltzmann distribution of statistical mechanics. We discuss the problem of kinetic blocking in certain cases and how it can be solved at the order $1/N^2$ by the consideration of three-body correlations. We also consider the behavior of the system close to the critical point following a recent suggestion by Hamilton and Heinemann (2023). We present a simple calculation, valid for spatially homogeneous systems with long-range interactions described by the Cauchy distribution, showing how the consideration of the Landau modes regularizes the divergence of the friction by polarization at the critical point.</description>

      <title>Bifurcation in correlation length of the Ising model on a "Toblerone" lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classical Ising chain is the paradigm for the non-existence of phase transitions in 1D systems and was solved by Ernst Ising one hundred years ago. More recently, a decorated two leg Ising ladder has received interest for the curious thermodynamics that resemble a phase transition; a sharp peak in the specific heat at low, but finite temperature. We use this model to reveal a bifurcation in the correlation lengths due to a crossing of the sub-leading eigenvalues of the transfer matrix, which results in two distinct length scales necessary to describe to the decay of correlations. We discuss this phenomenon in the context of the geometric frustration in the model. We also provide additional results to aid in the understanding of the curious thermodynamics of the model through a study of the magnetic susceptibilities.</description>

      <title>Exact real time dynamics with free fermions in disguise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider quantum spin chains with a hidden free fermionic structure, distinct from the Jordan-Wigner transformation and its generalizations. We express selected local operators with the hidden fermions. This way we can exactly solve the real time dynamics in various physical scenarios, including the computation of selected dynamical two point functions and Loschmidt amplitudes, in continuous or discrete time. In the latter case we build quantum circuits that can be implemented on a quantum computer. With this we extend the family of classically simulable quantum many body processes.</description>

      <title>Interfaces of the two-dimensional voter model in the context of SLE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates various geometrical properties of interfaces of the two-dimensional voter model. Despite its simplicity, the model exhibits dual characteristics, resembling both a critical system with long-range correlations, while also showing a tendency towards order similar to the Ising-Glauber model at zero temperature. This duality is reflected in the geometrical properties of its interfaces, which are examined here from the perspective of Schramm-Loewner evolution. Recent studies have delved into the geometrical properties of these interfaces within different lattice geometries and boundary conditions. We revisit these findings, focusing on a system within a box of linear size $L$ with Dobrushin boundary conditions, where values of the spins are fixed to either $+1$ or $-1$ on two distinct halves of the boundary, in order to enforce the presence of a pinned interface with fixed endpoints (or chordal interface). We also expand the study to compare the geometrical properties of the interfaces of the voter model with those of the critical Ising model and other related models. Scaling arguments and numerical studies suggest that, while locally the chordal interface of the voter model has fractal dimension $d_{\rm f}=3/2$, corresponding to a parameter $\kappa=4$, it becomes straight at large scales, confirming a conjecture made by Holmes et al \cite{holmes}, and ruling out the possibility of describing the chordal interface of the voter model by SLE$_{\kappa}$, for any non zero value of $\kappa$. This contrasts with the critical Ising model, which is described by SLE$_3$, and whose interface fluctuations remain of order $L$, and more generally with related critical models, which are in the same universality class.</description>

      <title>Number of distinct and common sites visited by $N$ independent random walkers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this Chapter, we consider a model of $N$ independent random walkers, each of duration $t$, and each starting from the origin, on a lattice in $d$ dimensions. We focus on two observables, namely $D_N(t)$ and $C_N(t)$ denoting respectively the number of distinct and common sites visited by the walkers. For large $t$, where the lattice random walkers converge to independent Brownian motions, we compute exactly the mean $\langle D_N(t) \rangle$ and $\langle C_N(t) \rangle$. Our main interest is on the $N$-dependence of these quantities. While for $\langle D_N(t) \rangle$ the $N$-dependence only appears in the prefactor of the power-law growth with time, a more interesting behavior emerges for $\langle C_N(t) \rangle$. For this latter case, we show that there is a ``phase transition'' in the $(N, d)$ plane where the two critical line $d=2$ and $d=d_c(N) = 2N/(N-1)$ separate three phases of the growth of $\langle C_N(t)\rangle$. The results are extended to the mean number of sites visited exactly by $K$ of the $N$ walkers. Furthermore in $d=1$, the full distribution of $D_N(t)$ and $C_N(t)$ are computed, exploiting a mapping to the extreme value statistics. Extensions to two other models, namely $N$ independent Brownian bridges and $N$ independent resetting Brownian motions/bridges are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Classical and Quantum Properties of the Spin-Boson Dicke Model: Chaos, Localization, and Scarring</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20381v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This review article describes major advances associated with the Dicke model, starting in the 1950s when it was introduced to explain the transition from a normal to a superradiant phase. Since then, this spin-boson interacting model has raised significant theoretical and experimental interest in various contexts. The present review focuses on the isolated version of the model and covers properties and phenomena that are better understood when seen from both the classical and quantum perspectives, in particular, the onset of chaos, localization, and scarring.</description>

      <title>Active Young-Dupr\'e Equation: How Self-organized Currents Stabilize Partial Wetting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Young-Dupr\'e equation is a cornerstone of the equilibrium theory of capillary and wetting phenomena. In the biological world, interfacial phenomena are ubiquitous, from the spreading of bacterial colonies to tissue growth and flocking of birds, but the description of such active systems escapes the realm of equilibrium physics. Here we show how a microscopic, mechanical definition of surface tension allows us to build an Active Young-Dupr\'e equation able to account for the partial wetting observed in simulations of active particles interacting via pairwise forces. Remarkably, the equation shows that the corresponding steady interfaces do not result from a simple balance between the surface tensions at play but instead emerge from a complex feedback mechanism. The interfaces are indeed stabilized by a drag force due to the emergence of steady currents, which are themselves a by-product of the symmetry breaking induced by the interfaces. These currents also lead to new physics by selecting the sizes and shapes of adsorbed droplets, breaking the equilibrium scale-free nature of the problem. Finally, we demonstrate a spectacular consequence of the negative value of the liquid-gas surface tensions in systems undergoing motility-induced phase separation: partially-immersed objects are expelled from the liquid phase, in stark contrast with what is observed in passive systems. All in all, our results lay the foundations for a theory of wetting in active systems.</description>

      <title>Macroscopic Efimov effect of quantized vortex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The three-body problem, from the chaotic motions of celestial bodies to complex microscopic particle interactions, has always been one of the most foundational yet intricate challenges in physics since its establishment. A key breakthrough in this domain is the Efimov effect, which represents a significant stride in what is now known as Efimov physics. Our study uncovers a macroscopic Efimov effect in a three-component Bose-Einstein Condensate (BEC) system. Through theoretical analysis and numerical simulation, it is verified that under certain conditions, three vortices form a bound state, while removing one vortex causes the others to unbind, demonstrating topological characteristics similar to the Borromean rings, hence termed the `vortex Efimov effect', signifying a novel topological phase transition. We propose several experimental approaches to realize this macroscopic Efimov effect, paving new paths not only in many-body physics but also in exploring quantum phase transitions and applications in quantum information.</description>

      <title>Upscaled equations for the Fokker-Planck diffusion through arrays of permeable and of impermeable inclusions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20741v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the Fokker-Planck diffusion equation with diffusion coefficient depending periodically on the space variable. Inside a periodic array of inclusions the diffusion coefficient is reduced by a factor called the diffusion magnitude. We find the upscaled equations obtained by taking both the degeneration and the homogenization limits in which the diffusion magnitude and the scale of the periodicity tends, respectively, to zero. Different behaviors, classified as pure diffusion, diffusion with mass deposition, and absence of diffusion, are found depending on the order in which the two limits are taken and on the ratio between the size of the inclusions and the scale of the periodicity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a minimal system to study the stochastic formation of Borromean links within topologically entangled networks without requiring the use of knot invariants. Borromean linkages may form in entangled solutions of open polymer chains or in Olympic gel systems such as kinetoplast DNA, but it is challenging to investigate this due to the difficulty of computing three-body link invariants. Here, we investigate randomly oriented rectangles densely packed within a volume, and evaluate them for Hopf linking and Borromean link formation. We show that dense packings of rectangles can form Borromean triplets and larger clusters, and that in high enough density the combination of Hopf and Borromean linking can create a percolating hypergraph through the network. We present data for the percolation threshold of Borromean hypergraphs, and discuss implications for the existence of Borromean connectivity within kinetoplast DNA.</description>

      <title>Finite-size spectrum of the staggered six-vertex model with antidiagonal boundary conditions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20919v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The finite-size spectrum of the critical staggered six-vertex model with antidiagonal boundary conditions is studied. Similar to the case of periodic boundary conditions, we identify three different phases. In two of those, the underlying conformal field theory can be identified to be related to the twisted $U(1)$ Kac-Moody algebra. In contrast, the finite size scaling in the third regime, whose critical behaviour with the quasi-periodic BCs is described by the $SL(2,\mathbb{R})_k/U(1)$ black hole CFT possessing a non-compact degree of freedom, is more subtle. Here with antidiagonal BCs imposed, the corrections to the scaling of the ground state grow logarithmically with the system size, while the energy gaps appear to close logarithmically. Moreover, we obtain an explicit formula for the Q-operator which is useful for numerical implementation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.21011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Eigenstates of observables such as the Hamiltonian play a central role in quantum mechanics. Inspired by the pure Nash equilibria that arise in classical game theory, we propose ''Nash states'' of multiple observables as a generalization of eigenstates of single observables. This generalization is mathematically natural for many-body quantum systems, which possess an intrinsic tensor product structure. Every set of observables gives rise to algebraic varieties of Nash state vectors that we call ''Nash varieties''. We present analytical and numerical results on the existence of Nash states and on the geometry of Nash varieties. We relate these ideas to earlier, pioneering work on the Nash equilibria of few-body quantum games and discuss connections to the variational minimization of local Hamiltonians.</description>

      <title>Interferometry of quantum correlation functions to access quasiprobability distribution of work</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.21041v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Kirkwood-Dirac quasiprobability distribution emerges from the quantum correlation function of two observables measured at distinct times and is therefore relevant for fundamental physics and quantum technologies. These quasiprobabilities follow all but one of Kolmogorov axioms for joint probability distributions: they can take non-positive values. Their experimental reconstruction becomes challenging when expectation values of incompatible observables are involved. Previous strategies aimed to reconstruct them using weak measurements or combining strong measurements. Here, we use a more direct approach, an interferometric scheme aided by an auxiliary system, to reconstruct the Kirkwood-Dirac quasiprobability distribution. We experimentally demonstrate the interferometric scheme in an electron-nuclear spin system associated with a nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond. By measuring the characteristic function, we reconstruct the quasiprobability distribution of the work and analyze the behavior of the first and second moments of work. Our results clarify the physical meaning of the work quasiprobability distribution in the context of quantum thermodynamics. Finally, having measured the real and imaginary parts of the Kirkwood-Dirac quasiprobability of work, we are also able to study the uncertainty of measuring the Hamiltonian of the system at two times, via the Robertson-Schr{\"o}dinger uncertainty relation, for different initial states.</description>

Abstract: A topological quantum number, the Witten index, characterizes supersymmetric models by probing for zero energy modes and the possibility of supersymmetry breaking. We propose an averaging method to infer the Witten index in quantum analogue simulators. Motivated by recent work on Rydberg atoms trapped in optical tweezer arrays, we consider a related supersymmetric XXZ spin model. We show how to infer the Witten index from open system averaging and numerically demonstrate its topological robustness in this model.

      <title>Equilibrium thermodynamic properties of binary hard-sphere mixtures from integral equation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.03961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.03961v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The binary additive hard-sphere mixtures have been studied by the Ornstein-Zernike integral equation coupled with the Martynov-Sarkisov (MS) closure approximation. Virial equation of state is computed in the MS approximation. The excess chemical potential for the mixture is evaluated with a closed-form expression based on correlation functions. The excess Helmholtz free energy is obtained using the Euler relation of thermodynamics. Moreover, these thermodynamic quantities are obtained by the Boubl\'{i}k-Mansoori-Carnahan-Starling-Leland (BMCSL) formulas. Our findings for pressure and excess chemical potential for a number of binary sets of the mixtures from the MS approximation show good agreements with those obtained by the BMCSL formulas and available data in literature, having a maximum deviation of $5\%$ for a packing fraction up to 0.5. The maximum deviation of the excess free energy obtained for the mixtures is shown to be $\sim 16\%$ for a packing fraction of 0.5. To our knowledge, this work presents an initial calculation of an excess chemical potential of the system in the MS approximation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.01973v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider overdamped Brownian particles with two degrees of freedom (DoF) that are confined in a time-varying quadratic potential and are in simultaneous contact with heat baths of different temperatures along the respective DoF. The anisotropy in thermal fluctuations can be used to extract work by suitably manipulating the confining potential. The question of what the maximal amount of work that can be extracted is has been raised in recent work, and has been computed under the simplifying assumption that the entropy of the distribution of particles (thermodynamic states) remains constant throughout a thermodynamic cycle. Indeed, it was shown that the maximal amount of work that can be extracted amounts to solving an isoperimetric problem, where the 2-Wasserstein length traversed by thermodynamic states quantifies dissipation that can be traded off against an area integral that quantifies work drawn out of the thermal anisotropy. Here, we remove the simplifying assumption on constancy of entropy. We show that the work drawn can be computed similarly to the case where the entropy is kept constant while the dissipation can be reduced by suitably tilting the thermodynamic cycle in a thermodynamic space with one additional dimension. Optimal cycles can be locally approximated by solutions to an isoperimetric problem in a tilted lower-dimensional subspace.</description>

      <title>Probing phase transitions with correlations in configuration space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07087v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In principle, the probability of configurations, determined by the system's partition function or wave function, encapsulates essential information about phases and phase transitions. Despite the exponentially large configuration space, we show that the generic correlation of distances between configurations, with a degree of freedom proportional to the lattice size, can probe phase transitions using importance sampling procedures like Monte Carlo simulations. The distribution of sampled distances varies significantly across different phases, suggesting universal critical behavior for uncertainty and participation entropy. For various classical spin models with different phases and transitions, finite-size analysis based on these quantities accurately identifies phase transitions and critical points. Notably, in all cases, the critical exponent derived from the uncertainty of distances equals the anomalous dimension governing real-space correlation decay. Thus, configuration space correlations, defined by distance uncertainties, share the same decay ratio as real-space correlations, determining the universality class of phase transitions. This work applies to diverse lattice models with different local degrees of freedom, e.g., two levels for Ising-like models, discrete multi-levels for q-state clock models, and continuous local levels for the XY model, offering a robust, alternative method for understanding complex phases and transitions.</description>

      <title>TensorKrowch: Smooth integration of tensor networks in machine learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.08595v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tensor networks are factorizations of high-dimensional tensors into networks of smaller tensors. They have applications in physics and mathematics, and recently have been proposed as promising machine learning architectures. To ease the integration of tensor networks in machine learning pipelines, we introduce TensorKrowch, an open source Python library built on top of PyTorch. Providing a user-friendly interface, TensorKrowch allows users to construct any tensor network, train it, and integrate it as a layer in more intricate deep learning models. In this paper, we describe the main functionality and basic usage of TensorKrowch, and provide technical details on its building blocks and the optimizations performed to achieve efficient operation.</description>

      <title>Biorthogonal Dynamical Quantum Phase Transitions in Non-Hermitian Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.02993v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By utilizing biorthogonal bases, we develop a comprehensive framework for studying biorthogonal dynamical quantum phase transitions in non-Hermitian systems. With the help of the previously overlooked associated state, we define the automatically normalized biorthogonal Loschmidt echo. This approach is capable of handling arbitrary non-Hermitian systems with complex eigenvalues and naturally eliminates the negative value of Loschmidt rate obtained without the biorthogonal bases. Taking the non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model as a concrete example, a $1/2$ change of dynamical topological order parameter in biorthogonal bases is observed which is not shown in self-normal bases. Furthermore, we discover that the periodicity of biorthogonal dynamical quantum phase transitions depends on whether the two-level subsystem at the critical momentum oscillates or reaches a steady state.</description>

      <title>Relevant long-range interaction of the entanglement Hamiltonian emerges from a short-range system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.16089v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Beyond the Li-Haldane-Poilblanc conjecture, we find the entanglement Hamiltonian (EH) is actually not closely similar to the original Hamiltonian on the virtual edge. Unexpectedly, the EH has some relevant long-range interacting terms which hugely affect the physics. Without loss of generality, we study a spin-1/2 Heisenberg bilayer to obtain the entanglement information between the two layers through our newly developed quantum Monte Carlo scheme, which can simulate large-scale EH. Although the entanglement spectrum carrying the Goldstone mode seems like a Heisenberg model on a single layer, which is consistent with Li-Haldane-Poilblanc conjecture, we demonstrate that there actually exists a finite-temperature phase transition of the EH. The results violate the Mermin-Wagner theorem, which means there should be relevant long-range terms in the EH. It reveals that the Li-Haldane-Poilblanc conjecture ignores necessary corrections for the EH which may lead totally different physics.</description>

      <title>Learning protein-ligand unbinding pathways via single-parameter community detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.07103v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the dynamics of biomolecular complexes, e.g., of protein-ligand (un)binding, requires the understanding of paths such systems take between metastable states. In MD simulation data, paths are usually not observable per se, but need to be inferred from simulation trajectories. Here we present a novel approach to cluster trajectories based on a community detection algorithm that requires the definition of only a single free parameter. Using the streptavidin-biotin complex as benchmark system and the A\textsubscript{2a} adenosine receptor in complex with the inhibitor ZM241385 as an elaborate application, we demonstrate how such clusters of trajectories correspond to pathways, and how the approach helps in the identification of reaction coordinates for a considered (un)binding process.</description>

      <title>Robust Experimental Signatures of Phase Transitions in the Variational Quantum Eigensolver</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18953v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) is widely considered to be a promising candidate for a quantum-classical algorithm which could achieve near-term quantum advantage. However, current levels of hardware noise can require extensive application of error-mitigation techniques to achieve reliable computations. In this work, we use several IBM devices to explore a finite-size spin model with multiple `phase-like' regions characterized by distinct ground-state configurations. Using pre-optimized VQE solutions, we demonstrate that in contrast to calculating the energy, where zero-noise extrapolation is required in order to obtain qualitatively accurate yet still unreliable results, calculations of the energy derivative, two-site spin correlation functions, and the fidelity susceptibility yield accurate behavior across multiple regions, even with minimal or no application of error-mitigation approaches. Taken together, these sets of observables could be used to identify level crossings in VQE solutions in a simple and noise-robust manner, with potential near-term application to identifying quantum phase transitions, avoided crossings and non-adiabatic conical intersections in electronic structure calculations.</description>

      <title>$N$-player game formulation of the majority-vote model of opinion dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13945v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: From a self-centered perspective, it can be assumed that people only hold opinions that can benefit them. If opinions have no intrinsic value, and acquire their value when held by the majority of individuals in a discussion group, then we have a situation that can be modeled as an $N$-player game. Here we explore the dynamics of (binary) opinion formation using a game-theoretic framework to study an $N$-player game version of Galam's local majority-vote model. The opinion dynamics is modeled by a stochastic imitation dynamics in which the individuals copy the opinion of more successful peers. In the infinite population limit, this dynamics is described by the classical replicator equation of evolutionary game theory. The equilibrium solution shows a threshold separating the initial frequencies that lead to the fixation of one opinion or the other. A comparison with Galam's deterministic model reveals contrasting results, especially in the presence of inflexible individuals, who never change their opinions. In particular, the $N$-player game predicts a polarized equilibrium consisting only of extremists. Using finite-size scaling analysis, we evaluate the critical exponents that determine the population size dependence of the opinion's fixation probability and mean fixation times near the threshold. The results underscore the usefulness of combining evolutionary game theory with opinion dynamics and the importance of statistical physics tools to summarize the results of Monte Carlo simulations.</description>

      <title>Quantum dynamics of the effective field theory of the Calogero-Sutherland model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10011v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the known effective field theory of the Calogero-Sutherland model in the thermodynamic limit of large number of particles, obtained from the standard procedure in conformal field theory: the Hilbert space is constructed a priori in terms of irreducible representations of the symmetry algebra, and not by diagonalization of the hamiltonian, which is given in terms of fields that carry representations of the W-infinity algebra (representing the incompressibility of the Fermi sea). Nevertheless, the role of the effective hamiltonian of the theory is to establish a specific dynamics, which deserves further consideration. We show that the time evolution of the (chiral or antichiral) density field is given by the quantum Benjamin-Ono equation, in agreement with previous results obtained from the alternative description of the continuous limit of the model, based on quantum hydrodynamics. In this study, all calculations are performed at the quantum operator level, without making any assumption on the semiclassical limit of the fields and their equations of motion. This result may be considered as a reliable indication of the equivalence between the quantum field theoretic and quantum hydrodynamical formulations of the effective theories of the model. A one-dimensional quantum compressible fluid that includes both chiralities is the physical picture that emerges for the continuous limit of the Calogero-Sutherland model.</description>

      <title>Elementary Flux Modes as CRN Gears for Free Energy Transduction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17960v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that, for a chemical reaction network (CRN) engaged in energy transduction, its optimal operation from a thermodynamic efficiency standpoint is contingent upon its working conditions. Analogously to the bicycle gear system, CRNs have at their disposal several transducing mechanisms characterized by different yields. We highlight the critical role of the CRN's elementary flux modes in determining this "gearing" and their impact on maximizing energy transduction efficiency. Furthermore, we introduce an enzymatically regulated CRN, engineered to autonomously adjust its "gear", thereby optimizing its efficiency under different external conditions.</description>

      <title>Ion Correlation-Driven Hysteretic Adhesion and Repulsion between Opposing Polyelectrolyte Brushes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19329v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Polyelectrolyte (PE) brushes are widely used in biomaterials and nanotechnology to regulate surface properties and interactions. Here, we apply the electrostatic correlation augmented self-consistent field theory to investigate the interactions between opposing PE brushes in a mixture of 1:1 and 3:1 salt solutions. Our theory predicts hysteretic feature of the normal stress induced by strong ion correlations. In the presence of trivalent ions, the force profile is discontinuous: repulsive in the compression branch and adhesive in the separation branch. The molecular origin of the hysteretic force is the coexistence of two collapsed modes: two separated condensed layer on each surface in the compression and a single bundled condensed layer in the separation. With the systematic inclusion of ion correlations, our theory fully captures the hysteretic force, adhesive separation, ``jump-in'' and ``jump-out'' features, and the ``specific ion effect'', all in good agreement with the reported experimental results.</description>
