      <title>An Upper Bound on the Number of Generalized Cospectral Mates of Oriented Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines the spectral characterizations of oriented graphs. Let $\Sigma$ be an $n$-vertex oriented graph with skew-adjacency matrix $S$. Previous research mainly focused on self-converse oriented graphs, proposing arithmetic conditions for these graphs to be uniquely determined by their generalized skew-spectrum ($\mathrm{DGSS}$). However, self-converse graphs are extremely rare; this paper considers a more general class of oriented graphs $\mathcal{G}_{n}$ (not limited to self-converse graphs), consisting of all $n$-vertex oriented graphs $\Sigma$ such that $2^{-\left \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \right \rfloor }\det W(\Sigma)$ is an odd and square-free integer, where $W(\Sigma)=[e,Se,\dots,S^{n-1}e]$ ($e$ is the all-one vector) is the skew-walk matrix of $\Sigma$. Given that $\Sigma$ is cospectral with its converse $\Sigma^{\rm T}$, there always exists a unique regular rational orthogonal $Q_0$ such that $Q_0^{\rm T}SQ_0=-S$. This study reveals that there exists a deep relationship between the level $\ell_0$ of $Q_0$ and the number of generalized cospectral mates of $\Sigma$. More precisely, we show, among others, that the maximum number of generalized cospectral mates of $\Sigma\in\mathcal{G}_{n}$ is at most $2^{t}-1$, where $t$ is the number of prime factors of $\ell_0$. Moreover, some numerical examples are also provided to demonstrate that the above upper bound is attainable. Finally, we also provide a criterion for the oriented graphs $\Sigma\in\mathcal{G}_{n}$ to be weakly determined by the generalized skew-spectrum ($\mathrm{WDGSS})$.</description>

      <title>Spectral radius and Hamiltonicity of uniform hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $n$ and $r$ be integers with $n-2\ge r\ge 3$. We prove that any $r$-uniform hypergraph $\mathcal{H}$ on $n$ vertices with spectral radius $\lambda(\mathcal{H}) &gt; \binom{n-2}{r-1}$ must contain a Hamiltonian Berge cycle unless $\mathcal{H}$ is the complete graph $K_{n-1}^r$ with one additional edge. This generalizes a result proved by Fiedler and Nikiforov for graphs. As part of our proof, we show that if $|\mathcal{H}| &gt; \binom{n-1}{r}$, then $\mathcal{H}$ contains a Hamiltonian Berge cycle unless $\mathcal{H}$ is the complete graph $K_{n-1}^r$ with one additional edge, generalizing a classical theorem for graphs.</description>

      <title>Lower bounds on collective additive spanners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we present various lower bound results on collective tree spanners and on spanners of bounded treewidth. A graph $G$ is said to admit a system of $\mu$ collective additive tree $c$-spanners if there is a system $\cal{T}$$(G)$ of at most $\mu$ spanning trees of $G$ such that for any two vertices $u,v$ of $G$ a tree $T\in \cal{T}$$(G)$ exists such that the distance in $T$ between $u$ and $v$ is at most $c$ plus their distance in $G$. A graph $G$ is said to admit an additive $k$-treewidth $c$-spanner if there is a spanning subgraph $H$ of $G$ with treewidth $k$ such that for any pair of vertices $u$ and $v$ their distance in $H$ is at most $c$ plus their distance in $G$. Among other results, we show that:
  $\bullet$ Any system of collective additive tree $1$ -- spanners must have $\Omega(\sqrt[3]{\log n})$ spanning trees for some unit interval graphs;
  $\bullet$ No system of a constant number of collective additive tree $2$-spanners can exist for strongly chordal graphs;
  $\bullet$ No system of a constant number of collective additive tree $3$-spanners can exist for chordal graphs;
  $\bullet$ No system of a constant number of collective additive tree $c$-spanners can exist for weakly chordal graphs as well as for outerplanar graphs for any constant $c\geq 0$;
  $\bullet$ For any constants $k \ge 2$ and $c \ge 1$ there are graphs of treewidth $k$ such that no spanning subgraph of treewidth $k-1$ can be an additive $c$-spanner of such a graph.
  All these lower bound results apply also to general graphs. Furthermore, they %results complement known upper bound results with tight lower bound results.</description>

      <title>Tutte's theorem as an educational formalization project</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18146v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present two results: The first result is the formalization of Tutte's theorem in Lean, a key theorem concerning matchings in graph theory. As this formalization is ready to be integrated in Lean's mathlib, it provides a valuable step in the path towards formalizing research-level mathematics in this area. The second result is a framework for doing educational formalization projects. This framework provides a structure to learn to formalize mathematics with minimal teacher input. This framework applies to both traditional academic settings and independent community-driven environments. We demonstrate the framework's use by connecting it to the process of formalizing Tutte's theorem.</description>

      <title>Ergodic theorems for bilinear averages, Roth's Theorem and Corners along fractional powers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18307v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that for every $c\in(1,23/22)$, every probability space $(X,\mathcal{B},\mu)$ equipped with two commuting measure-preserving transformations $T,S\colon X\to X$ and every $f,g\in L^{\infty}_{\mu}(X)$ we have that the $L^2_{\mu}(X)$-limit \[ \lim_{N\to\infty}\frac{1}{N}\sum_{n=1}^Nf(T^{\lfloor n^c\rfloor}x)g(S^{\lfloor n^c\rfloor}x) \] equals the $L^2_{\mu}(X)$-limit $\lim_{N\to\infty}\frac{1}{N}\sum_{n=1}^Nf(T^{n}x)g(S^{n}x)$. The approach is based on the author's recently developed technique which may be thought of as a change of variables. We employ it to establish several new results along fractional powers including a Roth-type result for patterns of the form $x,x+\lfloor y^c \rfloor,x+2\lfloor y^c \rfloor$ as well as its ''corner'' counterpart. The quantitative nature of the former result allows us to recover the analogous one in the primes. Our considerations give partial answers to Problem 29 and Problem 30 from Frantzikinakis' open problems survey on multiple ergodic averages. Notably, we cover more general sparse orbits $(\lfloor h(n)\rfloor)_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$, where $h$ belongs to the class of the so-called $c$-regularly varying functions, addressing for example even the orbit $(\lfloor n\log n\rfloor)_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$.</description>

      <title>Computing Distances on Graph Associahedra is Fixed-parameter Tractable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An elimination tree of a connected graph $G$ is a rooted tree on the vertices of $G$ obtained by choosing a root $v$ and recursing on the connected components of $G-v$ to obtain the subtrees of $v$. The graph associahedron of $G$ is a polytope whose vertices correspond to elimination trees of $G$ and whose edges correspond to tree rotations, a natural operation between elimination trees. These objects generalize associahedra, which correspond to the case where $G$ is a path. Ito et al. [ICALP 2023] recently proved that the problem of computing distances on graph associahedra is NP-hard. In this paper we prove that the problem, for a general graph $G$, is fixed-parameter tractable parameterized by the distance $k$. Prior to our work, only the case where $G$ is a path was known to be fixed-parameter tractable. To prove our result, we use a novel approach based on a marking scheme that restricts the search to a set of vertices whose size is bounded by a (large) function of $k$.</description>

      <title>On constrained intersection representations of graphs and digraphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.18365v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of determining optimal directed intersection representations of DAGs in a model introduced by Kostochka, Liu, Machado, and Milenkovic [ISIT2019]: vertices are assigned color sets so that there is an arc from a vertex $u$ to a vertex $v$ if and only if their color sets have nonempty intersection and $v$ gets assigned strictly more colors than $u$, and the goal is to minimize the total number of colors. We show that the problem is polynomially solvable in the class of triangle-free and Hamiltonian DAGs and also disclose the relationship of this problem with several other models of intersection representations of graphs and digraphs.</description>

Abstract: A Cayley hyper-digraph is a directed hypergraph that its automorphism group contains a subgroup acting regularly on vertices and a Cayley hypermap is a hypermap whose automorphism group contains a subgroup which induces regular action on the hypervertex set. In this paper, we study Cayley hyper-digraphs and construct Cayley hypermaps which have high level of symmetry. Our main goal is to present the general theory so as to make it clear to study Cayley hypermaps.</description>

      <title>More on the number of distinct values of a class of functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03655v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a previous article, the authors determined the first (and at the time of writing, the only) non-trivial upper bound for the cardinality of the image set for several classes of functions, including planar functions. Here, we show that the upper bound cannot be tight for planar functions over $\mathbb F_{q}$, with the possible exception of $q=343.$ We further show that if such an exception exists, then it implies the existence of a projective plane of order 18.
  This follows from more general upper bound results, which apply to a wider class of functions. To determine these bounds, we first resolve a problem related to Gauss' well-known result on triangular sums. By doing so, we are then able to approach our problem via a well-studied Diophantine problem, which eventually yields upper bounds that are related to class numbers of quadratic number fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04433v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we examine the unimodality and strict unimodality of certain formal bivariate Laurent series with non-negative coefficients. We show that the sets of these formal bivariate Laurent series form commutative semirings under the operations of addition and multiplication of formal Laurent series. This result is used to establish the unimodality of sequences involving Gauss polynomials and certain refined color partitions. In particular, we solve an open problem posed by Andrews on the unimodality of generalized Gauss polynomials and establish an unimodal result for a statistic of plane partitions. We also establish many unimodal results for rank statistics in partition theory, including the rank statistics of concave and convex compositions studied by Andrews, as well as certain unimodal sequences studied by Kim-Lim-Lovejoy. Additionally, we establish the unimodality of the Betti numbers and Gromov-Witten invariants of certain Hilbert schemes of points.</description>

      <title>Hall-Littlewood polynomials, affine Schubert series, and lattice enumeration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08075v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce multivariate rational generating series called Hall-Littlewood-Schubert ($\mathsf{HLS}_n$) series. They are defined in terms of polynomials related to Hall-Littlewood polynomials and semistandard Young tableaux. We show that $\mathsf{HLS}_n$ series provide solutions to a range of enumeration problems upon judicious substitutions of their variables. These include the problem to enumerate sublattices of a $p$-adic lattice according to the elementary divisor types of their intersections with the members of a complete flag of reference in the ambient lattice. This is an affine analog of the stratification of Grassmannians by Schubert varieties. Other substitutions of $\mathsf{HLS}_n$ series yield new formulae for Hecke series and $p$-adic integrals associated with symplectic $p$-adic groups, and combinatorially defined quiver representation zeta functions. $\mathsf{HLS}_n$ series are $q$-analogs of Hilbert series of Stanley-Reisner rings associated with posets arising from parabolic quotients of Coxeter groups of type $\mathsf{B}$ with the Bruhat order. Special values of coarsened $\mathsf{HLS}_n$ series yield analogs of the classical Littlewood identity for the generating functions of Schur polynomials.</description>

      <title>The General Position Problem: A Survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.19385v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inspired by a chessboard puzzle of Dudeney, the general position problem in graph theory asks for a largest set $S$ of vertices in a graph such that no three elements of $S$ lie on a common shortest path. The number of vertices in such a largest set is the \emph{general position number} of the graph. This paper provides a survey of this rapidly growing problem, which now has an extensive literature. We cover exact results for various graph classes and the behaviour of the general position number under graph products and operations. We also discuss interesting variations of the general position problem, including those corresponding to different graph convexities, as well as dynamic, fractional, colouring and game versions of the problem.</description>

Abstract: In 1988, Bj\"{o}rner and Kalai [Acta Math. 161 (3--4) (1988) 279--303] extended the classic Euler-Poincar\'{e} theorem by introducing certain nonlinear relations between the $f$-vector and the Betti sequence of simplicial complexes. In this paper, we present an equivalent characterization of Bj\"{o}rner and Kalai's nonlinear relations using a number-theoretic approach. Moreover, we strengthen a result of Bj\"{o}rner and Kalai concerning the maximal element of Betti sequences with respect to a fixed $f$-vector and the minimal element of $f$-vectors with respect to a fixed Betti sequence.</description>

A cycle of order $m$ is denoted by $C_{m}$. A lot of studies have been done in recent years on the Ramsey number $R(B_{n}, C_{m})$. However, the exact value remains unknown for several $n$ and $m$. In 2021, Lin and Peng obtained the value of $R(B_{n}, C_{m})$ under certain conditions on $n$ and $m$. In this paper, they remarked that the value is still unknown for the range $n\in [\frac{9m}{8}-125, 4m-14]$. In a recent paper, Hu et al. determined the value of the book-cycle Ramsey number within the range $n\in [ \frac{3m-5}{2}-125, 4m]$ where $m$ is odd and $n$ is sufficiently large. In this article, we extend the investigation to smaller values of $n$. We have obtained a bound of $R(B_{n}, C_{m})$ if $n\in [2m-3, 4m-14]$ and $m\geq 7$ is odd. This is a progress on the earlier result. A connected graph $G$ is said to be \emph{$H$-good} if the formula, \begin{equation*} R(G,H)= (|G|-1)(\chi(H)-1)+\sigma(H) \end{equation*} holds, where $\chi(H)$ is the chromatic number of $H$ and $\sigma(H)$ is the size of the smallest colour class for the $\chi(H)$-colouring. In this article, we have studied the \emph{Ramsey goodness} of the graph pair $(C_{m}, \mathbb{K}_{2,n})$, where $\mathbb{K}_{2,n}$ is the complete biparite graph. We have obtained an exact value of $R(\mathbb{K}_{2,n},C_{m})$ for all $n$ satisfying $n\geq 3493$ and $n\geq 2m+499$ where $m\geq 7$ is odd. This shows that $\mathbb{K}_{2,n}$ is $C_{m}$-good, which extends a previous result on the Ramsey goodness of $(C_{m}, \mathbb{K}_{2,n})$. Also, this improves the lower bound on $n$ from a previous result on the Ramsey number $R(B_{n}, C_{m})$</description>

      <title>On graphs with a simple structure of maximal cliques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16863v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We say that a hereditary graph class $\mathcal{G}$ is \emph{clique-sparse} if there is a constant $k=k(\mathcal{G})$ such that for every graph $G\in\mathcal{G}$, every vertex of $G$ belongs to at most $k$ maximal cliques, and any maximal clique of $G$ can be intersected in at most $k$ different ways by other maximal cliques.
  We provide various characterisations of clique-sparse graph classes, including a list of five parametric forbidden induced subgraphs. We show that recent techniques for proving induced analogues of Menger's Theorem and the Grid Theorem of Robertson and Seymour can be lifted to prove induced variants in clique-sparse graph classes when replacing ``treewidth'' by ''tree-independence number''.</description>

      <title>Memories of Ian G. Macdonald</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07882v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This is a slightly edited translation of a paper in Dutch which appeared in Nieuw Archief voor Wiskunde (5) 25 (2024), No.2, 87-90 on the occasion of I.G. Macdonald's death in 2023, and aimed at a very broad mathematical audience. First we review some of Macdonald's most important older results. Then we focus on the period 1985-1995 when Macdonald often visited the Netherlands and there was much interaction between his work, notably the Macdonald polynomials, and the work by the authors. We end with some glimpses about Macdonald as a person.</description>

      <title>Characters of symmetric groups: sharp bounds on virtual degrees and the Witten zeta function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04347v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove sharp bounds on the virtual degrees introduced by Larsen and Shalev. This leads to improved bounds on characters of symmetric groups. We then sharpen bounds of Liebeck and Shalev concerning the Witten zeta function. Our main application is a characterization of the fixed-point free conjugacy classes whose associated random walk mixes in 2 steps.</description>

      <title>Two Proofs of a Structural Theorem of Decreasing Minimization on Integrally Convex Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06463v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper gives two different proofs to a structural theorem of decreasing minimization (lexicographic optimization) on integrally convex sets. The theorem states that the set of decreasingly minimal elements of an integrally convex set can be represented as the intersection of a unit discrete cube and a face of the convex hull of the given integrally convex set. The first proof resorts to the Fenchel-type duality theorem in discrete convex analysis and the second is more elementary using Farkas' lemma.</description>

      <title>Light Edge Fault Tolerant Graph Spanners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10890v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There has recently been significant interest in fault tolerant spanners, which are spanners that still maintain their stretch guarantees after some nodes or edges fail. This work has culminated in an almost complete understanding of the three-way tradeoff between stretch, sparsity, and number of faults tolerated. However, despite some progress in metric settings, there have been no results to date on the tradeoff in general graphs between stretch, lightness, and number of faults tolerated.
  We initiate the study of light edge fault tolerant (EFT) graph spanners, obtaining the first such results. First, we observe that lightness can be unbounded if we use the traditional definition (normalizing by the MST). We then argue that a natural definition of fault-tolerant lightness is to instead normalize by a min-weight fault tolerant connectivity preserver; essentially, a fault-tolerant version of the MST. However, even with this, we show that it is still not generally possible to construct $f$-EFT spanners whose weight compares reasonably to the weight of a min-weight $f$-EFT connectivity preserver.
  In light of this lower bound, it is natural to then consider bicriteria notions of lightness, where we compare the weight of an $f$-EFT spanner to a min-weight $(f' &gt; f)$-EFT connectivity preserver. The most interesting question is to determine the minimum value of $f'$ that allows for reasonable lightness upper bounds. Our main result is a precise answer to this question: $f' = 2f$. In particular, we show that the lightness can be untenably large (roughly $n/k$ for a $k$-spanner) if one normalizes by the min-weight $(2f-1)$-EFT connectivity preserver. But if one normalizes by the min-weight $2f$-EFT connectivity preserver, then we show that the lightness is bounded by just $O(f^{1/2})$ times the non-fault tolerant lightness (roughly $n^{1/k}$, for a $(1+\epsilon)(2k-1)$-spanner).</description>
