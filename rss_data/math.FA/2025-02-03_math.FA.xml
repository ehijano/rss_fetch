      <title>Maximal Function and Atomic Characterizations of Matrix-Weighted Hardy Spaces with Their Applications to Boundedness of Calder\'on--Zygmund Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $p\in(0,1]$ and $W$ be an $A_p$-matrix weight, which in scalar case is exactly a Muckenhoupt $A_1$ weight. In this article, we introduce matrix-weighted Hardy spaces $H^p_W$ via the matrix-weighted grand non-tangential maximal function and characterize them, respectively, in terms of various other maximal functions and atoms, both of which are closely related to matrix weights under consideration and their corresponding reducing operators. As applications, we first establish the finite atomic characterization of $H^p_W$, then using it we give a criterion on the boundedness of sublinear operators from $H^p_W$ to any $\gamma$-quasi-Banach space, and finally applying this criterion we further obtain the boundedness of Calder\'on--Zygmund operators on $H^p_W$. The main novelty of these results lies in that the aforementioned maximal functions related to reducing operators are new even in the scalar weight case and we characterize these matrix-weighted Hardy spaces by a fresh and natural variant of classical weighted atoms via first establishing a Calder\'on--Zygmund decomposition which is also new even in the scalar weight case.</description>

      <title>Geometric characterizations of ${\sf PI}$ spaces: an overview of some modern techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We survey recent results on the study of metric measure spaces satisfying a Poincar\'e inequality. We overview recent characterizations in terms of objects of dimension 1, such as pencil of curves, modulus estimates and obstacle-avoidance principles. Then, we turn our attention to characterizations in terms of objects of codimension 1, such as relative isoperimetric inequalities and separating sets, the last one obtained in collaboration with N. Cavallucci in [arXiv:2401.02762]. We propose a strategy to provide examples using our characterization in the toy-model of the Euclidean case. We also discuss a more geometric relation between separating sets and obstacle-avoidance principles, obtained in [IMRN, Vol. 2025, Issue 1, Jan. 2025, rnae276]. Finally, we recall some open questions in the field.</description>

      <title>Optimal transportation and pressure at zero temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given two compact metric spaces $X$ and $Y$, a Lipschitz continuous cost function $c$ on $X \times Y$ and two probabilities $\mu \in\mathcal{P}(X),\,\nu\in\mathcal{P}(Y)$, we propose to study the Monge-Kantorovich problem and its duality from a zero temperature limit of a convex pressure function. We consider the entropy defined by $H(\pi) = -D_{KL}(\pi|\mu\times \nu)$, where $D_{KL}$ is the Kullback-Leibler divergence, and then the pressure defined by the variational principle \[P(\beta A) = \sup_{\pi \in \Pi(\mu,\nu)} \left[ \smallint \beta A\,d\pi + H(\pi)\right],\]where $\beta&gt;0$ and $A=-c$. We will show that it admits a dual formulation and when $\beta \to+\infty$ we recover the solution for the usual Monge-Kantorovich problem and its Kantorovich duality. Such approach is similar to one which is well known in Thermodynamic Formalism and Ergodic Optimization, where $\beta$ is interpreted as the inverse of the temperature ($\beta = \frac{1}{T}$) and $\beta\to+\infty$ is interpreted as a zero temperature limit.</description>

      <title>Some compact-like properties in non-archimedean functional analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.13476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.13476v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: First, we define some concepts similar to the local compactoidity or the c-compactness, and study relationships between these concepts and the original ones. As a result, we find a characterization of the local compactoidity when its coefficient field is spherically complete. Moreover, from the point of view of the minimum principle, we give a necessary and sufficient condition for the c-compactness under a suitable condition. Secondly, we try a new approach to a non-complete local compactoid, which gives us a different perspective than before. Thirdly, we study the non-archimedean Goldstine theorem and Eberlein-Smulian theorem. Consequently, if the coefficient field is spherically complete, we get results completely different from the classical ones. Finally, we give a new result about the closed range theorem by using epicompactness.</description>

      <title>Range decreasing group homomorphisms and weighted composition operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04707v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present necessary and sufficient conditions for a group homomorphism between spaces of smooth sections of Lie group bundles to be a weighted composition operator. These results provide new insights into a wide range of problems related to weighted composition operators. Specifically, we prove that the algebraic structure of the space of smooth sections of an algebra bundle, where the typical fiber is a positive dimensional simple unital algebra, completely determines the bundle structure. Furthermore, we derive a homomorphism version of the Shanks-Pursell theorem and identify a class of homomorphisms of multiplicative semigroups between spaces of smooth functions on finite dimensional manifolds, including all isomorphisms. Our approach is based on a method called range decreasing group homomorphisms.</description>
