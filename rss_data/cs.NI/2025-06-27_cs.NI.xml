      <title>Drift-Adaptive Slicing-Based Resource Management for Cooperative ISAC Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel drift-adaptive slicing-based resource management scheme for cooperative integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) networks. Particularly, we establish two network slices to provide sensing and communication services, respectively. In the large-timescale planning for the slices, we partition the sensing region of interest (RoI) of each mobile device and reserve network resources accordingly, facilitating low-complexity distance-based sensing target assignment in small timescales. To cope with the non-stationary spatial distributions of mobile devices and sensing targets, which can result in the drift in modeling the distributions and ineffective planning decisions, we construct digital twins (DTs) of the slices. In each DT, a drift-adaptive statistical model and an emulation function are developed for the spatial distributions in the corresponding slice, which facilitates closed-form decision-making and efficient validation of a planning decision, respectively. Numerical results show that the proposed drift-adaptive slicing-based resource management scheme can increase the service satisfaction ratio by up to 18% and reduce resource consumption by up to 13.1% when compared with benchmark schemes.</description>

      <title>Flowcut Switching: High-Performance Adaptive Routing with In-Order Delivery Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Network latency severely impacts the performance of applications running on supercomputers. Adaptive routing algorithms route packets over different available paths to reduce latency and improve network utilization. However, if a switch routes packets belonging to the same network flow on different paths, they might arrive at the destination out-of-order due to differences in the latency of these paths. For some transport protocols like TCP, QUIC, and RoCE, out-of-order (OOO) packets might cause large performance drops or significantly increase CPU utilization. In this work, we propose flowcut switching, a new adaptive routing algorithm that provides high-performance in-order packet delivery. Differently from existing solutions like flowlet switching, which are based on the assumption of bursty traffic and that might still reorder packets, flowcut switching guarantees in-order delivery under any network conditions, and is effective also for non-bursty traffic, as it is often the case for RDMA.</description>

      <title>Rational Miner Behaviour, Protocol Stability, and Time Preference: An Austrian and Game-Theoretic Analysis of Bitcoin's Incentive Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper integrates Austrian capital theory with repeated game theory to examine strategic miner behaviour under different institutional conditions in blockchain systems. It shows that when protocol rules are mutable, effective time preference rises, undermining rational long-term planning and cooperative equilibria. Using formal game-theoretic analysis and Austrian economic principles, the paper demonstrates how mutable protocols shift miner incentives from productive investment to political rent-seeking and influence games. The original Bitcoin protocol is interpreted as an institutional anchor: a fixed rule-set enabling calculability and low time preference. Drawing on the work of Bohm-Bawerk, Mises, and Hayek, the argument is made that protocol immutability is essential for restoring strategic coherence, entrepreneurial confidence, and sustainable network equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Inside Job: Defending Kubernetes Clusters Against Network Misconfigurations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kubernetes has emerged as the de facto standard for container orchestration. Unfortunately, its increasing popularity has also made it an attractive target for malicious actors. Despite extensive research on securing Kubernetes, little attention has been paid to the impact of network configuration on the security of application deployments. This paper addresses this gap by conducting a comprehensive analysis of network misconfigurations in a Kubernetes cluster with specific reference to lateral movement. Accordingly, we carried out an extensive evaluation of 287 open-source applications belonging to six different organizations, ranging from IT companies and public entities to non-profits. As a result, we identified 634 misconfigurations, well beyond what could be found by solutions in the state of the art. We responsibly disclosed our findings to the concerned organizations and engaged in a discussion to assess their severity. As of now, misconfigurations affecting more than thirty applications have been fixed with the mitigations we proposed.</description>

      <title>Anonymized Network Sensing Graph Challenge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08115v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The MIT/IEEE/Amazon GraphChallenge encourages community approaches to developing new solutions for analyzing graphs and sparse data derived from social media, sensor feeds, and scientific data to discover relationships between events as they unfold in the field. The anonymized network sensing Graph Challenge seeks to enable large, open, community-based approaches to protecting networks. Many large-scale networking problems can only be solved with community access to very broad data sets with the highest regard for privacy and strong community buy-in. Such approaches often require community-based data sharing. In the broader networking community (commercial, federal, and academia) anonymized source-to-destination traffic matrices with standard data sharing agreements have emerged as a data product that can meet many of these requirements. This challenge provides an opportunity to highlight novel approaches for optimizing the construction and analysis of anonymized traffic matrices using over 100 billion network packets derived from the largest Internet telescope in the world (CAIDA). This challenge specifies the anonymization, construction, and analysis of these traffic matrices. A GraphBLAS reference implementation is provided, but the use of GraphBLAS is not required in this Graph Challenge. As with prior Graph Challenges the goal is to provide a well-defined context for demonstrating innovation. Graph Challenge participants are free to select (with accompanying explanation) the Graph Challenge elements that are appropriate for highlighting their innovations.</description>

      <title>LoRaConnect: Unlocking HTTP Potential on LoRa Backbones for Remote Areas and Ad-Hoc Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02469v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Minimal infrastructure requirements make LoRa suitable for service delivery in remote areas. Additionally, web applications have become a de-facto standard for modern service delivery. However, Long Range (LoRa) fails to enable HTTP access due to its limited bandwidth, payload size limitations, and high collisions in multi-user setups. We propose LoRaConnect to enable HTTP access over LoRa. The LoRaWeb hardware tethers a WiFi hotspot to which client devices connect and access HTTP resources over LoRa backhaul. It implements caching and synchronization mechanisms to address LoRa's aforementioned limitations. It also implements a message-slicing method in the application layer to overcome LoRa's payload limitations. We evaluate the proposed system using actual hardware in three experimental setups to assess the baseline performance, ideal scenario, and practical application scenario with Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum (FHSS). Additionally, it implements a ping operation to demonstrate Internet capability and extensible nature. LoRaWeb achieves an average throughput of 1.18 KB/S approximately, with an access delay of only 1.3 S approximately for a 1.5KB webpage in the baseline setup. Moreover, it achieves an access delay of approximately 6.7 S for a 10KB webpage in the ideal case and an average end-to-end delay of only 612 ms approximately in the FHSS-based setup. Comparison with benchmark suggests multi-fold improvement.</description>

      <title>ALLSTaR: Automated LLM-Driven Scheduler Generation and Testing for Intent-Based RAN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18389v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The evolution toward open, programmable O-RAN and AI-RAN 6G networks creates unprecedented opportunities for Intent-Based Networking (IBN) to dynamically optimize RAN[...]. However, applying IBN effectively to the RAN scheduler [...] remains a significant challenge. Current approaches predominantly rely on coarse-grained network slicing, lacking the granularity for dynamic adaptation to individual user conditions and traffic patterns. Despite the existence of a vast body of scheduling algorithms [...], their practical utilization is hindered by implementation heterogeneity, insufficient systematic evaluation in production environments, and the complexity of developing high-performance scheduler implementations.[...] To address these limitations, we propose ALLSTaR (Automated LLm-driven Scheduler generation and Testing for intent-based RAN), a novel framework leveraging LLMs for automated, intent-driven scheduler design, implementation, and evaluation. ALLSTaR interprets NL intents, automatically generates functional scheduler code from the research literature using OCR and LLMs, and intelligently matches operator intents to the most suitable scheduler(s). Our implementation deploys these schedulers as O-RAN dApps, enabling on-the-fly deployment and testing on a production-grade, 5G-compliant testbed. This approach has enabled the largest-scale OTA experimental comparison of 18 scheduling algorithms automatically synthesized from the academic literature. The resulting performance profiles serve as the input for our Intent-Based Scheduling (IBS) framework, which dynamically selects and deploys appropriate schedulers that optimally satisfy operator intents. We validate our approach through multiple use cases unattainable with current slicing-based optimization techniques, demonstrating fine-grained control based on buffer status, physical layer conditions, and heterogeneous traffic types</description>

      <title>Towards Event-Triggered NMPC for Efficient 6G Communications: Experimental Results and Open Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18589v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Networked control systems enable real-time control and coordination of distributed systems, leveraging the low latency, high reliability, and massive connectivity offered by 5G and future 6G networks. Applications include autonomous vehicles, robotics, industrial automation, and smart grids. Despite networked control algorithms admitting nominal stability guarantees even in the presence of delays and packet dropouts, their practical performance still heavily depends on the specific characteristics and conditions of the underlying network. To achieve the desired performance while efficiently using communication resources, co-design of control and communication is pivotal. Although periodic schemes, where communication instances are fixed, can provide reliable control performance, unnecessary transmissions, when updates are not needed, result in inefficient usage of network resources. In this paper, we investigate the potential for co-design of model predictive control and network communication. To this end, we design and implement an event-triggered nonlinear model predictive controller for stabilizing a Furuta pendulum communicating over a tailored open radio access network 6G research platform. We analyze the control performance as well as network utilization under varying channel conditions and event-triggering criteria. Additionally, we analyze the network-induced delay pattern and its interaction with the event-triggered controller. Our results show that the event-triggered control scheme achieves similar performance to periodic control with reduced communication demand.</description>

      <title>The Starlink Robot: A Platform and Dataset for Mobile Satellite Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19781v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The integration of satellite communication into mobile devices represents a paradigm shift in connectivity, yet the performance characteristics under motion and environmental occlusion remain poorly understood. We present the Starlink Robot, the first mobile robotic platform equipped with Starlink satellite internet, comprehensive sensor suite including upward-facing camera, LiDAR, and IMU, designed to systematically study satellite communication performance during movement. Our multi-modal dataset captures synchronized communication metrics, motion dynamics, sky visibility, and 3D environmental context across diverse scenarios including steady-state motion, variable speeds, and different occlusion conditions. This platform and dataset enable researchers to develop motion-aware communication protocols, predict connectivity disruptions, and optimize satellite communication for emerging mobile applications from smartphones to autonomous vehicles. The project is available at https://github.com/StarlinkRobot.</description>
