      <title>Survival and Detection of Symmetry-Protected Topology in Loop Quenches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore a class of dynamical protocols - that we term loop quenches - which are tailored for the study of symmetry-protected topological (SPT) systems. In loop quenches, SPT phases can survive even out of equilibrium, thus evading the dynamical violation of their protecting symmetry. Moreover, we demonstrate that employing loop quenches allows to detect the equilibrium topology via measurable dynamical quantities. Focusing on chiral-SPT phases, we introduce the Loschmidt chirality amplitude as a key observable that encodes the equilibrium topological invariant. We exemplify our method for chiral-symmetric one-dimensional two-band insulators and propose a pump-probe measurement scheme which allows to extract the amplitude in question. Our protocol uncovers a direct dynamical signature of SPT phases and, most importantly, paves the way for a general diagnostic framework that can be extended to other symmetry classes and dimensions.</description>

      <title>Orbital dependent Coulomb drag in electron-hole bilayer graphene heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report Coulomb drag studies in an electron-hole bilayer graphene heterostructure in a magnetic field, where the orbital, spin, and valley degrees of freedom are lifted by the combined effects of exchange interaction, Zeeman energy, and vertical displacement field. Our device enables the application of a large vertical displacement field in both layers. In addition to the well-established strong Coulomb drag between Landau levels with an orbital quantum number N = 0, we observe a Coulomb drag signal between the N = 1 Landau levels under a suitable vertical displacement field. As the displacement field increases further, the Coulomb drag signal between N = 1 Landau levels weakens, and a Coulomb drag signal emerges between the N = 0 and N = 1 Landau levels. These findings suggest the important roles of the orbital index and vertical displacement field in interlayer Coulomb interactions within the quantum Hall regime of coupled bilayer systems.</description>

      <title>Giant Shift Current in Electrically-Tunable Superlattice Bilayer Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent introduction of superlattice potentials has opened new avenues for engineering tunable electronic band structures featuring topologically nontrivial moir\'{e}-like bands. Here we consider optoelectronic properties of Bernal-stacked graphene subjected to a superlattice potential either electrostatically or through lattice twisting to show that it exhibits a giant shift current response that is orders of magnitude larger than existing predictions in twisted mulitlayer systems. Effects of gate voltage and the strength and phase of the superlattice potential on the shift current are delineated systematically across various topological regimes. Our study gives insight into the nature of nonlinear responses of materials and how these responses could be optimized by tuning the superlattice potential.</description>

      <title>Planar Hall effects in $X$-wave magnets with $X=p,d,g,f,i$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The planar Hall effect is a phenomenon that the Hall conductivity emerges perpendicular to the electric field in the presence of an in-plane magnetic field. We investigate the planar Hall effect in two-dimensional higher symmetric $X$-wave magnets with $X=p,d,f,g,i$, where those with $X=d,g,i$ are altermagnets. The $X$-wave magnet is characterized by the number $N_{X}$ of the nodes in the band structure, where $N_{X}=1,2,3,4,6$ corresponding to $X=p,d,f,g,i$. We demonstrate that the Hall conductivities are almost half quantized and well approximated by the formula $\sigma _{xy}=\pm (e^{2}/2h)$ sgn$\left( J\sin N_{X}\Phi \right) $, where $J$ is the coefficient of the coupling between the $X$-wave magnet and the electrons, and $\Phi $ is the direction of the applied magnetic field. Hence, the Hall conductivity has the periodicity with respect to $\Phi $, and the periodicity is equal to the number $N_{X}$ of the nodes. This property may be used to confirm that the target material is indeed an $X$-wave magnet. Furthermore, the sign of $J$ may be used as a bit for antiferromagnetic spintronics.</description>

      <title>Entropy of a double quantum dot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use charge sensing to detect entropy changes in a double quantum dot defined by electrostatic gating of a GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructure. This system can be tuned to be two separate systems, like two independent, artificial atoms, or a single coherent system, like a molecule. We study entropy changes in both regimes due to changes in the occupation of the system. First we recover the single-dot result for each dot, that the occupation of the dot by a single electron corresponds to an increase in the entropy of $k_{\mathrm{B}} \log 2$. Next we examine two different charge transitions in the "molecular" regime, and how it reveals itself in terms of the measured entropy. We also uncover a realization of Pauli blockade that clutters the entropy signal. By applying a rate equation model, we demonstrate the effect's nonequilibrium origins and exclude it from the analysis of the system's entropy. Understanding these experiments in this simplest coupled system enables the study of the entropy in other, more complicated coupled quantum systems, such as ones with topological or highly entangled ground states.</description>

      <title>Twist-angle tunable Josephson junctions in three-dimensional superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the superconducting phase and perpendicular Josephson supercurrent in twisted three-dimensional (3D) superconductors, where two layered 3D materials are stacked with a relative twist. We formulate the Bogoliubov-de Gennes Hamiltonian and develop a self-consistent method to calculate the superconducting order parameter and the resulting supercurrent. Applying this framework to a toy model with Fermi surfaces located near the Brillouin zone corners, we demonstrate a phase discontinuity at the twisted interface, indicating that a Josephson junction is formed purely by the twist. Our calculations reveal that the interface supports a finite critical current even when the Fermi surfaces of the two superconductors are completely separated, unlike in the case of a twisted normal-metal interface. We further show that the critical current can be effectively controlled by the twist angle, transitioning from a high-transparency regime at small angles to a low-transparency regime at larger angles.</description>

      <title>Phonon interference effects in GaAs-GaP superlattice nanowires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fine-tuning the functional properties of nanomaterials is crucial for technological applications. Superlattices, characterized by periodic repetitions of two or more materials in different dimensions, have emerged as a promising area of investigation. We present a study of the phonon interference effect on thermal transport in GaAs-GaP superlattice nanowires with sharp interfaces between the GaAs and GaP layers, as confirmed by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. We performed thermal conductivity measurements using the so-called thermal bridge method on superlattice nanowires with a period varying from 4.8 to 23.3 nm. The measurements showed a minimum of the thermal conductivity as a function of superlattice period up to room temperature, that we interpreted as an indication of the crossover from coherent to incoherent thermal transport. Notably, this effect is not destroyed by surface boundary or by phonon-phonon scattering, as the crossover trend is also observed at room temperature. Our results were corroborated by both ab initio lattice dynamics and semiclassical nonequilibrium molecular dynamics calculations. These findings provide insights into the wave-like and particle-like transport of phonons in superlattice nanowires and demonstrate the potential for engineering thermal properties through precise control of the superlattice structure.</description>

      <title>Laser-induced topological phases in monolayer amorphous carbon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Driving non-topological materials out of equilibrium using time-periodic perturbations, such as circularly-polarized laser light, is a compelling way to engineer topological phases. At the same time, topology has traditionally only been considered for crystalline materials. Here we propose an experimentally feasible way of driving monolayer amorphous carbon topological. We show that circularly polarized laser light induces both regular and anomalous edge modes at quasienergies $0$ and $\pm \pi$, respectively. We also obtain complete topological characterization using an energy- and space-resolved topological marker based on the spectral localizer. Additionally, by introducing atomic coordination defects in the amorphous carbon, we establish the importance of the local atomic structure in topological amorphous materials. Our work establishes amorphous systems, including carbon, as a versatile and abundant playground to engineer topological phases.</description>

      <title>Resonantly enhanced polariton-mediated superconductivity in a doped transition metal dichalcogenide monolayer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a proposal for achieving light-induced superconductivity using exciton polaritons - hybrid light-matter particles of excitons (bound electron-hole pairs) and microcavity photons. In contrast to previous theories of polariton-mediated superconductivity, which typically require multiple semiconductor layers, we show that superconductivity can be induced within a single semiconductor monolayer with inverted conduction bands, such as in the tungsten-based transition metal dichalcogenides. The key ingredient is that we can resonantly excite exciton polaritons into bands that are different from those occupied by the doped electrons, thus avoiding any Pauli blocking effects. Crucially, we can exploit the trion fine structure (i.e., multiple exciton-electron bound states) and tune the electron-polariton interactions via Feshbach resonances. Our theory of polariton-mediated superconductivity includes the energy dependence of the polariton-mediated interactions between electrons, as well as the polariton-induced changes to the electron quasiparticles. We find that superconductivity at elevated temperatures is within reach of current experiments.</description>

      <title>Quasi-1D Electronic Metadevices with Enhanced Electrical Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electronic metadevices leveraging sub-wavelength metallic features have shown great potential for high-frequency switching. Theoretical analysis based on a one-dimensional (1D) model indicates that reducing the size of subwavelength features can enhance electrical properties, such as contact resistance and switching cutoff frequency. Here, we report higher-than-expected contact resistance in electronic metadevices when the subwavelength feature size is aggressively downscaled. We attribute this effect to transverse currents in the two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) running parallel to the stripe width. We present the first experimental demonstration of a metadevice governed by a one-dimensional model, which we refer to as a quasi-1D electronic metadevice and show that it enables enhanced electrical performance. Our findings pave the way to design next generation electronic metadevice switches with applications in future telecommunication circuits.</description>

      <title>Switching of a closed mobile vacancy based memristor, whose specific resistance linearly depends on local vacancy concentration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The linear (proportional to local vacancy concentration) term in specific resistance of the material does not directly contribute to the change of memristor's total resistance when the vacancies are redistributed inside while keeping their total number constant. But it still changes kinetics of the vacancy drift under the influence of a passing electric current. These changes are especially significant in the presence of metal-insulator phase transition in the memristor's material. In this paper, kinetic equation for local vacancy concentration is obtained, and exact solutions for its steady states are analyzed. It is shown that not only in the weakly nonlinear case (when the dependence of the specific resistance on the vacancy concentration can be neglected), but also in a strongly non-linear memristor with phase transition, its kinetics can be reduced to the classical exactly solvable Burgers equation.</description>

      <title>Oscillating bound states in waveguide-QED system with two giant atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the bound states in the continuum (BIC) in a system of two identical two-level giant atoms coupled to a one-dimensional waveguide. By deriving general dark-state conditions, we clarify how coupling configurations and atomic parameters influence decay suppression. Through analysis of the long-time dynamical behaviors of atoms and bound photons, we carry out a detailed classification of bound states and explore the connections between these dynamical behaviors and the system's intrinsic light-matter interactions. The system supports static bound states with persistent atomic excitations, and oscillating bound states with periodic atom-photon or atom-atom excitation exchange. Under certain conditions, oscillating bound states can contain more harmonic components owing to the emergence of additional quasi-dark modes, rendering them promising platforms for high-capacity quantum information processing. These findings advance the understanding of BIC in waveguide quantum electrodynamics with multiple giant atoms and reveal their prospective applications in quantum technologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.09387v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In superconductors with multiple pairing channels, Bardasis-Schrieffer modes and clapping modes arise as fluctuations in channels whose angular momenta differ from that of the pair condensate. Crystal symmetries often impose selection rules which keep these modes optically dark. We show that if pairing occurs around a single Fermi surface, trigonal warping renders both of these modes, as well as the quasiparticle excitation gap, visible in the longitudinal and Hall optical responses. Our results suggest that rhombohedral graphene multilayers, which are believe to host the required ingredients, might offer an ideal setting for the study of exotic superconducting collective modes.</description>

      <title>Energetically Favored One-Dimensional Moir\'e Superstructure in the Pseudo-Square Lattice GdTe3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Moir\'e engineering in layered crystals has recently gained considerable attention due to the discovery of various structural and physical phenomena, including interfacial reconstruction, superconductivity, magnetism, and distinctive optoelectronic properties. Nevertheless, most explored moir\'e systems have been limited to hexagonal lattices, thereby constraining a comprehensive understanding and technological application of moir\'e phenomena in general layered crystals. Here, we investigate GdTe3, a pseudo-tetragonal layered crystal, as a platform to explore unconventional moir\'e phenomena. GdTe3 exhibits a slight in-plane distortion correlated with the direction of charge density wave formation. Through vertical stacking of layers with different distortions-induced via a controlled strain/release process-we realize energetically favorable one-dimensional (1D) moir\'e superstructures. Using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), including high-resolution scanning TEM imaging, dark-field TEM imaging, and sample tilting experiments, we systematically examine stacking variations across the 1D moir\'e structure. Additionally, electron energy loss spectroscopy reveals modulations in electronic properties associated with the 1D moir\'e structure. Our findings expand the scope of moir\'e systems beyond conventional hexagonal twistronics, enabling exploration of moir\'e phenomena in low-symmetry van der Waals crystals.</description>

      <title>Density Matrix Renormalization Group Study of Domain Wall Qubits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11585v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nanoscale topological spin textures in magnetic systems are emerging as promising candidates for scalable quantum architectures. Despite their potential as qubits, previous studies have been limited to semiclassical approaches, leaving a critical gap: the lack of a fully quantum demonstration. Here, we address this challenge by employing the density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method to establish domain wall (DW) qubits in coupled quantum spin-1/2 chains. We calculate the ground-state energies and excitation gaps of the system and find that DWs with opposite chiralities form a well-defined low-energy sector, distinctly isolated from higher excited states in the presence of anisotropies. This renders the chirality states suitable for encoding quantum information, serving as robust qubits. Interestingly, when a magnetic field is applied, we observe tunneling between quantum DW states with opposite chiralities. Through quantum simulations, we construct an effective qubit Hamiltonian that exhibits strongly anisotropic $g$-factors, offering a way to implement single-qubit gates. Furthermore, we obtain an effective interacting Hamiltonian for two mobile DWs in coupled quantum spin chains from DMRG simulations, enabling the implementation of two-qubit gates.Single-qubit and two-qubit gates are also demonstrated in real-time simulations using the time-dependent variational principle. Our work represents a critical step from semiclassical constructions to a fully quantum demonstration of the potential of DW textures for scalable quantum computing, establishing a solid foundation for future quantum architectures based on topological magnetic textures.</description>

      <title>Fractional chiral second-order topological insulator from a three-dimensional array of coupled wires</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06101v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a model of a three-dimensional chiral second-order topological insulator (SOTI) from an array of weakly coupled nanowires. We show that, in a suitable parameter regime, the interplay between rotating magnetic fields and spatially modulated interwire tunnelings leads to the opening of gaps in the bulk and surface spectrum of the system, while one or more chiral hinge states propagating along a closed path of one-dimensional hinges are left gapless. The exact path of these hinge states is determined by the hierarchy of interwire couplings and the boundary termination of the sample. Depending on the ratio between the period of the rotating magnetic field and the Fermi wavelength, our model can realize both integer and fractional chiral SOTIs. The fractional regime emerges in the presence of strong electron-electron interactions and features hinge states carrying only a fraction $e/p$ of the electronic charge $e$ for a positive odd integer $p$.</description>

      <title>Entanglement mediated by DC current induced nonreciprocal graphene plasmonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.10085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.10085v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate entanglement mediated by DC current induced nonreciprocal graphene plasmon polaritons. Nonreciprocal systems are ideal for the enhancement, control, and preservation of entanglement due to the potential for unidirectional beam-like wave propagation, i.e., efficiently transporting photons from one emitter to another. Using a quantum master equation and three-dimensional Green's function analysis, we investigate a system consisting of two two-level emitters dominantly interacting via electric current induced nonreciprocal plasmonic modes of a graphene waveguide. We use concurrence as a measure of entanglement. We show that nonreciprocal graphene plasmon polaritons are a promising candidate to generate and mediate concurrence, where it is shown that there is good enhancement and control of entanglement over vacuum, which is beneficial for the broad applications of entanglement as a quantum resource. We believe our findings contribute to the development of quantum devices, enabling efficient and tunable entanglement between two-level systems, which is a central goal in quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Surface Plasmon Polaritons: Creation Dynamics and Interference of Slow and Fast Propagating SPPs at a Temporal Boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20686v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish the theoretical framework for a material system that supports surface plasmon polaritions (SPPs) excited by a dipole excitation, where the media configuration suddenly changes at a temporal boundary. We employ three-dimensional Green's function analysis in the Laplace transform domain. We use this framework to demonstrate dynamic SPP formation and time-boundary-induced interference of slow and fast propagating SPPs. This analysis provides insight into how SPPs are formed in time and how they interfere at a temporal boundary.</description>
