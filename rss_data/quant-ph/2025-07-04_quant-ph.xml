      <title>Switchable coherent state stored quantum batteries with large ergotropies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum battery (QB) is a conceptually new energy storage and conversion device, which consists usually of a quantum charger and an energy store (called usually as the QB for simplicity). The demonstrated advantage of QB, over its classical counterpart, is that its charging efficiency can be significantly enhanced by using quantum entanglement resources. In this letter, we investigate alternatively how to realize the switchable charging and the lossless power detection of the charged QB. With the proposed QB configuration we show that, by adjusting the eigenfrequency of the qubit-based charger, the cavity-based QB can be switched on between the charging and power-off states and its stored energy can be non-destructively monitored by probing the transmitted spectrum of the external electromagnetic waves scattered by the qubit-based charger. As the qubit-based charger has never been excited, the proposed cavity-based QB could directly store the coherent state energy (rather than the single-photon one) and thus possess significantly large ergotropy. The physical realization of the proposed switchable QB configuration is demonstrated specifically with the experimental circuit quantum electrodynamical devices.</description>

      <title>Efficient characterization of coherent and correlated noise in layers of gates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a quantum process tomography protocol based on a low-degree ansatz for the quantum channel, i.e. when it can be expressed as a fixed-degree polynomial in terms of Pauli operators. We demonstrate how to perform tomography of such channels with a polynomial amount of effort relative to the size of the system, by employing random state preparation and measurements in the Pauli basis. We extend the applicability of the protocol to channels consisting of a layer of quantum gates with a fixed number of non-Clifford gates, followed by a low-degree noise channel. Rather than inverting the layer of quantum gates in the hardware, which would introduce new errors, we effectively carry out the inversion by classical post-processing while maintaining the protocol's efficiency. Numerical simulations support our theoretical findings and demonstrate the feasibility of our method.</description>

      <title>Topological Reality Switch: Towards Bulk-Boundary Selective Lasing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of complex spectra in non-Hermitian systems causes dramatic changes even under weak perturbations, significantly hindering their precise control for study and integration into practical applications. Achieving a controlled method to generate a real spectrum in non-Hermitian systems has long been a key objective in the field. In this study, we explore the 2D non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model and introduce a reality switch that allows for the controllable induction of a real spectrum depending on the imposed boundary condition. We show that a topological phase transition in the complex gap accompanies the switching process. Our work lays the cornerstone for developing a selective bulk-boundary control mechanism for the gain and lasing behaviors in non-Hermitian systems.</description>

      <title>Scaling Quantum Algorithms via Dissipation: Avoiding Barren Plateaus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) have enabled a wide range of applications on near-term quantum devices. However, their scalability is fundamentally limited by barren plateaus, where the probability of encountering large gradients vanishes exponentially with system size. In addition, noise induces barren plateaus, deterministically flattening the cost landscape. Dissipative quantum algorithms that leverage nonunitary dynamics to prepare quantum states via engineered cooling offer a complementary framework with remarkable robustness to noise. We demonstrate that dissipative quantum algorithms based on non-unital channels can avoid both unitary and noise-induced barren plateaus. Periodically resetting ancillary qubits actively extracts entropy from the system, maintaining gradient magnitudes and enabling scalable optimization. We provide analytic conditions ensuring they remain trainable even in the presence of noise. Numerical simulations confirm our predictions and illustrate scenarios where unitary algorithms fail but dissipative algorithms succeed. Our framework positions dissipative quantum algorithms as a scalable, noise-resilient alternative to traditional VQAs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I show that incoherent dynamics can lead to metrological advantages in quantum sensing. The results rely on the fact that incoherent dynamics lead to an additive contribution to the quantum Fisher information about time. Such an additive contribution can lead to a decrease in the error of optimal estimation protocols, as implied by the quantum Cram\'er-Rao bound. I characterize regimes in which the estimation of a time interval or a frequency is enhanced by noise, thus identifying cases where incoherent dynamics serve as a metrological resource. I illustrate with protocols that display improved sensing of time intervals or global fields by qubit and photonic sensor networks.</description>

      <title>Selective Feature Re-Encoded Quantum Convolutional Neural Network with Joint Optimization for Image Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Machine Learning (QML) has seen significant advancements, driven by recent improvements in Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. Leveraging quantum principles such as entanglement and superposition, quantum convolutional neural networks (QCNNs) have demonstrated promising results in classifying both quantum and classical data. This study examines QCNNs in the context of image classification and proposes a novel strategy to enhance feature processing and a QCNN architecture for improved classification accuracy. First, a selective feature re-encoding strategy is proposed, which directs the quantum circuits to prioritize the most informative features, thereby effectively navigating the crucial regions of the Hilbert space to find the optimal solution space. Secondly, a novel parallel-mode QCNN architecture is designed to simultaneously incorporate features extracted by two classical methods, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Autoencoders, within a unified training scheme. The joint optimization involved in the training process allows the QCNN to benefit from complementary feature representations, enabling better mutual readjustment of model parameters. To assess these methodologies, comprehensive experiments have been performed using the widely used MNIST and Fashion MNIST datasets for binary classification tasks. Experimental findings reveal that the selective feature re-encoding method significantly improves the quantum circuit's feature processing capability and performance. Furthermore, the jointly optimized parallel QCNN architecture consistently outperforms the individual QCNN models and the traditional ensemble approach involving independent learning followed by decision fusion, confirming its superior accuracy and generalization capabilities.</description>

      <title>88Sr+ ion trap apparatus for generating 408 nm photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe a 88Sr+ ion trap apparatus with the capability to produce high-quality 408 nm photons aimed at distributed quantum computing and networking applications. This instrument confines ion chains using a surface electrode trap with a two-dimensional magneto-optical trap as an atomic source. Several laser systems spanning 400-1100 nm are used to achieve high fidelity state preparation and readout. Photons are produced via the decay of an exited state, which is accessed using a custom 408 nm laser system that produces 150 ps optical pulses using non-linear photonics. We demonstrate single photon production through a Hanbury Brown-Twiss measurement for one to six ions.</description>

      <title>Thermal Effects in the Casimir Torque between Birefringent Plates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Casimir effect, originating from quantum and thermal fluctuations, is well known for inducing forces between closely spaced surfaces. When these surfaces are optically anisotropic, these interactions can produce a Casimir torque that rotates the surfaces relative to each other. We investigate, for the first time, the influence of thermal fluctuations on the Casimir torque between birefringent plates. Our results reveal that thermal modes significantly diminish the torque, with reductions up to 2 orders of magnitude for highly birefringent materials. Temperature is also shown to alter the angular dependence of the torque, significantly deviating from the typical sinusoidal behavior, and becomes particularly important at large separations that exceed the thermal wavelength. Finally, we demonstrate that systems of dissimilar birefringent plates that exhibit a distance-dependent reversal in the torque's direction can enable precise control of the torque's magnitude and sign through temperature manipulation. These findings advance our understanding of quantum and thermal fluctuation interplay and provide a framework for designing innovative nanoscale sensors and devices leveraging Casimir torque phenomena.</description>

      <title>Classification of four-qubit pure codes and five-qubit absolutely maximally entangled states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that every 5-qubit absolutely maximally entangled (AME) state is equivalent by a local unitary transformation to a point in the unique ((5,2,3)) quantum error correcting code C. Furthermore, two points in C are equivalent if and only if they are related by a group of order 24 acting on C. There exists a set of 3 invariant polynomials that separates equivalence classes of 5-qubit AME states. We also show that every 4-qubit pure code is equivalent to a subspace of the unique ((4,4,2)) and construct an infinite family of 3-uniform n-qubit states for even $n\geq 6$. The proofs rely heavily on results from Vinberg and classical invariant theory.</description>

      <title>Entanglement groups for mixed states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend an operational characterization of entanglement in terms of stabilizer groups from pure states to mixed states. For a density matrix $\rho_{AB}$, a stabilizer is a factorized unitary matrix $u_A \otimes u_B$ that, under conjugation, leaves $\rho_{AB}$ invariant. The entanglement group is a quotient of the stabilizer group, in which one-party stabilizers are considered trivial. This definition relates the entanglement of a density matrix to the entanglement of its purification. We give general properties of entanglement groups for mixed states, then discuss special properties for separable states. For a separable state, the entanglement group may be non-trivial. However it can only arise from multi-party entanglement with the purifying system.</description>

      <title>Thermal Noise Measurement Below the Standard Quantum Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a method characterizing thermal noise in an optical cavity independent from quantum noise despite the thermal noise falling below the quantum noise limit. Using this method, we measured the thermal noise contribution from a GaAs AlGaAs micro-mirror suspended on a GaAs cantilever microresonator when brought to a cryogenic temperature (approximately 25 K) and incorporated into a Fabry Perot cavity. An optical spring is formed in this optical cavity. Previously, this setup exploited an optical spring to produce a displacement sensitivity falling 2.8 dB below the free-mass standard quantum limit (SQL), as reported by Cullen et. al. Here we use a similar setup to measure thermal noise which fell a maximum of 5 dB below the SQL. This measurement, in turn, allowed for an investigation of quantum noise suppression resulting from the optical spring effect, falling a maximum of 10 dB below the SQL.</description>

      <title>Photon number projective measurement in Schr\"odinger cat quantum state preparation procedure after parametric down-conversion interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The preparation of bright Schr\"odinger cat (SC) states is of great interest for various areas of quantum technologies. In our previous paper, we proposed a probabilistic procedure for preparing SC states using degenerate spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) with depleting pump mode and subsequent projective measurement in the pump mode. In this paper, we aim to provide our interpretation of this process which is could be used to build more general theory -- fully theoretical understanding of SPDC with depleting pump mode, which is currently was not provided in quantum domain. We also report that even-photon measurement also allows obtaining SC states, albeit less bright.</description>

      <title>Scattering States in One-Dimensional Non-Hermitian Baths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A single quantum emitter coupled to a structured non-Hermitian environment shows anomalous bound states and real-time dynamics without Hermitian counterparts, as shown in [Gong et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 129, 223601 (2022)]. In this work, we establish a general approach for studying the scattering states of a single quantum emitter coupled to one-dimensional non-Hermitian single-band baths. We formally solve the exact eigenvalue equation for all the scattering states defined on finite periodic lattices. In the thermodynamic limit, the formal solution reduces to the celebrated Lippmann-Schwinger equation for generic baths. In this case, we find that the scattering states are no longer linear superpositions of plane waves in general, unlike those in Hermitian systems; Instead, the wave functions exhibit a large, yet finite localization length proportional to the lattice size. Furthermore, we show and discuss the cases where the Lippmann-Schwinger equation breaks down. We find the analytical solutions for the Hatano-Nelson and unidirectional next-to-nearest-neighbor baths in the thermodynamic limit.</description>

      <title>Bias-tailored single-shot quantum LDPC codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum hardware rarely suffers equal amounts of bit-flip ($X$) and phase-flip ($Z$) errors; one type is often much more common than the other. A code that is ``bias-tailored'' can exploit this imbalance, lowering the fault-tolerance overhead. A complementary idea, called "single-shot" error correction, aims to recover from data errors and noisy measurements in a single round of stabilizer readout, avoiding slow repetition cycles. In this work, we combine these two ideas and build a hierarchy of new quantum codes.
  The full construction starts from the syndrome-encoded hypergraph product code and then tailors it to the dominant error type. The resulting code keeps the single-shot guarantee for every noise model while boosting the threshold whenever $X$ and $Z$ errors are asymmetric.
  By removing carefully chosen blocks of stabilizers we obtain two trimmed variants. The first, called the simplified code, cuts the physical-qubit count by $1/6$ and halves the number of stabilizer measurements, yet its minimum distance grows quadratically compared to the standard design and its biased noise threshold is unchanged. The second, called the reduced code, achieves the same hardware savings but trades away single-shot protection for purely $X$ or purely $Z$ noise; instead it remains single-shot under balanced, or depolarizing, noise. In settings where strongly biased noise is likely, either trimmed code offers a less resource-intensive alternative to the full construction.
  As a concrete illustration, we lift the two-dimensional XZZX surface code to a three-dimensional cubic lattice and show that this ``3D XZZX'' code is an explicit member of the simplified family.
  Taken together, these bias-tailored single-shot codes provide an adjustable set of code design alternatives, allowing tradeoffs between hardware overhead and noise types.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum lock-in amplification raises the detection sensitivity of magnetic fields to unprecedented level by phase-locked pumping the Zeeman levels of a single trapped atom. To further enhance this sensitivity, quadrature squeezing could be introduced to overcome the quantum uncertainty limit. We propose a detection scheme using an atomic ensemble whose collected spin is pumped by two lasers for simultaneous squeezing and phase locking. We derive the optimal $\pi/2$-pulse and $\pi$-pulse schemes that accomplishes this concurrent action and prove that the resulting phase sensitivity is enhanced while the usable detection window for phase locking is widened.</description>

      <title>Mixed-state phases from local reversibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a refined definition of mixed-state phase equivalence based on locally reversible channel circuits. We show that such circuits preserve topological degeneracy and the locality of all operators including both strong and weak symmetries. Under a locally reversible channel, weak unitary symmetries are locally dressed into channel symmetries, a new generalization of symmetry for open quantum systems. For abelian higher-form symmetries, we show the refined definition preserves anomalies and spontaneous breaking of such symmetries within a phase. As a primary example, a two-dimensional classical loop ensemble is trivial under the previously adopted definition of mixed-state phases. However, it has non-trivial topological degeneracy arising from a mutual anomaly between strong and weak 1-form symmetries, and our results show that it is not connected to a trivial state via locally reversible channel circuits.</description>

      <title>Quantum Mpemba Effects from Symmetry Perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-equilibrium dynamics have become a central research focus, exemplified by the counterintuitive Mpemba effect where initially hotter systems can cool faster than colder ones. Studied extensively in both classical and quantum regimes, this phenomenon reveals diverse and complex behaviors across different systems. This review provides a concise overview of the quantum Mpemba effect (QME), specifically emphasizing its connection to symmetry breaking and restoration in closed quantum many-body systems. We begin by outlining the classical Mpemba effect and its quantum counterparts, summarizing key findings. Subsequently, we introduce entanglement asymmetry and charge variance as key metrics for probing the QME from symmetry perspectives. Leveraging these tools, we analyze the early- and late-time dynamics of these quantities under Hamiltonian evolution and random unitary circuits. We conclude by discussing significant challenges and promising avenues for future research.</description>

      <title>A global quantum network with ground-based single-atom memories in optical cavities and satellite links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The realization of a global quantum network holds the potential to enable groundbreaking applications such as secure quantum communication and blind quantum computing. However, building such a network remains a formidable challenge, primarily due to photon loss in optical fibers. In this work, we propose a quantum repeater architecture for distributing entanglement over intercontinental distances by leveraging low-Earth-orbit satellites equipped with spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) photon-pair sources and ground stations utilizing single-atom memories in optical cavities and single-photon detectors to implement the cavity-assisted photon scattering (CAPS) gates for high-fidelity entanglement mapping. The efficient entanglement swapping is achieved by performing high-fidelity Rydberg gates and readouts. We evaluate the entanglement distribution rates and fidelities by analyzing several key imperfections, including time-dependent two-photon transmission and time-dependent pair fidelity, for various satellite heights and ground station distances. We also investigate the impact of pair source fidelity and spin decoherence rate on the repeater performance. Furthermore, we introduce a spatial-frequency multiplexing strategy within this architecture to enhance the design's performance. Finally, we discuss in detail the practical implementation of this architecture. Our results show that this architecture enables entanglement distribution over intercontinental distances. For example, it can distribute over 10000 pairs per flyby over 10000 km with a fidelity above 90%, surpassing the capabilities of terrestrial quantum repeaters</description>

      <title>One application of Duistermaat-Heckman measure in quantum information theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While the exact separability probability of 8/33 for two-qubit states under the Hilbert-Schmidt measure has been reported by Huong and Khoi [\href{https://doi.org/10.1088/1751-8121/ad8493}{J.Phys.A:Math.Theor.{\bf57}, 445304(2024)}], detailed derivations remain inaccessible for general audiences. This paper provides a comprehensive, self-contained derivation of this result, elucidating the underlying geometric and probabilistic structures. We achieve this by developing a framework centered on the computation of Hilbert-Schmidt volumes for key components: the quantum state space, relevant flag manifolds, and regular (co)adjoint orbits. Crucially, we establish and leverage the connection between these Hilbert-Schmidt volumes and the symplectic volumes of the corresponding regular co-adjoint orbits, formalized through the Duistermaat-Heckman measure. By meticulously synthesizing these volume computations -- specifically, the ratios defining the relevant probability measures -- we reconstruct and rigorously verify the 8/33 separability probability. Our approach offers a transparent pathway to this fundamental constant, detailing the interplay between symplectic geometry, representation theory, and quantum probability.</description>

      <title>Generalized tensor transforms and their applications in classical and quantum computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for Generalized Tensor Transforms (GTTs), constructed through an $n$-fold tensor product of an arbitrary $b \times b$ unitary matrix $W$. This construction generalizes many established transforms, by providing a adaptable set of orthonormal basis functions. Our proposed fast classical algorithm for GTT achieves an exponentially lower complexity of $O(N \log_b N)$ in comparison to a naive classical implementation that has an associated computational cost of $O(N^2)$. For quantum applications, our GTT-based algorithm, implemented in the natural spectral ordering, achieves both gate complexity and circuit depth of $O(\log_b N)$, where $N = b^n$ denotes the length of the input vector. This represents a quadratic improvement over Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT), which requires $O((\log_b N)^2)$ gates and depth for $n$ qudits, and an exponential advantage over classical Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) based and Fast Walsh-Hadamard Transform (FWHT) based methods, which incur a computational cost of $O(N \log_b N)$.
  We explore diverse applications of GTTs in quantum computing, including quantum state compression and transmission, function encoding and quantum digital signal processing. The proposed framework provides fine-grained control of the transformation through the adjustable parameters of the base matrix $W$. This versatility allows precise shaping of each basis function while preserving their effective Walsh-type structure, thus tailoring basis representations to specific quantum data and computational tasks. Our numerical results demonstrate that GTTs enable improved performance in quantum state compression and function encoding compared to fixed transforms (such as FWHT or FFT), achieving higher fidelities with fewer retained components. We also provided novel classical and quantum digital signal filtering algorithms based on our GTT framework.</description>

      <title>Quantum walk search for exceptional configurations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There exist two types of configurations of marked vertices on a two-dimensional grid, known as the {\it exceptional configurations}, which are hard to find by the discrete-time quantum walk algorithms. In this article, we provide a comparative study of the quantum walk algorithm with different coins to search these {\it exceptional configurations} on a two-dimensional grid. We further extend the analysis to the hypercube, where only one type of {\it exceptional configurations} are present. Our observation, backed by numerical results, is that our recently proposed modified coin operator is the only coin which can search both types of {\it exceptional configurations} as well as non-{\it exceptional configurations} successfully. As a consequence, we observe that the existence of {\it exceptional configurations} are not a quantum phenomenon, rather a mere limitation of some of the coin operators.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Photon Indistinguishability of Spectrally Mismatched Single Photons by Cavity Floquet Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically propose a scheme to enhance the photon indistinguishability of spectrally mismatched single photons via Floquet-engineered optical frequency combs (OFCs) in cavity quantum electrodynamic systems. By periodically modulating two distinct single-photon states under a modulation frequency which is exactly equal to the spectral mismatch of two cavity modes, a pair of single-photon frequency-comb (SPFC) states is prepared energy-conservatively based on full unitary operations. The two states show high indistinguishability with an ideal $g^{(2)}_\mathrm{HOM}(0)$ down to zero due to the superposition of intensity-matched single-photon states coherently distributed across the teeth of the combs.</description>

      <title>Fast variational knowledge graph embedding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Embedding of a knowledge graph(KG) entities and relations in the form of vectors is an important aspect for the manipulation of the KG database for several downstream tasks, such as link prediction, knowledge graph completion, and recommendation. Because of the growing size of the knowledge graph databases, it has become a daunting task for the classical computer to train a model efficiently. Quantum computer can help speedup the embedding process of the KGs by encoding the entities into a variational quantum circuit of polynomial depth. Usually, the time complexity for such variational circuit-dependent quantum classical algorithms for each epoch is $\mathcal{O}(N \mbox{poly}(\log M))$, where $N$ is number of elements in the knowledge graph and $M$ is the number of features of each entities of the knowledge graph. In this article we exploit additional quantum advantage by training multiple elements of KG in superpositions, thereby reducing the computing time further for the knowledge graph embedding model.</description>

      <title>Popescu-Rohrlich box fraction of dimensionally restricted nonlocality and secure quantum key distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With a measure of dimensionally restricted nonlocality in the bipartite Bell scenario with two inputs and two outputs, a different decomposition of any nonsignaling box that is a convex mixture of a single Popescu-Rohrlich box and a Bell-local box, with the measure being zero, is introduced. It is shown that any nonsignaling box shared by Alice and Bob that has dimensionally restricted nonlocality contains secret correlations against any third party, Eve, who is also dimensionally restricted. In this context, for the specific Bell scenario considered, it is demonstrated that the Popescu-Rohrlich box fraction can be used as a resource for secure quantum key distribution even if entanglement is not certified.</description>

      <title>Quantum speed limit under decoherence: unitary, dissipative, and fluctuation contributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a new quantum speed limit (QSL) for open quantum systems governed by Markovian dynamics. By analyzing the time derivative of the Bures angle between the initial pure state and its time-evolved state, we obtain an analytically computable upper bound on the evolution speed that decomposes into three distinct physical contributions; coherent unitary dynamics, dissipative deformation, and a fluctuation term. Based on this structure, we establish a general inequality that connects the QSL to the Quantum Fisher information in the short-time regime. This result gives a fundamental trade-off between the distinguishability between speed and estimation precision, and clarifies how decoherence can both accelerate and constrain information acquisition.</description>

      <title>Toffoli and C$^\text{n}$NOT (n$&gt;2$) gates in a neutral-atom platform using Rydberg coupling and dark state resonances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a protocol for realizing a Toffoli gate using neutral-atom qubits in optical tweezers. Two ground-state hyperfine levels of the atoms are considered as qubit states. Our method relies on the strong and long-range interactions between atoms due to Rydberg excitations and the occurrence of dark states in the target qubit, with both control and target qubits being individually addressed with laser pulses. Our gate protocol enables precise control over the quantum states of individual qubits, effectively suppressing undesirable transitions to ensure high-fidelity gate performance. The gate fidelity is estimated to be about $96\%$ for realistic system parameters. We further demonstrate a C$^\text{n}$NOT gate with $n &gt;2$ by exploiting the Rydberg antiblockade mechanism, which allows multiple atoms within the blockade radius to be simultaneously excited to the Rydberg states. Thus, our approach may open a promising route to multi-qubit controlled operations for quantum computation.</description>

      <title>An Algorithm for Estimating $\alpha$-Stabilizer R\'enyi Entropies via Purity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-stabilizerness, or magic, is a resource for universal quantum computation in most fault-tolerant architectures; access to states with non-stabilizerness allows for non-classically simulable quantum computation to be performed. Quantifying this resource for unknown states is therefore essential to assessing their utility in quantum computation. The Stabilizer R\'enyi Entropies have emerged as a leading tools for achieving this, having already enabled one efficient algorithm for measuring non-stabilizerness. In addition, the Stabilizer R\'enyi Entropies have proven useful in developing connections between non-stabilizerness and other quantum phenomena. In this work, we introduced an alternative algorithm for measuring the Stabilizer R\'enyi Entropies of an unknown quantum state. Firstly, we show the existence of a state, produced from the action of a channel on $\alpha$ copies of some pure state, that encodes the $\alpha$-Stabilizer R\'enyi Entropy into its purity. We detail several methods of applying this channel and then, by employing existing purity-measuring algorithms, provide an algorithm for measuring the $\alpha$-Stabilizer R\'enyi Entropies for all integers $\alpha&gt;1$. This algorithm is benchmarked for qubits and the resource requirements compared to other known algorithms. Finally, a non-stabilizerness/entanglement relationship is shown to exist in the algorithm, demonstrating an novel relationship between the two resources.</description>

      <title>Context-aware gate set tomography: Improving the self-consistent characterization of trapped-ion universal gate sets by leveraging non-Markovianity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To progress in the characterization of noise for current quantum computers, gate set tomography (GST) has emerged as a self-consistent tomographic protocol that can accurately estimate the complete set of noisy quantum gates, state preparations, and measurements. In its original incarnation, GST improves the estimation precision by applying the gates sequentially, provided that the noise makes them a set of fixed completely-positive and trace preserving (CPTP) maps independent of the history of previous gates in the sequence. This 'Markovian' assumption is sometimes in conflict with experimental evidence, as there might be time-correlated noise leading to non-Markovian dynamics or, alternatively, slow drifts and cumulative calibration errors that lead to context dependence, such that the CP-divisible maps composed during a sequence actually change with the circuit depth. In this work, we address this issue for trapped-ion devices with phonon-mediated two-qubit gates. By a detailed microscopic modeling of high-fidelity light-shift gates, we tailor GST to capture the main source of context dependence: motional degrees of freedom. Rather than invalidating GST, we show that context dependence can be incorporated in the parametrization of the gate set, allowing us to reduce the sampling cost of GST. Our results identify a promising research avenue that might be applicable to other platforms where microscopic modeling can be incorporated: the development of a context-aware GST.</description>

      <title>Steady-State Coherences under Partial Collective non-Markovian Decoherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Steady-state coherence in open quantum systems is crucial for quantum technologies, yet its behavior is not fully understood due to the interplay between collective and individual decoherence. While collective decoherence is thought to induce steady-state coherence, experiments often fail to observe this because of individual decoherence. We study a system of two harmonic oscillators coupled to both individual and collective environments, introducing a tunable parameter to adjust the decoherence proportions. By analytically solving the exact dynamical equations, we find that steady-state coherence depends on the initial state under collective decoherence, but not under partial decoherence. Interestingly, non-Markovianity induces rich and complex steady-state coherence behaviors. Our results offer new insights into the role of non-Markovian decoherence in quantum systems and serve as a benchmark for evaluating approximate methods in modelling quantum processes.</description>

      <title>Future Impact of Quantum Computing on the Computational Landscape of Power Electronics: A Short Tutorial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing is emerging as a promising technology for solving complex optimization problems that arise in various engineering fields, and therefore has the potential to also significantly impact power electronics applications. This paper offers a concise tutorial on fundamental concepts in quantum computing, serving as both an introduction to the field and a bridge to its potential applications in power electronics. As a first step in this direction, the use of quantum computing for solving offline mixed-integer optimization problems commonly encountered in power electronics is examined. To this end, a simplified power electronics design problem is reformulated as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problem and executed on quantum hardware, despite current limitations such as low qubit counts and hardware noise. This demonstration marks a pioneering step towards leveraging quantum methods in power electronics. Moreover, the implications of ongoing advancements in quantum algorithms and hardware are discussed, highlighting their potential to enable the efficient solution of large-scale, multiobjective design and control problems. The presented findings suggest that early adoption and exploration of quantum computing could significantly expand the capabilities and performance of power electronic systems in the near future.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work is an extention of Shiraishi and Matsumoto [10], and discusses the computational complexity of the long-term average of local observables in one-dimensional lattices with shift-invariant nearest-neighbor interactions for simple initial states. As shown in the previous paper, the problem is generally intractable. In this paper we refine the statement further. First, we consider restriction of the initial state, where the state of all the sites are the same except for a single site. We show this version of the problem is also undecidable (RE-complete). Then we turn to the case where the lattice size is finite: depening on the defitiniton of the input size, this version of problem is either EXPSPACE-complete or PSPACE-complete.</description>

      <title>Access Control Threatened by Quantum Entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Access control is a cornerstone of computer security that prevents unauthorised access to resources. In this paper, we study access control in quantum computer systems. We present the first explicit scenario of a security breach when a classically secure access control system is straightforwardly adapted to the quantum setting. The breach is ultimately due to that quantum mechanics allows the phenomenon of entanglement and violates Mermin inequality, a multi-party variant of the celebrated Bell inequality. This reveals a threat from quantum entanglement to access control if existing computer systems integrate with quantum computing. To protect against such threat, we propose several new models of quantum access control, and rigorously analyse their security, flexibility and efficiency.</description>

      <title>An Ultra-Cold Mechanical Quantum Sensor for Tests of New Physics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Initialization of mechanical modes in the quantum ground state is crucial for their use in quantum information and quantum sensing protocols. In quantum processors, impurity of the modes' initial state affects the infidelity of subsequent quantum algorithms. In quantum sensors, excitations out of the ground state contribute to the noise of the detector, and their prevalence puts a bound on rare events that deposit energy into the mechanical modes. In this work, we measure the excited-state populations of GHz-frequency modes in a high-overtone bulk acoustic wave resonator (HBAR). We find that the population of the first excited state can be as low as $P_p$=(1.2$\pm$5.5)$\times10^{-5}$, corresponding to an effective temperature of 25.2 mK, which are upper bounds limited by imperfections in the measurement process. These results compare favorably to the lowest populations measured in superconducting circuits. Finally, we use the measured populations to constrain the amplitude of high-frequency gravitational waves, the kinetic mixing strength of ultra-light dark matter, and non-linear modifications of the Schr\"{o}dinger equation describing wavefunction collapse mechanisms. Our work establishes HBARs as a versatile resource for quantum state initialization and studies of fundamental physics.</description>

      <title>Bayesian frequency estimation at the fundamental quantum limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Searching for a weak signal at an unknown frequency is a canonical task in experiments probing fundamental physics such as gravitational-wave observatories and ultra-light dark matter haloscopes. These state-of-the-art sensors are limited by quantum noise arising from the fundamental uncertainty about the state of the device. Classically, frequency estimation suffers from a threshold effect in the signal-to-noise ratio such that weak signals are extremely hard to localise in frequency. We show that this phenomenon persists at the fundamental quantum limit but that the classical approach, a quadrature measurement, can nevertheless be beaten by a coherent protocol of projecting onto the "quantum whitened" possible quantum states. Quantum whitening is a covariant measurement, and we examine it analytically in the wide-prior limit and numerically for finite-width priors. Beyond accelerating searches for unknown frequencies, quantum whitening may be used generally to sense the parameter of a unitary encoding given no prior information about the parameter.</description>

      <title>Designs from magic-augmented Clifford circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce magic-augmented Clifford circuits -- architectures in which Clifford circuits are preceded and/or followed by constant-depth circuits of non-Clifford (``magic") gates -- as a resource-efficient way to realize approximate $k$-designs, with reduced circuit depth and usage of magic. We prove that shallow Clifford circuits, when augmented with constant-depth circuits of magic gates, can generate approximate unitary and state $k$-designs with $\epsilon$ relative error. The total circuit depth for these constructions on $N$ qubits is $O(\log (N/\epsilon)) +2^{O(k\log k)}$ in one dimension and $O(\log\log(N/\epsilon))+2^{O(k\log k)}$ in all-to-all circuits using ancillas, which improves upon previous results for small $k \geq 4$. Furthermore, our construction of relative-error state $k$-designs only involves states with strictly local magic. The required number of magic gates is parametrically reduced when considering $k$-designs with bounded additive error. As an example, we show that shallow Clifford circuits followed by $O(k^2)$ single-qubit magic gates, independent of system size, can generate an additive-error state $k$-design. We develop a classical statistical mechanics description of our random circuit architectures, which provides a quantitative understanding of the required depth and number of magic gates for additive-error state $k$-designs. We also prove no-go theorems for various architectures to generate designs with bounded relative error.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Noisy Quantum Sensing by GHZ State Partitioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Presence of harmful noise is inevitable in entanglement-enhanced sensing systems, requiring careful allocation of resources to optimize sensing performance in practical scenarios. We advocate a simple but effective strategy to improve sensing performance in the presence of noise. Given a fixed number of quantum sensors, we partition the preparation of GHZ states by preparing smaller, independent sub-ensembles of GHZ states instead of a GHZ state across all sensors. We perform extensive analytical studies of the phase estimation performance when using partitioned GHZ states under realistic noise -- including state preparation error, particle loss during parameter encoding, and sensor dephasing during parameter encoding. We derive simple, closed-form expressions that quantify the optimal number of sub-ensembles for partitioned GHZ states. We also examine the explicit noisy quantum sensing dynamics under dephasing and loss, where we demonstrate the advantage from partitioning for maximal QFI, short-time QFI increase, and the sensing performance in the sequential scheme. The results offer quantitative insights into the sensing performance impact of different noise sources and reinforce the importance of resource allocation optimization in realistic quantum applications.</description>

      <title>LCQNN: Linear Combination of Quantum Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum neural networks combine quantum computing with advanced data-driven methods, offering promising applications in quantum machine learning. However, the optimal paradigm of quantum neural networks in the context trainability and expressivity remains an open question. To overcome this issue, we first introduce a framework called Linear Combination of Quantum Neural Networks (LCQNN), which leverages the linear combination of unitaries concept to coordinate the composition of QNNs, thereby balancing trainability and expressivity. Secondly, LCQNN provides a tunable design that can reduce vanishing gradients without incurring excessive classical simulability. Specifically, we detail how restricting certain subspaces or adopting $k$-local control unitaries prevents gradients from collapsing while maintaining enough parameter volume for complex tasks. These findings also align with prior discussions on expanding QNN capabilities for multi-qubit systems. Additionally, we extend the LCQNN to the group action scenarios. By exploiting symmetry, the LCQNN model, excluding exponentially large irreducible subspaces, can circumvent barren plateaus. Overall, LCQNN provides a novel framework for focusing quantum resources into architectures that remain practically trainable yet expressive enough to tackle challenging machine-learning applications.</description>

      <title>Enhancement of the effects due to the Schr\"odinger-Newton equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Schr\"odinger-Newton (SN) equation introduces a nonlinear self-gravitational term to the standard Schr\"odinger equation, offering a paradigmatic model for semiclassical gravity. However, the small deviations it predicts from standard quantum mechanics pose significant experimental challenges. We propose a novel method to amplify such deviations through periodic modulation of the trapping frequency in a levitated mechanical oscillator. We identify specific regimes where the SN-induced effects on the dynamics of second moments are significantly enhanced-by up to six orders of magnitude compared to unmodulated setups. We show that this protocol remains feasible within current magnetic levitation technologies and enables distinguishability between standard and SN dynamics using measurable quantities such as the position variance. Our results pave the way for a viable experimental test of the SN equation, offering a new route to probe the interface between quantum mechanics and gravity.</description>

      <title>Three-qubit W state tomography via full and marginal state reconstructions on ibm_osaka</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a three-qubit quantum state tomography scheme requiring a set of 17 measurements, significantly reducing the experimental overhead compared to the conventional 63 Pauli measurements. Using IBM's 127-qubit open-access quantum processor ibm osaka, we prepare the three-qubit W state and employ our tomography scheme to reconstruct it. Additionally, we implement a two-qubit tomography protocol, involving a set of 7 measurements, on ibm osaka to reconstruct two of the two-qubit marginals of the W state. This serves as a proof-of-principle demonstration of the well-known theoretical result that any two of the two-qubit reduced density matrices can uniquely determine most of the whole three-qubit pure states. We show that the fidelity of the W-state reconstructed from its two-qubit subsystems is consistently larger than that obtained from the full three-qubit tomography, highlighting the practical advantage of the subsystem-based tomography approach.</description>

      <title>Imprints of information scrambling on eigenstates of a quantum chaotic system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How are the spatial and temporal patterns of information scrambling in locally interacting quantum many-body systems imprinted on the eigenstates of the system's time-evolution operator? We address this question by identifying statistical correlations among sets of minimally four eigenstates that provide a unified framework for various measures of information scrambling. These include operator mutual information and operator entanglement entropy of the time-evolution operator, as well as more conventional diagnostics such as two-point dynamical correlations and out-of-time-ordered correlators. We demonstrate this framework by deriving exact results for eigenstate correlations in a minimal model of quantum chaos -- Floquet dual-unitary circuits. These results reveal not only the butterfly effect and the information lightcone, but also finer structures of scrambling within the lightcone. Our work thus shows how the eigenstates of a chaotic system can encode the full spatiotemporal anatomy of quantum chaos, going beyond the descriptions offered by random matrix theory and the eigenstate thermalisation hypothesis.</description>

      <title>The study of the energy spectrum of a system of quantum micro-vortices in a bounded spatial domain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02615v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study focuses on microscopic-sized quantum vortex filaments that are shaped like a circle. The model we considered examines loops with different radii and a small but non-zero core diameter. These loops are located in a bounded domain $D$. The quantization scheme of the classical vortices is based on the new approach proposed by the author \cite{Tal22_1,Tal24_2}. For these loops, we calculate both the quantized circulation and the energy spectrum, which are perfectly non-trivial. To understand how the results we have obtained can be used to describe the initial stage of turbulence in a quantum fluid, we study a system of $K$ random, non-interacting vortices. We explain how specific energy and circulation spectra lead to the occurrence of turbulence in the context of the developed approach.</description>

      <title>Topology-ferrimagnetism intertwining via weak interactions in Lieb lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00291v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A common wisdom about quantum many-body systems is that emergent phases typically fall into either the Landau-Ginzburg paradigm or topological classifications. Experimentally realizing the intertwined emergence of spontaneous symmetry breaking and topological order remains challenging. Here, we present an experimentally accessible platform for studying magnetic topological states in a spin-orbit-coupled Lieb lattice. Remarkably, we observe the coexistence of topological characteristics, quantified by the Chern number and Bott index, with spontaneous symmetry-breaking orders, such as ferrimagnetism, in the many-body ground states. Computational analyses combining dynamical mean-field theory and Hartree-Fock approximations reveal a pronounced parameter regime where magnetic topological insulators emerge even under weak interactions. This unconventional phenomenon originates from the Lieb lattice's unique band structure, which facilitates the synergy between interaction-driven symmetry breaking and spin-orbit coupling induced band inversion. Crucially, spin polarization and spin winding co-emerge as inherently coupled phenomena due to their shared origin in the same interacting, spinful atoms. We further propose a specific experimental implementation scheme for ultracold atoms, utilizing currently available Raman lattice techniques. Our findings pave the way for exploring the interplay between symmetry-broken states and topological order in strongly correlated systems.</description>

      <title>Frequency reproducibility of solid-state Th-229 nuclear clocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01180v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solid-state $^{229}$Th nuclear clocks are set to provide new opportunities for precision metrology and fundamental physics. Taking advantage of a nuclear transition's inherent low sensitivity to its environment, orders of magnitude more emitters can be hosted in a solid-state crystal compared to current optical lattice atomic clocks. Furthermore, solid-state systems needing only simple thermal control are key to the development of field-deployable compact clocks. In this work, we explore and characterize the frequency reproducibility of the $^{229}$Th:CaF$_2$ nuclear clock transition, a key performance metric for all clocks. We measure the transition linewidth and center frequency as a function of the doping concentration, temperature, and time. We report the concentration-dependent inhomogeneous linewidth of the nuclear transition, limited by the intrinsic host crystal properties. We determine an optimal working temperature for the $^{229}$Th:CaF$_2$ nuclear clock at 195(5) K where the first-order thermal sensitivity vanishes. This would enable in-situ temperature co-sensing using different quadrupole-split lines, reducing the temperature-induced systematic shift below the 10$^{-18}$ fractional frequency uncertainty level. At 195 K, the reproducibility of the nuclear transition frequency is 280 Hz (fractionally $1.4\times10^{-13}$) for two differently doped $^{229}$Th:CaF$_2$ crystals over four months. These results form the foundation for understanding, controlling, and harnessing the coherent nuclear excitation of $^{229}$Th in solid-state hosts, and for their applications in constraining temporal variations of fundamental constants.</description>

      <title>Growth of block diagonal operators and symmetry-resolved Krylov complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work addresses how the growth of invariant operators is influenced by their underlying symmetry structure. For this purpose, we introduce the symmetry-resolved Krylov complexity, which captures the time evolution of each block into which an operator, invariant under a given symmetry, can be decomposed. We find that, at early times, the complexity of the full operator is equal to the average of the symmetry-resolved contributions. At later times, however, the interplay among different charge sectors becomes more intricate. In general, the symmetry-resolved Krylov complexity depends on the charge sector, although in some cases this dependence disappears, leading to a form of Krylov complexity equipartition. Our analysis lays the groundwork for a broader application of symmetry structures in the study of Krylov space complexities with implications for thermalization and universality in many-body quantum systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We reinterpret Starobinsky's stochastic inflation as an open quantum system, where short-wavelength modes act as the environment for long-wavelength modes. Using the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism, we systematically trace out the environment and derive an effective theory for the reduced density matrix, including deviations from exact de Sitter. The resulting master equation is a Lindblad equation, which reduces to a Fokker-Planck equation for the diagonal elements up to higher orders in the slow-roll expansion, while also yielding a more complete equation in phase space. Finally, we extend the formalism to global de Sitter, for which the associated Fokker-Planck equation lacks equilibrium solutions until the late-time regime $aH \gg 1$.</description>

Abstract: Supersymmetry is one of the most important and indispensable ingredients of modern theoretical physics. However, the absence, at least at the time of publishing this review, of experimental verification of supersymmetry in elementary particle/high-energy physics casts doubt on the viability of this concept at the energies achievable at the LHC. The more unexpected are either already experimentally verified or proposed for verification manifestations of supersymmetry at the level of low (condensed matter physics, quantum optics) and medium (nuclear physics) energies where standard quantum mechanics works. Using examples of various systems from completely different areas of physics, we discuss the isospectrality of quantum Hamiltonians, hidden and explicit supersymmetry, the advantages of the supersymmetric quantum mechanics approach and its role in quantum engineering.</description>

      <title>Unlocking Quantum Control and Multi-Order Correlations via Terahertz Two-Dimensional Coherent Spectroscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02116v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Terahertz two-dimensional coherent spectroscopy (THz-2DCS) is transforming our ability to probe, visualize, and control quantum materials far from equilibrium. This emerging technique brings multi-dimensional resolution to the ultrafast dynamics of nonequilibrium phases of matter, enabling new capabilities demanding precise coherent control and measurement of many-body dynamics and multi-order correlations. By mapping complex excitations across time and frequency dimensions, THz-2DCS delivers coherence tomography of driven quantum matter, thus revealing hidden excitation pathways, measuring higher order nonlinear response functions, disentangling various quantum pathways, capturing collective modes on ultrafast timescales and at terahertz frequencies. These experimental features frequently remain obscured in traditional single particle measurements, ultrafast spectroscopy techniques, and equilibrium-based probes. This Review traces the early development of THz-2DCS and showcases significant recent progress in leveraging this technique to probe and manipulate quantum material properties, including nonequilibrium superconductivity, nonlinear magnonics, dynamical topological phases, and the detection of novel excitations and exotic collective modes with potential technological impact. Looking forward, we identify critical opportunities in advancing THz-2DCS instrumentation and experimental strategies that are shaping future applications in THz optoelectronics, quantum information processing, and sensing.</description>

      <title>Observation of wave amplification and temporal topological state in a genuine photonic time crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02223v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photonic time crystals (PTCs) are materials whose dielectric permittivity is periodically modulated in time, giving rise to bandgaps not in energy-as in conventional photonic crystals-but in momentum, known as k-gaps. These k-gaps enable wave amplification by extracting energy from temporal modulation, offering a mechanism for coherent light generation that bypasses traditional optical gain. PTCs also extend the concept of topological insulators to the time domain, inducing a temporal topological state at the mid-gap of the k-gap, characterized by the Zak phase-a topological invariant originally defined for spatial lattices. Here, we experimentally demonstrate the properties of a k gap in a genuine PTC, realized in a dynamically modulated transmission-line metamaterial. Wave amplification within the k-gap is observed, with an initial power spectrum narrowing and shifting toward the gap. To probe the mid-gaptopological state, we introduce a temporal interface separating two PTCs with distinct topological phases. The measured phase shift between time-reflected and time-refracted waves, together with the temporal confinement of the topological state, provides direct evidence of nontrivial temporal topology. By integrating kgap amplification with time-domain topological features, our work opens new avenues for light generation and manipulation in time-varying photonic materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Shallow nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond are promising quantum sensors but suffer from noise-induced short coherence times due to bulk and surface impurities. We present interfacial engineering via oxygen termination and graphene patching, extending shallow NV coherence to over 1 ms, approaching the T1 limit. Raman spectroscopy and density-functional theory reveal surface termination-driven graphene charge transfer reduces spin noise by pairing surface electrons, supported by double electron-electron resonance spectroscopy showing fewer unpaired spins. Enhanced sensitivity enables detection of single weakly coupled 13C nuclear spins and external 11B spins from a hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) layer, achieving nanoscale nuclear magnetic resonance. A protective h-BN top layer stabilizes the platform, ensuring robustness against harsh treatments and compatibility with target materials. This integrated approach advances practical quantum sensing by combining extended coherence, improved sensitivity, and device durability.</description>

      <title>QFFN-BERT: An Empirical Study of Depth, Performance, and Data Efficiency in Hybrid Quantum-Classical Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) have recently emerged as promising components for enhancing the expressibility of neural architectures. In this work, we introduce QFFN-BERT, a hybrid quantum-classical transformer where the feedforward network (FFN) modules of a compact BERT variant are replaced by PQC-based layers. This design is motivated by the dominant parameter contribution of FFNs, which account for approximately two-thirds of the parameters within standard Transformer encoder blocks. While prior studies have primarily integrated PQCs into self-attention modules, our work focuses on the FFN and systematically investigates the trade-offs between PQC depth, expressibility, and trainability. Our final PQC architecture incorporates a residual connection, both $R_Y$ and $R_Z$ rotations, and an alternating entanglement strategy to ensure stable training and high expressibility. Our experiments, conducted on a classical simulator, on the SST-2 and DBpedia benchmarks demonstrate two key findings. First, a carefully configured QFFN-BERT achieves up to 102.0% of the baseline accuracy, surpassing its classical counterpart in a full-data setting while reducing FFN-specific parameters by over 99%. Second, our model exhibits a consistent and competitive edge in few-shot learning scenarios, confirming its potential for superior data efficiency. These results, supported by an ablation study on a non-optimized PQC that failed to learn, confirm that PQCs can serve as powerful and parameter-efficient alternatives to classical FFNs when co-designed with foundational deep learning principles.</description>

      <title>Bootstrapping periodic quantum systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Periodic structures are ubiquitous in quantum many-body systems and quantum field theories, ranging from lattice models, compact spaces, to topological phenomena. However, previous bootstrap studies encountered technical challenges even for one-body periodic problems, such as a failure in determining the accurate dispersion relations for Bloch bands. In this work, we develop a new bootstrap procedure to resolve these issues, which does not make use of positivity constraints. We mainly consider a quantum particle in a periodic cosine potential. The same procedure also applies to a particle on a circle, where the role of the Bloch momentum $k$ is played by the boundary condition or the $\theta$ angle. We unify the natural set of operators and the translation operator by a new set of operators $\{e^{inx} e^{iap} p^s\}$. To extract the Bloch momentum $k$, we further introduce a set of differential equations for $\langle{e^{inx} e^{iap} p^s}\rangle$ in the translation parameter $a$. At some fixed $a$, the boundary conditions can be determined accurately by analytic bootstrap techniques and matching conditions. After solving the differential equations, we impose certain reality conditions to determine the accurate dispersion relations, as well as the $k$ dependence of other physical quantities. We also investigate the case of noninteger $s$ using the Weyl integral in fractional calculus.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02499v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate the polarization of electron orbital angular momentum (OAM) in neutral atoms by integrating the Zeeman effect with attosecond transient absorption spectroscopy (ATAS). Using density matrix simulations, we show that in a helium atom, the absorption probability asymmetry between mj=-1 and mj = 1 in the 1s2p state can be precisely controlled by adjusting the time delay between infrared (IR) and extreme ultraviolet (XUV) fields, the strength of an applied static magnetic field, as well as the angle between laser polarization and magnetic field direction. This approach has significant implications across various fields, including quantum computing, quantum communication, and spintronics. Moreover, it paves the way for advancements in applications such as manipulating chemical reactions control, tailoring the magnetic properties of matter, and enabling novel laser emissions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02644v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid development of neural quantum states (NQS) has established it as a promising framework for studying quantum many-body systems. In this work, by leveraging the cutting-edge transformer-based architectures and developing highly efficient optimization algorithms, we achieve the state-of-the-art results for the doped two-dimensional (2D) Hubbard model, arguably the minimum model for high-Tc superconductivity. Interestingly, we find different attention heads in the NQS ansatz can directly encode correlations at different scales, making it capable of capturing long-range correlations and entanglements in strongly correlated systems. With these advances, we establish the half-filled stripe in the ground state of 2D Hubbard model with the next nearest neighboring hoppings, consistent with experimental observations in cuprates. Our work establishes NQS as a powerful tool for solving challenging many-fermions systems.</description>

Abstract: We present a pedagogical introduction to Floquet-Magnus theory through the classical example of Kapitza's pendulum \ -- a simple system exhibiting nontrivial dynamical stabilization under rapid periodic driving. By deriving the equations of motion and analyzing the system via Floquet theory and the Magnus expansion, we obtain analytical stability conditions and effective evolution equations. While grounded in classical mechanics, the techniques are directly applicable to periodically driven quantum systems as well. The approach is fully analytical, using only tools from theoretical mechanics and linear algebra, and is suitable for advanced undergraduate or graduate students.</description>

Abstract: We study the charge and spin-dependent thermoelectric response of a ferromagnetic helical system irradiated by arbitrarily polarized light, using a tight-binding framework and the Floquet-Bloch formalism. Transport properties for individual spin channels are determined by employing the non-equilibrium Green's function technique, while phonon thermal conductance is evaluated using a mass-spring model with different lead materials. The findings reveal that that light irradiation induces spin-split transmission features, suppresses thermal conductance, and yields favorable spin thermopower and figure of merit (FOM). The spin FOM consistently outperforms its charge counterpart under various light conditions. Moreover, long-range hopping is shown to enhance the spin thermoelectric performance, suggesting a promising strategy for efficient energy conversion in related ferromagnetic systems.</description>

      <title>Uniform semiclassical observable error bound of Trotterization without the Egorov theorem: a simple algebraic proof</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efficient simulation of the semiclassical Schr\"odinger equation has garnered significant attention in the numerical analysis community. While controlling the error in the unitary evolution or the wavefunction typically requires the time step size to shrink as the semiclassical parameter $h$ decreases, it has been observed -- and proved for first- and second-order Trotterization schemes -- that the error in certain classes of observables admits a time step size independent of $h$. In this work, we explicitly characterize this class of observables and present a new, simple algebraic proof of uniform-in-$h$ error bounds for arbitrarily high-order Trotterization schemes. Our proof relies solely on the algebraic structure of the underlying operators in both the continuous and discrete settings. Unlike previous analyses, it avoids Egorov-type theorems and bypasses heavy semiclassical machinery. To our knowledge, this is the first proof of uniform-in-$h$ observable error bounds for Trotterization in the semiclassical regime that relies only on algebraic structure, without invoking the semiclassical limit.</description>

Abstract: Diamond and diamond color centers have become prime hardware candidates for solid state-based technologies in quantum information and computing, optics, photonics and (bio)sensing. The synthesis of diamond materials with specific characteristics and the precise control of the hosted color centers is thus essential to meet the demands of advanced applications. Yet, challenges remain in improving the concentration, uniform distribution and quality of these centers. Here we perform a review and meta-analysis of some of the main diamond synthesis methods and their parameters for the synthesis of N-, Si-, Ge- and Sn-vacancy color-centers, including worldwide trends in fabrication techniques and processes. We extract quantitative data from over 60 experimental papers and organize it in a large database (170 data sets and 1692 entries). We then use the database to train two machine learning algorithms to make robust predictions about the fabrication of diamond materials with specific properties from careful combinations of synthesis parameters. We use traditional statistical indicators to benchmark the performance of the algorithms and show that they are powerful and resource-efficient tools for researchers and material scientists working with diamond color centers and their applications.</description>

      <title>Stability and quasi-Periodicity of Many-Body Localized Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2201.11223v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The connection between entanglement dynamics and non-equilibrium statistics in isolated many-body quantum systems has been established both theoretically and experimentally. Many-Body Localization (MBL), a phenomenon where interacting particles in disordered (i.e., random) chains fail to thermalize, exemplifies this connection. However, the systematic proof of critical phenomena such as MBL remains challenging due to the lack of robust methods for analyzing many-body entanglement dynamics. In this paper, we identify MBL through quasi-periodic dynamics in the entanglement evolution of subsystems in a disordered Heisenberg chain. This new form of characterizing MBL, through stable quasi-periodic dynamics of entanglement -- where stable means they persist in the thermodynamic limit -- concretely distinguishes between two competing scenarios: fully localized behavior of subsystems or slowly, exponentially slow in disorder, thermalizing subsystems -- a heated controversy in the literature. Utilizing perturbation theory, we derive the entanglement dynamics of single spins through an infinite perturbative series, while also modeling rare Griffiths regions (locally thermal inclusions). Our results prove that in regimes of sufficiently strong disorder, the entanglement evolution of individual subsystems remains quasi-periodic in the thermodynamic limit, thereby providing concrete evidence for the stability of MBL dynamics in disordered Heisenberg chains. This behavior contrasts with the widely reported logarithmic growth of subsystem entanglement in the MBL phase. We show that the logarithmic growth observed in prior studies arises from statistical ensemble averaging, which is prohibited due to the intrinsic non-ergodic dynamics characteristic of MBL systems, rooted in their quasi-periodic features.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18468v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two-photon interference is an interesting quantum phenomenon that is usually captured in two distinct types of experiments, namely the Hanbury-Brown-Twiss (HBT) experiment and the Hong- Ou-Mandel (HOM) experiment. While the HBT experiment was carried out much earlier in 1956, with classical light, the demonstration of the HOM effect came much later in 1987. Unlike the former, the latter has frequently been argued to be a purely quantum effect. A generalized formulation of two-particle interference is presented here. The HOM and the quantum HBT effects emerge as special cases in the general analysis. A realizable two-particle interference experiment, which is intermediate between the two effects, is proposed and analyzed. Thus two-particle interference is shown to be a single phenomenon with various possible implementations, including the HBT and HOM setups.</description>

Abstract: High-dimensional (HD) entanglement promises both enhanced key rates and overcoming obstacles faced by modern-day quantum communication. However, modern convex optimization-based security arguments are limited by computational constraints; thus, accessible dimensions are far exceeded by progress in HD photonics, bringing forth a need for efficient methods to compute key rates for large encoding dimensions. In response to this problem, we present a flexible analytic framework facilitated by the dual of a semi-definite program and diagonalizing operators inspired by entanglement-witness theory, enabling the efficient computation of key rates in high-dimensional systems. To facilitate the latter, we show how matrix completion techniques can be incorporated to effectively yield improved, computable bounds on the key rate in paradigmatic high-dimensional systems of time- or frequency-bin entangled photons and beyond.</description>

Abstract: The time-dependent one-dimensional nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation (NLSE) is solved numerically by a hybrid pseudospectral-variational quantum algorithm that connects a pseudospectral step for the Hamiltonian term with a variational step for the nonlinear term. The Hamiltonian term is treated as an integrating factor by forward and backward Fourier transformations, which are here carried out classically. This split allows us to avoid higher-order time integration schemes, to apply a first-order explicit time stepping for the remaining nonlinear NLSE term in a variational algorithm block, and thus to avoid numerical instabilities. We demonstrate that the analytical solution is reproduced with a small root mean square error for a long time interval over which a nonlinear soliton propagates significantly forward in space while keeping its shape. We analyze the accuracy of the quantum algorithm and compare it with classical approaches. Furthermore, we investigate the influence of algorithm parameters on the accuracy of the results, including the temporal step width and the depth of the quantum circuit.</description>

Abstract: Understanding the collective quantum dynamics of nonequilibrium many-body systems is an outstanding challenge in quantum science. In particular, dynamics driven by quantum fluctuations are important for the formation of exotic quantum phases of matter, fundamental high-energy processes, quantum metrology, and quantum algorithms. Here, we use a programmable quantum simulator based on Rydberg atom arrays to experimentally study collective dynamics across a (2+1)D Ising quantum phase transition. After crossing the quantum critical point, we observe a gradual growth of correlations through coarsening of antiferromagnetically ordered domains. By deterministically preparing and following the evolution of ordered domains, we show that the coarsening is driven by the curvature of domain boundaries, and find that the dynamics accelerate with proximity to the quantum critical point. We quantitatively explore these phenomena and further observe long-lived oscillations of the order parameter, corresponding to an amplitude (Higgs) mode. These observations offer a unique viewpoint into emergent collective dynamics in strongly correlated quantum systems and nonequilibrium quantum processes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15954v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dichotomy of localization versus delocalization is a historic topic central to quantum and condensed matter physics. We discover a new delocalization mechanism attributed to a residue imaginary (part of) velocity $\operatorname{Im}(v)$, feasible for ground states or low-temperature states of non-Hermitian quantum systems under periodic boundary conditions. In sharp contrast to conventional formalisms through extended wavefunctions, these target systems exhibit delocalization in collective physical properties such as correlation and entanglement (of the Fermi Seas) despite sometimes localized left and right single-particle eigenstates, as we demonstrate numerically and generalize to scenarios with finite temperatures and interaction. Interestingly, disorder contributing to $\operatorname{Im}(v)$ may also allow strong-disorder delocalization. Thus, the nontrivial physics of $\operatorname{Im}(v)$ significantly enriches our understanding of delocalization and harbors interesting experiments and practical applications.</description>

Abstract: Geometrically local quantum codes, which are error correction codes embedded in $\mathbb{R}^D$ with checks acting only on qubits within a fixed spatial distance, have garnered significant interest. Recently, it has been demonstrated how to achieve geometrically local codes that maximize both the dimension and the distance, as well as the energy barrier of the code. In this work, we focus on the constructions involving subdivision and show that they have an almost linear time decoder, obtained by combining the decoder of the outer good qLDPC code and a generalized version of the Union-Find decoder. This provides the first decoder for an optimal geometrically local three-dimensional code. We demonstrate the existence of a finite threshold error rate under the code capacity noise model using a minimum weight perfect matching decoder. Furthermore, we argue that this threshold is also applicable to the decoder based on the generalized Union-Find algorithm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11042v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-harmonic generation (HHG) is a nonlinear process in which a strong driving field interacts with a material, resulting in the frequency up-conversion of the driver into its high-order harmonics. This process is highly sensitive to the field's polarization: circular polarization, for instance, inhibits HHG. In this work, we demonstrate that the use of non-classical structured light enables HHG in this otherwise prohibitive configuration for classical drivers. We consider circularly polarized light with non-classical fluctuations, introduced via squeezing along one polarization direction, and show that these non-classical features prompt the HHG process. We find that the spectral properties of the emitted harmonics depend on the type of squeezing applied and, by analyzing the inner electron dynamics, we relate the observed differences to modifications of the HHG three-step mechanism induced by the specific squeezing type. This approach opens new pathways for integrating quantum optics in HHG, providing novel means of controlling the light-matter interaction dynamics.</description>

      <title>Symmetry verification for noisy quantum simulations of non-Abelian lattice gauge theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07844v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-Abelian gauge theories underlie our understanding of fundamental forces of modern physics. Simulating them on quantum hardware is an outstanding challenge in the rapidly evolving field of quantum simulation. A key prerequisite is the protection of local gauge symmetries against errors that, if unchecked, would lead to unphysical results. While an extensive toolkit devoted to identifying, mitigating, and ultimately correcting such errors has been developed for Abelian groups, non-commuting symmetry operators complicate the implementation of similar schemes in non-Abelian theories. Here, we discuss two techniques for error mitigation through symmetry verification, tailored for non-Abelian lattice gauge theories implemented in noisy qudit hardware: dynamical post-selection (DPS), based on mid-circuit measurements without active feedback, and post-processed symmetry verification (PSV), which combines measurements of correlations between target observables and gauge transformations. We illustrate both approaches for the discrete non-Abelian group $D_3$ in 2+1 dimensions, explaining their usefulness for current NISQ devices even in the presence of fast fluctuating noise. Our results open new avenues for robust quantum simulation of non-Abelian gauge theories, for further development of error-mitigation techniques, and for measurement-based control methods in qudit platforms.</description>

      <title>Anomalous discharging of quantum batteries: the ergotropic Mpemba effect</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13259v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Anomalous thermal relaxation is ubiquitous in nonequilibrium statistical mechanics. An emblematic example of this is the Mpemba effect, where an initially ``hot'' system cools faster than an initially ``cooler'' one. This effect has recently been studied in a variety of different classical and quantum settings. In this Letter, we find a novel signature of the Mpemba effect in the context of quantum batteries. We identify situations where batteries in higher charge states can discharge faster than less charged states. Specifically, we consider a quantum battery encoded in a single bosonic mode that is charged using unitary Gaussian operations. We show that the ergotropy, used here as a dynamical indicator of the energy stored in the battery, can be recast as a phase space relative entropy between the system's state and the unitarily connected passive state, at each time. Our formalism allows us to compute the ergotropy analytically under dissipative dynamics and allows us to understand the conditions which give rise to a Mpemba effect. We also find situations where two batteries charged to the same value using different operations can discharge at different rates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.21171v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent progress in quantum computing has enabled systems with tens of reliable logical qubits, built from thousands of noisy physical qubits. However, many impactful applications demand quantum computations with millions of logical qubits, necessitating highly scalable quantum error correction. In classical information theory, low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes can approach channel capacity efficiently. Yet, no quantum error-correcting codes with efficient decoding have been shown to approach the hashing bound - a fundamental limit on quantum capacity - despite decades of research. Here, we present quantum LDPC codes that not only approach the hashing bound but also allow decoding with computational cost linear in the number of physical qubits. This breakthrough paves the way for large-scale, fault-tolerant quantum computation. Combined with emerging hardware that manages many qubits, our approach brings quantum solutions to important real-world problems significantly closer to reality.</description>

      <title>Quantum-enhanced causal discovery for a small number of samples</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05007v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The discovery of causal relations from observed data has attracted significant interest from disciplines such as economics, social sciences, and biology. In practical applications, considerable knowledge of the underlying systems is often unavailable, and real data are usually associated with nonlinear causal structures, which makes the direct use of most conventional causality analysis methods difficult. This study proposes a novel quantum Peter-Clark (qPC) algorithm for causal discovery that does not require any assumptions about the underlying model structures. Based on conditional independence tests in a class of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces characterized by quantum circuits, the proposed algorithm can explore causal relations from the observed data drawn from arbitrary distributions. We conducted systematic experiments on fundamental graphs of causal structures, demonstrating that the qPC algorithm exhibits better performance, particularly with smaller sample sizes compared to its classical counterpart. Furthermore, we proposed a novel optimization approach based on Kernel Target Alignment (KTA) for determining hyperparameters of quantum kernels. This method effectively reduced the risk of false positives in causal discovery, enabling more reliable inference. Our theoretical and experimental results demonstrate that the quantum algorithm can empower classical algorithms for accurate inference in causal discovery, supporting them in regimes where classical algorithms typically fail. In addition, the effectiveness of this method was validated using the datasets on Boston housing prices, heart disease, and biological signaling systems as real-world applications. These findings highlight the potential of quantum-based causal discovery methods in addressing practical challenges, particularly in small-sample scenarios, where traditional approaches have shown significant limitations.</description>

Abstract: Starting from an experimentally feasible atomic setup, we derive a stochastic Schr\"{o}dinger equation that captures the homodyne detection record of a strongly interacting system. Applying the rotating wave approximation to the linear atom-light coupling, we arrive at a reduced equation formulated solely in terms of atomic operators. In the appropriate limit, this equation converges to that of Gaussian continuous quantum measurement -- revealing that the complexities of real-world detection can, under certain conditions, echo the elegance of idealized theory. To illustrate the utility of this framework, we numerically study the Bose-Hubbard model under continuous observation, showing that time-domain analysis of the measurement signal uncovers rich dynamical features, including quantum jumps, that are obscured in ensemble-averaged spectral data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18630v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This research introduces an improved framework for constructing matrix product operators (MPOs) and tree tensor network operators (TTNOs), crucial tools in quantum simulations. A given (Hamiltonian) operator typically has a known symbolic "sum of operator strings" form that can be translated into a tensor network structure. Combining the existing bipartite-graph-based approach and a newly introduced symbolic Gaussian elimination preprocessing step, our proposed method improves upon earlier algorithms in cases when Hamiltonian terms share the same prefactors. We test the performance of our method against established ones for benchmarking purposes. Finally, we apply our methodology to the model of a cavity filled with molecules in a solvent. This open quantum system is cast into the hierarchical equation of motion (HEOM) setting to obtain an effective Hamiltonian. Construction of the corresponding TTNO demonstrates a sub-linear increase of the maximum bond dimension.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19584v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the evolution of two-point correlation functions of one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model in the semiclassical regime in the framework of Truncated Wigner Approximation (TWA) with quantum jumps as first-order corrections. At early times, the correlation functions show strong superdiffusion with universal integer exponents determined solely by the initial conditions and completely insensitive to system parameters and chaos. Only after a long time this regime crosses over to normal diffusion regime which is most robust when nonintegrability is strong. For strong nonintegrability, the system ends up in a homogeneous state while for weak nonintegrability the oscillations and inhomogeneities persist, despite the fact that chaos is nearly always strong and only weakly depends on nonintegrability parameter. We conclude that the superidiffusive regime is neither prethermalized nor a precursor to thermalization but a novel early-time phenomenon related to a special scaling symmetry of the Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>Generalized Quantum Signal Processing and Non-Linear Fourier Transform are equivalent</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03026v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum signal processing (QSP) and quantum singular value transformation (QSVT) are powerful techniques for the development of quantum procedures. They allow to derive circuits preparing desired polynomial transformations. Recent research [Alexis et al. 2024] showed that Non-Linear Fourier Analysis (NLFA) can be employed to numerically compute a QSP protocol, with provable stability. In this work we extend their result, showing that GQSP and the Non-Linear Fourier Transform over $SU(2)$ are the same object. This statement - proven by a simple argument - has a bunch of consequences: first, the Riemann-Hilbert-Weiss algorithm can be turned, with little modifications and no penalty in complexity, into a unified, provably stable algorithm for the computation of phase factors in any QSP variant, including GQSP. Secondly, we derive a uniqueness result for the existence of GQSP phase factors based on the bijectivity of the Non-Linear Fourier Transform. Furthermore, NLFA provides a complete theory of infinite generalized quantum signal processing, which characterizes the class of functions approximable by GQSP protocols.</description>

Abstract: Computing the similarity between two DNA sequences is of vital importance in bioscience. However, traditional computational methods can be resource-intensive due to the enormous sequence length encountered in practice. Recently, applied quantum algorithms have been anticipated to provide potential advantages over classical approaches. In this paper, we propose a permutation-invariant variational quantum kernel model specifically designed for DNA comparison. To represent the four nucleotide bases in DNA sequences with quantum states, we introduce a novel, theoretically motivated encoding scheme: the four distinct bases are encoded using the states of symmetric, informationally complete, positive operator-valued measures (SIC-POVMs). This encoding ensures mutual equality: each pair of symbols is equidistant on the Bloch sphere. Also, common DNA similarity measures, such as the Levenshtein distance, exhibit permutation-insensitive property. To approximately capture this property, we specially design a parameterized quantum layer to realize permutation invariance in the kernel model. We show that our novel encoding method and parameterized layers used in the quantum kernel model can effectively capture the symmetric characteristics of the pairwise DNA sequence comparison task. We validate our model through numerical experiments, which yield promising results on length-$8$ DNA sequences.</description>

Abstract: I generalize the well-known classical Metropolis-Hastings algorithm into a quantum algorithm that can equilibrate, measure, and mix a quantum thermal state on a quantum computer. It performs non-symmetric transitions on labels of state preparation and measurement operations and rejects transitions using imprecise energies extracted by Gaussian-filtered quantum phase estimation.</description>

      <title>Enhancing LLM-based Quantum Code Generation with Multi-Agent Optimization and Quantum Error Correction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14557v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-agent frameworks with Large Language Models (LLMs) have become promising tools for generating general-purpose programming languages using test-driven development, allowing developers to create more accurate and robust code. However, their potential has not been fully unleashed for domain-specific programming languages, where specific domain exhibits unique optimization opportunities for customized improvement. In this paper, we take the first step in exploring multi-agent code generation for quantum programs. By identifying the unique optimizations in quantum designs such as quantum error correction, we introduce a novel multi-agent framework tailored to generating accurate, fault-tolerant quantum code. Each agent in the framework focuses on distinct optimizations, iteratively refining the code using a semantic analyzer with multi-pass inference, alongside an error correction code decoder. We also examine the effectiveness of inference-time techniques, like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) in the context of quantum programming, uncovering observations that are different from general-purpose code generation. To evaluate our approach, we develop a test suite to measure the impact each optimization has on the accuracy of the generated code. Our findings indicate that techniques such as structured CoT significantly improve the generation of quantum algorithms by up to 50%. In contrast, we have also found that certain techniques such as RAG show limited improvement, yielding an accuracy increase of only 4%. Moreover, we showcase examples of AI-assisted quantum error prediction and correction, demonstrating the effectiveness of our multi-agent framework in reducing the quantum errors of generated quantum programs.</description>

      <title>Simulating Quantum Circuits with Tree Tensor Networks using Density-Matrix Renormalization Group Algorithm</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16718v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum computing offers the potential for computational abilities that can go beyond classical machines. However, they are still limited by several challenges such as noise, decoherence, and gate errors. As a result, efficient classical simulation of quantum circuits is vital not only for validating and benchmarking quantum hardware but also for gaining deeper insights into the behavior of quantum algorithms. A promising framework for classical simulation is provided by tensor networks. Recently, the Density-Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) algorithm was developed for simulating quantum circuits using matrix product states (MPS). Although MPS is efficient for representing quantum states with one-dimensional correlation structures, the fixed linear geometry restricts the expressive power of the MPS. In this work, we extend the DMRG algorithm for simulating quantum circuits to tree tensor networks (TTNs). The framework employs a variational compression scheme that optimizes the TTN to approximate the evolved quantum state. To benchmark the method, we simulate random circuits and the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) with various two-qubit gate connectivities. For the random circuits, we devise tree-like gate layouts that are suitable for TTN and show that TTN requires less memory than MPS for the simulations. For the QAOA circuits, a naive TTN construction that exploits graph structure significantly improves the simulation fidelities. Our findings show that the DMRG algorithm with TTNs provides a promising framework for simulating quantum circuits, particularly when gate connectivities exhibit clustering or a hierarchical structure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22502v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gaussian Process Regression is a well-known machine learning technique for which several quantum algorithms have been proposed. We show here that in a wide range of scenarios these algorithms show no exponential speedup. We achieve this by rigorously proving that the condition number of a kernel matrix scales at least linearly with the matrix size under general assumptions on the data and kernel. We additionally prove that the sparsity and Frobenius norm of a kernel matrix scale linearly under similar assumptions. The implications for the quantum algorithms runtime are independent of the complexity of loading classical data on a quantum computer and also apply to dequantised algorithms. We supplement our theoretical analysis with numerical verification for popular kernels in machine learning.</description>

      <title>Bounded information as a foundation for quantum theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18549v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to formalize the concept that best synthesizes our intuitive understanding of quantum mechanics -- that the information carried by a system is limited -- and, from this principle, to construct the foundations of quantum theory. In our discussion, we also introduce a second important hypothesis: if a measurement closely approximates an ideal one in terms of experimental precision, the information it provides about a physical system is independent of the measurement method and, specifically, of the system's physical quantities being measured. This principle can be expressed in terms of metric properties of a manifold whose points represent the state of the system. These and other reasonable hypotheses provide the foundation for a framework of quantum reconstruction.
  The theory presented in this paper is based on a description of physical systems in terms of their statistical properties, specifically statistical parameters, and focuses on the study of estimators for these parameters. To achieve the goal of quantum reconstruction, a divide-and-conquer approach is employed, wherein the space of two discrete conjugate Hamiltonian variables is partitioned into a binary tree of nested sets. This approach naturally leads to the reconstruction of the linear and probabilistic structure of quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>Will it glue? On short-depth designs beyond the unitary group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23925v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a range of results on several groups of broad interest in quantum information science: the Clifford group, the orthogonal group, the unitary symplectic groups, and the matchgate group. For all of these groups, we prove that analogues of unitary designs cannot be generated by any circuit ensemble with light-cones that are smaller than the system size. This implies linear lower bounds on the circuit depth in one-dimensional systems. For the Clifford and orthogonal group, we moreover show that a broad class of circuits cannot generate designs in sub-linear depth on any circuit architecture. We show this by exploiting observables in the higher-order commutants of each group, which allow one to distinguish any short-depth circuit from truly random. While these no-go results rule out short-depth unitary designs, we prove that slightly weaker forms of randomness -- including additive-error state designs and anti-concentration in sampling distributions -- nevertheless emerge at logarithmic depths in many cases. Our results reveal that the onset of randomness in shallow quantum circuits is a widespread yet subtle phenomenon, dependent on the interplay between the group itself and the context of its application.</description>

      <title>Coupled Cluster Downfolding Theory in Simulations of Chemical Systems on Quantum Hardware</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01199v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The practical application of quantum technologies to chemical problems faces significant challenges, particularly in the treatment of realistic basis sets and the accurate inclusion of electron correlation effects. A direct approach to these problems is currently infeasible due to limitations in the number of logical qubits, their fidelity, and the shallow circuit depths supported by existing hardware; all of which hinder simulations at the required level of accuracy. A promising alternative is hybrid quantum-classical computing, where classical resources are used to construct effective Hamiltonians characterized by dimensions that conform to the constraints of current quantum devices. In this paper, we demonstrate the performance of a hybrid approach: coupled-cluster downfolded Hamiltonians are first evaluated in reduced-dimensionality active spaces, and the corresponding ground-state energies are subsequently computed using quantum algorithms. Our comprehensive analysis explores the achievable accuracy in recovering correlation energies when hundreds of orbitals are downfolded into a problem size tractable by today's quantum hardware. We argue that such flexible hybrid algorithms, where problem size can be tailored to available quantum resources, can serve as a bridge between noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices and future fault-tolerant quantum computers, marking a step toward the early realization of quantum advantage in chemistry.</description>

      <title>Emergent interaction-driven elliptic flow of few fermionic atoms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.09699v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hydrodynamics provides a successful framework to effectively describe the dynamics of complex many-body systems ranging from subnuclear to cosmological scales by introducing macroscopic quantities such as particle densities and fluid velocities. According to textbook knowledge, it requires coarse graining over microscopic constituents to define a macroscopic fluid cell, which is large compared to the interparticle spacing and the mean free path. In addition, the entire system must consist of many such fluid cells. In high energy heavy ion collisions, hydrodynamic behaviour is inferred from the observation of elliptic flow. Here, we demonstrate the emergence of elliptic flow in a system of few strongly interacting atoms. In our system a hydrodynamic description is a priori not applicable, as all relevant length scales, i.e. the system size, the inter-particle spacing, and the mean free path are comparable. The single particle resolution, deterministic control over particle number and interaction strength in our experiment allow us to explore the boundaries between a microscopic description and a hydrodynamic framework in unprecedented detail.</description>

      <title>Stable singular fractional skyrmion spin texture from the quantum Kelvin-Helmholtz instability</title>

Abstract: Topology profoundly influences diverse fields of science, providing a powerful framework for classifying phases of matter and predicting nontrivial excitations, such as solitons, vortices, and skyrmions. These topological defects are typically characterized by integer numbers, called topological charges, representing the winding number in their order parameter field. The classification and prediction of topological defects, however, become challenging when singularities are included within the integration domain for calculating the topological charge. While such exotic nonlinear excitations have been proposed in the superfluid $^3$He-A phase and spinor Bose-Einstein condensate of atomic gases, experimental observation of these structures and studies of their stability have long been elusive. Here we report the observation of a singular skyrmion that goes beyond the framework of topology in a ferromagnetic superfluid. The exotic skyrmions are sustained by undergoing anomalous symmetry breaking associated with the eccentric spin singularity and carry half of the elementary charge, distinctive from conventional skyrmions or merons. By successfully realizing the universal regime of the quantum Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, we identified the eccentric fractional skyrmions, produced by emission from a magnetic domain wall and a spontaneous splitting of an integer skyrmion with spin singularities. The singular skyrmions are stable and can be observed after 2~s of hold time. Our results confirm the universality between classical and quantum Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities and broaden our understanding on complex nonlinear dynamics of nontrivial texture beyond skyrmion in topological quantum systems.</description>

Abstract: Understanding many body systems is a key challenge in physics. Single atom resolved imaging techniques have unlocked access to microscopic correlations in ultracold quantum gases. However they cannot be used when the relevant length scales are obscured by the resolution of the detection technique. We present a matterwave magnification scheme, based on evolutions in optical potentials, tailored to magnify the wave function of atoms, such that all length scales can be resolved. To showcase this method, we image atoms in the strongly interacting regime, establishing a new way to characterize correlated systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09488v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we extend the study of the interplay between scaling symmetries and statistics to one-dimensional fluids by studying the Calogero model in a harmonic trap modulated through time. The latter harbors an interpretation in terms of free particles imbued with exclusion statistics and is an example of a scale invariant fluid in one-dimension displaying $\mathrm{SO(2,1)}$ dynamical symmetry preserved by harmonic traps. Taking advantage of the dynamical symmetry, two experimentally relevant drive protocols spanning both quasistatic and nonadiabatic regimes are investigated and universal signatures of the interactions and exclusion statistics are uncovered in the ground-state echo amplitude and closely related ground-state fidelity. In particular, under both periodic modulation and slow drive through the gapless point of the trap frequency, enhanced interactions and exclusion are shown to favor the proliferation of defects and to hinder their annihilation, which leads to a universal decrease of ground-state fidelities and echo amplitudes. We also show that increasing exclusion sparks a sharp suppression of the likelihood of intermediate echoes beyond those imposed by the commensurability of a periodic drive and the natural frequency of the trap.</description>

      <title>Estimate of equilibration times of quantum correlation functions in the thermodynamic limit based on Lanczos coefficients</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15932v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the equilibration times $T_\text{eq}$ of local observables in quantum chaotic systems by considering their auto-correlation functions. Based on the recursion method, we suggest a scheme to estimate $T_\text{eq}$ from the corresponding Lanczos coefficients that is expected to hold in the thermodynamic limit. We numerically find that if the observable eventually shows smoothly growing Lanczos coefficients, a finite number of the former is sufficient for a reasonable estimate of the equilibration time. This implies that equilibration occurs on a realistic time scale much shorter than the life of the universe. The numerical findings are further supported by analytical arguments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01016v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Within the framework of optical Dirac theory, we present a field-theoretical model of spin-orbit interaction and photonic spin/orbit Hall effects. Our approach reformulates light propagation along helical paths as solving the Maxwell equations in a ray-based curvilinear coordinate system. This system can alternatively be interpreted as a spin-degenerate medium with antisymmetric elements in the dielectric tensor, corresponding to the spin-1 excitation mode characterized by a rotational dipole vector. We show that, at leading order, the resulting effective Hamiltonian is equivalent to the Maxwell theory in a uniformly rotating frame, incorporating both spin-rotation and orbit-rotation coupling. This rotation arises from the torsion of helical paths, manifesting as extrinsic orbital angular momentum (EOAM) of photons. Notably, the spin angular momentum (SAM) of the photon and its intrinsic orbital angular momentum (IOAM) contribute jointly to the geometric phase. In the Heisenberg picture, the spin and orbital Hall effects naturally emerge from interaction terms in the ray equations. Furthermore, we find that the transverse spin of evanescent waves couples with EOAM, revealing that the geometric phase of elliptically polarized light differs from that of circularly polarized light. This distinction underscores the role of spin-orbit coupling in modifying phase accumulation.</description>

      <title>Delocalized Excitation Transfer in Open Quantum Systems with Long-Range Interactions</title>

Abstract: The interplay between coherence and system-environment interactions is at the basis of a wide range of phenomena, from quantum information processing to charge and energy transfer in molecular systems, biomolecules, and photochemical materials. In this work, we use a Frenkel exciton model with long-range interacting qubits coupled to a damped collective bosonic mode to investigate vibrationally assisted transfer processes in donor-acceptor systems featuring internal substructures analogous to light-harvesting complexes. We find that certain delocalized excitonic states maximize the transfer rate and that the entanglement is preserved during the dissipative transfer over a wide range of parameters. We investigate the reduction in transfer caused by static disorder, white noise, and finite temperature and study how transfer efficiency scales as a function of the number of dimerized monomers and the component number of each monomer, finding which excitonic states lead to optimal transfer. Finally, we provide a realistic experimental setting to realize this model in analog trapped-ion quantum simulators. Analog quantum simulation of systems comprising many and increasingly complex monomers could offer valuable insights into the design of light-harvesting materials, particularly in the non-perturbative intermediate parameter regime examined in this study, where classical simulation methods are resource-intensive.</description>

      <title>Rethinking LLM Training through Information Geometry and Quantum Metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15830v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optimization in large language models (LLMs) unfolds over high-dimensional parameter spaces with non-Euclidean structure. Information geometry frames this landscape using the Fisher information metric, enabling more principled learning via natural gradient descent. Though often impractical, this geometric lens clarifies phenomena such as sharp minima, generalization, and observed scaling laws. We argue that curvature-aware approaches deepen our understanding of LLM training. Finally, we speculate on quantum analogies based on the Fubini-Study metric and Quantum Fisher Information, hinting at efficient optimization in quantum-enhanced systems.</description>
