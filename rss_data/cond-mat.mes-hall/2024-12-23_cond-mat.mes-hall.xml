      <title>Abelian Spectral Topology of Multifold Exceptional Points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advent of non-Hermitian physics has enriched the plethora of topological phases to include phenomena without Hermitian counterparts. Despite being among the most well-studied uniquely non-Hermitian features, the topological properties of multifold exceptional points, $n$-fold spectral degeneracies (EP$n$s) at which also the corresponding eigenvectors coalesce, were only recently revealed in terms of topological resultant winding numbers and concomitant Abelian doubling theorems. Nevertheless, a more mathematically fundamental description of EP$n$s and their topological nature has remained an open question. To fill this void, in this article, we revisit the topological classification of EP$n$s in generic systems and systems with local symmetries, generalize it in terms of more mathematically tractable (local) similarity relations, and extend it to include all such similarities as well as non-local symmetries. Through the resultant vector, whose components are given in terms of the resultants between the corresponding characteristic polynomial and its derivatives, the topological nature of the resultant winding number is understood in several ways: in terms of i) the tenfold classification of (Hermitian) topological matter, ii) the framework of Mayer--Vietoris sequence, and iii) the classification of vector bundles. Our work reveals the mathematical foundations on which the topological nature of EP$n$s resides, enriches the theoretical understanding of non-Hermitian spectral features, and will therefore find great use in modern experiments within both classical and quantum physics.</description>

      <title>Scattering theory of higher order topological phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The surface states of intrinsic higher order topological phases are protected by the spatial symmetries of a finite sample. This property makes the existing scattering theory of topological invariants inapplicable because the scattering geometry is either incompatible with the symmetry or does not probe the bulk topology. We resolve this obstacle by using a symmetric scattering geometry that probes transport from the inside to the outside of the sample. We demonstrate that the intrinsic higher order topology is captured by the flux dependence of the reflection matrix. Our finding follows from identifying the spectral flow of a flux line as a signature of higher order topology. We show how this scattering approach applies to several examples of higher order topological insulators and superconductors. Our theory provides an alternative approach for proving bulk--edge correspondence in intrinsic higher order topological phases, especially in presence of disorder.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of metastable contact soliton dissipative exchange flows in one-dimensional ferromagnetic channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dissipative exchange flows (DEFs) are large-amplitude boundary value solutions of ferromagnetic channels. In their low-injection limit, DEFs reduce to spin superfluids. However, in the strong injection limit, nonlinearities dominate close to the injection site and a soliton is formed; this solution has been termed a contact soliton dissipative exchange flow (CS-DEF). Here, we numerically investigate CS-DEF solutions in a moderate injection regime and a finite injection width. We find a solution where two metastable solitons coexist in the injection region. This solution is metastable in the sense that any perturbation to the system will eject one of the solitons out of the injection region. Moreover, soliton dynamics can be excited when two injection regions are separated by a certain distance. We find that the ensuing DEF between the solitons induces a steady-state dynamics in which metastable solitons are continually ejected and nucleated. Furthermore, and depending on the relative signs of the spin injections, the soliton dynamics possess a particular handedness and frequency related to the spin transfer torque delivered by the DEF. Our results provide insights into the transport of spin current by DEFs - where the interaction between DEFs and solitons suggests a mechanism for detaching contact-solitons from the injection boundary. Although this study focuses on the "nonlocal" interaction between solitons, it may lead to the investigation of new mechanisms for inserting solitons in a DEF, e.g., for discrete motion and transport of information over long distances.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity in Epitaxial SiGe for Cryogenic Electronics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Introducing superconductivity into group IV elements by doping has long promised a pathway to introduce quantum functionalities into well-established semiconductor technologies. The non-equilibrium hyperdoping of group III atoms into Si or Ge has successfully shown superconductivity can be achieved, however, the origin of superconductivity has been obscured by structural disorder and dopant clustering. Here, we report the epitaxial growth of hyperdoped Ga:Ge films by molecular beam epitaxy with extreme hole concentrations (n$_{h}$ = 4.15 $\times$ 10$^{21}$ cm$^{-3}$, ~17.9\% Ga substitution) that yield superconductivity with a critical temperature of T$_{C}$ = 3.5 K, and an out-of-plane critical field of 1 T at 270 mK. Synchrotron-based X-ray absorption and scattering methods reveal that Ga dopants are substitutionally incorporated within the Ge lattice, introducing a tetragonal distortion to the crystal unit cell. Our findings, corroborated by first-principles calculations, suggest that the structural order of Ga dopants creates a flat band for the emergence of superconductivity in Ge, establishing hyperdoped Ga:Ge as a low-disorder, epitaxial superconductor-semiconductor platform.</description>

      <title>Electrically tunable MoSe$_2$/WSe$_2$ heterostructure-based quantum dot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe here a theory of a quantum dot in an electrically tunable MoSe$_2$/WSe$_2$ heterostructure. Van der Waals heterostructures allow for tuning their electronic properties beyond their monolayer counterparts. We start by determining their electronic structure using density functional theory. We obtain the type-II band alignment and close in energy conduction band minima (valleys) at the $K$ and $Q$ points in the Brillouin zone. The valence band maxima, also energetically close, are located at the $K$ and $\Gamma$ points. By analyzing the Kohn-Sham wavefunctions, we describe the layer, spin, and orbital contributions. Next, we construct an \textit{ab initio}-based tight-binding model, which helps us to better understand the complexity of the interlayer interactions. We determine the effect of a vertical electric field, showing that vertical gating enables control of valleys extrema and their occupancy. Finally, we employ the tight-binding model to investigate laterally gated quantum dots and analyze the influence of a perpendicular electric field on their energy spectrum. Our results demonstrate that tuning the electric field enables control over the valley character of the quantum dot states, selectively localizing them in either the $K$ or $Q$ valleys, as evidenced by their characteristic degeneracies and wavefunctions.</description>

      <title>On-Demand Magnon Resonance Isolation in Cavity Magnonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cavity magnonics is a promising field focusing the interaction between spin waves (magnons) and other types of signals. In cavity magnonics, the function of isolating magnons from the cavity to allow signal storage and processing fully in the magnonic domain is highly desired, but its realization is often hindered by the lack of necessary tunability on the interaction. This work shows that by utilizing the collective mode of two YIG spheres and adopting Floquet engineering, magnonic signals can be switched on-demand to a magnon dark mode that is protected from the environment, enabling a variety of manipulation over the magnon dynamics. Our demonstration can be scaled up to systems with an array of magnonic resonators, paving the way for large-scale programmable hybrid magnonic circuits.</description>

      <title>Theoretical study of Magnetoresistance Oscillations in Semi-parabolic Plus Semi-inverse Squared Quantum Wells in the Presence of Intense Electromagnetic Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetoresistance oscillations in semiconductor quantum wells, with the semi-parabolic plus semi-inverse squared potential, under the influence of intense electromagnetic waves (IEMW), is studied theoretically. Analytical expression for the longitudinal magnetoresistance (LMR) is derived from the quantum kinetic equation for electrons, using the Fr\"ohlich Hamiltonian of the electron-acoustic phonon system. Numerical calculation results show the complex dependence of LMR on the parameters of the external field (electric, magnetic field and temperature) as well as the structure parameters of the confinement potential. In the absence of IMEW, Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) oscillations appear with amplitudes that decrease with temperature in agreement with previous theoretical and experimental results. In the presence of IEMW, the SdH oscillations appear in beats with amplitudes that increase with the intensity of the IEMW. SdH oscillations under the influence of electromagnetic waves are called microwave-induced magnetoresistance oscillations. The maximum and minimum peaks appear at the positions where the IEMW frequencies are integer and half-integer values of the cyclotron frequency, respectively. In addition, the structural parameters of the quantum well such as the confinement frequency and the geometrical parameters have a significant influence on the LMR as well as the SdH oscillations. When the confinement frequency is small, the two-dimensional electronic system in the quantum well behaves as a bulk semiconductor, resulting in the absence of SdH oscillations. In addition, the LMR increases with the geometrical parameter $\beta_z$ of the quantum well. The obtained results provide a solid theoretical foundation for the possibility of controlling SdH oscillations by IEMW as well as the structural properties of materials in future experimental observations.</description>

      <title>Effects of magnetic field and structural parameters on multi-photon absorption spectra in Morse quantum wells with electron-phonon interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a systematic theoretical study of the multi-photon nonlinear optical absorption properties of a $\text{GaAs/A}{{\text{l}}_{x}}\text{G}{{\text{a}}_{1-x}}\text{As}$ based quantum well (QW) structure with Morse confinement potential under the influence of a magnetic field. Based on the stationary states due to the electron confinement in Morse QWs and the Landau levels obtained by solving the Schrodinger equation in the effective mass approximation, we have developed calculations for the optical absorption power with MPA using second-order perturbation theory. Our model accounts for electron-phonon interactions and considers both optical and acoustic phonon mechanisms in the MPA process. Our findings show that the one-photon absorption (1PA) peaks are larger and appear to the right of the two-photon absorption (2PA) peaks, whereas 2PA peaks are larger and occur to the right of three-photon absorption (3PA) peaks. The resonance peak positions follow the magneto-phonon resonance condition and are temperature-independent. Increasing the magnetic field and aluminum concentration induces a blue shift in the absorption spectra, whereas increasing the QW width leads to a red shift. Variations in magnetic field, aluminum concentration, and QW width also affect the peak intensities and full-width at half maximum (FWHM), with increasing values of the former two enhancing the FWHM, while expanding the QW width reduces it. Thermal excitations increase peak intensity without shifting their positions. Our study highlights the significance of nonlinear absorption processes (2PA, 3PA) in understanding optical absorption, despite their smaller FWHM compared to linear absorption (1PA). Overall, the Morse QW model demonstrates promising magneto-optical properties, making it a strong candidate for future optoelectronic device applications.</description>

      <title>Two-Dimensional Graphene: Theoretical Study of Multi-photon Non-linear Absorption Coefficient of a Strong Electromagnetic Wave by Using Quantum Kinetic Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on the quantum kinetic equation for electrons, we theoretically study the quantum multi-photon non-linear absorption of a strong electromagnetic wave (EMW) in two-dimensional graphene. Two cases of the electron scattering mechanism are considered: Electron-optical phonon scattering and electron-acoustic phonon scattering. The general multi-photon absorption coefficient is presented as a function of the temperature, the external magnetic field, the photon energy and the amplitude of external EMW. These analytical expressions for multi-photon non-linear absorption coefficient (MNAC) are numerically calculated and the results are discussed in both the absence and presence of a magnetic field perpendicular to the graphene sheet. The results show that there is no absorption peak in the absence of the magnetic field, which contrasts with previous results in 2D systems such as quantum wells or superlattices. However, when there is a strong magnetic field along the direction perpendicular to the 2D graphene, absorption spectral lines appear consistent with the magneto-phonon resonance conditions. Our calculations show that the MPA's effect is stronger than mono-photon absorption. Besides, the quantum multi-photon non-linear absorption phenomenon has been studied from low to high temperatures. This transcends the limits of the classical BKE which is studied in the high-temperature domain. The computational results show that the dependence of MNAC on the above quantities is consistent with the previous theoretical investigation. Another novel feature of this work is that the general analytic expression for MNAC shows the Half Width at Half Maximum dependence on the magnetic field which is in good agreement with the previous experimental observations. Thus, our estimation might give a critical prediction for future experimental observations in 2D graphene.</description>

      <title>Unified real-space construction scheme for flat bands based on symmetric compact localized states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flat band (FB) systems provide ideal playgrounds for studying correlation physics, whereas multi-orbital characteristics in real materials are distinguished from most simple FB models. Here, we propose a systematic and versatile framework for FB constructions in tight-binding (TB) models based on symmetric compact localized states (CLSs), integrating lattice and orbital degrees of freedom. We first demonstrate that any CLS can be symmetrized into a representation of the point group, which remains valid for high orbitals with finite spin-orbit coupling (SOC). Second, we determine the candidate CLS sites according to lattice symmetry, and simplify the hopping as a linear mapping between two Hilbert spaces: one of CLS sites and another of their adjacent sites. The existence of FBs depends on a non-empty kernel of the mapping. Finally, we distinguish eigenstates in the kernel to qualify as a CLS. To illustrate the versatility of our framework, we construct three representative FB models: one in two dimensions (2D) and the rest in three dimensions (3D). All of them lack special lattice structures and incorporate high orbitals. Notably, the 3D FBs can exhibit not only band touchings at points but also along lines, a feature of significant physical interest. For a comprehensive understanding, we derive a concise criterion for determining band touchings, which provides a natural explanation for the occurrence of both gapped and gapless FBs. By unifying symmetry principles in real space, our work offers a systematic approach to constructing FBs across diverse lattice systems. This framework opens new avenues for understanding and engineering FB systems, with potential implications for correlated quantum phenomena and exotic phases of matter.</description>

      <title>Strain tuning of the nonlinear anomalous Hall effect in MoS2 monolayer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to the time reversal symmetry, the linear anomalous Hall effect (AHE) usually vanishes in MoS2 monolayer. In contrast, the nonlinear AHE plays an essential role in such system when the uniaxial strain breaks the C3v symmetry and eventually results in the nonzero Berry curvature dipole (BCD). We find that not only the magnitude of the AHE but also the nonlinear Hall angle can be tuned by the strain. Especially the nonlinear Hall angle exhibits a deep relationship which is analogy to the birefraction phenomenon in optics. It actually results from the pseudotensor nature of the BCD moment. Besides the ordinary positive and negative crystals in optics, there are two more birefraction-like cases corresponding to an imaginary refraction index ratio in monolayer MoS2. Our findings shed lights on the strain controlled electronic devices based on the two-dimensional (2D) materials with BCD.</description>

      <title>Electrically-tunable ultra-flat bands and $\pi$-electron magnetism in graphene nanoribbons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atomically thin crystals hosting flat electronic bands have been recently identified as a rich playground for exploring and engineering strongly correlated phases. Yet, their variety remains limited, primarily to two-dimensional moir\'e superlattices. Here, we predict the formation of reversible, electrically-induced ultra-flat bands and $\pi$-electron magnetism in one-dimensional chevron graphene nanoribbons. Our $ab$ $initio$ calculations show that the application of a transverse electric field to these nanoribbons generates a pair of isolated, nearly perfectly flat bands with widths of approximately 1 meV around the Fermi level. Upon charge doping, these flat bands undergo a Stoner-like electronic instability, resulting in the spontaneous emergence of local magnetic moments at the edges of the otherwise non-magnetic nanoribbon, akin to a one-dimensional spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ chain. Our findings expand the class of carbon-based nanostructures exhibiting flat bands and establish a novel route for inducing correlated electronic phases in chevron graphene nanoribbons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While ballistic electrons are a key tool for applications in sensing and flying qubits, sub-nanosecond propagation times and complicated interactions make control of ballistic single electrons challenging. Recent experiments have revealed Coulomb collisions of counterpropagating electrons in a beam splitter, giving time resolved control of interactions between single electrons. Here we use remote Coulomb interactions to demonstrate a scheme for sensing single ballistic electrons. We show that interactions are highly controllable via electron energy and emission timing. We use a weakly-coupled `sensing' regime to characterise the nanoscale potential landscape of the beam splitter and the strength of the Coulomb interaction, and show multi-electron sensing with picosecond resolution.</description>

      <title>Elementary theory of Magnetoferrons: bringing magnons and ferrons together in multiferroic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The collective excitations of a multiferroic material are analyzed. We show that these excitations also exhibit magnetoelectric behavior, leading to the hybridization of magnons ,oscillations of the magnetization field, and ferrons, which are oscillations of the electric dipolar density field. We term these emergent entities 'magnetoferrons', study their main properties, and discuss their potential applications. Additionally, we provide a phenomenological framework for these systems, which will be invaluable for describing the dynamics of the multiferromagnetic state.</description>

      <title>Imaging the transition from diffusive to Landauer resistivity dipoles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A point-like defect in a uniform current-carrying conductor induces a dipole in the electrochemical potential, which counteracts the original transport field. If the mean free path of the carriers is much smaller than the size of the defect, the dipole results from the purely diffusive motion of the carriers around the defect. In the opposite limit, ballistic carriers scatter from the defect $-$ for this situation Rolf Landauer postulated the emergence of a residual resistivity dipole (RRD) that is independent of the defect size and thus imposes a fundamental limit on the resistance of the parent conductor in the presence of defects. Here, we study resistivity dipoles around holes of different sizes in two-dimensional Bi films on Si(111). Using scanning tunneling potentiometry to image the dipoles in real space, we find a transition from linear to constant scaling behavior for small hole sizes, manifesting the transition from diffusive to Landauer dipoles. The extracted parameters of the transition allow us to estimate the Fermi wave vector and the carrier mean free path in our Bi films.</description>

      <title>Revealing spin-flip two-level systems using ultra-thin film superconducting resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Material disorders are one of the major sources of noise and loss in solid-state quantum devices, whose behaviors are often modeled as two-level systems (TLSs) formed by charge tunneling between neighboring sites. However, the role of their spins in tunneling and its impact on device performance remain highly unexplored. In this work, employing ultra-thin TiN superconducting resonators, we reveal anomalous TLS behaviors by demonstrating an unexpected increase in resonant frequency at low magnetic fields. Furthermore, a spin-flip TLS model is proposed, in which an effective spin-orbit coupling is generated by inhomogeneous local magnetic fields from defect spins. This mechanism mixes charge tunnelings and spin flips, quantitatively reproducing the observed frequency-field relationship and its temperature dependence. This work deepens the understanding of spin-dependent TLS behaviors, offering the possibility of magnetically engineering noise and loss in solid-state quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Direct measurement of the local electrocaloric effect in 2D ferroelectric In${}_2$Se${}_3$ by Scanning Electrocaloric Thermometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electrocaloric effect refers to the temperature change in a material when an electric field is applied or removed. Significant breakthroughs revealed its potential for solid-state cooling technologies in past decades. These devices offer a sustainable alternative to traditional vapor compression refrigeration, with advantages such as compactness, silent operation, and the absence of moving parts or refrigerants.
  Electrocaloric effects are typically studied using indirect methods using polarization data, and which suffer from inaccuracies related to assumptions about heat capacity. Direct methods, although more precise, require device fabrication and face challenges in studying meso- or nanoscale systems, like 2D materials, and materials with non-uniform polarization textures where high spatial resolution is required.
  In this study, a novel technique, Scanning Electrocaloric Thermometry, is introduced for characterizing the local electrocaloric effect in nanomaterials. This approach achieves high spatial resolution by locally applying electric fields and by simultaneously measuring the resulting temperature change. By employing AC excitation, the measurement sensitivity is further enhanced and the electrocaloric effect is disentangled from other heating mechanisms such as Joule heating and dielectric losses. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated by examining electrocaloric and heat dissipation phenomena in two-dimensional In${}_2$Se${}_3$ micrometer-sized flakes.</description>

      <title>Twist-tuned quantum criticality in moir\'e bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We argue that moir\'e bilayer graphene at charge neutrality hosts a continuous semimetal-to-insulator quantum phase transition that can be accessed experimentally by tuning the twist angle between the two layers. For small twist angles near the first magic angle, the system realizes a Kramers intervalley-coherent insulator, characterized by circulating currents and spontaneously broken time reversal and U(1) valley symmetries. For larger twist angles above a critical value, the spectrum remains gapless down to the lowest temperatures, with a fully symmetric Dirac semimetal ground state. Using self-consistent Hartree-Fock theory applied to a realistic model of twisted bilayer graphene, based on the Bistritzer-MacDonald Hamiltonian augmented by screened Coulomb interactions, we find that the twist-tuned quantum phase transition is continuous. We argue that the quantum critical behavior belongs to the relativistic Gross-Neveu-XY universality class, and we characterize it through an effective field theory analysis. Our theoretical predictions can be directly tested using current experimental setups incorporating the recently developed quantum twisting microscope.</description>

      <title>A two-dimensional 10-qubit array in germanium with robust and localised qubit control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computers require the systematic operation of qubits with high fidelity. For holes in germanium, the spin-orbit interaction allows for \textit{in situ} electric fast and high-fidelity qubit gates. However, the interaction also causes a large qubit variability due to strong g-tensor anisotropy and dependence on the environment. Here, we leverage advances in material growth, device fabrication, and qubit control to realise a two-dimensional 10-spin qubit array, with qubits coupled up to four neighbours that can be controlled with high fidelity. By exploring the large parameter space of gate voltages and quantum dot occupancies, we demonstrate that plunger gate driving in the three-hole occupation enhances electric-dipole spin resonance (EDSR), creating a highly localised qubit drive. Our findings, confirmed with analytical and numerical models, highlight the crucial role of intradot Coulomb interaction and magnetic field direction. Furthermore, the ability to engineer qubits for robust control is a key asset for further scaling.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking stochasticity behind reproducibility: denoising strategies in Ta$_2$O$_5$ memristors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reproducibility, endurance, driftless data retention, and fine resolution of the programmable conductance weights are key technological requirements against memristive artificial synapses in neural network applications. However, the inherent fluctuations in the active volume impose severe constraints on the weight resolution. In order to understand and push these limits, a comprehensive noise benchmarking and noise reduction protocol is introduced. Our approach goes beyond the measurement of steady-state readout noise levels and tracks the voltage-dependent noise characteristics all along the resistive switching $I(V)$ curves. Furthermore, we investigate the tunability of the noise level by dedicated voltage cycling schemes in our filamentary Ta$_2$O$_5$ memristors. This analysis highlights a broad, order-of-magnitude variability of the possible noise levels behind seemingly reproducible switching cycles. Our nonlinear noise spectroscopy measurements identify a subthreshold voltage region with voltage-boosted fluctuations. This voltage range enables the reconfiguration of the fluctuators without resistive switching, yielding a highly denoised state within a few subthreshold cycles.</description>

      <title>Adiabatic preparation of a number-conserving atomic Majorana phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15286v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a protocol to adiabatically prepare the ground state of a widely discussed number-conserving model Hamiltonian for ultracold atoms in optical lattices that supports Majorana edge states. In particular, we introduce a symmetry breaking mass term that amounts to threading a commensurate (artificial) magnetic flux through the plaquettes of the considered two-leg ladder which opens a constant bulk gap. This enables the preparation of the topological Majorana phase from a trivial Mott insulator state with optimal asymptotic scaling of the ramp time in system size, which is linear owing to the critical nature of the target state. Using constructive bosonization techniques that account for both finite size effects and global fermion number conservation, we are able to fully explain with theory the somewhat counterintuitive necessity of the aforementioned commensurate flux for a controlled bulk gap. Our analytical predictions are corroborated and quantified by unbiased numerical matrix product states (MPS) simulations. Directly building up on previous experimental work, the crucial flux-term of the proposed protocol is feasible with state-of-the-art experimental techniques in atomic quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>Surface Modification and Subsequent Fermi Density Enhancement of Bi(111)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15313v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Defects introduced to the surface of Bi(111) break the translational symmetry and modify the surface states locally. We present a theoretical and experimental study of the 2D defects on the surface of Bi(111) and the states that they induce. Bi crystals cleaved in ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) at low temperature (110 K) and the resulting ion-etched surface are investigated by low-energy electron diffraction (LEED), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS), and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) as well as spectroscopy (STS) techniques in combination with density functional theory (DFT) calculations. STS measurements of cleaved Bi(111) reveal that a commonly observed bilayer step edge has a lower density of states (DOS) around the Fermi level as compared to the atomic-flat terrace. Following ion bombardment, the Bi(111) surface reveals anomalous behavior at both 110 and 300 K: Surface periodicity is observed by LEED, and a significant increase in the number of bilayer step edges and energetically unfavorable monolayer steps is observed by STM. It is suggested that the newly exposed monolayer steps and the type A bilayer step edges result in an increase to the surface Fermi density as evidenced by UPS measurements and the Kohn-Sham DOS. These states appear to be thermodynamically stable under UHV conditions.</description>

      <title>How phonon coherence develops and contributes to heat conduction in periodic and aperiodic superlattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work investigates the impact of device length on thermal conductivity in periodic and aperiodic superlattices (SLs). While it is well known that thermal conductivity in aperiodic SLs exhibits a weaker dependence on device length compared to periodic SLs, existing literature attributes this behavior to the scattering of coherent phonons by aperiodically arranged interfaces. Through atomistic wave-packet simulations, we show that coherent phonons in aperiodic SLs have spatial extensions limited to a certain number of SL layers, which prevents transmission if the extension is shorter than the device length. Specifically, the disordered interface spacing in aperiodic SLs causes coherent phonons to behave as non-propagative vibrational modes, resulting in diffuse energy transmission. In periodic SLs, however, coherent phonons can propagate across the entire structure, enabling high transmission. The difference between ballistic transport in periodic SLs and diffuse transport in aperiodic SLs is captured in the length-dependence of phonon transmission. These findings provide new insights into phonon coherence and its implications for heat conduction in superlattices, with potential applications in the thermal design of nanostructures.</description>

Abstract: Non-equilibrium quantum thermodynamics is an intensively developing field with many existing applications. We study the dynamics of temperatures and chemical potentials of fermionic reservoirs coupled to an open quantum system. We show that heat transfer from the coldest reservoir to the hottest one is allowed by the Clausius inequality and results in transient cooling of the coldest reservoir without additional external refrigeration. We show that during the establishment of thermal and chemical equilibrium, non-monotone evolution of reservoirs' temperatures and chemical potentials is possible, including changes in reservoirs' temperatures and chemical potentials orderliness. Achieved results can be used in the design of quantum thermal machines and nanoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Conformal approach to physics simulations for thin curved 3D membranes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15741v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Three-dimensional nanoarchitectures are widely used across various areas of physics, including spintronics, photonics, and superconductivity. In this regard, thin curved 3D membranes are especially interesting for applications in nano- and optoelectronics, sensorics, and information processing, making physics simulations in complex 3D geometries indispensable for unveiling new physical phenomena and the development of devices. Here, we present a general-purpose approach to physics simulations for thin curved 3D membranes, that allows for performing simulations using finite difference methods instead of meshless methods or methods with irregular meshes. The approach utilizes a numerical conformal mapping of the initial surface to a flat domain and is based on the uniformization theorem stating that any simply-connected Riemann surface is conformally equivalent to an open unit disk, a complex plane, or a Riemann sphere. We reveal that for many physical problems involving the Laplace operator and divergence, a flat-domain formulation of the initial problem only requires a modification of the equations of motion and the boundary conditions by including a conformal factor and the mean/Gaussian curvatures. We demonstrate the method's capabilities for case studies of the Schr\"{o}dinger equation for a charged particle in static electric and magnetic fields for 3D geometries, including C-shaped and ring-shaped structures, as well as for the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equation.</description>

      <title>Entanglement entropy scaling laws from fluctuations of non-conserved quantities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Entanglement patterns reveal essential information on many-body states and provide a way to classify quantum phases of matter. However, experimental studies of many-body entanglement remain scarce due to their unscalable nature. The present work aims to mitigate this theoretical and experimental divide by introducing reduced fluctuations of observables, consisting of a sum of on-site operators, as a scalable experimental probe of the entanglement entropy. Specifically, we illustrate by Density Matrix Renormalization Group calculations in spin chains that the reduced fluctuations exhibit the same size scaling properties as the entanglement entropy. Generalizing previous observations restricted to special systems with conserved quantities, our work introduces experimentally feasible protocol to extract entanglement scaling laws.</description>

      <title>Up-Converting Luminescent Nanoparticles as Probes of Surface Dynamics in Single Evaporating Microdroplets of Suspension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15833v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have investigated the optically measurable properties of single evaporating microdroplets of suspensions containing up-converting luminescent nanoparticles (Gd2O3:Er3+), levitated in a linear electrodynamic trap. These microdroplets served as spherical optical resonators, with their resonance properties influenced by the distribution and interactions of nanoparticles (NPs) acting as nanoprobes. Using a combination of light scattering theories, we examined the evolution of the microdroplet radius, nanoparticle surface organization, and effective refractive index during evaporation. Up-conversion luminescence, driven by 805 nm excitation, enhanced the resolution of these observations. Key findings reveal that the increasing NP density in the surface layer leads to surface saturation, followed by transitions to a gel-like state through successive layer formation and collapse. Scattering and luminescence signals exhibit complex oscillatory behaviors linked to resonance phenomena and nanoparticle migration driven by photophoretic forces. Theoretical modeling closely aligns with experimental trends, confirming the interplay between NP distribution and optical resonance properties.</description>

In doing so, we resolve a contradiction in the original argument, and in the case of a $\nu = 1/m$ Laughlin holes, we also show that the standard relation between fractional charge and statistics is necessary by an argument based on a t'Hooft anomaly in a one-form global ${\mathcal Z}_m$ symmetry.</description>

      <title>Identifying Switching of Antiferromagnets by Spin-Orbit Torques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Antiferromagnets are promising candidates for ultrafast spintronic applications, leveraging current-induced spin-orbit torques. However, experimentally distinguishing between different switching mechanisms of the staggered magnetization (N\'eel vector) driven by current pulses remains a challenge. In an exemplary study of the collinear antiferromagnetic compound Mn$_2$Au, we demonstrate that slower thermomagnetoelastic effects predominantly govern switching over a wide parameter range. In the regime of short current pulses in the nanosecond range, however, we observe fully N\'eel spin-orbit torque driven switching. We show that this ultrafast mechanism enables the complete directional alignment of the N\'eel vector by current pulses in device structures.</description>

      <title>Dynamic heterogeneity in the self-induced spin glass state of elemental neodymium</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spin glasses are magnetic materials exhibiting numerous magnetization patterns, that randomly vary both in real space and in time. To date, it is still not well understood what the nature of these spatiotemporal dynamics is, namely if they are completely random or if there are links between given time and length scales. Here we show the ubiquitous behavior of dynamic heterogeneity in the self-induced spin glass state of elemental neodymium. We used spin-polarized scanning tunneling microscopy in combination with atomistic spin dynamics simulations to image the locally ordered magnetic patterns in the glass state, and tracked the induced spatiotemporal dynamics in response to external perturbations. We observed that the real space magnetization exhibited a coexistence of slow and fast dynamics reminiscent of dynamic heterogeneity in structural glasses. Furthermore, we found that zero-field cooling imprints a specific set of metastable periodicities into the spin glass, which evolved during aging and could be thermally reinitialized. These results demonstrate the importance of local length scales for the understanding of aging dynamics in spin glasses and provide a link to the more general picture of true glasses.</description>

      <title>Collective single-photon emission and energy transfer in thin-layer dielectric and plasmonic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16000v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the collective photon decay of multiple quantum emitters embedded in a thin high-index dielectric layer such as hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), with and without a metal substrate. We first explore the significant role that guided modes including surface plasmon modes play in the collective decay of identical singlephoton emitters (super- and subradiance). Surprisingly, on distances relevant for collective emission, the guided or surface-plasmon modes do not always enhance the collective emission. We identify configurations with inhibition, and others with enhancement of the dipole interaction due to the guided modes. We interpret our results in terms of local and cross densities of optical states. In the same structure, we show a remarkably favorable configuration for enhanced F\"orster resonance energy transfer between a donor and acceptor in the dielectric layer on a metallic substrate. We compare our results to theoretical limits for energy transfer efficiency.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Single pulse All Optical Helicity-Independent Switching is demonstrated in an in-plane magnetized magnetic tunnel junction. A toggle switching of the 2nm thick Co40Fe40B20 soft layer could be achieved by exchange coupling the Co40Fe40B20 with a 10nm thick Co85Gd15 layer monitored by measuring the Tunnel magneto resistance of the device. The use of in plane magnetized electrodes relaxes the constrains linked to perpendicular magnetic anisotropy systems while achieving a tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) ratio exceeding 100%. The influence of the upper electrical electrode, which is opaque to the laser beam in this study, is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Integrability versus chaos in the steady state of many-body open quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16041v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Lindblad description of an open quantum system gives rise to two types of integrability, since the nonequilibrium steady state can be integrable independently of the Liouvillian. Taking boundary-driven and dephasing spin chains as a representative example, we discriminate Liouvillian and steady-state chaos by combining level spacing statistics and an extension of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis to open quantum systems. Moreover, we analyze the structure of the steady states by expanding it in the basis of Pauli strings and comparing the weight of strings of different lengths. We show that the natural expectation that integrable steady states are "simple" (i.e., built from few-body local operators) does not hold: the steady states of both chaotic and integrable models have relevant contributions coming from Pauli strings of all possible lengths, including long-range and many-body interactions. Nevertheless, we show that one can effectively use the operator-size distribution to distinguish chaotic and integrable steady states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16116v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an architecture for bit flip error correction of Andreev spins that is protected by Kramers' degeneracy. Specifically, we show that a coupling network of linear inductors results in a static Hamiltonian composed of the stabilizers of a bit flip code. Thereby, without detuning from the Kramers' point, reflectometry off a single coupled resonator accomplishes a projective measurement of multiple stabilizers. We further show how circuit-mediated spin couplings enable error correction operations and a complete set of logical quantum gates. The concept is experimentally feasible.</description>

Abstract: Quantum noise plays a pivotal role in understanding quantum transport phenomena, including current correlations and wave-particle duality. A recent focus in this domain is $\Delta_T$ noise, which arises due to a finite temperature difference in the absence of charge current at zero voltage bias. This paper investigates $\Delta_T$ noise in mesoscopic hybrid junctions with insulators, where the average charge current is zero at zero voltage bias, through the measurement of quantum shot noise, i.e., $\Delta_T$ noise. Notably, we find that the $\Delta_T$ noise in metal-insulator-superconductor junctions is significantly larger than in metal-insulator-metal junctions. Furthermore, our results reveal that $\Delta_T$ noise initially increases with barrier strength, peaks, and then decreases, while it shows a steady increase with temperature bias, highlighting the nuanced interplay between barrier characteristics and thermal gradients.</description>

      <title>Floquet Analysis on an Irradiated Nodal Surface Semimetal with Non-Symmorphic Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04053v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A nodal surface semimetal (NSSM) features symmetry enforced band crossings along a surface within the three-dimensional (3D) Brillouin zone (BZ) and a presence of a nonsymmorphic symmetry there pushes such surfaces to stick to the BZ center or boundaries. The topological robustness of the same does not always come with nonzero Berry fluxes. We consider two such nodal surfaces (NS), one with zero and another with nonzero topological charges and investigate the effect of light irradiation on them. We find that depending on the state of polarization, one can obtain additional Weyl points/ nodal surfaces in the corresponding Floquet Hamiltonians. Particularly, using a simple two band spinless/spin polarized models with no spin orbit coupling, we emphasize the low energy behavior of the continuum Hamiltonians close to the band crossings and its evolution in a Floquet system in the high frequency limit. In the Floquet system, we also find the nodal surfaces to perish or new multi Weyl points to get popped up for different polarization scenario or different NSSM Hamiltonians. Our findings open up important avenues on what out of equilibrium NSSM systems can offer in many active fields including quantum computations.</description>

      <title>Steady-state dynamics and non-local correlations in thermoelectric Cooper pair splitters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06053v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent experiments on Cooper pair splitters using superconductor-quantum dot hybrids have embarked on creating entanglement in the solid-state, by engineering the sub-gap processes in the superconducting region. Using the thermoelectric Cooper pair splitter setup [Nat. Comm., 12, 21, (2021)] as a prototype, we present a comprehensive analysis of the fundamental components of the observed transport signal, aiming to critically clarify the operating regimes and confirm the nonlocal and nonclassical nature of correlations arising from crossed Andreev processes. By making a nexus with quantum discord, we identify operating points of nonlocal quantum correlations in the CPS device -- information that cannot be extracted from the transport signal alone. A notable consequence of our analysis is the finding that contact-induced level broadening of the quantum dot's discrete energy spectrum, along with its hybridization with the superconducting segment, can lead to shifted resonances in the crossed Andreev process as well as a parity reversal in the thermoelectric current. Our work thereby provides detailed insights into the gate voltage control of the quantum correlations in superconducting-hybrid Cooper pair splitters, revealing new avenues for harnessing quantum correlations in solid-state systems.</description>

      <title>Correlation functions of the Kitaev model with a spatially modulated phase in the superconducting order parameter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15733v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Kitaev chain model with a spatially modulated phase in the superconducting order parameter exhibits two types of topological transitions, namely a band topology transition between trivial and topological gapped phases, and a Fermi surface Lifshitz transition from a gapped to a gapless superconducting state. We investigate the correlation functions of the model for arbitrary values of superconducting coupling~$\Delta_0$, chemical potential $\mu$, and phase modulation wavevector $Q$, characterizing the current flowing through the system. In the cases $\mu=0$ or $Q=\pm \pi/2$ the model turns out to exhibit special symmetries, which are proven to induce an even/odd effect in the correlations as a function of the distance $l$ between two lattice sites, as they are non-vanishing or strictly vanishing depending on the parity of $l$, measured in the lattice spacing unit. We identify a clear difference between the band topology and the Lifshitz transition through the $Q$-dependence of the short distance correlation functions, which, in particular, exhibit pronounced cusps with discontinuous derivatives across the Lifshitz transition. We also determine the long distance behavior of correlations, finding that in the gapped phase there can be various types of exponential decays and that in the gapless phase the algebraic decay is characterized by two different spatial periods, depending on the model parameters. Furthermore, we establish a connection between the gapless superconducting phase of the Kitaev chain and the chiral phase of spin models with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17512v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Kinetic inductance travelling-wave parametric amplifiers (KTWPAs) are emerging as core components in many applications where wideband cryogenic rf amplification at or near the quantum limit of added noise is critical. These thin film superconducting devices are unique in their ability to simultaneously provide large dynamic range and quantum-limited amplification of single photon to 100,000s of photon signals. Despite the promising performance of co-planar NbTiN thin-film KTWPAs, the original promise of a "simple" single-layer metal fabrication has encountered roadblocks and their broader adoption has been hindered by low fabrication yield. In this work, we present a post-lithography correction technique that eliminates short circuits, significantly improving yield and enabling reliable wafer-scale production. Using automated image acquisition, error analysis, and correction, we successfully fabricated operational KTWPAs on high-resistivity silicon, achieving &gt; 10 dB between 2 - 4 GHz. This approach paves the way for the scaling up manufacturing of KTWPAs, positioning them for widespread deployment in quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>BATIS: Bootstrapping, Autonomous Testing, and Initialization System for Quantum Dot Devices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07676v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Semiconductor quantum dot (QD) devices have become central to advancements in spin-based quantum computing. As the complexity of QD devices grows, manual tuning becomes increasingly infeasible, necessitating robust and scalable autotuning solutions. Tuning large arrays of QD qubits depends on efficient choices of automated protocols. Here, we introduce a bootstrapping, autonomous testing, and initialization system (BATIS) designed to streamline QD device evaluation and calibration. BATIS navigates high-dimensional gate voltage spaces, automating essential steps such as leakage testing and gate characterization. For forming the current channels, BATIS follows a non-standard approach that requires a single measurement regardless of the number of channels. Demonstrated at 1.3 K on a quad-QD Si/Si$_x$Ge$_{1-x}$ device, BATIS eliminates the need for deep cryogenic environments during initial device diagnostics, significantly enhancing scalability and reducing setup times. By requiring only minimal prior knowledge of the device architecture, BATIS represents a platform-agnostic solution, adaptable to various QD systems, which bridges a critical gap in QD autotuning.</description>

Abstract: Confining electrons or holes in quantum dots formed in the channel of industry-standard fully depleted silicon-on-insulator CMOS structures is a promising approach to scalable qubit architectures. In this communication, we present measurement results of a commercial nanostructure fabricated using the GlobalFoundries 22FDX(TM) industrial process. We demonstrate here that quantum dots are formed in the device channel by applying a combination of a back- and gate voltages. We report our results on an effective detuning of the energy levels in the quantum dots by varying the barrier gate voltages in combination with the back-gate voltage. Given the need and importance of scaling to larger numbers of qubits, we demonstrate here the feasibility of single-electron box sensors at the edge of the quantum dot array for effective charge sensing in different operation modes -- sensing charge transitions in a single- and double quantum dots forming the quantum dot array. We also report measurement results demonstrating bias triangle pair formation and precise control over coupled quantum dots with variations in the inter-dot barrier. The reported measurement results demonstrate the ability to control the formation and coupling of multiple quantum dots in a quantum dot array and to sense their charge state via a Single Electron Box sensor in a commercial process for the first time.</description>

Abstract: Magnon Bose-Einstein condensates in ferromagnetic insulators has been a field of much interest, while condensation in anti-ferromagnetic systems are yet to be explored in detail. We analyze the stability of condensed chiral magnons in two antiferromagnetic insulators: an easy-axis system and a biaxial system. We show that two-component magnon condensation and inter-magnon interactions are essential to create metastable magnon condensation. The uniaxial system with a Rashba-type DMI interaction supports two condensate populations at finite wavevectors. The condensation state is stable only when the distribution of magnons between the two populations is symmetric. On the other hand, in the biaxial system without DMI interaction we predict that the magnons condensate will not be stabilized. The results indicate that the lack of stability is a general feature of single-component quasiparticle condensates.</description>

      <title>Robust gap closing and reopening in topological-insulator Josephson junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08265v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the seminal proposal by Fu and Kane, the superconducting proximity effect is used to realize topological superconductivity in the topological surface state (TSS) of a 3D topological insulator (TI). In a line Josephson junction made on the TI surface, the spin-momentum locking of the TSS guarantees the existence of a pair of spin-non-degenerate, perfectly transmitted Andreev modes. These modes lead to robust gap closing and parity alteration as a function of the superconducting phase difference $\varphi$ across the junction. Here, we report the observation of the predicted gap closing at $\varphi = (2n+1)\pi$ in a TI Josephson junction ($n$ integer), where the local density of states is probed via tunnel contacts and $\varphi$ is controlled by a flux loop. This phenomenon is robust for a wide range of chemical potentials, supporting its TSS origin. Under an applied perpendicular magnetic field, Josephson vortices form, making $\varphi$ position-dependent. In this case, the gap closing occurs locally at the Josephson vortex cores where $\varphi = (2n+1)\pi$, which we also observe. Our results confirm the fundamental role of spin-momentum locking in the Andreev physics in the TSS, which implies that the observed gap closing and reopening has a topological nature.</description>

      <title>Cheshire qudits from fractional quantum spin Hall states in twisted MoTe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03401v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Twisted MoTe$_2$ homobilayers exhibit transport signatures consistent with a fractional quantum spin Hall (FQSH) state. We describe a route to construct topological quantum memory elements, dubbed Cheshire qudits, formed from punching holes in such a FQSH state and using proximity-induced superconductivity to gap out the resulting helical edge states. Cheshire qudits encode quantum information in states that differ by a fractional topological "Cheshire" charge that is hidden from local detection within a condensate anyons. Control of inter-edge tunneling by gates enables both supercurrent-based readout of a Cheshire qudit, and capacitive measurement of the thermal entropy associated with its topological ground-space degeneracy. Additionally, we systematically classify different types of gapped boundaries, Cheshire qudits, and parafermionic twist defects for various Abelian and non-Abelian candidate FQSH orders that are consistent with the transport data, and describe experimental signatures to distinguish these orders.</description>

      <title>Structural Properties and Recrystallization Effects in Ion Beam Modified B20-type FeGe Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02325v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Disordered iron germanium (FeGe) has recently garnered interest as a testbed for a variety of magnetic phenomena as well as for use in magnetic memory and logic applications. This is partially owing to its ability to host skyrmions and antiskyrmions -- nanoscale whirlpools of magnetic moments that could serve as information carriers in spintronic devices. In particular, a tunable skyrmion-antiskyrmion system may be created through precise control of the defect landscape in B20-phase FeGe, motivating developing methods to systematically tune disorder in this material and understand the ensuing structural properties. To this end, we investigate a route for modifying magnetic properties in FeGe. Specifically, we irradiate epitaxial B20-phase FeGe films with 2.8 MeV Au$^{4+}$ ions, which creates a dispersion of amorphized regions that may preferentially host antiskyrmions at densities controlled by the irradiation fluence. To further tune the disorder landscape, we conduct a systematic electron diffraction study with in-situ annealing, demonstrating the ability to recrystallize controllable fractions of the material at temperatures ranging from approximately 150$^{\circ}$ C to 250$^{\circ}$C. Finally, we describe the crystallization kinetics using the Johnson-Mehl-Avrami-Kolmogorov model, finding that the growth of crystalline grains is consistent with diffusion-controlled one-to-two dimensional growth with a decreasing nucleation rate.</description>

      <title>Josephson diode effect in one-dimensional quantum wires connected to superconductors with mixed singlet-triplet pairing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02794v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Josephson diode effect (JDE), characterized by asymmetric critical currents in a Josephson junction, has drawn considerable attention in the field of condensed matter physics. We investigate the conditions under which JDE can manifest in a one-dimensional Josephson junction composed of a spin-orbit-coupled quantum wire with an applied Zeeman field, connected between two superconductors. Our study reveals that while spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and a Zeeman field in the quantum wire are not sufficient to induce JDE when the superconductors are purely singlet, introduction of triplet pairing in the superconductors leads to the emergence of JDE. This finding highlights the potential of JDE as a probe for triplet superconductivity. We further demonstrate that even in absence of SOC in the quantum wire, JDE can arise when the directions of the triplet pairing and the Zeeman field are non-collinear, provided the superconductors exhibit mixed singlet-triplet pairing. Additionally, we identify specific conditions under which JDE is absent, namely, when the pairing is purely triplet and the directions of the SOC and the triplet pairing are perpendicular. Our findings indicate that JDE is always accompanied by anomalous Josephson effect. The diode effect coefficient is found to oscillate with variations in the chemical potential of the quantum wire, driven by Fabry-P\'erot interference effects. Our results suggest that quantum wires connected across superconductors can serve as effective platforms for probing triplet superconductivity through the observation of JDE.</description>

      <title>Spin fractionalization at the edge of quantum Hall fluids induced by bulk quasiparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14879v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define a measurable spin for the edge of a lowest Landau level and incompressible fractional quantum Hall state in the presence of an Abelian or non-Abelian bulk quasiparticle. We show that this quantity takes a fractional value inherited from the fractional spin of the bulk quasiparticle. We present a geometric picture that does not rely on global symmetries of the wavefunction but is able to treat quasiparticles and edges with different shapes. We study finite-size many-body wavefunctions on the cylinder with circular quasiparticles and straight edges. Our results are supported by matrix-product-state calculations for the Laughlin and the k=3 Read-Rezayi states.</description>

      <title>A bosonic matrix product state description of Read-Rezayi states and its application to quasi-hole spins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14889v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the $k=3$ Read-Rezayi quantum Hall state by means of a purely bosonic matrix product state formulation, which is described in detail. We calculate the density profiles in the presence of bulk quasi-holes of six different types: one for each $\mathbb{Z}_3$ parafermion sector. From the density profiles, we calculate the (local) spins of these quasi-holes. By employing a spin-statistics relation, we obtain the exchange statistics parameters. Our results, which are entirely based on local properties of the quasi-holes, corroborate previous results obtained by explicitly braiding quasi-holes, showing that the exchange statistics can be read off from the monodromy properties of the wave functions, i.e., that the associated Berry phase vanishes. We also discuss the entanglement spectrum, to show that our bosonic matrix product state formulation correctly captures the $\mathbb{Z}_3$ parafermionic structure of the $k=3$ Read-Rezayi states.</description>

      <title>Short two-qubit pulse sequences for exchange-only spin qubits in 2D layouts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14918v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Exchange-only (EO) spin qubits in quantum dots offer an expansive design landscape for architecting scalable device layouts. The study of two-EO-qubit operations, which involve six electrons in six quantum dots, has so far been limited to a small number of the possible configurations, and previous works lack analyses of design considerations and implications for quantum error correction. Using a simple and fast optimization method, we generate complete pulse sequences for CX, CZ, iSWAP, leakage-controlled CX, and leakage-controlled CZ two-qubit gates on 450 unique planar six-dot topologies and analyze differences in sequence length (up to 43% reduction) across topology classes. In addition, we show that relaxing constraints on post-operation spin locations can yield further reductions in sequence length; conversely, constraining these locations in a particular way generates a CXSWAP operation with minimal additional cost over a standard CX. We integrate this pulse library into the Intel quantum stack and experimentally verify pulse sequences on a Tunnel Falls chip for different operations in a linear-connectivity device to confirm that they work as expected. Finally, we explore architectural implications of these results for quantum error correction. Our work guides hardware and software design choices for future implementations of scalable quantum dot architectures.</description>
