      <title>Will LAGEOS and LARES 2 succeed in accurately measuring frame-dragging?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07264v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The current LAGEOS-LARES 2 experiment aims to accurately measure the general relativistic Lense-Thirring effect in the gravitomagnetic field of the spinning Earth generated by the latter's angular momentum $\boldsymbol{J}$. The key quantity to a priori analytically assess the overall systematic uncertainty is the ratio $\mathcal{R}^{J_2}$ of the sum of the classical precessions of the satellites' nodes $\Omega$ induced by the Earth's oblateness $J_2$ to the sum of their post-Newtonian counterparts. $In$ $principle$, if the sum of the inclinations $I$ of both satellites were $exactly$ $180^\circ$, the semimajor axes $a$ and the eccentricities $e$ being $identical$, $\mathcal{R}^{J_2}$ would $exactly$ vanish. Actually, it is $not$ so by a large amount because of the departures of the $real$ satellites' orbital configurations from their $ideal$ ones. Thus, $J_2$ impacts not only directly through its own uncertainty, but also $indirectly$ through the errors in all the other physical and orbital parameters entering $\mathcal{R}^{J_2}$. The consequences of this fact are examined in greater details than done so far in the literature. The Van Patten and Everitt's proposal in 1976 of looking at the sum of the node precessions of two counter-orbiting spacecraft in (low-altitude) circular polar orbits is revamped rebranding it POLAr RElativity Satellites (POLARES).

      <title>A decade of the fast-varying ionospheric and magnetospheric magnetic fields from ground and multi-satellite observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10601v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The time-varying geomagnetic field is a superposition of contributions from multiple internal and external current systems. A major source of geomagnetic variations at periods less than a few years are current systems external to the solid Earth, namely the ionospheric and magnetospheric currents, as well as associated induced currents. The separation of these three sources is mathematically underdetermined using either ground or satellite measurements alone, but becomes tractable when the two datasets are combined. Based on this concept, we developed a new geomagnetic field modelling approach that allows us to simultaneously characterise the mid-latitude ionospheric, magnetospheric and the internal induced magnetic fields using ground and satellite observations for all local times and magnetic conditions, and without prescribing any harmonic behaviour on these current systems in time, as is typical in other models. By applying this new method to a 10-year dataset of ground observatory and multi-satellite measurements from 2014 to 2023, we obtained the time series of the spherical harmonic coefficients of the ionospheric, magnetospheric and induced fields. These new time series allow the study of complex non-periodic dynamics of the external magnetic fields during global geomagnetic storms, as well as periodicities in the magnetospheric coefficients linked to solar activities and periodic ionospheric magnetic fields linked to lunar daily variations, contributing to a more complete picture of the dynamics of the external currents and magnetosphere-ionosphere interactions, and facilitating more accurate space weather nowcast and forecast. Finally, the new approach allows for a better characterisation of internal induced field sources, leading to higher quality electromagnetic transfer functions.</description>

      <title>Electron-only reconnection and inverse magnetic-energy transfer at sub-ion scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06020v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive, and validate numerically, an analytical model for electron-only magnetic reconnection applicable to strongly magnetized plasmas. Our model predicts sub-ion-scale reconnection rates significantly higher than those pertaining to large-scale reconnection, aligning with recent observations and simulations. We apply this reconnection model to the problem of inverse magnetic energy transfer at sub-ion scales. We derive time-dependent scaling laws for the magnetic energy decay and the typical magnetic structure dimensions that differ from those previously found in the MHD regime. These scaling laws are validated via two- and three-dimensional simulations, demonstrating that sub-ion scale magnetic fields can reach large, system-size scales via successive coalescence.</description>

      <title>The Lense-Thirring effect at work in M87$^\ast$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08686v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, the temporal evolution of the angles characterizing the spatial configuration of the jet in the supermassive black hole M87$^\ast$ was measured exhibiting a precessional pattern around the hole's spin axis. It would be due to the dragging induced by the fact that the hole's external spacetime is described by the Kerr metric. Here, it is shown that the Lense-Thirring orbital precessions of a test particle moving about a rotating massive object, calculated perturbatively to the first post-Newtonian order, are able to fully reproduce all the measured features of the jet axis of M87$^\ast$. In particular, by assuming that the latter is aligned with the angular momentum of the accretion disk, modelled as an effective particle moving along a circular orbit, the condition that the absolute value of the predicted Lense-Thirring precessional frequency of the disk agrees with the measured value of $0.56\pm 0.02$ radians per year of the jet's one is satisfied for a range of physically meaningful values of the hole's spin parameter, close to unity, and of the effective disk radius, of the order of just over a dozen gravitational radii. Relying upon such assumptions and results, it is possible to predict that the angle between the hole's spin axis and the jet's one stays constant over the years amounting to $1.16^\circ$, in agreement with its measured value of $1.25^\circ\pm 0.18^\circ$. Furthermore, also the temporal pattern and the amplitudes of the time series of the jet's angles are reproduced by the aforementioned Lense-Thirring precessional model.</description>

      <title>An experimental platform for levitated mechanics in space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17108v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conducting levitated mechanical experiments in extreme conditions has long been the aim of researchers, as it allows for the investigation of new fundamental physics phenomena. One of the great frontiers has been sending these experiments into the micro-g environment of space, with multiple proposals calling for such a platform. At the same time, levitated sensors have demonstrated a high sensitivity to external stimuli which will only improve in low-vibrational conditions. conditions This paper describes the development of a technology demonstrator for optical and magnetic trapping experiments in space. Our payload represents the first concrete step towards future missions with aims of probing fundamental physical questions: matter-wave interferometry of nanoparticles to probe the limits of macroscopic quantum mechanics, detection of Dark Matter candidates and gravitational waves to test physics beyond the Standard Model, and accelerometry for Earth-observation.</description>
