      <title>Neural Field Transformations for Hybrid Monte Carlo: Architectural Design and Scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Critical slowing down, where autocorrelation grows rapidly near the continuum limit due to Hybrid Monte Carlo (HMC) moving through configuration space inefficiently, still challenges lattice gauge theory simulations. Combining neural field transformations with HMC (NTHMC) can reshape the energy landscape and accelerate sampling, but the choice of neural architectures has yet to be studied systematically. We evaluate NTHMC on a two-dimensional U(1) gauge theory, analyzing how it scales and transfers to larger volumes and smaller lattice spacing. Controlled comparisons let us isolate architectural contributions to sampling efficiency. Good designs can reduce autocorrelation and boost topological tunneling while maintaining favorable scaling. More broadly, our study highlights emerging design guides, such as wider receptive fields and channel-dependent activations, paving the way for systematic extensions to four-dimensional SU(3) gauge theory.</description>

      <title>Accurate nucleon iso-vector scalar and tensor charge at physical point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a new high precision calculation of the isospin vector charge $g_{S,T}$ of the nucleon using recently proposed ``blending" method which provides a high-accuracy stochastic estimate of the all-to-all fermion propagator. By combining the current-involved interpolation operator, which can efficiently cancel the major excited state contamination, we can extract high-precision $g_S$ and $g_T$ directly at the physical pion mass. Using 15 of the $N_f=2+1$ lattice ensembles which covers 5 lattice spacing, 5 combinations with the same quark masses and lattice spacing but multiple volumes, and includes three at the physical pion mass, we report so far most accurate lattice QCD prediction $g_T^{\rm QCD} = 1.0258[79]_{\rm tot}(56)_{\rm stat} (24)_{a} (44)_{\rm FV} (01)_\chi (24)_{\rm ex} (05)_{\rm re}$ and $g_S^{\rm QCD} = 1.107[47]_{\rm tot}(32)_{\rm stat} ( 04)_{a} (29)_{\rm FV} (01)_\chi (18)_{\rm ex} (08)_{\rm re}$ at $\overline{\mathrm{MS}}$ 2~GeV, with the systematic uncertainty from continuum, infinite volume, chiral extrapolations, excited state contamination and also renormalization.</description>

      <title>An exploratory calculation of $K_{\rm L}\to\mu^+\mu^-$ decay from Lattice QCD at physical pion mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04346v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the complex, long-distance two-photon-exchange amplitude which contributes to the rare $K_{\rm L}\rightarrow\mu^+\mu^-$ decay from lattice QCD. We use a $24^3\times 64$ physical-pion-mass gauge field ensemble at an inverse lattice spacing of $1.023$ GeV and a QED${}_\infty$-based formalism. Our implementation strategies for all five non-SU$(3)$-flavor-suppressed diagram topologies are given in detail. We achieve a 25% statistical precision on the dispersive part of this long-distance amplitude. This calculation is carried out with 2+1 quark flavors and therefore requires the addition of counter terms to compensate for the absence of the Glashow-Iliopoulos-Maiani mechanism. These counter terms are not included in the current calculation and will be the subject of a second paper. The precision of our results is limited by the reconstruction of the physical contribution of the $\eta$ intermediate state, for which various strategies are tested and compared.</description>

      <title>Investigation of triply heavy spin-3/2 baryons in their ground and excited states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06822v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We calculate the masses and residues of triply heavy baryons with spin-3/2, including $\Omega^*_{ccc}$, $\Omega^*_{ccb}$, $\Omega^*_{bbc}$ and $\Omega^*_{bbb}$, using the QCD sum rules method. Our calculations primarily focus on obtaining the masses of the first three resonances, that is, the ground state (1S), the first orbital excited state (1P), and the first radial excited state (2S), for the mentioned baryons. We additionally determine the residues of these baryons, which serve as key parameters for studying their possible decay channels and interactions with other particles. To achieve higher accuracy compared to previous studies, we consider nonperturbative operators up to eight mass dimensions. We present our calculated outcomes in two distinct energy schemes, referred to as pole and $\mathrm{\overline{MS}}$. Given the absence of experimental data for these states, we compare our results with previous theoretical calculations that are reported in relevant studies employing various approaches. These results may provide valuable insights for experimental groups searching for the triply heavy baryons.</description>

      <title>$QQ\bar Q\bar Q$ Quark System and Gauge/String Duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25605v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a stringy description of a system composed of two heavy quarks and two heavy antiquarks, mimicking that in pure $SU(3)$ gauge theory. We present both analytical and numerical studies of the string configurations for rectangular geometries. As an application, we analyze the two lowest Born-Oppenheimer potentials. Our results suggest that the ground state of the $QQ\bar Q\bar Q$ system is a mixed state of a hadronic molecule and a tetraquark state. For general geometries, we derive the asymptotic expression for the energy of the tetraquark configuration in the infrared limit and extend this result to multiquark configurations. Here we also demonstrate the universality of the string tension.</description>
