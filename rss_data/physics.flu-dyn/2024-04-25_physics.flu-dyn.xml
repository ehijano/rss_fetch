      <title>Implementation of Immersed Boundaries through Volume Penalization in the Industrial Aeronautical Solver CODA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present the implementation and validation of the immersed boundary volume penalization methods in the CFD solver CODA. Our goal is the modelling and simulation of turbulent fluid flowsin complex 3D aerodynamic configuration through the numerical solution of the Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes equations using the Spalart-Allmaras turbulent model. To do that, an efficient immerse boundary method, together with an efficient preprocessing tool for the construction of unstructured hexahedral meshes with adaptive mesh refinement around immersed geometries has been developed. We report several numerical computations, including subsonic flow past a NACA0012 airfoil, subsonic flow past an MDA30P30N multi-element airfoil and subsonic flow around the NASA high-lift CRM aircraft. These simulations have been performed in the CODA solver with a second-order finite volume scheme as spatial discretization and an implicit backward-Euler scheme based on the matrix-free GMRES block-Jacobi iterative method. The reported numerical simulations are in very good agreement with their corresponding experimental data.</description>

      <title>Machine-Learned Closure of URANS for Stably Stratified Turbulence: Connecting Physical Timescales &amp; Data Hyperparameters of Deep Time-Series Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop time-series machine learning (ML) methods for closure modeling of the Unsteady Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes (URANS) equations applied to stably stratified turbulence (SST). SST is strongly affected by fine balances between forces and becomes more anisotropic in time for decaying cases. Moreover, there is a limited understanding of the physical phenomena described by some of the terms in the URANS equations. Rather than attempting to model each term separately, it is attractive to explore the capability of machine learning to model groups of terms, i.e., to directly model the force balances. We consider decaying SST which are homogeneous and stably stratified by a uniform density gradient, enabling dimensionality reduction. We consider two time-series ML models: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (NODE). Both models perform accurately and are numerically stable in a posteriori tests. Furthermore, we explore the data requirements of the ML models by extracting physically relevant timescales of the complex system. We find that the ratio of the timescales of the minimum information required by the ML models to accurately capture the dynamics of the SST corresponds to the Reynolds number of the flow. The current framework provides the backbone to explore the capability of such models to capture the dynamics of higher-dimensional complex SST flows.</description>

      <title>Spanwise Control Authority of Synthetic Jets on a Stalled Airfoil</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the aerodynamic effects of low- and high-frequency synthetic jet control strategies on a National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) 0025 airfoil. Visualizations and measurements are employed to assess the stability of the flow, focusing on the shear layer and wake dynamics under two forcing frequencies. High-frequency actuation is found to induce steadier flow reattachment and more favorable aerodynamic characteristics compared to low-frequency control. Flow structures resulting from high-frequency actuation, notably vortex rings, are identified and their significance in flow control is evaluated. Furthermore, the spanwise control authority is analyzed, revealing variations in aerodynamic stability away from the midspan. Insights from modal analysis provide additional understanding of flow structures and their evolution across different spanwise planes.</description>

      <title>A quantitative theory for heterogeneous combustion of nonvolatile metal particles in the diffusion-limited regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper presents an analytical theory quantitatively describing the heterogeneous combustion of nonvolatile (metal) particles in the diffusion-limited regime. It is assumed that the particle is suspended in an unconfined, isobaric, quiescent gaseous mixture and the chemisorption of the oxygen takes place evenly on the particle surface. The exact solution of the particle burn time is derived from the conservation equations of the gas-phase described in a spherical coordinate system with the utilization of constant thermophysical properties, evaluated at a reference film layer. This solution inherently takes the Stefan flow into account. The approximate expression of the time-dependent particle temperature is solved from the conservation of the particle enthalpy by neglecting the higher order terms in the Taylor expansion of the product of the transient particle density and diameter squared. Coupling the solutions for the burn time and time-dependent particle temperature provides quantitative results when initial and boundary conditions are specified. The theory is employed to predict the burn time and temperature of micro-sized iron particles, which are then compared with measurements, as the first validation case. The theoretical burn time agrees with the experiments almost perfectly at both low and high oxygen levels. The calculated particle temperature matches the measurements fairly well at relatively low oxygen mole fractions, whereas the theory overpredict the particle peak temperature due to the neglect of evaporation and the possible transition of the combustion regime.</description>

      <title>Finite-size inertial spherical particles in turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate by direct numerical simulations the fluid-solid interaction of non-dilute suspensions of spherical particles moving in triperiodic turbulence, at the relatively large Reynolds number of $Re_\lambda \approx 400$. The solid-to-fluid density ratio is varied between $1.3$ and $100$, the particle diameter $D$ ranges between $16 \le D/\eta \le 123$ ($\eta$ is the Kolmogorov scale), and the volume fraction of the suspension is $0.079$. Turbulence is sustained using the Arnold-Beltrami-Childress cellular-flow forcing. The influence of the solid phase on the largest and energetic scales of the flow changes with the size and density of the particles. Light and large particles modulate all scales in a isotropic way, while heavier and smaller particles modulate the largest scales of the flow towards an anisotropic state. Smaller scales are isotropic and homogeneous for all cases. The mechanism driving the energy transfer across scales changes with the size and the density of the particles. For large and light particles the energy transfer is only marginally influenced by the fluid-solid interaction. For small and heavy particles, instead, the classical energy cascade is subdominant at all scales, and the energy transfer is essentially driven by the fluid-solid coupling. The influence of the solid phase on the flow intermittency is also discussed. Besides, the collective motion of the particles and their preferential location in relation with properties of the carrier flow are analysed. The solid phase exhibits moderate clustering; for large particles the level of clustering decreases with their density, while for small particles it is maximum for intermediate values.</description>

      <title>Extended Thermodynamic and Mechanical Evolution Criterion for Fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Glansdorff and Prigogine General Evolution Criterion (GEC) is an inequality that holds for macroscopic physical systems obeying local equilibrium and that are constrained under timeindependent boundary conditions. The latter, however, may prove overly restrictive for many applications involving fluid flow in physics, chemistry and biology. We therefore analyze in detail a physically more-encompassing evolution criterion for time-dependent convective viscous flow with time-dependent boundary conditions. The result is an inequality involving the sum of a bulk volume and a surface contribution, and reduces to the GEC if and only if the surface term is zero. We use the closed-form analytical solution of the starting flow problem in straight cylindrical pipes to confirm this extended general evolution criterion. We next validate the starting flow problem and evolution criterion numerically. Numerical methods are used to validate the extended evolution criterion in non-fully developed flows inside complex geometries with curvature and torsion, such as encountered in sections of helical pipes. Knowledge of only the algebraic sign of the surface contribution is sufficient for predicting how the volume thermodynamic forces evolve in time and how the system approaches its non-equilibrium stationary state consistent with the boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Velocity-Based Monte Carlo Fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16274v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a velocity-based Monte Carlo fluid solver that overcomes the limitations of its existing vorticity-based counterpart. Because the velocity-based formulation is more commonly used in graphics, our Monte Carlo solver can be readily extended with various techniques from the fluid simulation literature. We derive our method by solving the Navier-Stokes equations via operator splitting and designing a pointwise Monte Carlo estimator for each substep. We reformulate the projection and diffusion steps as integration problems based on the recently introduced walk-on-boundary technique [Sugimoto et al. 2023]. We transform the volume integral arising from the source term of the pressure Poisson equation into a form more amenable to practical numerical evaluation. Our resulting velocity-based formulation allows for the proper simulation of scenes that the prior vorticity-based Monte Carlo method [Rioux-Lavoie and Sugimoto et al. 2022] either simulates incorrectly or cannot support. We demonstrate that our method can easily incorporate advancements drawn from conventional non-Monte Carlo methods by showing how one can straightforwardly add buoyancy effects, divergence control capabilities, and numerical dissipation reduction methods, such as advection-reflection and PIC/FLIP methods.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Arterial Blood Flow Simulations through Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16347v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study introduces a computational approach leveraging physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for the efficient computation of arterial blood flows, particularly focusing on solving the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations by using the domain decomposition technique. Unlike conventional computational fluid dynamics methods, PINNs offer advantages by eliminating the need for discretized meshes and enabling the direct solution of partial differential equations (PDEs). In this paper, we propose the weighted Extended Physics-Informed Neural Networks (WXPINNs) and weighted Conservative Physics-Informed Neural Networks (WCPINNs), tailored for detailed hemodynamic simulations based on generalized space-time domain decomposition techniques. The inclusion of multiple neural networks enhances the representation capacity of the weighted PINN methods. Furthermore, the weighted PINNs can be efficiently trained in parallel computing frameworks by employing separate neural networks for each sub-domain. We show that PINNs simulation results circumvent backflow instabilities, underscoring a notable advantage of employing PINNs over traditional numerical methods to solve such complex blood flow models. They naturally address such challenges within their formulations. The presented numerical results demonstrate that the proposed weighted PINNs outperform traditional PINNs settings, where sub-PINNs are applied to each subdomain separately. This study contributes to the integration of deep learning methodologies with fluid mechanics, paving the way for accurate and efficient high-fidelity simulations in biomedical applications, particularly in modeling arterial blood flow.</description>

      <title>A Mathematical Framework for Spatio-Temporal Control in Industrial Drying</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16604v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce two models of industrial drying - a simplified one-equation model, and a detailed three-equation model. The purpose of the simplified model is rigorous validation of numerical methods for PDE-constrained optimal control. The purpose of the detailed model is to be able to predict and control the behaviour of an industrial disk drier. For both models, we introduce a fully validated numerical method to compute the optimal source term to maintain the outlet temperature as close as possible to the set-point temperature. By performing simulations using realistic parameters for industrial driers, we illustrate potential applications of the method.</description>

      <title>A Test Problem for Flow Codes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16798v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a test problem for Navier-Stokes solvers based on the flow around a cylinder. We choose a range of Reynolds numbers for which the flow is time-dependent but can be characterized as essentially two-dimensional. The test problem requires accurate resolution of chaotic dynamics over a long time interval. It also requires the use of a relatively large computational domain, part of which is curved, and it requires evaluation of derivatives of the solution and pressure on the curved boundary. We review the performance of different finite element methods for the proposed range of Reynolds numbers. These tests indicate that some of the most established methods do not capture the correct behavior.</description>

      <title>Fingering convection in a spherical shell</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.01602v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use 123 three dimensional direct numerical simulations to study fingering convection in non-rotating spherical shells. We investigate the scaling behaviour of the flow lengthscale, the non-dimensional heat and compositional fluxes $Nu$ and $Sh$ and the mean convective velocity over the fingering convection instability domain defined by $1 \leq R_\rho &lt; Le$, $R_\rho$ being the ratio of density perturbations of thermal and compositional origins and $Le$ the Lewis number. We show that the chemical boundary layers are marginally unstable and adhere to the laminar Prandtl-Blasius model, hence explaining the asymmetry between the inner and outer spherical shell boundary layers. We develop scaling laws for two asymptotic regimes close to the two edges of the instability domain, namely $R_\rho \lesssim Le$ and $R_\rho \gtrsim 1$. For the former, we develop novel power laws of a small parameter $\epsilon$ measuring the distance to onset, which differ from theoretical laws published to date in Cartesian geometry. For the latter, we find that the Sherwood number $Sh$ gradually approaches a scaling $Sh\sim Ra_\xi^{1/3}$ when $Ra_\xi \gg 1$; and that the P\'eclet number accordingly follows $Pe \sim Ra_\xi^{2/3} |Ra_T|^{-1/4}$, $Ra_\xi$ being the chemical Rayleigh number. When the Reynolds number exceeds a few tens, we report on a secondary instability which takes the form of large-scale toroidal jets which span the entire spherical domain. Jets distort the fingers resulting in Reynolds stress correlations, which in turn feed the jet growth until saturation. This nonlinear phenomenon can yield relaxation oscillation cycles.</description>

      <title>Role of wave scattering in instability-induced Langmuir circulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.19533v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a classical problem about dynamic instability that leads to the Langmuir circulation. The problem statement assumes that there is initially a wind-driven shear flow and a plane surface wave propagating in the direction of the flow. The unstable mode is a superposition of i) shear flow and ii) surface waves both modulated in the horizontal spanwise direction and iii) circulation that is made up with vortices forming near-surface rolls whose axis are coaligned along the shear flow streamlines and whose transverse size corresponds to the modulation period. Usually, the Langmuir circulation is understood as the vortical part of the mode slowly varying in time, which is the combination of the first and the last flows. The novelty of our approach is that we, firstly, take into account the scattering of the initial surface wave on the slow current. Second, we find the interference of the scattered and the initial waves generating a Stokes drift modulated in the same direction. Third, we establish the subsequent affect of the circulation by the vortex force created by the nonlinear interaction of the initial shear flow and the modulated part of the Stokes drift. S. Leibovich &amp; A.D.D. Craik previously showed that the third part of the mechanism could maintain the Langmuir circulation. We calculate the growth rate which is approximately twice smaller than that obtained by A.D.D. Craik. The vertical structure of the circulation in the mode consists of two vortices, that corresponds to the next mode in Craik's model. Considering the wave scattering, we describe the fast-wave motion as a potential flow with relatively weak vortical correction. Application of the technique can be expanded on other flows where fast oscillating surface waves coexist with a slow current.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.05007v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates the three-dimensionality of synthetic jet flow control over a NACA 0025 profile wing using horizontal and vertical smoke wire visualization. The stalled flow in the baseline case is visualized, providing insights into the shear layer roll-up process, the transition to turbulence, and vortex shedding in the wake. In the controlled flow study, two actuation frequencies, $F^+=1.18$ and $F^+=11.76$, are investigated, with a focus on spanwise control authority and the role of coherent structures in flow reattachment. The results indicate that while the control is effective at the midspan over the entire chord length, its effect diminishes with increasing distance from the midspan. Both control cases result in significant spanwise velocities, observed by a contraction of the flow towards midspan. Lastly, the high-frequency actuation results in unique small-scale structures at the shear layer-freestream interface.</description>

Abstract: This work investigates the capillary rise dynamics of highly wetting liquids in a divergent U-tube in the microgravity conditions provided by 78th European Space Agency (ESA) parabolic flight. This configuration produces a capillary-driven channel flow. We use image recording in backlight illumination to characterize the interface dynamics and dynamic contact angle of HFE7200 and Di-Propylene Glycol (DPG). For the case of HF7200, we complement the interface measurements with Particle Tracking Velocimetry (PTV) to characterize the velocity fields underneath the moving meniscus. In the experiments with DPG, the liquid column reaches different heights within various experiments, and the measurements show a sharp reduction of the meniscus curvature when the contact line moves from a pre-wet to a dry substrate. In experiments with HFE7200, the interface always moves on a pre-wet surface. Yet a curvature reduction is observed due to the inertial forces on the underlying accelerating flow. The PTV measurements show that the distance from the interface within which the velocity profile adapts to the meniscus velocity shortens as the interface acceleration increases.</description>

      <title>An exact analytical solution for the weakly magnetized flow around an axially symmetric paraboloid, with application to magnetosphere models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.07419v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rotationally symmetric bodies with longitudinal cross sections of parabolic shape are frequently used to model astrophysical objects, such as magnetospheres and other blunt objects, immersed in interplanetary or interstellar gas or plasma flows. We discuss a simple formula for the potential flow of an incompressible fluid around an elliptic paraboloid whose axis of symmetry coincides with the direction of incoming flow. Prescribing this flow, we derive an exact analytical solution to the induction equation of ideal magnetohydrodynamics for the case of an initially homogeneous magnetic field of arbitrary orientation being passively advected in this flow. Our solution procedure employs Euler potentials and Cauchy's integral formalism based on the flow's stream function and isochrones. Furthermore, we use a particular renormalization procedure that allows us to generate more general analytical expressions modeling the deformations experienced by arbitrary scalar or vector-valued fields embedded in the flow as they are advected first towards and then past the parabolic obstacle. Finally, both the velocity field and the magnetic field embedded therein are generalized from incompressible to mildly compressible flow, where the associated density distribution is found from Bernoulli's principle.</description>

      <title>Floating active carpets drive transport and aggregation in aquatic ecosystems</title>

Abstract: Communities of swimming microorganisms often thrive near liquid-air interfaces. We study how such `active carpets' shape their aquatic environment by driving biogenic transport in the water column beneath them. The hydrodynamic stirring that active carpets generate leads to diffusive upward fluxes of nutrients from deeper water layers, and downward fluxes of oxygen and carbon. Combining analytical theory and simulations, we examine the biogenic transport by studying fundamental metrics, including the single and pair diffusivity, the first passage time for particle pair encounters, and the rate of particle aggregation. Our findings reveal that the hydrodynamic fluctuations driven by active carpets have a region of influence that reaches orders of magnitude further in distance than the size of the organisms. These nonequilibrium fluctuations lead to a strongly enhanced diffusion of particles, which is anisotropic and space-dependent. Fluctuations also facilitate encounters of particle pairs, which we quantify by analysing their velocity pair correlation functions as a function of distance between the particles. We found that the size of the particles plays a crucial role in their encounter rates, with larger particles situated near the active carpet being more favourable for aggregation. Overall, this research broadens our comprehension of aquatic systems out of equilibrium and how biologically driven fluctuations contribute to the transport of fundamental elements in biogeochemical cycles.</description>

      <title>Mpemba meets Newton: Exploring the Mpemba and Kovacs effects in the time-delayed cooling law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03550v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite extensive research, the fundamental physical mechanisms underlying the Mpemba effect, a phenomenon where a substance cools faster after initially being heated, remain elusive. Although historically linked with water, the Mpemba effect manifests across diverse systems, sparking heightened interest in Mpemba-like phenomena. Concurrently, the Kovacs effect, a memory phenomenon observed in materials like polymers, involves rapid quenching and subsequent temperature changes, resulting in nonmonotonic relaxation behavior. This paper probes the intricacies of the Mpemba and Kovacs effects within the framework of the time-delayed Newton's law of cooling, recognized as a simplistic yet effective phenomenological model accommodating memory phenomena. This law allows for a nuanced comprehension of temperature variations, introducing a time delay ($\tau$) and incorporating specific protocols for the thermal bath temperature, contingent on a defined waiting time ($t_{\text{w}}$). Remarkably, the relevant parameter space is two-dimensional ($\tau$ and $t_{\text{w}}$), with bath temperatures exerting no influence on the presence or absence of the Mpemba effect or the relative strength of the Kovacs effect. The findings enhance our understanding of these memory phenomena, providing valuable insights applicable to researchers across diverse fields, ranging from physics to materials science.</description>

      <title>Limits to extreme event forecasting in chaotic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16512v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Predicting extreme events in chaotic systems, characterized by rare but intensely fluctuating properties, is of great importance due to their impact on the performance and reliability of a wide range of systems. Some examples include weather forecasting, traffic management, power grid operations, and financial market analysis, to name a few. Methods of increasing sophistication have been developed to forecast events in these systems. However, the boundaries that define the maximum accuracy of forecasting tools are still largely unexplored from a theoretical standpoint. Here, we address the question: What is the minimum possible error in the prediction of extreme events in complex, chaotic systems? We derive the minimum probability of error in extreme event forecasting along with its information-theoretic lower and upper bounds. These bounds are universal for a given problem, in that they hold regardless of the modeling approach for extreme event prediction: from traditional linear regressions to sophisticated neural network models. The limits in predictability are obtained from the cost-sensitive Fano's and Hellman's inequalities using the R\'enyi entropy. The results are also connected to Takens' embedding theorem using the information can't hurt inequality. Finally, the probability of error for a forecasting model is decomposed into three sources: uncertainty in the initial conditions, hidden variables, and suboptimal modeling assumptions. The latter allows us to assess whether prediction models are operating near their maximum theoretical performance or if further improvements are possible. The bounds are applied to the prediction of extreme events in the R\"ossler system and the Kolmogorov flow.</description>
