      <title>A Survey of Large Language Models for Financial Applications: Progress, Prospects and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have unlocked novel opportunities for machine learning applications in the financial domain. These models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in understanding context, processing vast amounts of data, and generating human-preferred contents. In this survey, we explore the application of LLMs on various financial tasks, focusing on their potential to transform traditional practices and drive innovation. We provide a discussion of the progress and advantages of LLMs in financial contexts, analyzing their advanced technologies as well as prospective capabilities in contextual understanding, transfer learning flexibility, complex emotion detection, etc. We then highlight this survey for categorizing the existing literature into key application areas, including linguistic tasks, sentiment analysis, financial time series, financial reasoning, agent-based modeling, and other applications. For each application area, we delve into specific methodologies, such as textual analysis, knowledge-based analysis, forecasting, data augmentation, planning, decision support, and simulations. Furthermore, a comprehensive collection of datasets, model assets, and useful codes associated with mainstream applications are presented as resources for the researchers and practitioners. Finally, we outline the challenges and opportunities for future research, particularly emphasizing a number of distinctive aspects in this field. We hope our work can help facilitate the adoption and further development of LLMs in the financial sector.</description>

      <title>Robust dividend policy: Equivalence of Epstein-Zin and Maenhout preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12305v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a continuous-time economy, this study formulates the Epstein-Zin (EZ) preference for the discounted dividend (or cash payouts) of stockholders as an EZ singular control utility. We show that such a problem is well-defined and equivalent to the robust dividend policy set by the firm's executive in the sense of Maenhout's ambiguity-averse preference. While the firm's executive announces the expected future earnings in financial reports, they also signal the firm's confidence in the expected earnings through dividend or cash payouts. The robust dividend policy can then be characterized by a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) variational inequality (VI). By constructing a novel shooting method for the HJB-VI, we theoretically prove that the robust dividend policy is a threshold strategy on the firm's surplus process. Therefore, dividend-caring investors can choose firms that match their preferences by examining stock's dividend policies and financial statements, whereas executives can make use of dividend to signal their confidence, in the form of ambiguity aversion, on realizing the earnings implied by their financial statements.</description>

      <title>Nash Equilibria in Greenhouse Gas Offset Credit Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01427v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One approach to reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is to incentivize carbon capturing and carbon reducing projects while simultaneously penalising excess GHG output. In this work, we present a novel market framework and characterise the optimal behaviour of GHG offset credit (OC) market participants in both single-player and two-player settings. The single player setting is posed as an optimal stopping and control problem, while the two-player setting is posed as optimal stopping and mixed-Nash equilibria problem. We demonstrate the importance of acting optimally using numerical solutions and Monte Carlo simulations and explore the differences between the homogeneous and heterogeneous players. In both settings, we find that market participants benefit from optimal OC trading and OC generation.</description>
