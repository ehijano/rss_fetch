      <title>Position Auctions in AI-Generated Content</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider an extension to the classic position auctions in which sponsored creatives can be added within AI generated content rather than shown in predefined slots. New challenges arise from the natural requirement that sponsored creatives should smoothly fit into the context. With the help of advanced LLM technologies, it becomes viable to accurately estimate the benefits of adding each individual sponsored creatives into each potential positions within the AI generated content by properly taking the context into account. Therefore, we assume one click-through rate estimation for each position-creative pair, rather than one uniform estimation for each sponsored creative across all positions in classic settings. As a result, the underlying optimization becomes a general matching problem, thus the substitution effects should be treated more carefully compared to standard position auction settings, where the slots are independent with each other.
  In this work, we formalize a concrete mathematical model of the extended position auction problem and study the welfare-maximization and revenue-maximization mechanism design problem. Formally, we consider two different user behavior models and solve the mechanism design problems therein respectively. For the Multinomial Logit (MNL) model, which is order-insensitive, we can efficiently implement the optimal mechanisms. For the cascade model, which is order-sensitive, we provide approximately optimal solutions.</description>

      <title>From Average-Iterate to Last-Iterate Convergence in Games: A Reduction and Its Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The convergence of online learning algorithms in games under self-play is a fundamental question in game theory and machine learning. Among various notions of convergence, last-iterate convergence is particularly desirable, as it reflects the actual decisions made by the learners and captures the day-to-day behavior of the learning dynamics. While many algorithms are known to converge in the average-iterate, achieving last-iterate convergence typically requires considerably more effort in both the design and the analysis of the algorithm. Somewhat surprisingly, we show in this paper that for a large family of games, there exists a simple black-box reduction that transforms the average iterates of an uncoupled learning dynamics into the last iterates of a new uncoupled learning dynamics, thus also providing a reduction from last-iterate convergence to average-iterate convergence. Our reduction applies to games where each player's utility is linear in both their own strategy and the joint strategy of all opponents. This family includes two-player bimatrix games and generalizations such as multi-player polymatrix games. By applying our reduction to the Optimistic Multiplicative Weights Update algorithm, we obtain new state-of-the-art last-iterate convergence rates for uncoupled learning dynamics in two-player zero-sum normal-form games: (1) an $O(\frac{\log d}{T})$ last-iterate convergence rate under gradient feedback, representing an exponential improvement in the dependence on the dimension $d$ (i.e., the maximum number of actions available to either player); and (2) an $\widetilde{O}(d^{\frac{1}{5}} T^{-\frac{1}{5}})$ last-iterate convergence rate under bandit feedback, improving upon the previous best rates of $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{d} T^{-\frac{1}{8}})$ and $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{d} T^{-\frac{1}{6}})$.</description>

      <title>Complexity and Manipulation of International Kidney Exchange Programmes with Country-Specific Parameterss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kidney Exchange Programmes (KEPs) facilitate the exchange of kidneys, and larger pools of recipient-donor pairs tend to yield proportionally more transplants, leading to the proposal of international KEPs (IKEPs). However, as studied by \citet{mincu2021ip}, practical limitations must be considered in IKEPs to ensure that countries remain willing to participate. Thus, we study IKEPs with country-specific parameters, represented by a tuple $\Gamma$, restricting the selected transplants to be feasible for the countries to conduct, e.g., imposing an upper limit on the number of consecutive exchanges within a country's borders. We provide a complete complexity dichotomy for the problem of finding a feasible (according to the constraints given by $\Gamma$) cycle packing with the maximum number of transplants, for every possible $\Gamma$. We also study the potential for countries to misreport their parameters to increase their allocation. As manipulation can harm the total number of transplants, we propose a novel individually rational and incentive compatible mechanism $\mathcal{M}_{\text{order}}$. We first give a theoretical approximation ratio for $\mathcal{M}_{\text{order}}$ in terms of the number of transplants, and show that the approximation ratio of $\mathcal{M}_{\text{order}}$ is asymptotically optimal. We then use simulations which suggest that, in practice, the performance of $\mathcal{M}_{\text{order}}$ is significantly better than this worst-case ratio.</description>

      <title>A Machine Learning Theory Perspective on Strategic Litigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03411v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strategic litigation involves bringing a legal case to court with the goal of having a broader impact beyond resolving the case itself: for example, creating precedent which will influence future rulings. In this paper, we explore strategic litigation from the perspective of machine learning theory. We consider an abstract model of a common-law legal system where a lower court decides new cases by applying a decision rule learned from a higher court's past rulings. In this model, we explore the power of a strategic litigator, who strategically brings cases to the higher court to influence the learned decision rule, thereby affecting future cases. We explore questions including: What impact can a strategic litigator have? Which cases should a strategic litigator bring to court? Does it ever make sense for a strategic litigator to bring a case when they are sure the court will rule against them?</description>

      <title>Sink equilibria and the attractors of learning in games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07975v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Characterizing the limit behavior -- that is, the attractors -- of learning dynamics is one of the most fundamental open questions in game theory. In recent work in this front, it was conjectured that the attractors of the replicator dynamic are in one-to-one correspondence with the sink equilibria of the game -- the sink strongly connected components of a game's preference graph -- , and it was established that they do stand in at least one-to-many correspondence with them. We make threefold progress on the problem of characterizing attractors. First, we show through a topological construction that the one-to-one conjecture is false. The counterexamples derive from objects called local sources -- fixed points which lie within the sink equilibrium yet are locally repelling. Second, we make progress on the attractor characterization problem for two-player games by establishing that the one-to-one conjecture is true when a local property called pseudoconvexity holds. Pseudoconvexity prevents the existence of local sources, and generalizes the existing cases -- such as zero-sum games and potential games -- where the conjecture was known to be true.</description>

      <title>Semicoarse Correlated Equilibria and LP-Based Guarantees for Gradient Dynamics in Normal-Form Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20466v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Projected gradient ascent is known to satisfy no-external regret as a learning algorithm. However, recent empirical work shows that projected gradient ascent often finds the Nash equilibrium in settings beyond two-player zero-sum interactions or potential games, including those where the set of coarse correlated equilibria is very large. We show that gradient ascent in fact satisfies a stronger class of linear $\Phi$-regret in normal-form games; resulting in a refined solution concept which we dub semicoarse correlated equilibria. Our theoretical analysis of the discretised Bertrand competition mirrors those recently established for mean-based learning in first-price auctions. With at least two firms of lowest marginal cost, Nash equilibria emerge as the only semicoarse equilibria under concavity conditions on firm profits. In first-price auctions, the granularity of the bid space affects semicoarse equilibria, but finer granularity for lower bids also induces convergence to Nash equilibria. Unlike previous work that aims to prove convergence to a Nash equilibrium that often relies on epoch based analysis and probability theoretic machinery, our LP-based duality approach enables a simple and tractable analysis of equilibrium selection under gradient-based learning.</description>

      <title>Human Misperception of Generative-AI Alignment: A Laboratory Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14708v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We conduct an incentivized laboratory experiment to study people's perception of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) alignment in the context of economic decision-making. Using a panel of economic problems spanning the domains of risk, time preference, social preference, and strategic interactions, we ask human subjects to make choices for themselves and to predict the choices made by GenAI on behalf of a human user. We find that people overestimate the degree of alignment between GenAI's choices and human choices. In every problem, human subjects' average prediction about GenAI's choice is substantially closer to the average human-subject choice than it is to the GenAI choice. At the individual level, different subjects' predictions about GenAI's choice in a given problem are highly correlated with their own choices in the same problem. We explore the implications of people overestimating GenAI alignment in a simple theoretical model.</description>
