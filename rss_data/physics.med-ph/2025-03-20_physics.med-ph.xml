      <title>Improving PET scanner time-of-flight resolution using additional prompt photon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Positronium Imaging requires two classes of events: double-coincidences originated from pair of back-to-back annihilation photons and triple-coincidences comprised with two annihilation photons and one additional prompt photon. The standard reconstruction of the emission position along the line-of-response of triple-coincidence event is the same as in the case of double-coincidence event; an information introduced by the high-energetic prompt photon is ignored. In this study, we propose to extend the reconstruction of position of triple-coincidence event by taking into account the time and position of prompt photon. We incorporate the knowledge about the positronium lifetime distribution and discuss the limitations of the method based on the simulation data. We highlight that the uncertainty of the estimate provided by prompt photon alone is much higher than the standard deviation estimated based on two annihilation photons. We finally demonstrate the extent of resolution improvement that can be obtained when estimated using three photons.</description>

      <title>Material Decomposition in Photon-Counting Computed Tomography with Diffusion Models: Comparative Study and Hybridization with Variational Regularizers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photon-counting computed tomography (PCCT) has emerged as a promising imaging technique, enabling spectral imaging and material decomposition (MD). However, images typically suffer from a low signal-to-noise ratio due to constraints such as low photon counts and sparse-view settings. Variational methods minimize a data-fit function coupled with handcrafted regularizers but are highly dependent on the choice of the regularizers. Artificial intelligence (AI)-based approaches and more particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are now considered the state-of-the-art approach and can be used as an end-to-end method for MD or to implicitly learn an a priori. In the last few years, diffusion models (DMs) became predominant in the field of generative models where a distribution function is learned. This distribution function can be used as a prior for solving inverse problems. This work investigates the use of DMs as regularizers for MD tasks in PCCT. MD by diffusion posterior sampling (DPS) can be achieved. Three DPS-based approaches -- image-domain two-step DPS (im-TDPS), projection-domain two-step DPS (proj-TDPS), and one-step DPS (ODPS) -- are evaluated. The first two methods perform MD in two steps: im-TDPS samples spectral images by DPS then performs image-based MD, while proj-TDPS performs projection-based MD then samples material images by DPS. The last method, ODPS, samples the material images directly from the measurement data. The results indicate that ODPS achieves superior performance compared to im-TDPS and proj-TDPS, providing sharper, noise-free and crosstalk-free images. Furthermore, we introduce a novel hybrid ODPS method combining DM priors with standard variational regularizers for scenarios involving materials absent from the training dataset. This hybrid method demonstrates improved material reconstruction quality compared to a standard variational method.</description>

      <title>A Language Vision Model Approach for Automated Tumor Contouring in Radiation Oncology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Background: Lung cancer ranks as the leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. The complexity of tumor delineation, crucial for radiation therapy, requires expertise often unavailable in resource-limited settings. Artificial Intelligence(AI), particularly with advancements in deep learning (DL) and natural language processing (NLP), offers potential solutions yet is challenged by high false positive rates. Purpose: The Oncology Contouring Copilot (OCC) system is developed to leverage oncologist expertise for precise tumor contouring using textual descriptions, aiming to increase the efficiency of oncological workflows by combining the strengths of AI with human oversight. Methods: Our OCC system initially identifies nodule candidates from CT scans. Employing Language Vision Models (LVMs) like GPT-4V, OCC then effectively reduces false positives with clinical descriptive texts, merging textual and visual data to automate tumor delineation, designed to elevate the quality of oncology care by incorporating knowledge from experienced domain experts. Results: Deployments of the OCC system resulted in a significant reduction in the false discovery rate by 35.0%, a 72.4% decrease in false positives per scan, and an F1-score of 0.652 across our dataset for unbiased evaluation. Conclusions: OCC represents a significant advance in oncology care, particularly through the use of the latest LVMs to improve contouring results by (1) streamlining oncology treatment workflows by optimizing tumor delineation, reducing manual processes; (2) offering a scalable and intuitive framework to reduce false positives in radiotherapy planning using LVMs; (3) introducing novel medical language vision prompt techniques to minimize LVMs hallucinations with ablation study, and (4) conducting a comparative analysis of LVMs, highlighting their potential in addressing medical language vision challenges.</description>

      <title>A biomechanical comparison of concussion and head acceleration events in elite-level American football and rugby union</title>

Abstract: Elite-level American football and rugby union are two high-contact sports with growing clinical and legal concerns over player safety, necessitating a comparative analysis. A biomechanical comparison of concussion and head acceleration events (HAEs) in elite-level American football and rugby union was undertaken. Rugby union players have a greater number of professional playing years and matches available in a season than their American football counterparts. Rugby union players have a greater number of concussions reported per match and a higher proportion of concussions occurring during training sessions, based on National Football League (NFL) and Rugby Football Union (RFU) injury reports. Preliminary findings indicate that rugby union forwards experience a higher incidence of HAEs per player match over lower and higher magnitude thresholds, than American football defensive players. Overall, elite-level rugby union appears less favourable than American football in in almost all metrics pertinent to concussion and HAE exposure in the biomechanical comparison undertaken. The findings highlight the critical importance of independence, scientific rigour, and transparency in future concussion and HAE biomechanics research and real-world implementation, ensuring the development of more effective mitigation strategies.</description>

      <title>OpenDosimeter: Open Hardware Personal X-ray Dosimeter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09993v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present OpenDosimeter (www.opendosimeter.org), an open hardware solution for real-time personal X-ray dose monitoring based on a scintillation counter. Using an X-ray sensor assembly (LYSO + SiPM) on a custom board powered by a Raspberry Pi Pico, OpenDosimeter provides real-time feedback (1 Hz), data logging (10 hours), and battery-powered operation. One of the core innovations is that we calibrate the device using $^{241}$Am found in ionization smoke detectors. Specifically, we use the $\gamma$-emissions to spectrally calibrate the dosimeter, then calculate the effective dose from X-ray exposure by compensating for the scintillator absorption efficiency and applying energy-to-dose coefficients derived from tabulated data in the ICRP 116 publication. We demonstrate that this transparent approach enables real-time dose rate readings with a linear response between 0.1-1000 $\mu$Sv/h at $\pm$25% accuracy, tested for energies up to 120 keV. The maximum dose rate readings are limited by pile-up effects when approaching count rate saturation ($\sim$77 kcps at $\sim$13 $\mu$s average pulse processing time). The total component cost for making an OpenDosimeter is &lt;\$100, which, combined with its open design (both hardware and software), enables cost-effective local reproducibility on a global scale. Through a student workshop, we also demonstrate its effectiveness as an educational and capacity-building tool. This paper complements the open-source documentation by explaining the underlying technology, the algorithm for dose calculation, and areas for future improvement.</description>
