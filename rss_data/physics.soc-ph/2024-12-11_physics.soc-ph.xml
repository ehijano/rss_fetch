      <title>Hypermodularity and community detection in higher-order networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerous networked systems feature a structure of non-trivial communities, which often correspond to their functional modules. Such communities have been detected in real-world biological, social and technological systems, as well as in synthetic models thereof. While much effort has been devoted to develop methods for community detection in traditional networks, the study of community structure in networks with higher-order interactions is still relatively unexplored. In this article, we introduce a formalism for the hypermodularity of higher-order networks that allows us to use spectral methods to detect community structures in hypergraphs. We apply this approach to synthetic random networks as well as to real-world data, showing that it produces results that reflect the nature and the dynamics of the interactions modelled, thereby constituting a valuable tool for the extraction of hidden information from complex higher-order data sets.</description>

      <title>High-Resolution Rooftop-PV Potential Assessment for a Resilient Energy System in Ukraine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rooftop photovoltaic (RTPV) systems are essential for building a decarbonized and, due to its decentralized structure, more resilient energy system, and are particularly important for Ukraine, where recent conflicts have damaged more than half of its electricity and heat supply capacity. Favorable solar irradiation conditions make Ukraine a strong candidate for large-scale PV deployment, but effective policy requires detailed data on spatial and temporal generation potential. This study fills the data gap by using open-source satellite building footprint data corrected with high-resolution data from eastern Germany. This approach allowed accurate estimates of rooftop area and PV capacity and generation across Ukraine, with simulations revealing a capacity potential of 238.8 GW and a generation potential of 290 TWh/a excluding north-facing. The majority of this potential is located in oblasts (provinces) across the country with large cities such as Donetsk, Dnipro or Kyiv and surroundings. These results, validated against previous studies and available as open data, confirm Ukraine's significant potential for RTPV, supporting both energy resilience and climate goals.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the Dynamics of Innovation Abandonment Across Scientific, Technological, Commercial, and Pharmacological Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the vast literature on the diffusion of innovations that impacts a broad range of disciplines, our understanding of the abandonment of innovations remains limited yet is essential for a deeper understanding of the innovation lifecycle. Here, we analyze four large-scale datasets that capture the temporal and structural patterns of innovation abandonment across scientific, technological, commercial, and pharmacological domains. The paper makes three primary contributions. First, across these diverse domains, we uncover one simple pattern of preferential abandonment, whereby the probability for individuals or organizations to abandon an innovation increases with time and correlates with the number of network neighbors who have abandoned the innovation. Second, we find that the presence of preferential abandonment fundamentally alters the way in which the underlying ecosystem breaks down, inducing a novel structural collapse in networked systems commonly perceived as robust against abandonments. Third, we derive an analytical framework to systematically understand the impact of preferential abandonment on network dynamics, pinpointing specific conditions where it may accelerate, decelerate, or have an identical effect compared to random abandonment, depending on the network topology. Together, these results deepen our quantitative understanding of the abandonment of innovation within networked social systems, with implications for the robustness and functioning of innovation communities. Overall, they demonstrate that the dynamics of innovation abandonment follow simple yet reproducible patterns, suggesting that the uncovered preferential abandonment may be a generic property of the innovation lifecycle.</description>

      <title>Fast and exact simulations of stochastic epidemics on static and temporal networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Epidemic models on complex networks have been widely used to study how the social structure of a population affect the spreading of epidemics. However, their numerical simulation can be computationally heavy, especially for large networks. In this paper, we introduce NEXT-Net: a flexible implementation of the next reaction method for epidemic spreading on both static and temporal networks. By systematic tests on artificial and real-world networks, we find that NEXT-Net is substantially faster than alternative algorithms, while being exact. It permits, in particular, to efficiently simulate epidemics on networks with million of nodes on a standard computer. It is also versatile enough to simulate a broad range of epidemic models of temporal networks, including cases in which the network structure changes in response to the epidemic. Our code is implemented in C++ and accessible from Python and R, thus combining speed with user friendliness. Because of these features, our algorithm constitutes an ideal tool for a broad range of applications.</description>

      <title>Vaccination dynamics of age-structured populations in higher-order social networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Voluntary vaccination is essential to protect oneself from infection and suppress the spread of infectious diseases. Voluntary vaccination behavior is influenced by factors such as age and interaction patterns. Differences in health consciousness and risk perception based on age result in heterogeneity in vaccination behavior among different age groups. Higher-order interactions among individuals of various ages facilitate the dissemination of vaccine-related information, further influencing vaccination intentions. To investigate the impact of individual age and interaction patterns on vaccination behavior, we propose an epidemic-game coevolution model in which age structure and higher-order interactions are considered. Combining the theoretical analysis of epidemic-game coevolution, this work calculates the evolutionarily stable strategies and dynamic equilibrium based on imitation dynamics in the well-mixed population. Extensive numerical experiments show that infants and the elderly exhibit conservative attitudes towards vaccination, and the vaccination levels of these two groups have no significant impact on the vaccination behavior of other age groups. The vaccination behavior of children is highly active, while the vaccination behavior of adults depends on the relative cost of vaccination. The increase in vaccination levels among children and adults leads to a decrease in vaccination levels in other groups. Furthermore, the infants exhibit the lowest level of vaccination, while the children have the highest vaccination rate. Higher-order interactions significantly enhance vaccination levels among children and adults.</description>

      <title>Balancing Mobility Behaviors to avoid Global epidemics from Local Outbreaks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human interactions and mobility shape epidemic dynamics by facilitating disease outbreaks and their spatial spread across regions. Traditional models often isolate commuting and random mobility as separate behaviors, focusing either on short, recurrent trips or on random, exploratory movements. Here, we propose a unified formalism that allows a smooth transition between commuting and exploratory behavior based on travel and return probabilities. We derive an analytical expression for the epidemic threshold, revealing a non-monotonic dependence on recurrence rates: while recurrence tends to lower the threshold by increasing agent concentration in high-contact hubs, it counterintuitively raises the invasion threshold in low-mobility scenarios, suggesting that allowing recurrence may foster local outbreaks while suppressing global epidemics. These results provide a comprehensive understanding of the interplay between human mobility patterns and epidemic spread, with implications for containment strategies in structured populations.</description>

      <title>The Grass of the Universe: Rethinking Technosphere, Planetary History, and Sustainability with Fermi Paradox</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08057v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: SETI is not a usual point of departure for environmental humanities. However, this paper argues that theories originating in this field have direct implications for how we think about viable inhabitation of the Earth. To demonstrate SETI's impact on environmental humanities, this paper introduces Fermi paradox as a speculative tool to probe possible trajectories of planetary history, and especially the "Sustainability Solution" proposed by Jacob Haqq-Misra and Seth Baum. This solution suggests that sustainable coupling between extraterrestrial intelligences and their planetary environments is the major factor in the possibility of their successful detection by remote observation. By positing that exponential growth is not a sustainable development pattern, this solution rules out space-faring civilizations colonizing solar systems or galaxies. This paper elaborates on Haqq-Misra's and Baum's arguments, and discusses speculative implications of the Sustainability Solution, thus rethinking three concepts in environmental humanities: technosphere, planetary history, and sustainability. The paper advocates that (1) technosphere is a transitory layer that shall fold back into biosphere; (2) planetary history must be understood in a generic perspective that abstracts from terrestrial particularities; and (3) sustainability is not sufficient vector of viable human inhabitation of the Earth, suggesting instead habitability and genesity as better candidates.</description>
