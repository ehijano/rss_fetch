      <title>Billiard trajectories inside Cones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently it was proved that every billiard trajectory inside a $C^3$ convex cone has a finite number of reflections.
  Here, by a $C^3$ convex cone, we mean a cone whose section with some hyperplane is a strictly convex closed $C^3$ submanifold of the hyperplane with nondegenerate second fundamental form.
  In this paper,
  we prove the existence of $C^2$ convex cones admitting billiard trajectories with infinitely many reflections in finite time.
  We also estimate the number of reflections of billiard trajectories in elliptic cones in $\mathbb{R}^3$
  using two first integrals.</description>

      <title>Circular Microalgae-Based Carbon Control for Net Zero</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The alteration of the climate in various areas of the world is of increasing concern since climate stability is a necessary condition for human survival as well as every living organism. The main reason of climate change is the greenhouse effect caused by the accumulation of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. In this paper, we design a networked system underpinned by compartmental dynamical thermodynamics to circulate the atmospheric carbon dioxide. Specifically, in the carbon dioxide emitter compartment, we develop an initial-condition-dependent finite-time stabilizing controller that guarantees stability within a desired time leveraging the system property of affinity in the control. Then, to compensate for carbon emissions we show that a cultivation of microalgae with a volume 625 times bigger than the one of the carbon emitter is required. To increase the carbon uptake of the microalgae, we implement the nonaffine-in-the-control microalgae dynamical equations as an environment of a state-of-the-art library for reinforcement learning (RL), namely, Stable-Baselines3, and then, through the library, we test the performance of eight RL algorithms for training a controller that maximizes the microalgae absorption of carbon through the light intensity. All the eight controllers increased the carbon absorption of the cultivation during a training of 200,000 time steps with a maximum episode length of 200 time steps and with no termination conditions. This work is a first step towards approaching net zero as a classical and learning-based network control problem. The source code is publicly available.</description>

      <title>Limitations of deducing measures of limsup sets from measures of finite intersections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Early results by Borel-Cantelli and more recently Erd\"os-Chung, Frolov and Feng-Li-Shen have provided bounds for the measure of the limsup set in terms of measures of its constituent sets and their intersections. Despite progress being made to give stronger bounds we show there is no hope for finding non-trivial bounds for the limsup measure from the measures of pairwise intersections in general. We go further and construct counterexamples wherein we have two sequences of sets whose individual measures all the way up to $k$-wise intersection measure $\mu(A_{i_1}\cap A_{i_2} \cap... \cap A_{i_k})$ are comparable but one sequence will have limsup measure 1 and the other 0. We later to go on to see that if we control all finite intersections (not just up to $k$ intersections) then we do indeed fix the limsup measure.</description>

      <title>Instabilities in visco-thermodiffusive swirling flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A geometrical optics approach has been used to derive instability criteria for various swirling flows observed in nature and industrial processes. By applying a short-wavelength local analysis to the Navier-Stokes equations, coupled with the energy equation when necessary, we account for viscosity and thermal diffusivity effects. The derived criteria are validated for swirling flows modeled by a cylindrical differentially rotating annulus with axial flow induced by either a sliding inner cylinder, an axial pressure gradient, or a radial temperature gradient combined with vertical gravity. These criteria successfully reproduce known results from numerical linear stability analysis and agree with experimental and simulation data. Moreover, they unify and extend several classical instability criteria: the Rayleigh criterion for centrifugally-driven instabilities, the Ludwieg-Eckhoff-Leibovich-Stewartson criterion for isothermal swirling flows, and the Goldreich-Schubert-Fricke criterion for non-isothermal azimuthal flows. Additionally, they predict oscillatory modes in swirling flows, thereby generalizing the McIntyre instability criterion to these systems.</description>

      <title>Uniform attraction and exit problems for stochastic damped wave equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a class of wave equations with constant damping and polynomial nonlinearities that are perturbed by small, multiplicative, space-time white noise. The equations are defined on a one-dimensional bounded interval with Dirichlet boundary conditions, continuous initial position and distributional initial velocity. In the first part of this work, we study the corresponding deterministic dynamics and prove that certain neighborhoods of asymptotically stable equilibria are uniformly attracting in the topology of uniform convergence. Then, we consider exit problems for local solutions of the stochastic damped wave equations from bounded domains $D$ of uniform attraction. Using tools from large deviations along with novel controllability results, we obtain logarithmic asymptotics for exit times and exit places, in the vanishing noise limit, that are expressed in terms of the corresponding quasipotential. In doing so, we develop arguments that take into account the lack of both smoothing and exact controllability that are inherent to the problem at hand. Moreover, our exit time results provide asymptotic lower bounds for the mean explosion time of local solutions. We introduce a novel notion of "regular" boundary points allowing to avoid the question of boundary smoothness in infinite dimensions and leading to the proof of a large deviations lower bound for the exit place. We illustrate this notion by providing explicit examples for different classes of domains $D$. Conditions under which lower and upper bounds for exit time and exit place logarithmic asymptotic hold, are also presented. In addition, we obtain deterministic stability results for linear damped wave equations that are of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Containment Control Approach for Steering Opinion in a Social Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01847v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper studies the problem of steering multi-dimensional opinion in a social network. Assuming the society of desire consists of stubborn and regular agents, stubborn agents are considered as leaders who specify the desired opinion distribution as a distributed reward or utility function. In this context, each regular agent is seen as a follower, updating its bias on the initial opinion and influence weights by averaging their observations of the rewards their influencers have received. Assuming random graphs with reducible and irreducible topology specify the influences on regular agents, opinion evolution is represented as a containment control problem in which stability and convergence to the final opinion are proven.</description>

      <title>Free Semigroups of Large Critical Exponent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02003v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a convergence group equipped with an expanding coarse-cocycle, we construct finitely generated free subsemigroups, which we call $\textit{Bishop--Jones}$ $\textit{semigroups}$, of critical exponent arbitrarily close to but strictly less than the critical exponent of the ambient group. As an application, we show that for any lattice in the isometry group of the quaternionic hyperbolic space or the isometry group of the Cayley hyperbolic plane, there exist finitely generated free subsemigroups of critical exponent arbitrarily close to but strictly less than that of the ambient lattice. This shows no critical exponent gap for discrete subsemigroups in the isometry group of the quaternionic hyperbolic space or the isometry group of the Cayley hyperbolic plane, which is in contrast with Corlette's renowned gap theorem concerning infinite co-volume discrete subgroups of these rank one Lie groups. More generally, we prove that for any non-elementary transverse subgroup $\Gamma$ of a semisimple Lie group $G$, there exist finitely generated free Anosov subsemigroups in the sense of Kassel--Potrie of critical exponent arbitrarily close to but strictly less than that of the ambient transverse group. Furthermore, we show that these semigroups admit $\mathcal{C}$-regular quasi-isometric embeddings into the symmetric space $X$ of $G$, in the sense of Dey--Kim--Oh.</description>

      <title>Boundary actions of Bass-Serre Trees and the applications to $C^*$-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02039v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study Bass-Serre theory from the perspectives of $C^*$-algebras and topological dynamics. In particular, we investigate the actions of fundamental groups of graphs of groups on their Bass-Serre trees and the associated boundaries, through which, we identify new families of $C^*$-simple groups including certain tubular groups and fundamental groups of certain graphs of groups with one vertex group acylindrically hyperbolic. In addition, we obtain characterizations of $C^*$-simplicity for Generalized Baumslag-Solitar (GBS) groups and outer automorphism groups $\operatorname{Out}(BS(p, q))$ of Baumslag-Solitar groups. These $C^*$-simple groups also provide new examples of highly transitive groups. Moreover, we demonstrate that natural boundary actions of these $C^*$-simple fundamental groups of graphs of groups give rise to the new purely infinite crossed product $C^*$-algebras.</description>

      <title>Conditional Speed and Shape Corrections for Travelling Wave Solutions to Stochastically Perturbed Reaction-Diffusion Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we perform rigorous small noise expansions to study the impact of stochastic forcing on the behaviour of planar travelling wave solutions to reaction-diffusion equations on cylindrical domains. In particular, we use a stochastic freezing approach that allows effective limiting information to be extracted concerning the behaviour of the stochastic perturbations from the deterministic wave. As an application, this allows us to provide a rigorous definition for the stochastic corrections to the wave speed. In addition, our approach allows their size to be computed to any desired order in the noise strength, provided that sufficient smoothness is available.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the peak of an initially localized wave packet in one-dimensional nonlinear disordered chains decays more slowly than any power law of time. The systems under investigation are Klein-Gordon and nonlinear disordered Schr\"odinger-type chains, characterized by a harmonic onsite disordered potential and quartic nearest-neighbor coupling. Our results apply in the long-time limit, hold almost surely, and are valid for arbitrary finite energy values.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02360v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The analysis of observable phenomena (for instance, in biology or physics) allows the detection of dynamical behaviors and, conversely, starting from a desired behavior allows the design of objects exhibiting that behavior in engineering. The decomposition of dynamics into simpler subsystems allows us to simplify this analysis (or design). Here we focus on an algebraic approach to decomposition, based on alternative and synchronous execution as the sum and product operations; this gives rise to polynomial equations (with a constant side). In this article we focus on univariate, injective polynomials, giving a characterization in terms of the form of their coefficients and a polynomial-time algorithm for solving the associated equations.</description>

      <title>Strong convergence with error estimates for a stochastic compartmental model of electrophysiology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02518v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a rigorous mathematical analysis, alongside simulation studies, of a spatially extended stochastic electrophysiology model, the Hodgkin-Huxley model of the squid giant axon being a classical example. Although most studies in electrophysiology do not account for stochasticity, it is well known that ion channels regulating membrane voltage open and close randomly due to thermal fluctuations. We introduce a spatially extended compartmental model in which this stochastic behavior is captured through a piecewise-deterministic Markov process (PDMP). Space is discretized into n compartments each of which has at most one ion channel. We also devise a numerical method to simulate this stochastic model and illustrate the numerical method by simulation studies. We show that a classical system of partial differential equations (PDEs) approximates the stochastic system as $n \to \infty$. Unlike existing results, which focus on weak convergence or convergence in probability, we establish an almost sure convergence result with a precise error bound of order $n^{1/3}$. Our findings broaden the current understanding of stochastic effects in spatially structured neuronal models and have potential applications in studying random ion channel configurations in neurobiology. Additionally, our proof leverages ideas from homogenization theory in PDEs and can potentially be applied to other PDMPs or accommodate other ion channel distributions with random spacing or defects.</description>

Abstract: \emph{Koopman Regularization} is a constrained optimization-based method to learn the governing equations from sparse and corrupted samples of the vector field. \emph{Koopman Regularization} extracts a functionally independent set of Koopman eigenfunctions from the samples. This set implements the principle of parsimony, since, even though its cardinality is finite, it restores the dynamics precisely.
  \emph{Koopman Regularization} formulates the Koopman Partial Differential Equation as the objective function and the condition of functional independence as the feasible region. Then, this work suggests a barrier method-based algorithm to solve this constrained optimization problem that yields promising results in denoising, generalization, and dimensionality reduction.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the Geometric Structure of Neural Networks and Neural ODEs via Morse Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09351v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Besides classical feed-forward neural networks, also neural ordinary differential equations (neural ODEs) have gained particular interest in recent years. Neural ODEs can be interpreted as an infinite depth limit of feed-forward or residual neural networks. We study the input-output dynamics of finite and infinite depth neural networks with scalar output. In the finite depth case, the input is a state associated with a finite number of nodes, which maps under multiple non-linear transformations to the state of one output node. In analogy, a neural ODE maps an affine linear transformation of the input to an affine linear transformation of its time-$T$ map. We show that depending on the specific structure of the network, the input-output map has different properties regarding the existence and regularity of critical points, which can be characterized via Morse functions. We prove that critical points cannot exist if the dimension of the hidden layer is monotonically decreasing or the dimension of the phase space is smaller or equal to the input dimension. In the case that critical points exist, we classify their regularity depending on the specific architecture of the network. We show that except for a Lebesgue measure zero set in the weight space, each critical point is non-degenerate, if for finite depth neural networks the underlying graph has no bottleneck, and if for neural ODEs, the affine linear transformations used have full rank. For each type of architecture, the proven properties are comparable in the finite and the infinite depth case. The established theorems allow us to formulate results on universal embedding, i.e., on the exact representation of maps by neural networks and neural ODEs. Our dynamical systems viewpoint on the geometric structure of the input-output map provides a fundamental understanding of why certain architectures perform better than others.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23491v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider state-dependent delay differential equations of the form $$\dot{x}(t) = f(x(t), x(t - r(x_t))),$$ where $f$ is continuously differentiable and fulfills a negative feedback condition in the delayed term. Under suitable conditions on $r$ and $f$, we construct a Morse decomposition of the global attractor, giving some insight into the global dynamics. The Morse sets in the decomposition are closely related to the level sets of an integer valued Lyapunov function that counts the number of sign changes along solutions on intervals of length of the delay. This generalizes former results for constant delay. We also give two major types of state-dependent delays for which our results apply.</description>

      <title>Finite Time Hyperbolic Coordinates</title>

Abstract: We define finite-time hyperbolic coordinates, describe their geometry, and prove various results on both their convergence as the time scale increases, and on their variation in the state space. Hyperbolic coordinates reframe the classical paradigm of hyperbolicity: rather than define a hyperbolic dynamical system in terms of a splitting of the tangent space into stable and unstable subspaces, we define hyperbolicity in terms of the co-eccentricity of the map. The co-eccentricity describes the distortion of unit circles in the tangent space under the differential of the map. Finite-time hyperbolic coordinates have been used to demonstrate the existence of SRB measures for the Henon map; our eventual goal is to both elucidate these techniques and to extend them to a broad class of nonuniformly and singular hyperbolic systems.</description>

      <title>Operator-theoretic Analysis of Mutual Interactions in Synchronized Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.06186</link>

Abstract: Analyzing synchronized nonlinear oscillators is one of the most important and attractive topics in nonlinear science. By understanding the interactions between the oscillators, we can figure out the synchronization process. A promising approach to the analysis of interacting oscillators in nonlinear science is the application of the phase model. In this paper, we propose a data-driven approach to extract mutual interactions of synchronized oscillators based on the phase model. Recently, applying machine learning techniques to estimate models in physics has been actively investigated. We propose an operator-theoretic approach to estimate the phase model of interacting oscillators. We reduce the estimation problem to a multiparameter eigenvalue problem of the Koopman operator, a linear operator that describes a dynamical system. By reducing the problem to a linear algebraic problem, we can theoretically show that the proposed approach is stable with respect to perturbations in the given data.</description>

      <title>Roots in the semiring of finite deterministic dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09236v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Finite discrete-time dynamical systems (FDDS) model phenomena that evolve deterministically in discrete time. It is possible to define sum and product operations on these systems (disjoint union and direct product, respectively) giving a commutative semiring. This algebraic structure led to several works employing polynomial equations to model hypotheses on phenomena modelled using FDDS. To solve these equations, algorithms for performing the division and computing $k$-th roots are needed. In this paper, we propose two polynomial algorithms for these tasks, under the condition that the result is a connected FDDS. This ultimately leads to an efficient solution to equations of the type $AX^k=B$ for connected $X$. These results are some of the important final steps for solving more general polynomial equations on FDDS.</description>

      <title>BINDy -- Bayesian identification of nonlinear dynamics with reversible-jump Markov-chain Monte-Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08062v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Model parsimony is an important \emph{cognitive bias} in data-driven modelling that aids interpretability and helps to prevent over-fitting. Sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) methods are able to learn sparse representations of complex dynamics directly from data, given a basis of library functions. In this work, a novel Bayesian treatment of dictionary learning system identification, as an alternative to SINDy, is envisaged. The proposed method -- Bayesian identification of nonlinear dynamics (BINDy) -- is distinct from previous approaches in that it targets the full joint posterior distribution over both the terms in the library and their parameterisation in the model. This formulation confers the advantage that an arbitrary prior may be placed over the model structure to produce models that are sparse in the model space rather than in parameter space. Because this posterior is defined over parameter vectors that can change in dimension, the inference cannot be performed by standard techniques. Instead, a Gibbs sampler based on reversible-jump Markov-chain Monte-Carlo is proposed. BINDy is shown to compare favourably to ensemble SINDy in three benchmark case-studies. In particular, it is seen that the proposed method is better able to assign high probability to correct model terms.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Echo State Networks for Modeling Controllable Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19140v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Echo State Networks (ESNs) are recurrent neural networks usually employed for modeling nonlinear dynamic systems with relatively ease of training. By incorporating physical laws into the training of ESNs, Physics-Informed ESNs (PI-ESNs) were proposed initially to model chaotic dynamic systems without external inputs. They require less data for training since Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) of the considered system help to regularize the ESN. In this work, the PI-ESN is extended with external inputs to model controllable nonlinear dynamic systems. Additionally, an existing self-adaptive balancing loss method is employed to balance the contributions of the residual regression term and the physics-informed loss term in the total loss function. The experiments with two nonlinear systems modeled by ODEs, the Van der Pol oscillator and the four-tank system, and with one differential-algebraic (DAE) system, an electric submersible pump, revealed that the proposed PI-ESN outperforms the conventional ESN, especially in scenarios with limited data availability, showing that PI-ESNs can regularize an ESN model with external inputs previously trained on just a few datapoints, reducing its overfitting and improving its generalization error (up to 92% relative reduction in the test error). Further experiments demonstrated that the proposed PI-ESN is robust to parametric uncertainties in the ODE equations and that model predictive control using PI-ESN outperforms the one using plain ESN, particularly when training data is scarce.</description>

      <title>Co-evolutionary control of a class of coupled mixed-feedback systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19857v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Oscillatory behavior is ubiquitous in many natural and engineered systems, often emerging through self-regulating mechanisms. In this paper, we address the challenge of stabilizing a desired oscillatory pattern in a networked system where neither the internal dynamics nor the interconnections can be changed. To achieve this, we propose two distinct control strategies. The first requires the full knowledge of the system generating the desired oscillatory pattern, while the second only needs local error information. In addition, the controllers are implemented as co-evolutionary, or adaptive, rules of some edges in an extended plant-controller network. We validate our approach in several insightful scenarios, including synchronization and systems with time-varying network structures.</description>

      <title>The spectral concentration for damped waves on compact Anosov manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02929v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the spectral distribution of damped waves on compact Anosov manifolds. Sj\"ostrand \cite{SJ1} proved that the imaginary parts of the majority of the eigenvalues concentrate near the average of the damping function, see also Anantharaman \cite{AN2}. In this paper, we prove that the most of eigenvalues actually lie in certain regions with imaginary parts that approach the average logarithmically as the real parts tend to infinity. The proof relies on the moderate deviation principles for Anosov geodesic flows. As an application, we show the concentration of non-trivial zeros of twisted Selberg zeta functions in a logarithmic region asymptotically close to $\Re s=\frac{1}{2}$.</description>

      <title>The generic geometry of steady state varieties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17798v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We answer several fundamental geometric questions about reaction networks with power-law kinetics, on topics such as generic finiteness of the number of steady states, robustness, and nondegenerate multistationarity. In particular, we give an ideal-theoretic characterization of generic absolute concentration robustness, as well as conditions under which a network that admits multiple steady states also has the capacity for nondegenerate multistationarity. The key tools underlying our results come from the theory of vertically parametrized systems, and include a linear algebra condition that characterizes when the steady state system has positive nondegenerate zeros.</description>

      <title>Systolic $S^1$-index and characterization of non-smooth Zoll convex bodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13856v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define the systolic $S^1$-index of a convex body as the Fadell-Rabinowitz index of the space of centralized generalized systoles associated with its boundary. We show that this index is a symplectic invariant. Using the systolic $S^1$-index, we propose a definition of generalized Zoll convex bodies and prove that this definition is equivalent to the usual one in the smooth setting. Moreover, we show how generalized Zoll convex bodies can be characterized in terms of their Gutt-Hutchings capacities and we prove that the space of generalized Zoll convex bodies is closed in the space of all convex bodies. As a corollary, we establish that if the interior of a convex body is symplectomorphic to the interior of a ball, then such a convex body must be generalized Zoll, and in particular Zoll if its boundary is smooth. Finally, we discuss some examples.</description>
