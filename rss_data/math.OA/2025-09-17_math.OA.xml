      <title>K-Theory and Structural Properties of $C^*$-Algebras Associated with Relative Generalized Boolean Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an explicit formula for the $K$-theory of the $C^*$-algebra associated with a relative generalized Boolean dynamical system $(\CB, \CL, \theta, \CI_\af; \CJ)$. In particular, we find concrete generators for the $K_1$-group of $C^*(\CB, \CL, \theta, \CI_\af; \CJ)$. We also prove that every gauge-invariant ideal of $C^*(\CB, \CL, \theta, \CI_\af; \CJ)$ is Morita equivalent to a $C^*$-algebra of a relative generalized Boolean dynamical system.
  As a structural application, we show that if the underlying Boolean dynamical system $(\CB, \CL, \theta)$ satisfies Condition (K), then the associated $C^*$-algebra is $K_0$-liftable. Furthermore, we deduce that if $C^*(\CB, \CL, \theta, \CI_\af; \CJ)$ is separable and purely infinite, then it has real rank zero.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness of purifications is equivalent to Haag duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The uniqueness of purifications of quantum states on a system $A$ up to local unitary transformations on a purifying system $B$ is central to quantum information theory. We show that, if the two systems are modelled by commuting von Neumann algebras $M_A$ and $M_B$ on a Hilbert space $\mathcal H$, then uniqueness of purifications is equivalent to Haag duality $M_A = M_B'$. In particular, the uniqueness of purifications can fail in systems with infinitely many degrees of freedom -- even when $M_A$ and $M_B$ are commuting factors that jointly generate $B(\mathcal H)$ and hence allow for local tomography of all density matrices on $\mathcal H$.</description>

      <title>Essential Cartan subalgebras of $C^*$-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.09634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.09634v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define essential commutative Cartan pairs of $C^*$-algebras generalising the definition of Renault and show that such pairs are given by essential twisted groupoid $C^*$-algebras as defined by Kwa\'sniewski and Meyer. We show that the underlying twisted groupoid is effective, and is unique up to isomorphism among twists over effective groupoids giving rise to the essential commutative Cartan pair. We also show that for twists over effective groupoids giving rise to such pairs, the automorphism group of the twist is isomorphic to the automorphism group of the induced essential Cartan pair via explicit constructions.</description>

      <title>Understanding Quantum Instruments Through the Analysis of $C^*$-Convexity and Their Marginals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11785v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum instruments are mathematical devices introduced to describe the conditional state change during a quantum process. They are completely positive map valued measures on measurable spaces. We may also view them as non-commutative analogues of joint probability measures. We analyze the $C^*$-convexity structure of spaces of quantum instruments. A complete description of the $C^*$-extreme instruments in finite dimensions has been established. Further, the implications of $C^*$-extremity between quantum instruments and their marginals has been explored.</description>

      <title>Tracially embeddable strategies: Lifting MIP* tricks to MIPco</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.01940v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that any two-party correlation in the commuting operator model can be approximated using a tracially embeddable strategy, a class of strategies defined on a finite tracial von Neumann algebra, which we define in this paper. Using this characterization, we show that any approximately synchronous correlation can be approximated to the average of a collection of synchronous correlations in the commuting operator model. This generalizes the result from Vidick [JMP 2022] which only applies to finite-dimensional quantum correlations. As a corollary, we show that the quantum tensor code test from Ji et al. [FOCS 2022] follows the soundness property even under the general commuting operator model.
  Furthermore, we extend the state-dependent norm variant of the Gowers-Hatami theorem to finite von Neumann algebras. Combined with the aforementioned characterization, this enables us to lift many known results about robust self-testing for non-local games to the commuting operator model, including a sample efficient finite-dimensional EPR testing for the commuting operator strategies. We believe that, in addition to the contribution from this paper, this class of strategies can be helpful for further understanding non-local games in the infinite-dimensional setting.</description>

      <title>Dirac-Schr\"odinger operators, index theory, and spectral flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02993v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article we study generalised Dirac-Schr\"odinger operators in arbitrary signatures (with or without gradings), providing a general KK-theoretic framework for the study of index pairings and spectral flow. We provide a general Callias Theorem, which shows that the index (or the spectral flow, or abstractly the K-theory class) of Dirac-Schr\"odinger operators can be computed on a suitable compact hypersurface. Furthermore, if the zero eigenvalue is isolated in the spectrum of the Dirac operator, we relate the index (or spectral flow) of Dirac--Schr\"odinger operators to the index (or spectral flow) of corresponding Toeplitz operators. Combining both results, we obtain an index (or spectral flow) equality relating Toeplitz operators on the noncompact manifold to Toeplitz operators on the compact hypersurface. Our results generalise various known results from the literature, while presenting these results in a common unified framework.</description>

      <title>Deformations of Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces on Homogeneous Subvarieties of the Unit Ball</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23750v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the relationships between a subvariety of the open unit ball in the complex $d$-dimensional space $\mathbb{C}^{d}$, the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) obtained by restricting the Drury-Arveson space to the variety, and its multiplier algebra.
  We show that when two such RKHSs are almost isometrically isomorphic as RKHSs, their multiplier algebras are likewise almost completely isometrically isomorphic as multiplier algebras. In such cases, the underlying varieties are almost automorphically equivalent. For tractable homogeneous varieties, we further show that if the corresponding multiplier algebras are almost completely isometrically isomorphic as multiplier algebras or one variety is almost the image of the other under a unitary transformation, then the associated RKHSs are almost isometrically isomorphic as RKHSs.</description>
