      <title>In Situ Characterisation of Graphene Growth on Liquid Copper-Gallium Alloys: Paving the Path for Cost-Effective Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Liquid metal catalysts (LMCats), primarily molten copper, have demonstrated their efficiency in the chemical vapour deposition (CVD) approach for synthesising high-quality, large-area graphene. However, their high melting temperatures limit broader applications. Reducing the temperature of graphene production on LMCats would lead to a more efficient and cost-effective process. Here, we investigated the effects of alloying copper with a low-melting temperature metal on graphene growth in real-time. We examined a set of liquid copper-gallium alloy systems using two complementary in situ techniques: radiation-mode optical microscopy and synchrotron X-ray reflectivity (XRR). Microscopy observations revealed reduced catalytic activity and graphene quality degradation in compositions with gallium domination. The XRR confirmed the formation of single-layer graphene on alloys with up to 60 wt% of gallium. Additionally, we detected a systematic increase in adsorption height on the alloys' surface, suggesting a weaker graphene adhesion on gallium. These findings propose a trade-off between layer quality and production cost reduction is feasible. Our results offer insights into the CVD synthesis of graphene on bimetallic liquid surfaces and underscore the potential of gallium-copper alloys for enabling the direct transfer of graphene from a liquid substrate, thereby addressing the limitations imposed by high melting temperatures of conventional LMCats.</description>

      <title>Switching response and ionic hysteresis in organic electrochemical transistors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hysteresis in organic electrochemical transistors (OECT) is a basic effect in which the measured current depends on the voltage sweep direction and velocity. This phenomenon has an important impact on different aspects of the application of OECT, such as the switching time and the synaptic properties for neuromorphic applications. Here we address the combined ionic and electronic kinetic effects that cause the dominant hysteresis effects. We use a combination of tools consisting on basic analytical models, advanced 2D drift-diffusion simulation, and the experimental measurement of a Poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) OECT, working in an accumulation mode. We develop a general transmission line model considering drift electronic transport and ionic injection and diffusion from the electrolyte. We provide a basic classification of the transient response to a voltage pulse, according to the dominant ionic or electronic relaxation time, and the correspondent hysteresis effects of the transfer curves according to the general categories of inductive and capacitive hysteresis. These are basically related to the main control phenomenon, either the vertical diffusion of ions during doping and dedoping, or the equilibration of electronic current along the channel length.</description>

      <title>Inferring solid-state diffusivity in lithium-ion battery active materials: improving upon the classical GITT method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Galvanostatic Intermittent Titration Technique (GITT) is a ubiquitous method for determining the solid-state diffusivity in lithium-ion battery materials. However, it is notoriously time-consuming and relies upon assumptions whose applicability is questionable. We propose a novel methodology that allows inference of the diffusivity for a more general class of data that is simpler and faster to harvest. We infer the diffusivity (as a function of stoichiometry) by minimising the residual sum of squares between data and solutions to a spherically-symmetric diffusion model in a single representative active material particle. Using data harvested from the NMC cathode of a commercial LG M50 cell we first demonstrate that our method is able to reproduce the diffusivities inferred by the GITT, which requires ten days of galvanostatic intermittent titration data. We then demonstrate that our method reliably reconstructs diffusivity using significantly less data. Despite arising from quick-to-measure data, our method more accurately infers diffusivities. This work is a contribution towards developing faster and more reliable techniques in parameter inference for lithium-ion batteries.</description>

      <title>Dimensional Crossover of Microscopic Magnetic Metasurfaces for Magnetic Field Amplification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transformation optics applied to low frequency magnetic systems has been recently implemented to design magnetic field concentrators and cloaks with superior performance. Although this achievement has been amply demonstrated theoretically and experimentally in bulk 3D macrostructures, the performance of these devices at low dimensions remains an open question. In this work, we numerically investigate the non-monotonic evolution of the gain of a magnetic metamaterial field concentrator as the axial dimension is progressively shrunk. In particular, we show that in planar structures the role played by the diamagnetic components becomes negligible, whereas the paramagnetic elements increase their magnetic field channeling efficiency. This is further demonstrated experimentally by tracking the gain of superconductor-ferromagnet concentrators through the superconducting transition. Interestingly, for thicknesses where the diamagnetic petals play an important role for the concentration gain, they also help to reduce the stray field of the concentrator, thus limiting the perturbation of the external field (invisibility). Our findings establish a roadmap and set clear geometrical limits for designing low dimensional magnetic field concentrators.</description>

      <title>Testing structural balance theories in heterogeneous signed networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.07023v4 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The abundance of data about social relationships allows the human behavior to be analyzed as any other natural phenomenon. Here we focus on balance theory, stating that social actors tend to avoid establishing cycles with an odd number of negative links. This statement, however, can be supported only after a comparison with a benchmark. Since the existing ones disregard actors' heterogeneity, we extend Exponential Random Graphs to signed networks with both global and local constraints and employ them to assess the significance of empirical unbalanced patterns. We find that the nature of balance crucially depends on the null model: while homogeneous benchmarks favor the weak balance theory, according to which only triangles with one negative link should be under-represented, heterogeneous benchmarks favor the strong balance theory, according to which also triangles with all negative links should be under-represented. Biological networks, instead, display strong frustration under any benchmark, confirming that structural balance inherently characterizes social networks.</description>

      <title>Optomagnetic forces on YIG/YFeO3 microspheres levitated in chiral hollow-core photonic crystal fibre</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16182v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore a magnetooptomechanical system consisting of a single magnetic microparticle optically levitated within the core of a helically twisted single-ring hollow-core photonic crystal fibre. We use newly-developed magnetic particles that have a core of antiferromagnetic yttrium-ortho-ferrite (YFeO3) and a shell of ferrimagnetic YIG (Y3Fe5O12) approximately 50 nm thick. Using a 632.8 nm probe beam, we observe optical-torque-induced rotation of the particle and rotation of the magnetization vector in presence of an external static magnetic field. This one-of-a-kind platform opens a path to novel investigations of optomagnetic physics with levitated magnetic particles.</description>

      <title>Terahertz Voltage-controlled Oscillator from a Kerr-Induced Synchronized Soliton Microcomb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The generation of controlled and arbitrarily tunable terahertz radiation, essential for many applications, has proven challenging due to the complexity of experimental setups and fabrication techniques. We introduce a new strategy involving control over a terahertz repetition rate integrated frequency comb, using Kerr-induced synchronization, that results in a terahertz-voltage-controlled oscillator. By modulating the reference laser, we can transfer any microwave waveform onto the microcomb repetition rate via a linear transfer function based on optical frequency division. The resulting frequency comb with a terahertz carrier can be created using integrated components, with a bandwidth constrained only by the synchronization bandwidth and high coherence resulting from the low-noise soliton microcomb in the Kerr-induced synchronized state.</description>

      <title>Simulation of depth-dose curves and water equivalent ratios of energetic proton beams in cortical bone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have determined the depth-dose curve, the penetration range, and the water equivalent ratio (WER), for proton beams of clinical energies in cortical bone, by means of a detailed and accurate simulation that combines molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo techniques. The fundamental input quantities (stopping power and energy loss straggling) for the simulation were obtained from a reliable electronic excitation spectrum of the condensed-phase target, which takes into account the organic and mineral phases that form it. Our simulations with these inputs, that are in excellent agreement with the scarce data available for a cortical bone target, deviate from simulations performed using other stopping quantities, such as those provided in the widely used ICRU Report 49. The results of this work emphasize the importance of an accurate determination of the stopping quantities of cortical bone in order to advance towards the millimetric precision for the proton penetration ranges and deposited dose needed in radiotherapy.</description>

      <title>Oxygen Vacancies in Niobium Pentoxide as a Source of Two-Level System Losses in Superconducting Niobium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.13352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2108.13352v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We identify a major source of quantum decoherence in three-dimensional superconducting radio-frequency (SRF) resonators and two-dimensional transmon qubits composed of oxidized niobium: oxygen vacancies in the niobium pentoxide which drive two-level system (TLS) losses. By probing the effect of sequential \textit{in situ} vacuum baking treatments on the RF performance of bulk Nb SRF resonators and on the oxide structure of a representative Nb sample using time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS), we find a non-monotonic evolution of cavity quality factor $Q_0$ which correlates with the interplay of Nb\textsubscript{2}O\textsubscript{5} vacancy generation and oxide thickness reduction. We localize this effect to the oxide itself and present the insignificant role of diffused interstitial oxygen in the underlying Nb by regrowing a new oxide \textit{via} wet oxidation which reveals a mitigation of aggravated TLS losses. We hypothesize that such vacancies in the pentoxide serve as magnetic impurities and are a source of TLS-driven RF loss.</description>
