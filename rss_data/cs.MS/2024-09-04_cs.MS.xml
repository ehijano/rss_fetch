      <title>TorchDA: A Python package for performing data assimilation with deep learning forward and transformation functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data assimilation techniques are often confronted with challenges handling complex high dimensional physical systems, because high precision simulation in complex high dimensional physical systems is computationally expensive and the exact observation functions that can be applied in these systems are difficult to obtain. It prompts growing interest in integrating deep learning models within data assimilation workflows, but current software packages for data assimilation cannot handle deep learning models inside. This study presents a novel Python package seamlessly combining data assimilation with deep neural networks to serve as models for state transition and observation functions. The package, named TorchDA, implements Kalman Filter, Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF), 3D Variational (3DVar), and 4D Variational (4DVar) algorithms, allowing flexible algorithm selection based on application requirements. Comprehensive experiments conducted on the Lorenz 63 and a two-dimensional shallow water system demonstrate significantly enhanced performance over standalone model predictions without assimilation. The shallow water analysis validates data assimilation capabilities mapping between different physical quantity spaces in either full space or reduced order space. Overall, this innovative software package enables flexible integration of deep learning representations within data assimilation, conferring a versatile tool to tackle complex high dimensional dynamical systems across scientific domains.</description>

      <title>A prony method variant which surpasses the Adaptive LMS filter in the output signal's representation of input</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Prony method for approximating signals comprising sinusoidal/exponential components is known through the pioneering work of Prony in his seminal dissertation in the year 1795. However, the Prony method saw the light of real world application only upon the advent of the computational era, which made feasible the extensive numerical intricacies and labor which the method demands inherently. The Adaptive LMS Filter which has been the most pervasive method for signal filtration and approximation since its inception in 1965 does not provide a consistently assured level of highly precise results as the extended experiment in this work proves. As a remedy this study improvises upon the Prony method by observing that a better (more precise) computational approximation can be obtained under the premise that adjustment can be made for computational error , in the autoregressive model setup in the initial step of the Prony computation itself. This adjustment is in proportion to the deviation of the coefficients in the same autoregressive model. The results obtained by this improvisation live up to the expectations of obtaining consistency and higher value in the precision of the output (recovered signal) approximations as shown in this current work and as compared with the results obtained using the Adaptive LMS Filter.</description>

      <title>CEopt: A MATLAB Package for Non-convex Optimization with the Cross-Entropy Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00013v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces CEopt (https://ceopt.org), a MATLAB tool leveraging the Cross-Entropy method for non-convex optimization. Due to the relative simplicity of the algorithm, it provides a kind of transparent ``gray-box'' optimization solver, with intuitive control parameters. Unique in its approach, CEopt effectively handles both equality and inequality constraints using an augmented Lagrangian method, offering robustness and scalability for moderately sized complex problems. Through select case studies, the package's applicability and effectiveness in various optimization scenarios are showcased, marking CEopt as a practical addition to optimization research and application toolsets.</description>

      <title>Toward Capturing Genetic Epistasis From Multivariate Genome-Wide Association Studies Using Mixed-Precision Kernel Ridge Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We exploit the widening margin in tensor-core performance between [FP64/FP32/FP16/INT8,FP64/FP32/FP16/FP8/INT8] on NVIDIA [Ampere,Hopper] GPUs to boost the performance of output accuracy-preserving mixed-precision computation of Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) of 305K patients from the UK BioBank, the largest-ever GWAS cohort studied for genetic epistasis using a multivariate approach. Tile-centric adaptive-precision linear algebraic techniques motivated by reducing data motion gain enhanced significance with low-precision GPU arithmetic. At the core of Kernel Ridge Regression (KRR) techniques for GWAS lie compute-bound cubic-complexity matrix operations that inhibit scaling to aspirational dimensions of the population, genotypes, and phenotypes. We accelerate KRR matrix generation by redesigning the computation for Euclidean distances to engage INT8 tensor cores while exploiting symmetry.We accelerate solution of the regularized KRR systems by deploying a new four-precision Cholesky-based solver, which, at 1.805 mixed-precision ExaOp/s on a nearly full Alps system, outperforms the state-of-the-art CPU-only REGENIE GWAS software by five orders of magnitude.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11074v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article introduces 'cpp11armadillo', a new R package that integrates the powerful Armadillo C++ library for linear algebra into the R programming environment. Targeted primarily at social scientists and other non-programmers, this article explains the computational benefits of moving code to C++ in terms of speed and syntax. We provide a comprehensive overview of Armadillo's capabilities, highlighting its user-friendly syntax akin to MATLAB and its efficiency for computationally intensive tasks. The 'cpp11armadillo' package simplifies a part of the process of using C++ within R by offering additional ease of integration for those who require high-performance linear algebra operations in their R workflows. This work aims to bridge the gap between computational efficiency and accessibility, making advanced linear algebra operations more approachable for R users without extensive programming backgrounds.</description>
