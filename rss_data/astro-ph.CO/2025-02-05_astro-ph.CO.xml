      <title>Tuning the cosmic instrument: robust cosmology through combined probes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As wide-field surveys yield increasingly precise data, multiprobe analyses offer significant advantages. In this work, we use our previously developed framework for jointly analyzing cosmic microwave background (CMB) and large-scale structure data. We analyze combinations of three CMB (Planck PR3, Planck PR4, and ACT+WMAP) datasets, DESI Y1 Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) data, and a $9\times 2$pt low-$z$ dataset comprising KiDS-1000, BOSS DR12, and Planck CMB lensing/Integrated Sachs Wolfe (including all cross-correlations). We first assess internal consistency, finding a mild ($&lt;2\sigma$) tension between CMB and low-$z$ datasets in the full parameter space and hints of systematics in Planck PR3 and KiDS-1000. We then derive constraints in $\Lambda\mathrm{CDM}$ and, motivated by recent DESI results, dynamical dark energy ($w_0w_a\mathrm{CDM}$) and free neutrino mass extensions. In $\Lambda \mathrm{CDM}$, we derive a novel $9\times2$pt constraint of $S8=0.777^{+0.17}_{-0.17}$ and find strong consistency among CMB datasets. In $w_0w_a\mathrm{CDM}$, adding low-$z$ to CMB+BAO tightens $(w_0,w_a)$ constraints by 50\% (in figure-of-merit terms) in our baseline combination of Planck PR4 + low-$z$ + BAO. The posterior accommodates a cosmological constant ($w_0 = -1, w_a = 0$) within $1\sigma$, in contrast to the $\sim2\sigma$ preference for evolving dark energy from CMB+BAO alone. For neutrino masses, our baseline dataset yields a systematics-robust constraint of $M_\nu&lt;0.12\mathrm{eV}$ in $\nu\Lambda\mathrm{CDM}$. Allowing dynamical dark energy and free neutrino mass ($\nu w_0w_a\mathrm{CDM}$) broadens and shifts the neutrino mass posterior higher, yielding a $1.8\sigma$ constraint ($M_\nu=0.16^{+0.09}_{-0.09}\mathrm{eV}$) in our baseline. Our analysis demonstrates the power of multiprobe analyses for assessing tensions, identifying systematics and providing robust constraints.</description>

      <title>Clustered unified dark sector cosmology: Background evolution and linear perturbations in light of observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider unified dark sector models in which the fluid can collapse and cluster into halos, allowing for hierarchical structure formation to proceed as in standard cosmology. We show that both background evolution and linear perturbations tend towards those in $\LCDM$ as the clustered fraction $f \rightarrow 1$. We confront such models with various observational datasets, with emphasis on the relatively well motivated standard Chaplygin gas. We show that the strongest constraints come from secondary anisotropies in the CMB spectrum, which prefer models with $f \rightarrow 1$. However, as a larger Hubble constant is allowed for smaller $f$, values of $f \simeq 0.99$ (rather than tending to exact unity) are favored when late universe expansion data is included, with $f \simeq 0.97$ and $H_0 \simeq 70 {\rm km/s/Mpc}$ allowed at the 2-$\sigma$ level. Such values of $f$ imply extremely efficient clustering into nonlinear structures. They may nevertheless be compatible with clustered fractions in warm dark matter based cosmologies, which have similar minimal halo mass scales as the models considered here. Tight CMB constraints on $f$ also apply to the generalized Chaplygin gas, except for models that are already quite close to $\LCDM$, in which case all values of $0 \le f \le 1$ are allowed. In contrast to the CMB, large scale structure data, which were initially used to rule out unclustered unified dark matter models, are far less constraining. Indeed, late universe data, including the large scale galaxy distribution, prefer models that are far from $\LCDM$. But these are in tension with the CMB data.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Ray Feedback in Massive Halos: Implications for the Distribution of Baryons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use order of magnitude estimates and observational constraints to argue that feedback from relativistic cosmic rays (CRs) produced by massive black holes is likely to have a particularly large effect at radii of order the virial radius and larger in group-mass halos. We show that for a range of plausible (but uncertain) CR transport parameters and energetics, the pressure produced by CRs generated by the central massive black hole over its lifetime can be of order the thermal gas pressure in the outskirts of $\sim 10^{13-14} M_\odot$ halos (but not in more massive clusters). The properties of this CR feedback at low redshift are not well predicted by the radiative cooling rate of hot gas at smaller radii, which is often used as a proxy for `current' black hole feedback. This is because most black hole growth happens early in massive halos, and CR transport timescales in halo outskirts are Gyr or more; the accumulated CR energy thus depends on the full history of black hole activity in the halo. The large CR pressure in group-mass systems likely leads to CR-driven outflows that move gas from large halo radii to outside the virial radius. Such feedback would not be captured by current cosmological simulations that focus on mechanical black hole feedback; in particular, CR feedback remains active even long after the mechanical feedback sourcing the CRs has turned off. We speculate that this CR feedback may be important for explaining the weak lensing $S_8$ tension and the evidence for strong feedback at large halo radii from kinetic Sunyaev-Zeldovich measurements. Prospects for testing this mechanism observationally and implementing the necessary physics in cosmological simulations are discussed.</description>

      <title>The SRG/eROSITA all-sky survey: The morphologies of clusters of galaxies I: A catalogue of morphological parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The first SRG/eROSITA all-sky X-ray survey, eRASS1, resulted in a catalogue of over twelve thousand optically-confirmed galaxy groups and clusters in the western Galactic hemisphere. Using the eROSITA images of these objects, we measure and study their morphological properties, including their concentration, central density and slope, ellipticity, power ratios, photon asymmetry, centroid shift and Gini coefficient. We also introduce new forward-modelled parameters which take account of the instrument point spread function (PSF), which are slosh, which measures how asymmetric the surface brightness distribution is, and multipole magnitudes, which are analogues to power ratios. Using simulations, we find some non forward-modelled parameters are strongly biased due to PSF and data quality. For the same clusters, we find similar values of concentration and central density compared to results by ourselves using Chandra and previous results from XMM-Newton. The population as a whole has log concentrations which are typically around 0.3 dex larger than South Pole Telescope or Planck-selected samples and the deeper eFEDS sample. The exposure time, detection likelihood threshold, extension likelihood threshold and number of counts affect the concentration distribution, but generally not enough to reduce the concentration to match the other samples. The concentration of clusters in the survey strongly affects whether they are detected as a function of redshift and luminosity. We introduce a combined disturbance score based on a Gaussian mixture model fit to several of the parameters. For brighter clusters, around 1/4 of objects are classified as disturbed using this score, which may be due to our sensitivity to concentrated objects.</description>

      <title>Novel geometrical test of cosmological expansion from photometric data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02243v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In tomographic cosmic-shear observations, the BNT (Bernardeau, Nishimichi, Taruya) transform, Bernardeau et al. (2014), allows to build weak lensing transformed maps for which the contribution from low redshift lenses is nulled. As this transformation depends specifically on the expansion rate of the Universe but is independent of the matter distribution properties, it can be leveraged to extract information from large-scale structure probes at arbitrary non-linear scales, providing constraints on cosmological background evolution. We demonstrate this by proposing a specific null test for stage IV weak lensing projects. Using a Fisher matrix analysis and parameter sampling, we show that this approach can substantially enhance constraints on the dark energy equation of state. Notably, we find that shape noise currently limits this method's effectiveness making significant improvement possible in future designs. A detailed analysis of our null test in the context of the Euclid mission is presented in a companion paper Touzeau et al. (2025).</description>

      <title>Cosmic Shear Nulling as a geometrical cosmological probe: methodology and sensitivity to cosmological parameters and systematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In tomographic weak lensing surveys, the presence of nulling properties reveals symmetries inherent in the data, which rely solely on the geometrical properties of the Universe. Ensuring its validity thus provides us with constraints on the cosmological parameters that describe the background evolution, particularly the redshift dependence of the cosmological angular distance. This forms the basis of the tomographic cosmic shear nulling test that we introduce here. We outline how such a test can be executed, what it can constrain, and its specific efficiency in constraining cosmological parameters. Additionally, we explore its sensitivity to astrophysical effects such as magnification bias and reduced shear corrections, as well as observational systematics like errors in the mean redshift of the source bins. Our findings indicate that in a scenario akin to that of Euclid, this nulling test can bring significant and complementary constraints on basic cosmological parameters such as $\{\Omega_m,{\rm w}_0\}$, provided that the mean redshift of the bins are known at a level of $10^{-3}$. We conclude that the combination of nulling as a cosmological probe or a consistence test with usual weak lensing and galaxy clustering probes could allow to better keep systematics under control and bring more precise results in the future.</description>

      <title>Elucidating the Dark Energy and Dark Matter Phenomena Within the Scale-Invariant Vacuum (SIV) Paradigm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The enigmatic phenomenon of dark energy (DE) is regarded as the elusive entity driving the accelerated expansion of our Universe. A plausible candidate for DE is the non-zero Einstein Cosmological Constant $\Lambda_{E}$ manifested as a constant energy density of the vacuum, yet it seemingly defies gravitational effects. In this work, we interpret the non-zero $\Lambda_{E}$ through the lens of scale-invariant cosmology. We revisit the conformal scale factor $\lambda$ and its defining equations within the Scale-Invariant Vacuum (SIV) paradigm. Furthermore, we address the profound problem of the missing mass across galactic and extragalactic scales by deriving an MOND-like relation, $g \sim \sqrt{a_0\,g_N}$, within the SIV context. Remarkably, the values obtained for $\Lambda_{E}$ and the MOND fundamental acceleration, $a_0$, align with observed magnitudes, specifically, $a_0 \approx 10^{-10} \, \mathrm{m} \, \mathrm{s}^{-2}$ and $\Lambda_{E} \approx 1.8 \times 10^{-52} \, \mathrm{m}^{-2}$. Moreover, we propose a novel early dark energy term, $\tilde{T}_{\mu\nu} \sim \kappa H$, within the SIV paradigm, which holds potential relevance for addressing the Hubble tension.

      <title>Primordial Black Hole Formation via Inverted Bubble Collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel mechanism of primordial black hole (PBH) formation through inverted bubble collapse. In this scenario, bubbles nucleate sparsely in an incomplete first-order phase transition, followed by a bulk phase transition in the rest of the universe that inverts these pre-existing bubbles into false vacuum regions. These spherically symmetric false-vacuum bubbles subsequently collapse to form PBHs. Unlike conventional PBH formation mechanisms associated with domain wall collapse or bubble coalescence, our inverted bubble collapse mechanism naturally ensures spherical collapse. We demonstrate that, when applied to the electroweak phase transition, this mechanism can produce highly monochromatic PBHs with masses up to ${\cal O}(10^{-6}\,\text{-}\,10^{-5}) M_\odot$, which potentially explain the microlensing events observed in the OGLE and Subaru HSC data.</description>

      <title>Differentiable Cosmological Hydrodynamics for Field-Level Inference and High Dimensional Parameter Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hydrodynamical simulations are the most accurate way to model structure formation in the universe, but they often involve a large number of astrophysical parameters modeling subgrid physics, in addition to cosmological parameters. This results in a high-dimensional space that is difficult to jointly constrain using traditional statistical methods due to prohibitive computational costs. To address this, we present a fully differentiable approach for cosmological hydrodynamical simulations and a proof-of-concept implementation, diffhydro. By back-propagating through an upwind finite volume scheme for solving the Euler Equations jointly with a dark matter particle-mesh method for Poisson equation, we are able to efficiently evaluate derivatives of the output baryonic fields with respect to input density and model parameters. Importantly, we demonstrate how to differentiate through stochastically sampled discrete random variables, which frequently appear in subgrid models. We use this framework to rapidly sample sub-grid physics and cosmological parameters as well as perform field level inference of initial conditions using high dimensional optimization techniques. Our code is implemented in JAX (python), allowing easy code development and GPU acceleration.</description>

      <title>On likelihood-based analysis of the gravitationally (de)lensed CMB</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By reducing variance induced by gravitational lensing, likelihood-based de-lensing techniques have true potential to extract significantly more information from deep and high-resolution Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data than traditional methods. We derive here optimal data compression statistics for the lensed CMB, and clarify the role of each term, demonstrating their direct analogs in the quadratic estimator (QE) framework. We discuss in this light pros and cons of practical implementations, including the MUSE approach, as used in the latest SPT-3G cosmological analysis, and give improvements. We discuss pathways for porting the large robustness and redundancy toolbox of the QE approach to beyond-QE with simple means.</description>

      <title>Testing the Equivalence Principle on Cosmological Scales Using Peculiar Acceleration Power Spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While the (weak) Equivalence Principle (EP) has been rigorously tested within the solar system, its validity on cosmological scales, particularly in the context of dark matter and dark energy, remains uncertain. In this study, we propose a novel method to test EP on cosmological scales by measuring the peculiar acceleration power spectrum of galaxies using the redshift drift technique. We develop an EP estimator, $E_{\rm ep}$, to evaluate the consistency of the peculiar acceleration power spectrum across different tracers. By calculating the ratio of the peculiar acceleration power spectra of tracers, the ensemble average of $E_{\rm ep}$ is expected to be unity if EP holds on cosmological scales for these tracers. We validate this estimator using N-body simulations, focusing on four redshift bins with $z\leq 1.5$ and scales of $k$ in the range of $0.007$ and $0.32$ $h/\rm Mpc$. By measuring $E_{\rm ep}$ using i) different samples of dark matter particle mock data and ii) low-mass and high-mass halo mock data, we find that the measured $E_{\rm ep}$ values are consistent with unity within the $2\sigma$ level, supporting the validity of $E_{\rm ep}$ on the linear cosmological scales. Taking advantage of advanced observing capabilities, such as next-generation facilities that extend beyond the Square Kilometer Array, the proposed method offers a promising approach for future cosmological tests of EP.</description>

      <title>Gravitational lensing: towards combining the multi-messengers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The next generation of gravitational wave detectors and electromagnetic telescopes are beckoning the onset of the multi-messenger era and the exciting science that lies ahead. Multi-messenger strong gravitational lensing will help probe some of the most important questions of the Universe in an unprecedented manner. In particular, understanding the nature of gravitational wave sources, the underlying physical processes and mechanisms that produce emissions well before or right until the time of the merger, their associations to the seemingly distinct populations of gamma ray bursts, fast radio bursts and kilonovae. Not to mention, multi-messenger lensing will offer unique probes of test of gravity models and constraints on cosmological parameters complementary to other probes. Enabling multi-messenger science calls for concerted follow-up efforts and development of new and shared resources required in the community.</description>

      <title>Primordial Sharp Features through the Nonlinear Regime of Structure Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sudden violations of the slow-roll regime during inflation, a natural prediction of many UV-complete inflationary models, give rise to sharp features in the primordial power spectrum. At large scales, these features provide a unique window into the physics of inflation, with constraints primarily derived from Cosmic Microwave Background observations of linearly evolved primordial fluctuations. However, on smaller scales, it is less clear whether primordial features would survive the late-time nonlinear cosmological evolution, as they are expected to be washed out by mode coupling. In this paper, we run dedicated N-body simulations to tackle this question. We demonstrate that, while oscillatory-like patterns are erased over time by nonlinearities, signatures of primordial sharp features can persist through the nonlinear regime of structure formation. Those take the form of a localised power enhancement or decrease in the matter power spectrum, whose amplitude and position can in principle be used to recover the scale of the primordial feature, and an oscillatory pattern in the halo mass function. While these findings highlight the power for constraining inflationary physics at small scales, they also show the challenges posed by potential degeneracies with other physical processes relevant in the nonlinear regime of structure formation such as non-cold dark matter candidates. Our results open new avenues for probing inflationary physics in large scale structures and galactic physics and emphasise the need for refined theoretical tools to robustly constrain primordial features.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the large-scale structure of the Universe requires analysis of cosmic clustering and its evolution over time. In this work, we investigate the clustering properties of SDSS blue galaxies, which are excellent tracers of dark matter, along two distinct epochs of the Universe, utilizing estimators like the 2-point angular correlation function (2PACF), the angular power spectra, among others. Considering a model-independent approach, we perform analyses in two disjoint redshift shells, $0 \leq z &lt; 0.06$ and $0.06 \leq z &lt; 0.12$, to investigate the distribution of large cosmic structures. Using Bayesian inference methods, we constrain the parameter that quantifies the galaxy clustering in the 2PACF, enabling us to perform comparisons among different regions on the sky and between different epochs in the Universe regarding the gravitational action on matter structures. Our analyses complement previous efforts to map large-scale structures in the Local Universe. In addition, this study reveals differences regarding the clustering of large cosmic structures comparing two epochs of the Universe, analyses done with diverse estimators. Results reveal, clearly, distinct evolutionary signatures between the two redshift shells. Moreover, we had the opportunity to test the concordance cosmological model under extreme conditions in the highly non-linear Local Universe, computing the amplitude of the angular power spectrum at very small scales. Ultimately, all our analyses serve as a set of consistency tests of the concordance cosmological model, the $\Lambda$CDM.</description>

      <title>Pearls on a string: Dark and bright galaxies on a strikingly straight and narrow filament</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We identify a chain of galaxies along an almost straight line in the nearby Universe with a projected length of ~5 Mpc. The galaxies are distributed within projected distances of only 7-105 kpc from the axis of the identified filament. They have redshifts in a very small range of z=0.0361-0.0370 so that their radial velocities are consistent with galaxy proper motions. The filament galaxies are mainly star-forming and have stellar masses in a range of $\rm 10^{9.1}-10^{10.7}\,M_{\odot}$. We search for systems with similar geometrical properties in the full-sky mock galaxy catalogue of the MillenniumTNG simulations and find that although such straight filaments are unusual and rare, they are predicted by $\Lambda$CDM simulations (4% incidence). We study the cold HI gas in a 1.3 Mpc section of the filament through HI-21cm emission line observations and detect eleven HI sources, many more than expected from the HI mass function in a similar volume. They have HI masses $\rm 10^{8.5}-10^{9.5}\,M_{\odot}$ and are mostly within ~120 kpc projected distance from the filament axis. None of these HI sources has a confirmed optical counterpart. Their darkness together with their large HI-21cm line-widths indicate that they contain gas that might not yet be virialized. These clouds must be marking the peaks of the dark matter and HI distributions over large scales within the filament. The presence of such gas clouds around the filament spines is predicted by simulations, but this is the first time that the existence of such clouds in a filament is observationally confirmed.</description>

      <title>Direct Dark Matter searches with Metal Halide Perovskites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polar materials with optical phonons in the meV range are excellent candidates for both dark matter direct detection (via dark photon-mediated scattering) and light dark matter absorption. In this study, we propose, for the first time, the metal halide perovskites MAPbI$_3$, MAPbCl$_3$, and CsPbI$_3$ for these purposes. Our findings reveal that CsPbI$_3$ is the best material, significantly improving exclusion limits compared to other polar materials. For scattering, CsPbI$_3$ can probe dark matter masses down to the keV range. For absorption, it enhances sensitivity to detect dark photon masses below $\sim 10~{\rm meV}$. The only material which has so far been investigated and that could provide competitive bounds is CsI, which, however, is challenging to grow in kilogram-scale sizes due to its considerably lower stability compared to CsPbI$_3$. Moreover, CsI is isotropic while the anisotropic structure of CsPbI$_3$ enables daily modulation analysis, showing that a significant percentage of daily modulation exceeding 1% is achievable for dark matter masses below $40~{\rm keV}$.</description>

      <title>Resonant Locking Between Binary Systems Induced by Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01733v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interaction of gravitational waves (GWs) with matter is thought to be typically negligible in the Universe. We identify a possible exception in the case of resonant interactions, where GWs emitted by a background binary system such as an inspiraling supermassive black hole (SMBH) binary causes a resonant response in a stellar-mass foreground binary and the frequencies of the two systems become, and remain, synchronized. We point out that such locking is not only possible, but can significantly reduce the binaries' merger time for $\mathcal{O}(1-10^4)$ binaries in the host galaxy of the merging SMBHs of $10^{9-11}M_{\odot}$ for standard general relativity and even more either in ``wet'' SMBH mergers or in certain modified theories of gravity where the inspiral rate is reduced. This could leave an imprint on the period distribution of stellar mass binaries in post-merger galaxies which could be detectable by future GW detectors, such as LISA.</description>

      <title>Central Cluster Galaxies: A Hotspot for Detectable Gravitational Waves from Black Hole Mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01845v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We model continuous gravitational wave (CW) sources detectable by pulsar timing arrays (PTAs), using the ASTRID cosmological simulation. The most detectable single sources are in the low-frequency bins and are produced by the most supermassive black hole (SMBH) mergers (with M_BH ~ 10^10 - 10^11 solarmass) in the most massive galaxies M_star ~ 10^12 solarmass. Remarkably, these mergers (mostly at z&lt; 0.3) occur within massive galaxies residing at the center of galaxy clusters. Particularly striking in ASTRID is a triple merger event, where two subsequent mergers in the same cluster core generate high-detection-probability CW signals at ~ 2nHz and ~ 10nHz. We expect electromagnetic signatures from these events: either single or dual active galactic nuclei (AGN) and massive host galaxies that are undergoing significant star formation. We establish a novel connection between these high-mass, central cluster mergers, occurring in galaxies with active star formation and AGN, and the formation process of the central cluster galaxy in ASTRID. This provides new insights into the low-frequency gravitational wave sky and informs future multi-messenger searches for PTA CW sources.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Solution to the Eta Problem in Spectator Field Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01898v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a class of spectator field models that addresses the eta problem while providing a natural explanation for the observed slight deviation of the spectrum of curvature perturbations from scale-invariance. In particular, we analyze the effects of quantum corrections on the quadratic potential of the spectator field given by its gravitational coupling to the Ricci scalar and the inflaton energy, so-called the Hubble-induced mass term. These quantum corrections create a minimum around which the potential is flatter and to which the spectator field is attracted. We demonstrate that this attractor dynamics can naturally generate the observed slightly red-tilted spectrum of curvature perturbations. Furthermore, focusing on a curvaton model with a quadratic vacuum potential, we compute the primordial non-Gaussianity parameter $f_{\text{NL}}$ and derive a predictive relationship between $f_{\text{NL}}$ and the running of the scalar spectral index. This relationship serves as a testable signature of the model. Finally, we extend the idea to a broader class of models where the spectator field is an angular component of a complex scalar field.</description>

      <title>The Spectrum of Global Axion Strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The post-inflationary Peccei-Quinn (PQ) symmetry breaking scenario provides a unique opportunity to pinpoint the QCD axion dark matter mass, which is a crucial input for laboratory experiments that are designed for probing specific mass ranges. Predicting their mass requires a precise knowledge of how axions are produced from the decay of topological defects in the early Universe that are inevitably formed. In this contribution, we present recent results on the analysis of the spectrum of axions radiated from global strings based on large scale numerical simulations of the cosmological evolution of the PQ field on a static lattice. We highlight several systematic effects that have been overlooked in previous works, such as the dependence on the initial conditions, contaminations due to oscillations in the spectrum, and discretisation effects; some of which could explain the discrepancy in the current literature. Taking these uncertainties into account and performing the extrapolation to cosmologically relevant string tensions, we find that the dark matter mass is predicted to be in the range of $95\,\mu\text{eV} \lesssim m_a \lesssim 450 \, \mu\text{eV}$, which will be probed by some of the next generation direct detection experiments.</description>

      <title>Extended Effective Field Theory of Dark Energy: Ghost Condensate Dark Energy with Sextic Dispersion Relation in de Sitter Spacetime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We continue our studies of the ghost condensate (GC) with sixth-order dispersion relation. Contrary to the GC with quartic dispersion relation, we find that the correction to the Newtonian potential explicitly depends on the space and time dependence of matter density. At late times when the Newtonian potential becomes time-independent, one obtains similar oscillatory behavior at the distance $\frac{M_\textrm{Pl}}{M^2}$, but this time at the time scale $\frac{M^4}{M_\textrm{Pl}^3}$, where $M^2$ is the ghost field velocity. We also show that the speed of gravitational wave is modified in a frequency dependent manner at momenta close to $\frac{M_\textrm{Pl}}{\sqrt{|\sigma_1|}}$, where $\sigma_1$ is the coefficient of $\gamma^{ij} \nabla_i K_{lr} \nabla_j K^{lr}$ operator in the unitary gauge action.</description>

      <title>Constraints on minimally and conformally coupled ultralight dark matter with the EPTA</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02420v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Millisecond pulsars are extremely stable natural timekeepers. Pulsar Timing Array experiments, tracking subtle changes in the pulsars' rotation periods, can shed light on the presence of ultralight particles in our Galaxy. In this conference paper, we start by reviewing the most conservative scenario, in which ultralight particles interact only gravitationally. In this setting, we show that Pulsar Timing Arrays are able to constrain the presence of ultralight fields up to a few tenths of the observed dark matter abundance. Then, we consider conformally coupled ultralight candidates, demonstrating that the constraints on the universal scalar coupling of the field to Standard Model particles improve on existing bounds by several orders of magnitude, in the relevant mass range analyzed by Pulsar Timing Arrays. The discussion presented here is based on [1,2].</description>

Abstract: Untangling the connection between redshift space coordinates, a velocity measurement, and three dimensional real space coordinates, is a cosmological problem that is often modeled through a linear understanding of the velocity-position coupling. This linear information is better preserved in the Lagrangian space picture of the matter density field. Through Lagrangian space measurements, we can extract more information and make more accurate estimates of the linear growth rate of the universe. In this paper, we address the linear modelling of matter particle velocities through transfer functions, and in doing so examine to what degree the decrease in correlation with initial conditions may be contaminated by velocity-based nonlinearities. With a thorough analysis of the monopole-quadrupole ratio, we find the best-fit values for the Eulerian velocity dispersion, $\sigma_p = 378.3$ km/s for a Lorentzian finger-of-God damping factor and $\sigma_p = 254.6$ km/s for a Gaussian one. The covariance of the cosmological linear growth rate $f$, is estimated in the Eulerian and Lagrangian cases. Comparing Lagrangian and Eulerian, we find that the error in $f$ improves by a factor of 3, without the need for nonlinear velocity dispersion modelling.</description>

      <title>Does the magneto-thermal instability survive whistler-suppression of thermal conductivity in galaxy clusters?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.02163v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The hot and dilute intracluster medium (ICM) plays a central role in many key processes that shape galaxy clusters.Nevertheless, the nature of plasma turbulence and particle transport in the ICM remain poorly understood, and quantifying the effect of kinetic plasma instabilities on the macroscopic dynamics represents an outstanding problem. Here we focus on the impact of whistler-wave suppression of the heat flux on the magnetothermal instability (MTI), which is expected to drive significant turbulent motions in the periphery of galaxy clusters. We perform small-scale Boussinesq simulations with a sub-grid closure for the thermal diffusivity in the regime of whistler-wave suppression. Our model is characterized by a single parameter that quantifies the collisionality of the ICM on the astrophysical scales of interest that we tune to explore a range appropriate for the periphery of galaxy clusters. We find that the MTI is qualitatively unchanged for weak whistler suppression. Conversely, with strong suppression the magnetic dynamo is interrupted and MTI turbulence dies out. In the astrophysically relevant limit, however, the MTI is likely to be supplemented by additional sources of turbulence. Investigating this scenario, we show that the inclusion of external forcing has a beneficial impact and revives even MTI simulations with strong whistler suppression. As a result, the plasma remains buoyantly unstable, with important consequences for turbulent mixing in the ICM.</description>

      <title>Can we distinguish the adiabatic fluctuations and isocurvature fluctuations with pulsar timing arrays?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16781v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the nature of primordial fluctuations is pivotal to unraveling the Universe's early evolution. While these fluctuations are observed to be nearly scale-invariant, quasi-adiabatic, and Gaussian on large scales, their small-scale behavior remains poorly constrained, offering a potential window into new physics. Recent detections of a stochastic gravitational wave background in the nanohertz frequency range by pulsar timing arrays (PTAs), including NANOGrav, PPTA, EPTA+InPTA, and CPTA, align with astrophysical predictions from supermassive black hole binaries but could also encode signatures of primordial phenomena. We investigate whether the observed signal originates from primordial isocurvature or adiabatic fluctuations by fitting them to the latest NANOGrav dataset. Through comprehensive Bayesian model comparison, we evaluate the distinguishability of these scenarios given current PTA sensitivities. Our results demonstrate that existing data cannot conclusively differentiate between isocurvature and adiabatic sources, highlighting the need for enhanced observational capabilities to probe the primordial universe at small scales.</description>

      <title>ZTF SN Ia DR2: Colour standardisation of Type Ia Supernovae and its dependence on environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02072v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As type Ia supernova (SN Ia) cosmology transitions from a statistics-dominated to a systematics-dominated era, it is crucial to understand the remaining unexplained uncertainties that affect their luminosity, such as those stemming from astrophysical biases. SNe Ia are standardisable candles whose absolute magnitude reaches a scatter of 0.15 mag when empirical correlations with their light-curve stretch and colour and with their environment are accounted for. We investigate the dependence of the standardisation process of SNe Ia on the astrophysical environment, focusing on colour standardisation. We used the volume-limited ZTF SN Ia DR2 sample, which offers unprecedented statistics for the low-redshift ($z &lt; 0.06$) range. We first studied the colour distribution, to then select a dustless subsample of objects. We then examined the colour-residual relation and its associated parameter $\beta$. Finally, we investigated the colour dependence of the environment-dependent magnitude offsets (steps) to separate their intrinsic and extrinsic components. Our sample of nearly 1,000 SNe probes the red tail of the colour distribution up to $c = 0.8$. The dustless sample exhibits a significantly shorter red tail ($4.3\sigma$) than the whole sample, but the distributions around $c\sim0$ are similar for both samples. This suggests that the reddening above $c\geq0.2$ is dominated by interstellar dust absorption of the host. The colour-residual relation is linear with SN colour. We found indications of a potential evolution of $\beta$ with the stellar host mass, with $\beta\sim3.6$ for low-mass galaxies, compared to $\beta=3.05\pm0.06$ for the full sample. Finally, in contrast to recent claims from the literature, we found no evolution of steps as a function of SN colour. This suggests that dust may not be the dominating mechanism for the dependence on the environment of the magnitude of SNe Ia.</description>

Given the importance of compressing the increasingly complex data vectors used in cosmology, we address questions that impact the constraining power achieved, such as: Are currently used methods effectively lossless? Under what conditions do nonlinear methods, typically based on neural nets, outperform linear methods? Through theoretical analysis and experiments with simulated weak lensing data vectors we compare three standard linear methods and neural network based methods. We propose two linear methods that outperform all others while using less computational resources: a variation of the MOPED algorithm we call e-MOPED and an adaptation of Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA), which is a method new to cosmology but well known in statistics. Both e-MOPED and CCA utilize simulations spanning the full parameter space, and rely on the sensitivity of the data vector to the parameters of interest. The gains we obtain are significant compared to compression methods used in the literature: up to 30% in the Figure of Merit for $\Omega_m$ and $S_8$ in a realistic Simulation Based Inference analysis that includes statistical and systematic errors. We also recommend two modifications that improve the performance of all methods: First, include components in the compressed data vector that may not target the key parameters but still enhance the constraints on due to their correlations. The gain is significant, above 20% in the Figure of Merit. Second, compress Gaussian and non-Gaussian statistics separately -- we include two summary statistics of each type in our analysis.</description>

      <title>Weak Lensing analysis of Abell 2390 using short exposures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12119v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a weak lensing analysis of the galaxy cluster Abell 2390 at z = 0.23 using second moment shape measurements made in 411 short 60s exposures. The exposures are obtained in three broadband photometric filters (g, r, i) using WIYN-ODI. Shape measurement in individual exposures is done using a moment matching algorithm. Forced measurement is used when the moment matching algorithm fails to converge at low signal to noise ratio (SNR). The measurements made in individual images are combined using inverse error weight to obtain accurate shape of sources and hence recover shear. We use PhoSim simulations to validate shear measurements recovered by our pipeline. We find the mass of Abell 2390 is in agreement with previously published results. We also find the E-Mode maps show filamentary structures consistent with baryonic structures and recovers most clusters/groups of galaxies found using Optical and X-Ray data. Thus we demonstrate the feasibility of using Weak Lensing to map large scale structure of the universe. We also find the central portion of the cluster has a bimodal mass distribution and the relative orientation of the peaks are similar to X-Ray. We discuss earlier research on this galaxy cluster and show that a late stage merger accounts for all the observed data.</description>

      <title>Search for a Gravitational-Wave Background from Sound Speed Resonance from Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo's First Three Observing Runs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14929v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We search for a stochastic gravitational-wave background (SGWB) originating from scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGWs) with the sound speed resonance (SSR) effect using data from Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo's first three observing runs. The SSR mechanism, characterized by an oscillating sound speed squared term, can induce a nonperturbative parametric amplification of specific perturbation modes during inflation, leading to enhanced primordial curvature perturbations and a significant SIGW signal. We perform a Bayesian analysis to constrain the model parameters describing the SGWB spectrum from the SSR effect. Our results show no statistically significant evidence for the presence of such a signal in the current data. Consequently, we place an upper limit of $|\tau_0| \lesssim 5.9 \times 10^3\,\mathrm{s}$ at $95\%$ confidence level on the start time of the oscillation in the SSR model. These results demonstrate the capability of current gravitational wave detectors to probe inflation models through the SSR mechanism and paves the way for future searches with improved sensitivity.</description>

      <title>KiDS-1000: Weak lensing and intrinsic alignment around luminous red galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15416v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the properties of luminous red galaxies (LRGs) selected from the fourth data release of the Kilo Degree Survey (KiDS-1000) via galaxy-galaxy lensing of the background galaxies from KiDS-1000. We used a halo model formalism to interpret our measurements and obtain estimates of the halo masses as well as the satellite fractions of the LRGs, resulting in halo masses of $2.7 \times 10^{12} h^{-1} {\rm M}_{\odot}&lt;M_{\rm h}&lt; 2.6 \times 10^{13} h^{-1} {\rm M}_{\odot}$. We studied the strength of intrinsic alignments (IA) using the position-shape correlations as a function of LRG luminosity, where we used a double power law to describe the relation between luminosity and halo mass to allow for a comparison with previous works. Here, we directly linked the observed IA of the (central) galaxy to the mass of the hosting halo, which is expected to be a fundamental quantity in establishing the alignment. We find that the dependence of the IA amplitude on halo mass is described well by a single power law, with an amplitude of $A = 5.74\pm{0.32}$ and slope of $\beta_M = 0.44\pm{0.04}$, in the range of $1.9 \times 10^{12}h^{-1} {\rm M}_{\odot}&lt;M_{\rm h}&lt;3.7 \times 10^{14} h^{-1} {\rm M}_{\odot}$. We also find that both red and blue galaxies from the source sample associated with the LRGs are randomly oriented, with respect to the LRGs, although our detection significance is limited by the uncertainty in our photometric redshifts.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Correlators at Finite Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17195v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study finite-coupling effects of QFT on a rigid de Sitter (dS) background taking the $O(N)$ vector model at large $N$ as a solvable example. Extending standard large $N$ techniques to the dS background, we analyze the phase structure and late-time four-point functions. Explicit computations reveal that the spontaneous breaking of continuous symmetries is prohibited due to strong IR effects, akin to flat two-dimensional space. Resumming loop diagrams, we compute the late-time four-point functions of vector fields at large $N$, demonstrating that their spectral density is meromorphic in the spectral plane and positive along the principal series. These results offer highly nontrivial checks of unitarity and analyticity for cosmological correlators.</description>

      <title>Effects of Subhalos on Interpreting Highly Magnified Sources Near Lensing Caustics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09594v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large magnification factors near gravitational lensing caustics of galaxy cluster lenses allow the study of individual stars or compact stellar associations at cosmological distances. We study how the presence of sub-galactic subhalos, an inevitable consequence of cold dark matter, can alter the property of caustics and hence change the interpretation of highly magnified sources that lie atop them. First, we consider a galaxy cluster halo populated with subhalos sampled from a realistic subhalo mass function calibrated to $N$-body simulations. Then, we compare a semi-analytical approximation and an adaptive ray-shooting method which we employ to quantify the property of the caustics. As a case study, we investigate Earendel, a $z = 6.2$ candidate of magnified single or multiple star system with a lone lensed image atop the critical curve in the Sunrise Arc. We find that the source size constraint ($\lesssim 0.3\, \mathrm{pc}$) previously derived from macro lens models should be relaxed by a factor of a few to ten when subhalos are accounted for, therefore allowing the possibility of a compact star cluster. The subhalos could introduce an astrometric perturbation that is $\lesssim 0.5''$, which does not contradict observation. These conclusions are largely robust to changes in the subhalo population. Subhalos therefore should be seriously accounted for when interpreting the astrophysical nature of similar highly magnified sources uncovered in recent high-$z$ observations.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Dynamics in Interacting Scalar-Torsion f(T,$\phi$) Gravity: Investigating Energy and Momentum Couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14614v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the cosmological dynamics of a homogeneous scalar field non-minimally coupled to torsion gravity, which also interacts with cold dark matter through energy and momentum transfer. The matter and radiation perfect fluids are modeled using the Sorkin-Schutz formalism. We identify scaling regimes of the field during both the radiation and matter eras. Additionally, we discovered a field-dominated scaling attractor; however, it does not exhibit accelerated expansion, making it unsuitable for describing dark energy. Nevertheless, we find two attractor solutions that do exhibit accelerated expansion: one is a quintessence-like fixed point, and the other is a de Sitter fixed point.</description>

      <title>Geometrical origin for the compaction function for primordial black hole formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05544v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a geometrical origin for the Shibata-Sasaki compaction function, which is known to be a reliable indicator of primordial black hole formation at least during radiation domination. In the long-wavelength limit, we identify it with a compactness function in the static spacetime obtained by removing the cosmological scale factor from the metric and this explains why it cannot be greater than $1/2$. If its maximum is below $1/2$, the perturbation is of type I. If its maximum equals $1/2$, it corresponds to an extremal surface, which is simultaneously a bifurcating trapping horizon and admits a circular photon orbit in the static spacetime. In the long-wavelength regime of the physical expanding Universe, the Shibata-Sasaki compaction reaches its maximum value of $1/2$ at maximal and minimal surfaces on the constant time spacelike hypersurface, which feature a type II perturbation and both correspond to photon spheres expanding along with the cosmological expansion. Thus, the Shibata-Sasaki compaction measures how close to the type II configuration the perturbed region is.</description>

      <title>The cosmology of ultralight scalar dark matter coupled to right-handed neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17396v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider ultralight scalar dark matter that couples to right-handed neutrinos. Due to the high density of neutrinos in the early universe, the background neutrino density dominates the dynamics of the scalar field, and qualitatively alters the field's cosmological evolution. This effect has not been included in previous literature, and changes the interpretation of cosmological data and its interplay with laboratory experiments. To illustrate these points a simplified model of a $1+1$ setup with a single scalar field is analyzed.
  We find that: {\it i}) The scalar field experiences an asymmetric potential and its energy density redshifts differently than ordinary matter. {\it ii}) Neutrino mass measurements at the CMB and oscillation experiments performed today complement one another (i.e., they constrain different regions of parameter space). {\it iii}) There exists potentially interesting cosmologies with either $O(1)$ variations in the dark matter density between the CMB and today, or $O(1)$ oscillations of neutrino mass.</description>
