      <title>Differentially Private Publication of Electricity Time Series Data in Smart Grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Smart grids are a valuable data source to study consumer behavior and guide energy policy decisions. In particular, time-series of power consumption over geographical areas are essential in deciding the optimal placement of expensive resources (e.g., transformers, storage elements) and their activation schedules. However, publication of such data raises significant privacy issues, as it may reveal sensitive details about personal habits and lifestyles. Differential privacy (DP) is well-suited for sanitization of individual data, but current DP techniques for time series lead to significant loss in utility, due to the existence of temporal correlation between data readings. We introduce {\em STPT (Spatio-Temporal Private Timeseries)}, a novel method for DP-compliant publication of electricity consumption data that analyzes spatio-temporal attributes and captures both micro and macro patterns by leveraging RNNs. Additionally, it employs a partitioning method for releasing electricity consumption time series based on identified patterns. We demonstrate through extensive experiments, on both real-world and synthetic datasets, that STPT significantly outperforms existing benchmarks, providing a well-balanced trade-off between data utility and user privacy.</description>

      <title>SPICED: Syntactical Bug and Trojan Pattern Identification in A/MS Circuits using LLM-Enhanced Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analog and mixed-signal (A/MS) integrated circuits (ICs) are crucial in modern electronics, playing key roles in signal processing, amplification, sensing, and power management. Many IC companies outsource manufacturing to third-party foundries, creating security risks such as stealthy analog Trojans. Traditional detection methods, including embedding circuit watermarks or conducting hardware-based monitoring, often impose significant area and power overheads, and may not effectively identify all types of Trojans. To address these shortcomings, we propose SPICED, a Large Language Model (LLM)-based framework that operates within the software domain, eliminating the need for hardware modifications for Trojan detection and localization. This is the first work using LLM-aided techniques for detecting and localizing syntactical bugs and analog Trojans in circuit netlists, requiring no explicit training and incurring zero area overhead. Our framework employs chain-of-thought reasoning and few-shot examples to teach anomaly detection rules to LLMs. With the proposed method, we achieve an average Trojan coverage of 93.32% and an average true positive rate of 93.4% in identifying Trojan-impacted nodes for the evaluated analog benchmark circuits. These experimental results validate the effectiveness of LLMs in detecting and locating both syntactical bugs and Trojans within analog netlists.</description>

      <title>XG-NID: Dual-Modality Network Intrusion Detection using a Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network and Large Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the rapidly evolving field of cybersecurity, the integration of flow-level and packet-level information for real-time intrusion detection remains a largely untapped area of research. This paper introduces "XG-NID," a novel framework that, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to fuse flow-level and packet-level data within a heterogeneous graph structure, offering a comprehensive analysis of network traffic. Leveraging a heterogeneous graph neural network (GNN) with graph-level classification, XG-NID uniquely enables real-time inference while effectively capturing the intricate relationships between flow and packet payload data. Unlike traditional GNN-based methodologies that predominantly analyze historical data, XG-NID is designed to accommodate the heterogeneous nature of network traffic, providing a robust and real-time defense mechanism. Our framework extends beyond mere classification; it integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate detailed, human-readable explanations and suggest potential remedial actions, ensuring that the insights produced are both actionable and comprehensible. Additionally, we introduce a new set of flow features based on temporal information, further enhancing the contextual and explainable inferences provided by our model. To facilitate practical application and accessibility, we developed "GNN4ID," an open-source tool that enables the extraction and transformation of raw network traffic into the proposed heterogeneous graph structure, seamlessly integrating flow and packet-level data. Our comprehensive quantitative comparative analysis demonstrates that XG-NID achieves an F1 score of 97\% in multi-class classification, outperforming existing baseline and state-of-the-art methods. This sets a new standard in Network Intrusion Detection Systems by combining innovative data fusion with enhanced interpretability and real-time capabilities.</description>

      <title>Improving Adversarial Robustness in Android Malware Detection by Reducing the Impact of Spurious Correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) has demonstrated significant advancements in Android malware detection (AMD); however, the resilience of ML against realistic evasion attacks remains a major obstacle for AMD. One of the primary factors contributing to this challenge is the scarcity of reliable generalizations. Malware classifiers with limited generalizability tend to overfit spurious correlations derived from biased features. Consequently, adversarial examples (AEs), generated by evasion attacks, can modify these features to evade detection. In this study, we propose a domain adaptation technique to improve the generalizability of AMD by aligning the distribution of malware samples and AEs. Specifically, we utilize meaningful feature dependencies, reflecting domain constraints in the feature space, to establish a robust feature space. Training on the proposed robust feature space enables malware classifiers to learn from predefined patterns associated with app functionality rather than from individual features. This approach helps mitigate spurious correlations inherent in the initial feature space. Our experiments conducted on DREBIN, a renowned Android malware detector, demonstrate that our approach surpasses the state-of-the-art defense, Sec-SVM, when facing realistic evasion attacks. In particular, our defense can improve adversarial robustness by up to 55% against realistic evasion attacks compared to Sec-SVM.</description>

      <title>ANVIL: Anomaly-based Vulnerability Identification without Labelled Training Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supervised learning-based software vulnerability detectors often fall short due to the inadequate availability of labelled training data. In contrast, Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4, are not trained on labelled data, but when prompted to detect vulnerabilities, LLM prediction accuracy is only marginally better than random guessing. In this paper, we explore a different approach by reframing vulnerability detection as one of anomaly detection. Since the vast majority of code does not contain vulnerabilities and LLMs are trained on massive amounts of such code, vulnerable code can be viewed as an anomaly from the LLM's predicted code distribution, freeing the model from the need for labelled data to provide a learnable representation of vulnerable code. Leveraging this perspective, we demonstrate that LLMs trained for code generation exhibit a significant gap in prediction accuracy when prompted to reconstruct vulnerable versus non-vulnerable code.
  Using this insight, we implement ANVIL, a detector that identifies software vulnerabilities at line-level granularity. Our experiments explore the discriminating power of different anomaly scoring methods, as well as the sensitivity of ANVIL to context size. We also study the effectiveness of ANVIL on various LLM families, and conduct leakage experiments on vulnerabilities that were discovered after the knowledge cutoff of our evaluated LLMs. On a collection of vulnerabilities from the Magma benchmark, ANVIL outperforms state-of-the-art line-level vulnerability detectors, LineVul and LineVD, which have been trained with labelled data, despite ANVIL having never been trained with labelled vulnerabilities. Specifically, our approach achieves $1.62\times$ to $2.18\times$ better Top-5 accuracies and $1.02\times$ to $1.29\times$ times better ROC scores on line-level vulnerability detection tasks.</description>

      <title>Systematic Evaluation of Synthetic Data Augmentation for Multi-class NetFlow Traffic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detection of cyber-attacks in computer networks is a crucial and ongoing research challenge. Machine learning-based attack classification offers a promising solution, as these models can be continuously updated with new data, enhancing the effectiveness of network intrusion detection systems (NIDS). Unlike binary classification models that simply indicate the presence of an attack, multi-class models can identify specific types of attacks, allowing for more targeted and effective incident responses. However, a significant drawback of these classification models is their sensitivity to imbalanced training data. Recent advances suggest that generative models can assist in data augmentation, claiming to offer superior solutions for imbalanced datasets. Classical balancing methods, although less novel, also provide potential remedies for this issue. Despite these claims, a comprehensive comparison of these methods within the NIDS domain is lacking. Most existing studies focus narrowly on individual methods, making it difficult to compare results due to varying experimental setups. To close this gap, we designed a systematic framework to compare classical and generative resampling methods for class balancing across multiple popular classification models in the NIDS domain, evaluated on several NIDS benchmark datasets. Our experiments indicate that resampling methods for balancing training data do not reliably improve classification performance. Although some instances show performance improvements, the majority of results indicate decreased performance, with no consistent trend in favor of a specific resampling technique enhancing a particular classifier.</description>

      <title>LLMSecCode: Evaluating Large Language Models for Secure Coding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) requires careful consideration of their effect on cybersecurity. Our work aims to improve the selection process of LLMs that are suitable for facilitating Secure Coding (SC). This raises challenging research questions, such as (RQ1) Which functionality can streamline the LLM evaluation? (RQ2) What should the evaluation measure? (RQ3) How to attest that the evaluation process is impartial? To address these questions, we introduce LLMSecCode, an open-source evaluation framework designed to assess LLM SC capabilities objectively.
  We validate the LLMSecCode implementation through experiments. When varying parameters and prompts, we find a 10% and 9% difference in performance, respectively. We also compare some results to reliable external actors, where our results show a 5% difference.
  We strive to ensure the ease of use of our open-source framework and encourage further development by external actors. With LLMSecCode, we hope to encourage the standardization and benchmarking of LLMs' capabilities in security-oriented code and tasks.</description>

      <title>Development of a cyber risk assessment tool for Irish small business owners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) are increasingly vulnerable to cyber threats due to limited resources and cybersecurity expertise, in addition to an increasingly hostile cyber threat environment at national and international levels. This study aims to improve the cyber resilience amongst SMEs by developing a national risk assessment tool. This research is guided by three key questions: 1. What current international SME risk assessment tools are available and supported or endorsed by national cybersecurity centres? 2. How can a risk assessment tool be created that is accessible to SME owners with little to no cybersecurity knowledge? 3. What are the key areas of cybersecurity risks for SMEs? To answer these questions, a comprehensive review of existing risk assessment tools was carried out. Through iterative collaboration with SMEs, the development of a user-friendly tool that simplifies risk for non-expert users was made possible.</description>

      <title>Trustless Distributed Symmetric-key Encryption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Threshold cryptography has gained momentum in the last decades as a mechanism to protect long term secret keys. Rather than having a single secret key, this allows to distribute the ability to perform a cryptographic operation such as signing or encrypting. Threshold cryptographic operations are shared among different parties such that a threshold number of them must participate in order to run the operation. This makes the job of an attacker strictly more difficult in the sense that they would have to corrupt at least a threshold number of parties to breach the security. Most works in this field focus on asymmetric-key schemes that allow threshold signing or decrypting.
  We focus on the symmetric-key setting, allowing both threshold encryption and threshold decryption. Previous work relies on the presence of a trusted third party. Such a party may not exist in some use cases, and it represents a single point of failure. We propose to remove the requirement of a trusted third party by designing a dealer-free setup in which no entity can at any point obtain full knowledge of the secret keys.
  We implement a proof of concept of our construction in Python. We evaluate the proof of concept with timing metrics to compare to theoretical expectations and assess the cost in complexity of not relying on a trusted third party. While the setup phase suffers moderate additional cost, the encryption and decryption phases perform the same as the original algorithm.</description>

      <title>SoK: Identifying Limitations and Bridging Gaps of Cybersecurity Capability Maturity Models (CCMMs)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the rapidly evolving digital landscape, where organisations are increasingly vulnerable to cybersecurity threats, Cybersecurity Capability Maturity Models (CCMMs) emerge as pivotal tools in enhancing organisational cybersecurity posture. CCMMs provide a structured framework to guide organisations in assessing their current cybersecurity capabilities, identifying critical gaps, and prioritising improvements. However, the full potential of CCMMs is often not realised due to inherent limitations within the models and challenges encountered during their implementation and adoption processes. These limitations and challenges can significantly hamper the efficacy of CCMMs in improving cybersecurity. As a result, organisations remain vulnerable to cyber threats as they may fail to identify and address critical security gaps, implement necessary improvements or allocate resources effectively. To address these limitations and challenges, conducting a thorough investigation into existing models is essential. Therefore, we conducted a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) analysing 43 publications to identify existing CCMMs, their limitations, and the challenges organisations face when implementing and adopting them. By understanding these barriers, we aim to explore avenues for enhancing the efficacy of CCMMs, ensuring they more effectively meet the cybersecurity needs of organisational entities.</description>

      <title>LightSLH: Provable and Low-Overhead Spectre v1 Mitigation through Targeted Instruction Hardening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several software mitigations have been proposed to defend against Spectre vulnerabilities. However, these countermeasures often suffer from high performance overhead, largely due to unnecessary protections. We propose LightSLH, designed to mitigate this overhead by hardening instructions only when they are under threat from Spectre vulnerabilities. LightSLH leverages program analysis techniques based on abstract interpretation to identify all instructions that could potentially lead to Spectre vulnerabilities and provides provable protection. To enhance analysis efficiency and precision, LightSLH employs novel taint and value domains. The taint domain enables bit-level taint tracking, while the value domain allows LightSLH to analyze complex program structures such as pointers and structures. Furthermore, LightSLH uses a two-stage abstract interpretation approach to circumvent potential analysis paralysis issues.
  We demonstrate the security guarantees of LightSLH and evaluate its performance on cryptographic algorithm implementations from OpenSSL. LightSLH significantly reduces the overhead associated with speculative-load-hardening techniques. Our results show that LightSLH introduces no protection and thus no overhead on 4 out of the 7 studied algorithms, which contrasts with existing countermeasures that introduce additional overhead due to unnecessary hardening. Additionally, LightSLH performs, for the first time, a rigorous analysis of the security guarantees of RSA against Spectre v1, highlighting that the memory access patterns generated by the scatter-gather algorithm depend on secrets, even for observers at the cache line granularity, necessitating protection for such accesses.</description>

      <title>Understanding Privacy Norms through Web Forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Web forms are one of the primary ways to collect personal information online, yet they are relatively under-studied. Unlike web tracking, data collection through web forms is explicit and contextualized. Users (i) are asked to input specific personal information types, and (ii) know the specific context (i.e., on which website and for what purpose). For web forms to be trusted by users, they must meet the common sense standards of appropriate data collection practices within a particular context (i.e., privacy norms). In this paper, we extract the privacy norms embedded within web forms through a measurement study. First, we build a specialized crawler to discover web forms on websites. We run it on 11,500 popular websites, and we create a dataset of 293K web forms. Second, to process data of this scale, we develop a cost-efficient way to annotate web forms with form types and personal information types, using text classifiers trained with assistance of large language models (LLMs). Third, by analyzing the annotated dataset, we reveal common patterns of data collection practices. We find that (i) these patterns are explained by functional necessities and legal obligations, thus reflecting privacy norms, and that (ii) deviations from the observed norms often signal unnecessary data collection. In addition, we analyze the privacy policies that accompany web forms. We show that, despite their wide adoption and use, there is a disconnect between privacy policy disclosures and the observed privacy norms.</description>

      <title>Enhancing MOTION2NX for Efficient, Scalable and Secure Image Inference using Convolutional Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work contributes towards the development of an efficient and scalable open-source Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMPC) protocol on machines with moderate computational resources. We use the ABY2.0 SMPC protocol implemented on the C++ based MOTION2NX framework for secure convolutional neural network (CNN) inference application with semi-honest security. Our list of contributions are as follows. Firstly, we enhance MOTION2NX by providing a tensorized version of several primitive functions including the Hadamard product, indicator function and argmax function. Our design of secure indicator function based on a novel approach that uses secure Relu function available in the baseline MOTION2NX implementation. The secure indicator function is used, in turn, as a building block for a novel implementation of secure argmax. Secondly, we also develop a novel splitting of the computations at each CNN layer into multiple configurable chunks thereby resulting in significant reduction in RAM usage. Thirdly, we adapt an existing Helper node algorithm, working in tandem with the ABY2.0 protocol, for efficient convolution computation. This algorithm not only reduces execution time but also reduces the RAM usage required to execute CNN models, but comes at a cost of an additional compute server. Moreover, the ideas presented in this paper can also be applied to secure neural network training.</description>

      <title>Outside the Comfort Zone: Analysing LLM Capabilities in Software Vulnerability Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The significant increase in software production driven by automation and faster development lifecycles has resulted in a corresponding surge in software vulnerabilities. In parallel, the evolving landscape of software vulnerability detection, highlighting the shift from traditional methods to machine learning and large language models (LLMs), provides massive opportunities at the cost of resource-demanding computations. This paper thoroughly analyses LLMs' capabilities in detecting vulnerabilities within source code by testing models beyond their usual applications to study their potential in cybersecurity tasks. We evaluate the performance of six open-source models that are specifically trained for vulnerability detection against six general-purpose LLMs, three of which were further fine-tuned on a dataset that we compiled. Our dataset, alongside five state-of-the-art benchmark datasets, were used to create a pipeline to leverage a binary classification task, namely classifying code into vulnerable and non-vulnerable. The findings highlight significant variations in classification accuracy across benchmarks, revealing the critical influence of fine-tuning in enhancing the detection capabilities of small LLMs over their larger counterparts, yet only in the specific scenarios in which they were trained. Further experiments and analysis also underscore the issues with current benchmark datasets, particularly around mislabeling and their impact on model training and performance, which raises concerns about the current state of practice. We also discuss the road ahead in the field suggesting strategies for improved model training and dataset curation.</description>

      <title>CanCal: Towards Real-time and Lightweight Ransomware Detection and Response in Industrial Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ransomware attacks have emerged as one of the most significant cybersecurity threats. Despite numerous proposed detection and defense methods, existing approaches face two fundamental limitations in large-scale industrial applications: intolerable system overheads and notorious alert fatigue. To address these challenges, we propose CanCal, a real-time and lightweight ransomware detection system. Specifically, CanCal selectively filters suspicious processes by the monitoring layers and then performs in-depth behavioral analysis to isolate ransomware activities from benign operations, minimizing alert fatigue while ensuring lightweight computational and storage overhead. The experimental results on a large-scale industrial environment~(1,761 ransomware, ~3 million events, continuous test over 5 months) indicate that CanCal is as effective as state-of-the-art techniques while enabling rapid inference within 30ms and real-time response within a maximum of 3 seconds. CanCal dramatically reduces average CPU utilization by 91.04% (from 6.7% to 0.6%) and peak CPU utilization by 76.69% (from 26.6% to 6.2%), while avoiding 76.50% (from 3,192 to 750) of the inspection efforts from security analysts. By the time of this writing, CanCal has been integrated into a commercial product and successfully deployed on 3.32 million endpoints for over a year. From March 2023 to April 2024, CanCal successfully detected and thwarted 61 ransomware attacks, demonstrating the effectiveness of CanCal in combating sophisticated ransomware threats in real-world scenarios.</description>

Abstract: Cyber attacks leveraging or targeting the software supply chain, such as the SolarWinds and the Log4j incidents, affected thousands of businesses and their customers, drawing attention from both industry and government stakeholders. To foster open dialogue, facilitate mutual sharing, and discuss shared challenges encountered by stakeholders in securing their software supply chain, researchers from the NSF-supported Secure Software Supply Chain Center (S3C2) organize Secure Supply Chain Summits with stakeholders. This paper summarizes the Industry Secure Supply Chain Summit held on November 16, 2023, which consisted of \panels{} panel discussions with a diverse set of \participants{} practitioners from the industry. The individual panels were framed with open-ended questions and included the topics of Software Bills of Materials (SBOMs), vulnerable dependencies, malicious commits, build and deploy infrastructure, reducing entire classes of vulnerabilities at scale, and supporting a company culture conductive to securing the software supply chain. The goal of this summit was to enable open discussions, mutual sharing, and shedding light on common challenges that industry practitioners with practical experience face when securing their software supply chain.</description>

      <title>Android Malware Detection Based on RGB Images and Multi-feature Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the widespread adoption of smartphones, Android malware has become a significant challenge in the field of mobile device security. Current Android malware detection methods often rely on feature engineering to construct dynamic or static features, which are then used for learning. However, static feature-based methods struggle to counter code obfuscation, packing, and signing techniques, while dynamic feature-based methods involve time-consuming feature extraction. Image-based methods for Android malware detection offer better resilience against malware variants and polymorphic malware. This paper proposes an end-to-end Android malware detection technique based on RGB images and multi-feature fusion. The approach involves extracting Dalvik Executable (DEX) files, AndroidManifest.xml files, and API calls from APK files, converting them into grayscale images, and enhancing their texture features using Canny edge detection, histogram equalization, and adaptive thresholding techniques. These grayscale images are then combined into an RGB image containing multi-feature fusion information, which is analyzed using mainstream image classification models for Android malware detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method effectively captures Android malware characteristics, achieving an accuracy of up to 97.25%, outperforming existing detection methods that rely solely on DEX files as classification features. Additionally, ablation experiments confirm the effectiveness of using the three key files for feature representation in the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>ARINC 429 Cyber-vulnerabilities and Voltage Data in a Hardware-in-the-Loop Simulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: ARINC 429 is a ubiquitous data bus for civil avionics, enabling reliable communication between devices from disparate manufacturers. However, ARINC 429 lacks any form of encryption or authentication, making it an inherently insecure communication protocol and rendering any connected avionics vulnerable to a range of attacks. We constructed a hardware-in-the-loop simulator with ARINC 429 buses, explored these vulnerabilities, and identified their potential to deny, degrade, or disrupt aircraft capabilities. We performed a denial-of-service attack against a multi-function display via a compromised ARINC 429 bus using commercially available tools, which succeeded in disabling important navigational aids. This proven attack on physical avionics illustrates the risk inherent in ARINC 429 and the need for the ability to detect these attacks. One potential mitigation is an intrusion detection system (IDS) trained on data collected from the electrical properties of the physical bus. Although previous research has demonstrated the feasibility of an IDS on an ARINC 429 bus, no IDS has been trained on data generated by avionics hardware. To facilitate this, we recorded voltage traces and message history generated by avionics and adversarial devices on the ARINC 429 bus. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first publicly available collection of hardware-generated ARINC 429 signal data.</description>

      <title>Meta-Learning for Federated Face Recognition in Imbalanced Data Regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16003v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The growing privacy concerns surrounding face image data demand new techniques that can guarantee user privacy. One such face recognition technique that claims to achieve better user privacy is Federated Face Recognition (FRR), a subfield of Federated Learning (FL). However, FFR faces challenges due to the heterogeneity of the data, given the large number of classes that need to be handled. To overcome this problem, solutions are sought in the field of personalized FL. This work introduces three new data partitions based on the CelebA dataset, each with a different form of data heterogeneity. It also proposes Hessian-Free Model Agnostic Meta-Learning (HF-MAML) in an FFR setting. We show that HF-MAML scores higher in verification tests than current FFR models on three different CelebA data partitions. In particular, the verification scores improve the most in heterogeneous data partitions. To balance personalization with the development of an effective global model, an embedding regularization term is introduced for the loss function. This term can be combined with HF-MAML and is shown to increase global model verification performance. Lastly, this work performs a fairness analysis, showing that HF-MAML and its embedding regularization extension can improve fairness by reducing the standard deviation over the client evaluation scores.</description>

      <title>Improving Lagarias-Odlyzko Algorithm For Average-Case Subset Sum: Modular Arithmetic Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lagarias and Odlyzko (J.~ACM~1985) proposed a polynomial time algorithm for solving ``\emph{almost all}'' instances of the Subset Sum problem with $n$ integers of size $\Omega(\Gamma_{\text{LO}})$, where $\log_2(\Gamma_{\text{LO}}) &gt; n^2 \log_2(\gamma)$ and $\gamma$ is a parameter of the lattice basis reduction ($\gamma &gt; \sqrt{4/3}$ for LLL). The algorithm of Lagarias and Odlyzko is a cornerstone result in cryptography. However, the theoretical guarantee on the density of feasible instances has remained unimproved for almost 40 years.
  In this paper, we propose an algorithm to solve ``almost all'' instances of Subset Sum with integers of size $\Omega(\sqrt{\Gamma_{\text{LO}}})$ after a single call to the lattice reduction. Additionally, our argument allows us to solve the Subset Sum problem for multiple targets while the previous approach could only answer one target per call to lattice basis reduction. We introduce a modular arithmetic approach to the Subset Sum problem. The idea is to use the lattice reduction to solve a linear system modulo a suitably large prime. We show that density guarantees can be improved, by analysing the lengths of the LLL reduced basis vectors, of both the primal and the dual lattices simultaneously.</description>

      <title>DetectBERT: Towards Full App-Level Representation Learning to Detect Android Malware</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16353v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in ML and DL have significantly improved Android malware detection, yet many methodologies still rely on basic static analysis, bytecode, or function call graphs that often fail to capture complex malicious behaviors. DexBERT, a pre-trained BERT-like model tailored for Android representation learning, enriches class-level representations by analyzing Smali code extracted from APKs. However, its functionality is constrained by its inability to process multiple Smali classes simultaneously. This paper introduces DetectBERT, which integrates correlated Multiple Instance Learning (c-MIL) with DexBERT to handle the high dimensionality and variability of Android malware, enabling effective app-level detection. By treating class-level features as instances within MIL bags, DetectBERT aggregates these into a comprehensive app-level representation. Our evaluation demonstrates that DetectBERT not only surpasses existing state-of-the-art detection methods but also adapts to evolving malware threats. Moreover, the versatility of the DetectBERT framework holds promising potential for broader applications in app-level analysis and other software engineering tasks, offering new avenues for research and development.</description>

      <title>Quantum Sieving for Code-Based Cryptanalysis and Its Limitations for ISD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sieving using near-neighbor search techniques is a well-known method in lattice-based cryptanalysis, yielding the current best runtime for the shortest vector problem in both the classical [BDGL16] and quantum [BCSS23] setting. Recently, sieving has also become an important tool in code-based cryptanalysis. Specifically, using a sieving subroutine, [GJN23, DEEK24] presented a variant of the information-set decoding (ISD) framework, which is commonly used for attacking cryptographically relevant instances of the decoding problem. The resulting sieving-based ISD framework yields complexities close to the best-performing classical algorithms for the decoding problem such as [BJMM12, BM18]. It is therefore natural to ask how well quantum versions perform. In this work, we introduce the first quantum algorithms for code sieving by designing quantum variants of the aforementioned sieving subroutine. In particular, using quantum-walk techniques, we provide a speed-up over the best known classical algorithm from [DEEK24] and over a variant using Grover's algorithm [Gro96]. Our quantum-walk algorithm exploits the structure of the underlying search problem by adding a layer of locality-sensitive filtering, inspired by the quantum-walk algorithm for lattice sieving from [CL21]. We complement our asymptotic analysis of the quantum algorithms with numerical results, and observe that our quantum speed-ups for code sieving behave similarly as those observed in lattice sieving. In addition, we show that a natural quantum analog of the sieving-based ISD framework does not provide any speed-up over the first presented quantum ISD algorithm [Ber10]. Our analysis highlights that the framework should be adapted in order to outperform the state-of-the-art of quantum ISD algorithms [KT17, Kir18].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16508v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We tackle three optimization problems in which a colored graph, where each node is assigned a color, must be partitioned into colorful connected components. A component is defined as colorful if each color appears at most once. The problems differ in the objective function, which determines which partition is the best one. These problems have applications in community detection, cybersecurity, and bioinformatics. We present integer non-linear formulations, which are then linearized using standard techniques. To solve these formulations, we develop exact branch-and-cut algorithms, embedding various improving techniques, such as valid inequalities, bounds limiting the number of variables, and warm-start and preprocessing techniques. Extensive computational tests on benchmark instances demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed procedures. The branch-and-cut algorithms can solve reasonably sized instances efficiently. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to propose an exact algorithm for solving these problems.</description>

      <title>FastForensics: Efficient Two-Stream Design for Real-Time Image Manipulation Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the rise in popularity of portable devices, the spread of falsified media on social platforms has become rampant. This necessitates the timely identification of authentic content. However, most advanced detection methods are computationally heavy, hindering their real-time application. In this paper, we describe an efficient two-stream architecture for real-time image manipulation detection. Our method consists of two-stream branches targeting the cognitive and inspective perspectives. In the cognitive branch, we propose efficient wavelet-guided Transformer blocks to capture the global manipulation traces related to frequency. This block contains an interactive wavelet-guided self-attention module that integrates wavelet transformation with efficient attention design, interacting with the knowledge from the inspective branch. The inspective branch consists of simple convolutions that capture fine-grained traces and interact bidirectionally with Transformer blocks to provide mutual support. Our method is lightweight ($\sim$ 8M) but achieves competitive performance compared to many other counterparts, demonstrating its efficacy in image manipulation detection and its potential for portable integration.</description>

      <title>RLCP: A Reinforcement Learning-based Copyright Protection Method for Text-to-Image Diffusion Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16634v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing sophistication of text-to-image generative models has led to complex challenges in defining and enforcing copyright infringement criteria and protection. Existing methods, such as watermarking and dataset deduplication, fail to provide comprehensive solutions due to the lack of standardized metrics and the inherent complexity of addressing copyright infringement in diffusion models. To deal with these challenges, we propose a Reinforcement Learning-based Copyright Protection(RLCP) method for Text-to-Image Diffusion Model, which minimizes the generation of copyright-infringing content while maintaining the quality of the model-generated dataset. Our approach begins with the introduction of a novel copyright metric grounded in copyright law and court precedents on infringement. We then utilize the Denoising Diffusion Policy Optimization (DDPO) framework to guide the model through a multi-step decision-making process, optimizing it using a reward function that incorporates our proposed copyright metric. Additionally, we employ KL divergence as a regularization term to mitigate some failure modes and stabilize RL fine-tuning. Experiments conducted on 3 mixed datasets of copyright and non-copyright images demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces copyright infringement risk while maintaining image quality.</description>

      <title>PromptSmooth: Certifying Robustness of Medical Vision-Language Models via Prompt Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16769v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Medical vision-language models (Med-VLMs) trained on large datasets of medical image-text pairs and later fine-tuned for specific tasks have emerged as a mainstream paradigm in medical image analysis. However, recent studies have highlighted the susceptibility of these Med-VLMs to adversarial attacks, raising concerns about their safety and robustness. Randomized smoothing is a well-known technique for turning any classifier into a model that is certifiably robust to adversarial perturbations. However, this approach requires retraining the Med-VLM-based classifier so that it classifies well under Gaussian noise, which is often infeasible in practice. In this paper, we propose a novel framework called PromptSmooth to achieve efficient certified robustness of Med-VLMs by leveraging the concept of prompt learning. Given any pre-trained Med-VLM, PromptSmooth adapts it to handle Gaussian noise by learning textual prompts in a zero-shot or few-shot manner, achieving a delicate balance between accuracy and robustness, while minimizing the computational overhead. Moreover, PromptSmooth requires only a single model to handle multiple noise levels, which substantially reduces the computational cost compared to traditional methods that rely on training a separate model for each noise level. Comprehensive experiments based on three Med-VLMs and across six downstream datasets of various imaging modalities demonstrate the efficacy of PromptSmooth. Our code and models are available at https://github.com/nhussein/promptsmooth.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11977v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Firmware corpora for vulnerability research should be scientifically sound. Yet, several practical challenges complicate the creation of sound corpora: Sample acquisition, e.g., is hard and one must overcome the barrier of proprietary or encrypted data. As image contents are unknown prior analysis, it is hard to select high-quality samples that can satisfy scientific demands. Ideally, we help each other out by sharing data. But here, sharing is problematic due to copyright laws. Instead, papers must carefully document each step of corpus creation: If a step is unclear, replicability is jeopardized. This has cascading effects on result verifiability, representativeness, and, thus, soundness.
  Despite all challenges, how can we maintain the soundness of firmware corpora? This paper thoroughly analyzes the problem space and investigates its impact on research: We distill practical binary analysis challenges that significantly influence corpus creation. We use these insights to derive guidelines that help researchers to nurture corpus replicability and representativeness. We apply them to 44 top tier papers and systematically analyze scientific corpus creation practices. Our comprehensive analysis confirms that there is currently no common ground in related work. It shows the added value of our guidelines, as they discover methodical issues in corpus creation and unveil miniscule step stones in documentation. These blur visions on representativeness, hinder replicability, and, thus, negatively impact the soundness of otherwise excellent work.
  Finally, we show the feasibility of our guidelines and build a new, replicable corpus for large-scale analyses on Linux firmware: LFwC. We share rich meta data for good (and proven) replicability. We verify unpacking, deduplicate, identify contents, provide ground truth, and show LFwC's utility for research.</description>

      <title>A Proactive Decoy Selection Scheme for Cyber Deception using MITRE ATT&amp;CK</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12783v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cyber deception allows compensating the late response of defenders countermeasures to the ever evolving tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) of attackers. This proactive defense strategy employs decoys resembling legitimate system components to lure stealthy attackers within the defender environment, slowing and/or denying the accomplishment of their goals. In this regard, the selection of decoys that can expose the techniques used by malicious users plays a central role to incentivize their engagement. However, this is a difficult task to achieve in practice, since it requires an accurate and realistic modeling of the attacker capabilities and his possible targets. In this work, we tackle this challenge and we design a decoy selection scheme that is supported by an adversarial modeling based on empirical observation of real-world attackers. We take advantage of a domain-specific threat modelling language using MITRE ATT&amp;CK framework as source of attacker TTPs targeting enterprise systems. In detail, we extract the information about the execution preconditions of each technique as well as its possible effects on the environment to generate attack graphs modeling the adversary capabilities. Based on this, we formulate a graph partition problem that minimizes the number of decoys detecting a corresponding number of techniques employed in various attack paths directed to specific targets. We compare our optimization-based decoy selection approach against several benchmark schemes that ignore the preconditions between the various attack steps. Results reveal that the proposed scheme provides the highest interception rate of attack paths using the lowest amount of decoys.</description>

      <title>The Dark Side of Function Calling: Pathways to Jailbreaking Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17915v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, but their power comes with significant security considerations. While extensive research has been conducted on the safety of LLMs in chat mode, the security implications of their function calling feature have been largely overlooked. This paper uncovers a critical vulnerability in the function calling process of LLMs, introducing a novel "jailbreak function" attack method that exploits alignment discrepancies, user coercion, and the absence of rigorous safety filters. Our empirical study, conducted on six state-of-the-art LLMs including GPT-4o, Claude-3.5-Sonnet, and Gemini-1.5-pro, reveals an alarming average success rate of over 90\% for this attack. We provide a comprehensive analysis of why function calls are susceptible to such attacks and propose defensive strategies, including the use of defensive prompts. Our findings highlight the urgent need for enhanced security measures in the function calling capabilities of LLMs, contributing to the field of AI safety by identifying a previously unexplored risk, designing an effective attack method, and suggesting practical defensive measures.

      <title>On Feasibility of Intent Obfuscating Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02674v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Intent obfuscation is a common tactic in adversarial situations, enabling the attacker to both manipulate the target system and avoid culpability. Surprisingly, it has rarely been implemented in adversarial attacks on machine learning systems. We are the first to propose using intent obfuscation to generate adversarial examples for object detectors: by perturbing another non-overlapping object to disrupt the target object, the attacker hides their intended target. We conduct a randomized experiment on 5 prominent detectors -- YOLOv3, SSD, RetinaNet, Faster R-CNN, and Cascade R-CNN -- using both targeted and untargeted attacks and achieve success on all models and attacks. We analyze the success factors characterizing intent obfuscating attacks, including target object confidence and perturb object sizes. We then demonstrate that the attacker can exploit these success factors to increase success rates for all models and attacks. Finally, we discuss main takeaways and legal repercussions.</description>

      <title>The Illusion of Randomness: An Empirical Analysis of Address Space Layout Randomization Implementations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15107v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) is a crucial defense mechanism employed by modern operating systems to mitigate exploitation by randomizing processes' memory layouts. However, the stark reality is that real-world implementations of ASLR are imperfect and subject to weaknesses that attackers can exploit. This work evaluates the effectiveness of ASLR on major desktop platforms, including Linux, MacOS, and Windows, by examining the variability in the placement of memory objects across various processes, threads, and system restarts. In particular, we collect samples of memory object locations, conduct statistical analyses to measure the randomness of these placements and examine the memory layout to find any patterns among objects that could decrease this randomness. The results show that while some systems, like Linux distributions, provide robust randomization, others, like Windows and MacOS, often fail to adequately randomize key areas like executable code and libraries. Moreover, we find a significant entropy reduction in the entropy of libraries after the Linux 5.18 version and identify correlation paths that an attacker could leverage to reduce exploitation complexity significantly. Ultimately, we rank the identified weaknesses based on severity and validate our entropy estimates with a proof-of-concept attack. In brief, this paper provides the first comprehensive evaluation of ASLR effectiveness across different operating systems and highlights opportunities for Operating System (OS) vendors to strengthen ASLR implementations.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Intrusion Detection in IoT Environments: An Advanced Ensemble Approach Using Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15886v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, the evolution of machine learning techniques has significantly impacted the field of intrusion detection, particularly within the context of the Internet of Things (IoT). As IoT networks expand, the need for robust security measures to counteract potential threats has become increasingly critical. This paper introduces a hybrid Intrusion Detection System (IDS) that synergistically combines Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) with the XGBoost algorithm. Our proposed IDS leverages the unique capabilities of KANs, which utilize learnable activation functions to model complex relationships within data, alongside the powerful ensemble learning techniques of XGBoost, known for its high performance in classification tasks. This hybrid approach not only enhances the detection accuracy but also improves the interpretability of the model, making it suitable for dynamic and intricate IoT environments. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that our hybrid IDS achieves an impressive detection accuracy exceeding 99% in distinguishing between benign and malicious activities. Additionally, we were able to achieve F1 scores, precision, and recall that exceeded 98%. Furthermore, we conduct a comparative analysis against traditional Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) networks, assessing performance metrics such as Precision, Recall, and F1-score. The results underscore the efficacy of integrating KANs with XGBoost, highlighting the potential of this innovative approach to significantly strengthen the security framework of IoT networks.</description>

      <title>Graphical vs. Deep Generative Models: Measuring the Impact of Differentially Private Mechanisms and Budgets on Utility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.10994v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative models trained with Differential Privacy (DP) can produce synthetic data while reducing privacy risks. However, navigating their privacy-utility tradeoffs makes finding the best models for specific settings/tasks challenging. This paper bridges this gap by profiling how DP generative models for tabular data distribute privacy budgets across rows and columns, which is one of the primary sources of utility degradation. We compare graphical and deep generative models, focusing on the key factors contributing to how privacy budgets are spent, i.e., underlying modeling techniques, DP mechanisms, and data dimensionality.
  Through our measurement study, we shed light on the characteristics that make different models suitable for various settings and tasks. For instance, we find that graphical models distribute privacy budgets horizontally and thus cannot handle relatively wide datasets for a fixed training time; also, the performance on the task they were optimized for monotonically increases with more data but could also overfit. Deep generative models spend their budgets per iteration, so their behavior is less predictable with varying dataset dimensions, but are more flexible as they could perform better if trained on more features. Moreover, low levels of privacy ($\epsilon\geq100$) could help some models generalize, achieving better results than without applying DP. We believe our work will aid the deployment of DP synthetic data techniques by navigating through the best candidate models vis-a-vis the dataset features, desired privacy levels, and downstream tasks.</description>

      <title>Novel Long Distance Free Space Quantum Secure Direct Communication for Web 3.0 Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09108v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the advent of Web 3.0, the swift advancement of technology confronts an imminent threat from quantum computing. Security protocols safeguarding the integrity of Web 2.0 and Web 3.0 are growing more susceptible to both quantum attacks and sophisticated classical threats. The article introduces our novel long-distance free-space quantum secure direct communication (LF QSDC) as a method to safeguard against security breaches in both quantum and classical contexts. Differing from techniques like quantum key distribution (QKD), LF QSDC surpasses constraints by facilitating encrypted data transmission sans key exchanges, thus diminishing the inherent weaknesses of key-based systems. The distinctiveness of this attribute, coupled with its quantum mechanics base, protects against quantum computer assaults and advanced non-quantum dangers, harmonizing seamlessly with the untrustworthy tenets of the Web 3.0 age. The focus of our study is the technical design and incorporation of LF QSDC into web 3.0 network infrastructures, highlighting its efficacy for extended-range communication. LF QSDC is based on the memory DL04 protocol and enhanced with our novel Quantum-Aware Low-Density Parity Check (LDPC), Pointing, Acquisition, and Tracking (PAT) technologies, and Atmospheric Quantum Correction Algorithm (AQCA). Utilizing this method not only bolsters the security of worldwide Web 3.0 networks but also guarantees their endurance in a time when quantum and sophisticated classical threats exist simultaneously. Consequently, LF QSDC stands out as a robust security solution, well-suited for Web 3.0 systems amidst the constantly evolving digital environment.</description>
