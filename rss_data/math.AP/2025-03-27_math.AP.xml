      <title>Global Well-Posedness for the 3D Navier-Stokes Equations under Logarithmically Improved Criteria: Connections to Turbulence Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel class of initial data for which the three-dimensional incompressible Navier--Stokes equations yield unique global-in-time solutions. Building on a logarithmically improved regularity criterion, we impose a logarithmically subcritical condition on the initial data. Specifically, if \[ u_0 \in L^2(\mathbb{R}^3) \quad \text{and} \quad \|(-\Delta)^{s/2}u_0\|_{L^q(\mathbb{R}^3)} \le \frac{C_0}{\Bigl(1+\log\bigl(e+\|u_0\|_{\dot{H}^s}\bigr)\Bigr)^{\delta}}, \] for some $s \in (1/2,1)$ under appropriate scaling, then the corresponding solution exists globally and is unique. The proof employs refined commutator estimates for the fractional Laplacian together with new energy methods that exploit this logarithmic improvement to prevent singularity formation.
  Furthermore, we establish links between these improved criteria and turbulence theory. We derive precise relationships connecting the regularity conditions with turbulent intermittency, showing that the logarithmic enhancements correspond to anomalous scaling exponents in the turbulent energy spectrum. Additionally, we characterize the local structure of potential singularities and provide tight bounds on the energy flux in turbulent cascades. This approach bridges the gap between subcritical and critical regularity for the Navier--Stokes equations and offers a robust mathematical foundation for key phenomena observed in turbulence.</description>

      <title>Diffusion-aggregation equations and volume-preserving mean curvature flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Patlak-Keller-Segel system of equations (PKS) is a classical example of aggregation-diffusion equation. It describes the aggregation of some organisms via chemotaxis, limited by some nonlinear diffusion. It is known that for some choice of this nonlinear diffusion, the PKS model asymptotically leads to phase separation and mean-curvature driven free boundary problems. In this paper, we focus on the Elliptic-Parabolic PKS model and we obtain the first unconditional convergence result in dimension $2$ and $3$ towards the volume preserving mean-curvature flow. This work builds up on previous results that were obtained under the assumption that phase separation does not cause energy loss in the limit. In order to avoid this assumption, we rely on Brakke type formulation of the mean-curvature flow and a reinterpretation of the problem as an Allen-Cahn equation with a nonlocal forcing term.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic evaluation of three-dimensional integrals with singularities in application to wave phenomena</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a three-dimensional Fourier integral in which the exponent in the exponential factor is the product of some phase function and a large parameter. The asymptotics of this integral is sought when the large parameter tends to infinity. In the one-dimensional case, the asymptotics of such an integral is constructed by the points of stationary phase and singularities of the integrand. The three-dimensional case is more complicated: special points such as points of stationary phase in the domain, on singularity, on the crossing of singularities, points of triple crossing of singularities, and also conical points of the singularities, can contribute to the asymptotics. For all these types of singularities, topological conditions for the existence of nonzero asymptotics are constructed, and the asymptotics themselves are derived. The proposed technique is tested on the example of the classical problem of Kelvin waves on the surface of a deep fluid behind a towed body.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear asymptotic stability of 2D Taylor-Couette flow in the exterior disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the asymptotic stability of the 2D Taylor-Couette flow in the exterior disk, with a small kinematic viscosity $\nu \ll 1$ and a large rotation coefficient $|B|$. Due to the degeneracy of the Taylor-Couette flow at infinity, we cannot expect the solution to decay exponentially in a space-time decoupled manner. As stated in previous work \cite{LZZ-25}, even space-time coupled exponential decay can not be expected, and at most, we can obtain space-time coupled polynomial decay. To handle the space-time coupled decay multiplier, the previous time-independent resolvent estimate methods no longer work. Therefore, this paper introduces time-dependent resolvent estimates to deal with the space-time coupled decay multiplier $\Lambda_k$. We remark that the choice of $\Lambda_k$ is not unique, here we just provide one way to construct it. Finally, as an application, we derive a transition threshold bound of $\frac12$, which is the same as that for the Taylor-Couette flow in the bounded region.</description>

      <title>Critical fractional Kirchhoff problems: Uniqueness and Nondegeneracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the following critical fractional Kirchhoff equation \begin{equation*} \Big(a+b{\int_{\mathbb{R}^{N}}}|(-\Delta)^{\frac{s}{2}}u|^2dx\Big)(-\Delta)^su=|u|^{2^*_s-2}u,\quad \text{in}\ \mathbb{R}^{N}, \end{equation*} where $a,b&gt;0$, $\frac{N}{4}&lt;s&lt;1$, $2^*_s=\frac{2N}{N-2s}$ and $(-\Delta )^s$ is the fractional Laplacian. We prove the uniqueness and nondegeneracy of positive solutions to the problem, which can be used to study the singular perturbation problems concerning fractional Kirchhoff equations.</description>

      <title>Mass concentration of minimizers for $L^2$-subcritical Kirchhoff energy functional in bounded domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We are concerned with $L^2$-constraint minimizers for the Kirchhoff functional $$ E_b(u)=\int_{\Omega}|\nabla u|^2\mathrm{d}x+\frac{b}{2}\left(\int_\Omega|\nabla u|^2\mathrm{d}x\right)^2+\int_\Omega V(x)u^2\mathrm{d}x-\frac{\beta}{2}\int_{\Omega}|u|^4\mathrm{d}x, $$ where $b&gt;0$, $\beta&gt;0$ and $V(x)$ is a trapping potential in a bounded domain $\Omega$ of $\mathbb R^2$. As is well known that minimizers exist for any $b&gt;0$ and $\beta&gt;0$, while the minimizers do not exist for $b=0$ and $\beta\geq\beta^*$, where $\beta^*=\int_{\mathbb R^2}|Q|^2\mathrm{d}x$ and $Q$ is the unique positive solution of $-\Delta u+u-u^3=0$ in $\mathbb R^2$. In this paper, we show that for $\beta=\beta^*$, the energy converges to 0, but for $\beta&gt;\beta^*$, the minimal energy will diverge to $-\infty$ as $b\searrow0$. Further, we give the refined limit behaviors and energy estimates of minimizers as $b\searrow0$ for $\beta=\beta^*$ or $\beta&gt;\beta^*$. For both cases, we obtain that the mass of minimizers concentrates either at an inner point or near the boundary of $\Omega$, depending on whether $V(x)$ attains its flattest global minimum at an inner point of $\Omega$ or not. Meanwhile, we find an interesting phenomenon that the blow-up rate when the minimizers concentrate near the boundary of $\Omega$ is faster than concentration at an interior point if $\beta=\beta^*$, but the blow-up rates remain consistent if $\beta&gt;\beta^*$.</description>

      <title>Maximal turbulence as a selection criterion for measure-valued solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quest for a good solution concept for the partial differential equations (PDEs) arising in mathematical fluid dynamics is an outstanding open problem. An important notion of solutions are the measure-valued solutions. It is well known that for many PDEs there exists a multitude of measure-valued solutions even if admissibility criteria like an energy inequality are imposed. Hence in recent years, people have tried to select the relevant solutions among all admissible measure-valued solutions or at least to rule out some solutions which are not relevant.
  In this paper another such criterion is studied. In particular, we aim to select generalized Young measures which are ``maximally turbulent''. To this end, we look for maximizers of a certain functional, namely the variance, or more precisely, the Jensen defect of the energy. We prove existence of such a maximizer and we show that its mean value and total energy is uniquely determined. Our theory is carried out in a very general setting which may be applied in many situations where maximally turbulent measures shall be selected among a set of generalized Young measures.
  Finally, we apply this general framework to the incompressible and the isentropic compressible Euler equation. Our criterion of maximal turbulence is plausible and leads to existence and uniqueness in a certain sense (in particular, the mean value and the total energy of different maximally turbulent solutions coincide).</description>

      <title>A simple proof of reverse Sobolev inequalities on the sphere and Sobolev trace inequalities on the unit ball</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Frank et al. (J. Funct. Anal., 2022) stated that there is no relation between the reversed Hardy-Littlewood-Sobolev (HLS) inequalities and reverse Sobolev inequalities. However, we demonstrate that reverse Sobolev inequalities of order $\gamma\in(\frac{n}{2},\frac{n}{2}+1)$ on the $n$-sphere can be readily derived from the reversed HLS inequalities. For the case $\gamma\in(\frac{n}{2}+1,\frac{n}{2}+2)$, we present a simple proof of reverse Sobolev inequalities by using the center of mass condition introduced by Hang. In addition, applying this approach, we establish the quantitative stability of reverse Sobolev inequalities of order $\gamma\in(\frac{n}{2}+1,\frac{n}{2}+2)$ with explicit lower bounds. Finally, by using conformally covariant boundary operators and reverse Sobolev inequalities, we derive Sobolev trace inequalities on the unit ball.</description>

      <title>Entropy Production in General Balance Laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a general scalar balance law, i.e., in several space dimensions and with flux and source both space and time dependent, we focus on the functional properties of the entropy production. We apply this operator to entropy solutions, to distributional solutions or to merely L $\infty$ functions. Proving its analytical properties naturally leads to the projective tensor product of C 1 spaces and to further natural extensions to space and time dependent or complex valued ''entropies''. Besides various qualitative properties, this extended framework allows to obtain new quantitative formulae -also by means of Fourier transforms -that provide different representations of the entropy production. Remarkably, this operator also furnishes a faithful representation of any L $\infty$ function.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we focus on the existence of propagation fronts, solutions to non-local dispersion reaction models. Our aim is to provide a unified proof of this existence in a very broad framework using simple real analysis tools. In particular, we review the results that already exist in the literature and complete the table. It appears that the most important case is that of a bistable nonlinearity, which we then extend to other classical nonlinearities.</description>

      <title>Periodic KPP equations: new insights into persistence, spreading, and the role of advection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We focus on the persistence and spreading properties for a heterogeneous Fisher-KPP equation with advection. After reviewing the different notions of persistence and spreading speeds, we focus on the effect of the direction of the advection term, denoted by $b$. First, we prove that changing $b$ to $-b$ can have an effect on the spreading speeds and the ability of persistence. Next, we provide a class of relationships between the intrinsic growth term $r$ and the advection term $b$ such that changing $b$ to $-b$ does not change the spreading speeds and the ability of persistence. We briefly mention the cases of slowly and rapidly varying environments, and bounded domains. Lastly, we show that in general, the spreading speeds are not controlled by the ability of persistence, and conversely. However, when there is no advection term, the spreading speeds are controlled by the ability of persistence,  though the converse still does not hold.</description>

      <title>The square sticky disk: crystallization and Gamma-convergence to the octagonal anisotropic perimeter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a variant of the sticky disk energy where distances between particles are evaluated through the sup norm $\lVert\cdot\rVert_\infty$ in the plane. We first prove crystallization of minimizers in the square lattice, for any fixed number $N$ of particles. Then we consider the limit as $N\to\infty$: in contrast to the standard sticky disk, there is only one orientation in the limit, and we are able to compute explicitly the $\Gamma$-limit to be an anisotropic perimeter with octagonal Wulff shape. The results are based on an energy decomposition for graphs that generalizes the one proved by De Luca-Friesecke [J. Nonlinear Sci. 28 (2018), 69-90] in the triangular case.</description>

      <title>The regularity problem with a weaker condition on only the transversal direction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study an elliptic operator $L:=\mathrm{div}(A\nabla \cdot)$ on the upper half space. It is known that if the matrix $A$ is independent in the transversal $t$-direction, then the regularity boundary value problem is solvable with data in a Sobolev space. In the present paper we improve on the $t$-independence condition by introducing a mixed $L^1-L^\infty$ condition that only depends on $\partial_t A$, the derivative of $A$ in transversal direction. This condition is different from other conditions in the literature and has already been proven to imply solvability of the Dirichlet boundary value problem.</description>

      <title>On the decay of mass with respect to an invariant measure for semilinear heat equations in exterior domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper concerns with the decay property of solutions to the initial-boundary value problem of the semilinear heat equation $\partial_tu-\Delta u+u^p=0$ in exterior domains $\Omega$ in $\mathbb{R}^N$ ($N\geq 2$). The problem for the one-dimensional case is formulated with $\Omega=(0,\infty)$ which is one of the representative of the connected components in $\mathbb{R}$. One can see that the $C_0$-semigroup for the corresponding linear problem possesses an invariant measure $\phi(x)\,dx$, where $\phi$ is a positive harmonic function satisfying the Dirichlet boundary condition. This paper clarifies that the mass of solutions with respect to the measure $\phi(x)\,dx$ vanishes as $t\to \infty$ if and only if $1&lt;p\leq \min\{2,1+\frac{2}{N}\}$. In the other case $p&gt;\min\{2,1+\frac{2}{N}\}$, we prove that all solutions are asymptotically free. The asymptotic profile is actually given by a modification with Gaussian when $N\geq 3$.</description>

      <title>Convergence of thresholding energies for anisotropic mean curvature flow on inhomogeneous obstacle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the analysis by Esedo\={g}lu and Otto (2015) of thresholding energies for the celebrated multiphase Bence-Merriman-Osher algorithm for computing mean curvature flow of interfacial networks, to the case of differing space-dependent anisotropies. In particular, we address the special setting of an obstacle problem, where anisotropic particles move on an inhomogeneous substrate. By suitable modification of the surface energies we construct an approximate energy that uses a single convolution kernel and is monotone with respect to the convolution width. This allows us to prove that the approximate energies $\Gamma$-converge to their sharp interface counterpart.</description>

Abstract: We consider the Cauchy problem for the logarithmic Schr\"odinger equation and prove uniqueness of weak $H^s(\mathbb{R}^d)$ solutions for $s\in(0,1)$, which improves on the previous uniqueness result in $H^1(\mathbb{R}^d)$. The proof is achieved by combining a nontrivial use of integral equations, local smoothing estimates, and quantitative estimates of the sublinear effect of the nonlinearity, based on the localization argument. We also study uniqueness on the torus and uniqueness of the equation perturbed by pure power nonlinearities.</description>

      <title>Carleman estimate for full-discrete approximations of the complex Ginzburg-Landau equation with dynamic boundary conditions and applications to controllability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate Carleman estimate and controllability result for the fully-discrete approximations of a one-dimensional Ginzburg-Landau equation with dynamic boundary conditions. We first establish a new discrete Carleman estimate for the corresponding adjoint system. Based on this Carleman estimate, we obtain a relaxed observability inequality for the adjoint system, and then a controllability result for the fully-discrete Ginzburg-Landau equation with dynamic boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Fast relaxation of a viscous vortex in an external flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the evolution of a concentrated vortex advected by a smooth, divergence-free velocity field in two space dimensions. In the idealized situation where the initial vorticity is a Dirac mass, we compute an approximation of the solution which accurately describes, in the regime of high Reynolds numbers, the motion of the vortex center and the deformation of the streamlines under the shear stress of the external flow. For ill-prepared initial data, corresponding to a sharply peaked Gaussian vortex, we prove relaxation to the previous solution on a time scale that is much shorter than the diffusive time, due to enhanced dissipation inside the vortex core.</description>

      <title>Elliptic boundary-value problems in some distribution spaces of generalized smoothness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We build a solvability theory of elliptic boundary-value problems in normed Sobolev spaces of generalized smoothness for any integral-exponent $p&gt;1$. The smoothness is given by a number parameter and a supplementary function parameter that varies slowly at infinity. These spaces are obtained by a combination of the methods of the complex interpolation with number parameter between Banach spaces and the quadratic interpolation with function parameter between Hilbert spaces applied to classical Sobolev spaces. We show that the spaces under study admit localization near a smooth boundary and describe their trace spaces in terms of Besov spaces with the same supplementary function parameter. We prove that a general differential elliptic problem induces Fredholm bounded operators on appropriate pairs of the spaces under study. We also find exact sufficient conditions for solutions of the problem to have a prescribed generalized or classical smoothness on a given set and establish corresponding a priory estimates of the solution. These results are specified for parameter-elliptic problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Voight regularization of the Navier--Stokes system is studied in a bounded domain and on the torus. In the 3D case we obtain new explicit bounds for the attractor dimension improving the previously known results. In the 2D case we show that the estimates so obtained converge to the known estimates for the attractor of the Navier--Stokes system as the regularization parameter tends to zero both for the Dirichlet and the periodic boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Quasi-Brittle Fracture: The Blended Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A field theory is presented for predicting damage and fracture in quasi-brittle materials. The approach taken here is new and blends a non-local constitutive law with a two-point phase field. In this formulation, the material displacement field is uniquely determined by the initial boundary value problem. The theory naturally satisfies energy balance, with positive energy dissipation rate in accord with the Clausius-Duhem inequality. Notably, these properties are not imposed but follow directly from the constitutive law and evolution equation when multiplying the equation of motion by the velocity and integrating by parts. In addition to elastic constants, the model requires at most three key material parameters: the strain at the onset of nonlinearity, the ultimate tensile strength, and the fracture toughness. The approach simplifies parameter identification while ensuring representation of material behavior. The approach seamlessly handles fracture evolution across loading regimes, from quasi-static to dynamic, accommodating both fast crack propagation and quasi-brittle failure under monotonic and cyclic loading. Numerical simulations show quantitative and qualitative agreement with experiments, including three-point bending tests on concrete. The model successfully captures the cyclic load-deflection response of crack mouth opening displacement, the structural size-effect related to ultimate load and specimen size, fracture originating from corner singularities in L- shaped domains, and bifurcating fast cracks.</description>

      <title>A Polynomial Rate of Convergence for the Dirichlet Problem on Orthodiagonal Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20284v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend recent work of Gurel-Gurevich--Jerison--Nachmias (2020) and Bou-Rabee--Gwynne (2024) by showing that as the mesh of our lattice tends to $0$, we have a polynomial rate of convergence for the Dirichlet problem on orthodiagonal maps with H\"older boundary data to its continuous counterpart.
  The key idea is that the convolution of a discrete harmonic function on an orthodiagonal map with a smooth mollifier has small Laplacian and so is ``almost harmonic." This also allows us to show that discrete harmonic functions on orthodiagonal maps are Lipschitz in the bulk on a mesoscopic scale.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we prove uniqueness for complete non-compact Ricci flow with scaling invariant curvature bound. This generalizes the earlier work of Chen-Zhu, Kotschwar and covers most of the example of Ricci flows with unbounded curvature. In dimension three, we use it to show that complete Ricci flow starting from uniformly non-collapsed, non-negatively curved manifold is unique, extending the strong uniqueness Theorem of Chen. This is based on solving Ricci-harmonic map heat flow in unbounded curvature background.</description>

Abstract: We consider inverse boundary value problems for polyharmonic operators and in particular, the problem of recovering the coefficients of terms up to order one. The main interest of our result is that it further relaxes the regularity required to establish uniqueness. The proof relies on an averaging technique introduced by Haberman and Tataru for the study of an inverse boundary value problem for a second order operator.</description>

We also derive a uniform quantitative strong unique continuation for eigenfunctions that we use to prove that two Dirichlet-Laplace-Beltrami operators are gauge equivalent whenever their corresponding metrics coincide in the vicinity of the boundary and their boundary spectral data coincide on a subset of positive measure.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.05625v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a complete local well-posedness theory in $H^s$ based Sobolev spaces for the free boundary incompressible Euler equations with zero surface tension on a connected fluid domain. Our well-posedness theory includes: (i) Local well-posedness in the Hadamard sense, i.e., local existence, uniqueness, and the first proof of continuous dependence on the data, all in low regularity Sobolev spaces; (ii) Enhanced uniqueness: Our uniqueness result holds at the level of the Lipschitz norm of the velocity and the $C^{1,\frac{1}{2}}$ regularity of the free surface; (iii) Stability bounds: We construct a nonlinear functional which measures, in a suitable sense, the distance between two solutions (even when defined on different domains) and we show that this distance is propagated by the flow; (iv) Energy estimates: We prove refined, essentially scale invariant energy estimates for solutions, relying on a newly constructed family of elliptic estimates; (v) Continuation criterion: We give the first proof of a sharp continuation criterion in the physically relevant pointwise norms, at the level of scaling. In essence, we show that solutions can be continued as long as the velocity is in $L_T^1W^{1,\infty}$ and the free surface is in $L_T^1C^{1,\frac{1}{2}}$, which is at the same level as the Beale-Kato-Majda criterion for the boundaryless case; (vi) A novel proof of the construction of regular solutions.
  Our entire approach is in the Eulerian framework and can be adapted to work in more general fluid domains.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic limits from the self-organized kinetic system for body attitude coordination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.08657v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The self-organized kinetic system for body attitude coordination (SOKB) was recently derived by Degond et al. (Math. Models Methods Appl. Sci. 27(6), 1005-1049, 2017). This system describe a new collective motion for multi-agents dynamics, where each agent is described by its position and body attitude: agents travel at a constant speed in a given direction and their body can rotate round it adopting different configurations (representing by rotation matrix in $\mathrm{SO(3)}$). In this paper, we study the hydrodynamic limit of the scaled SOKB system with the constant intensity of coordination by employing the Generalized Collision Invariants (GCI)-based Hilbert expansion approach. The limit is the self-organized hydrodynamic model for body attitude coordination (SOHB). In spherical coordinates, the SOHB system is singular. To avoid this coordinate singularity, we transfer SOHB system into a non-singular form by stereographic projection. This work provides the first analytically rigorous justification of the modeling and asymptotic analysis in Degond et al. (Math. Models Methods Appl. Sci. 27(6), 1005-1049, 2017).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18706v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the porous medium equation (PME) on complete noncompact manifolds $M$ of nonnegative Ricci curvature. We require nonparabolicity of the manifold and construct a natural space $X$ of functions, strictly larger than $L^1$, in which the Green function on $M$ appears as a weight, such that the PME admits a solution in the weak dual (i.e. potential) sense whenever the initial datum $u_0$ is nonnegative and belongs to $X$. Smoothing estimates are also proved to hold both for $L^1$ data, where they take into account the volume growth of Riemannian balls giving rise to bounds which are shown to be sharp in a suitable sense, and for data belonging to $X$ as well.</description>

      <title>Sign-changing bubbling solutions for an exponential nonlinearity in $\mathbb{R}^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07641v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Very differently from those perturbative techniques of Deng-Musso in [21], we use the assumption of a $C^1$-stable critical point to construct positive or sign-changing solutions with arbitrary $m$ isolated bubbles to the boundary value problem $-\Delta u=\lambda u|u|^{p-2}e^{|u|^p}$ under homogeneous Dirichlet boundary condition in a bounded, smooth planar domain $\Omega$, when $0&lt;p&lt;2$ and $\lambda&gt;0$ is a small but free parameter. We prove that for any $0&lt;p&lt;1$ the delicate energy expansion of these bubbling solutions always converges to $4\pi m$ from below, but for any $1&lt;p&lt;2$ the energy always converges to $4\pi m$ from above, where the latter case sharply recurs a result of De Marchis-Malchiodi-Martinazzi-Thizy in [22] involving concentration and compactness properties at any critical energy level $4\pi m$ of positive bubbling solutions. A sufficient condition on the intersection between the nodal line of these sign-changing solutions and the boundary of the domain is founded. Moreover, for $\lambda$ small enough, we prove that when $\Omega$ is an arbitrary bounded domain, this problem has not only at least two pairs of bubbling solutions which change sign exactly once and whose nodal lines intersect the boundary, but also a bubbling solution which changes sign exactly twice or three times; when $\Omega$ has an axial symmetry, this problem has a bubbling solution which alternately changes sign arbitrarily many times along the axis of symmetry through the domain.</description>

      <title>$H^2$-regularity for stationary and non-stationary Bingham problems with perfect slip boundary condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18333v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: $H^2$-spatial regularity of stationary and non-stationary problems for Bingham fluids formulated with the pseudo-stress tensor is discussed. The problem is mathematically described by an elliptic or parabolic variational inequality of the second kind, to which weak solvability in the Sobolev space $H^1$ is well known. However, higher regularity up to the boundary in a bounded smooth domain seems to remain open. This paper indeed shows such $H^2$-regularity if the problems are supplemented with the so-called perfect slip boundary condition and if the yield stress vanishes on the boundary. For the stationary Bingham--Stokes problem, the key of the proof lies in a priori estimates for a regularized problem avoiding investigation of higher pressure regularity, which seems difficult to get in the presence of a singular diffusion term. The $H^2$-regularity for the stationary case is then directly applied to establish strong solvability of the non-stationary Bingham--Navier--Stokes problem, based on discretization in time and on the truncation of the nonlinear convection term.</description>

      <title>Smoothing effects and extinction in finite time for fractional fast diffusions on Riemannian manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17126v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study nonnegative solutions to the Cauchy problem for the Fractional Fast Diffusion Equation on a suitable class of connected, noncompact Riemannian manifolds. This parabolic equation is both singular and nonlocal: the diffusion is driven by the (spectral) fractional Laplacian on the manifold, while the nonlinearity is a concave power that makes the diffusion singular, so that solutions lose mass and may extinguish in finite time. Existence of mild solutions follows by nowadays standard nonlinear semigroups techniques, and we use these solutions as the building blocks for a more general class of so-called weak dual solutions, which allow for data both in the usual $L^1$ space and in a larger weighted space, determined in terms of the fractional Green function. We focus in particular on a priori smoothing estimates (also in weighted $L^p$ spaces) for a quite large class of weak dual solutions. We also show pointwise lower bounds for solutions, showing in particular that solutions have infinite speed of propagation. Finally, we start the study of how solutions extinguish in finite time, providing suitable sharp extinction rates.</description>

      <title>Microscopic, mesoscopic, and macroscopic descriptions of the Euler alignment system with adaptive communication strength</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02409v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This is a continuation of our previous joint work on the $\st$-model in[\textit{Well-posedness and long time behavior of the Euler Alignment System with adaptive communication strength}, accepted at the Abel Symposium Proceedings, also arXiv:2310.00269, 2023]. The $\st$-model, introduced by the first author in [\textit{Environmental averaging}. EMS Surv. Math. Sci., 11 (2024), no. 2, 277413],is an alignment model with the property that the strength of the alignment force, $\st$, is transported along an averaged velocity field. The transport of the strength is designed so that it admits an $e$-quantity, $e = \partial_x u + \st$, which controls regularity in 1D similarly to the classical Cucker-Smale case. The utility of the $\st$-model is that it has the versatility to behave qualitatively like the Motsch-Tadmor model, for which global regularity theory is not known.
  This paper aims to put the $\st$-model on firmer physical grounds by formulating and justifying the microscopic and mesoscopic descriptions from which it arises. A distinctive feature of the microscopic system is that it is a discrete-continuous system: the position and velocity of the particles are discrete objects, while the strength is an active continuum scalar function. We establish a rigorous passage from the microscopic to the mesoscopic description via the Mean Field Limit and from the mesoscopic to the macroscopic description in the monokinetic and Maxwellian limiting regimes. We also address the long-time behavior of the kinetic Fokker-Planck-Alignment equation by establishing the relaxation to the Maxwellian in 1D when the velocity averaging is given by the Favre filtration. As a supplement to the numerical results already presented in our previous work, we provide additional numerical evidence, via a particle simulation, that the $\st$-model behaves qualitatively like the Motsch-Tadmor model.</description>

      <title>Schauder Estimates for Germs by Scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01486v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this expository note, we show that the blow-up arguments of L. Simon adapt well to the corresponding Schauder theory of germs used in the study of singular SPDEs. We illustrate this through some representative examples. As in the classical PDE framework, the argument relies only on the scaling properties of the germ semi-norms and the Liouville principle for the operator.</description>

      <title>Generalized Doubly Parabolic Keller-Segel System with Fractional Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09871v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Keller-Segel model is a system of partial differential equations that describes the movement of cells or organisms in response to chemical signals, a phenomenon known as chemotaxis. In this study, we analyze a doubly parabolic Keller-Segel system in the whole space $\mathbb{R}^d$, $d\geq 2$, where both cellular and chemical diffusion are governed by fractional Laplacians with distinct exponents. This system generalizes the classical Keller-Segel model by introducing superdiffusion, a form of anomalous diffusion. This extension accounts for nonlocal diffusive effects observed in experimental settings, particularly in environments with sparse targets. We establish results on the local well-posedness of mild solutions for this generalized system and global well-posedness under smallness assumptions on the initial conditions in $L^p(\mathbb{R}^d)$. Furthermore, we characterize the asymptotic behavior of the solution.</description>

      <title>Lie Symmetry Analysis, Parametric Reduction and Conservation Laws of (3+1) Dimensional Nonlinear Dispersive Soliton Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07682v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The core focus of this research work is to obtain invariant solutions and conservation laws of the (3+1)-dimensional ZK equation which describes the phenomenon of wave stability and solitons propagation. ZK equation is significant in fluid dynamics, nonlinear optics, and acoustics. ZK equation plays an important role in understanding the behavior of nonlinear, dispersive waves especially in the presence of the magnetic field. Lie symmetry analysis has been applied to the (3+1)-dimensional ZK equation to derive invariant solutions. These solutions reveal how waves retain their shape as they travel, how they interact in space, and the impact of magnetic fields on wave propagation. Using the Lie symmetry, the (3+1) dimensional ZK equation is reduced to various ordinary differential equations. It also concludes with the conservation laws and non-linear self-adjoint ness property. Additionally, we align our findings with real-life problems, namely plasma physics, electromagnetic wave propagation, and water wave dynamics, providing the applicability of our theoretical results.</description>

      <title>On the optimal control of viscous Cahn-Hilliard systems with hyperbolic relaxation of the chemical potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15444v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study an optimal control problem for a viscous Cahn--Hilliard system with zero Neumann boundary conditions in which a hyperbolic relaxation term involving the second time derivative of the chemical potential has been added to the first equation of the system. For the initial-boundary value problem of this system, results concerning well-posedness, continuous dependence and regularity are known. We show Fr\'echet differentiability of the associated control-to-state operator, study the associated adjoint state system, and derive first-order necessary optimality conditions. Concerning the nonlinearities driving the system, we can include the case of logarithmic potentials. In addition, we perform an asymptotic analysis of the optimal control problem as the relaxation coefficient approaches zero.</description>
