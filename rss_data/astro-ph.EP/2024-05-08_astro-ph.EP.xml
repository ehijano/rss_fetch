      <title>Characterizing Exoplanetary Atmospheres: New Views on Exoplanet Composition and Chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I review the major open science questions in exoplanet atmospheres. These are mainly focused in the areas of understanding atmospheric physics, the atmosphere as a window into other realms of planetary physics, and the atmosphere is a window into understanding planet formation. For gas giant planets, high quality spectra have been delivered from JWST and from the ground, enabling the determination of atmospheric abundances. For the very common sub-Neptune planets, we are just beginning to obtain and interpret JWST spectra. For the terrestrial planets, which can be studied only around M stars, the field aims to determine if these planets even have long-lived atmospheres.</description>

      <title>A secondary atmosphere on the rocky exoplanet 55 Cancri e</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Characterizing rocky exoplanets is a central endeavor of astronomy, and yet the search for atmospheres on rocky exoplanets has hitherto resulted in either tight upper limits on the atmospheric mass or inconclusive results. The 1.95-REarth and 8.8-MEarth planet 55 Cnc e, with a predominantly rocky composition and an equilibrium temperature of ~2000 K, may have a volatile envelope (containing molecules made from a combination of C, H, O, N, S, and P elements) that accounts for up to a few percent of its radius. The planet has been observed extensively with transmission spectroscopy, and its thermal emission has been measured in broad photometric bands. These observations disfavor a primordial H2/He-dominated atmosphere but cannot conclusively determine whether the planet has a secondary atmosphere. Here we report a thermal emission spectrum of the planet obtained by JWST's NIRCam and MIRI instruments from 4 to 12 {\mu}m. The measurements rule out the scenario where the planet is a lava world shrouded by a tenuous atmosphere made of vaporized rock, and indicate a bona fide volatile atmosphere likely rich in CO2 or CO. This atmosphere can be outgassed from and sustained by a magma ocean.</description>

      <title>Potential Surface Ice Distribution on Close-in Terrestrial Exoplanets around M dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Previous studies suggested that surface ice could be distributed on close-in terrestrial exoplanets around M-dwarfs if heat redistribution on the planets is very inefficient. In general, orbital and atmospheric parameters play an important role in the climate on terrestrial planets, including the cold-trap region where the permanent surface water reservoir can potentially be distributed. Here, we develop a simple coupled land-atmosphere model to explore the potential surface ice distribution on close-in terrestrial planets with various orbital and atmospheric parameters, assuming that the planets are airless or have a thin \ce{N2} atmosphere. We find that the most significant factors in deciding the surface cold trap region are the spin-orbit ratio and obliquity. The incident stellar flux and the surface pressure play a limited role in the thin \ce{N2} simulations for incident flux smaller than Mercury's and surface pressure lower than 10$^4$ Pa. Our result illustrates the possible distribution of surface ice on arid terrestrial planets and can help to understand the climate of these exoplanets.</description>

      <title>Early and elongated epochs of planetesimal dynamo generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accreting in the first few Ma after Solar System formation, planetesimals record conditions in the protoplanetary disc and are the remnants of planetary formation processes. The meteorite paleomagnetic record carries key insights into the thermal history of planetesimals and their extent of differentiation. The current paradigm splits the paleomagnetic record into three magnetic field generation epochs: an early nebula field (&lt;5Ma after CAI formation), followed by thermal dynamos (5-34 Ma after CAI formation), then a gap in dynamo generation, before the onset of core solidification and compositional dynamos. The split between these epochs has been defined using thermal evolution and dynamo generation models of planetesimals. Here we demonstrate these epochs are not as distinct as previously thought based on our refined thermal evolution model that includes more realistic parametrisations for mantle convection, non-eutectic core solidification and radiogenic $^{60}Fe$ in the core. Inclusion of $^{60}$ in the core brings forward the onset of dynamo generation to 1-2 Ma after CAI formation, which overlaps with the existence of the nebula field. The second epoch of dynamo generation begins prior to the onset of core solidification, suggesting this epoch is not purely compositionally driven. Planetesimal radius is the dominant control on dynamo generation, and the choice of reference viscosity can widen the gap between epochs of dynamo generation from 0-200 Ma. Overall, timings of different planetesimal magnetic field generation mechanisms are more variable. This alters the information we can glean from the meteorite paleomagnetic record about the early Solar System. Evidence for the nebula field requires more careful interpretation and young paleomagnetic remanences, for example in the pallasites, may not be evidence for planetesimal core solidification.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Assisted Dynamical Classification of Trans-Neptunian Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs) are small, icy bodies in the outer solar system. They are observed to have a complex orbital distribution that was shaped by the early dynamical history and migration of the giant planets. Comparisons between the different dynamical classes of modeled and observed TNOs can help constrain the history of the outer solar system. Because of the complex dynamics of TNOs, particularly those in and near mean motion resonances with Neptune, classification has traditionally been done by human inspection of plots of the time evolution of orbital parameters. This is very inefficient. The Vera Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) is expected to increase the number of known TNOs by a factor of $\sim$10, necessitating a much more automated process. In this chapter we present an improved supervised machine learning classifier for TNOs. Using a large and diverse training set as well as carefully chosen, dynamically motivated data features calculated from numerical integrations of TNO orbits, our classifier returns results that match those of a human classifier 98% of the time, and dynamically relevant classifications 99.7% of the time. This classifier is dramatically more efficient than human classification, and it will improve classification of both observed and modeled TNO data.</description>

      <title>Detectability of Solar Panels as a Technosignature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we assess the potential detectability of solar panels made of silicon on an Earth-like exoplanet as a potential technosignature. Silicon-based photovoltaic cells have high reflectance in the UV-VIS and in the near-IR, within the wavelength range of a space-based flagship mission concept like the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO). Assuming that only solar energy is used to provide the 2022 human energy needs with a land cover of ~2.4%, and projecting the future energy demand assuming various growth-rate scenarios, we assess the detectability with an 8 m HWO-like telescope. Assuming the most favorable viewing orientation, and focusing on the strong absorption edge in the ultraviolet-to-visible (0.34 - 0.52 um), we find that several 100s of hours of observation time is needed to reach a SNR of 5 for an Earth-like planet around a Sun-like star at 10pc, even with a solar panel coverage of ~23% land coverage of a future Earth. We discuss the necessity of concepts like Kardeshev Type I/II civilizations and Dyson spheres, which would aim to harness vast amounts of energy. Even with much larger populations than today, the total energy use of human civilization would be orders of magnitude below the threshold for causing direct thermal heating or reaching the scale of a Kardashev Type I civilization. Any extraterrrestrial civilization that likewise achieves sustainable population levels may also find a limit on its need to expand, which suggests that a galaxy-spanning civilization as imagined in the Fermi paradox may not exist.</description>

      <title>Mysterious anomalies in Earth's atmosphere and strongly interacting Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04635v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has been recently argued [1-3] that there is a number of mysterious observations which are very hard to explain by conventional physics. The mysterious anomalies include (but not limited) to such unexpected correlations as temperature variation in stratosphere, the total electron content (TEC) of the Earths atmosphere, the earthquake activity from one hand, and positions of the planets from another hand. It has been hypothesized in [1-3] that the corresponding mysterious correlations is a result of the "streaming invisible matter" which suddenly become very strongly interacting material when enter the Earth's atmosphere. We propose that some of these (and many other) mysteries might be result of rare (but energetic) events when the so-called axion quark nuggets (AQN) hit the Earth. In different words, we identify "streaming invisible matter" conjectured by [1-3] with the AQNs. Therefore, we offer a specific microscopical mechanism which could shed some light on the mysterious correlations reported in [1-3]. One should emphasize that the AQN model was originally invented long ago to explain the observed similarity between the dark and the visible components in the Universe, i.e. $\Omega_{\rm DM}\sim \Omega_{\rm visible}$; it was not invented to fit the observed anomalies which represent the topic of this work. We support this proposal by demonstrating that intensity and the spectral features of the AQN induced events are consistent with the corresponding characteristics of the puzzling observations as reported in [1-3].</description>

      <title>First direct observations of interplanetary shock impact angle effects on actual geomagnetically induced currents: The case of the Finnish natural gas pipeline system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04647v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The impact of interplanetary (IP) shocks on the Earth's magnetosphere can greatly disturb the geomagnetic field and electric currents in the magnetosphere-ionosphere system. At high latitudes, the current systems most affected by the shocks are the auroral electrojet currents. These currents then generate ground geomagnetically induced currents (GICs) that couple with and are highly detrimental to ground artificial conductors including power transmission lines, oil/gas pipelines, railways, and submarine cables. Recent research has shown that the shock impact angle, the angle the shock normal vector performs with the Sun-Earth line, plays a major role in controlling the subsequent geomagnetic activity. More specifically, due to more symmetric magnetospheric compressions, nearly frontal shocks are usually more geoeffective than highly inclined shocks. In this study, we utilize a subset (332 events) of a shock list with more than 600 events to investigate, for the first time, shock impact angle effects on the subsequent GICs right after shock impact (compression effects) and several minutes after shock impact (substorm-like effects). We use GIC recordings from the Finnish natural gas pipeline performed near the M\"ants\"al\"a compression station in southern Finland. We find that GIC peaks (&gt; 5 A) occurring after shock impacts are mostly caused by nearly frontal shocks and occur in the post-noon/dusk magnetic local time sector. These GIC peaks are presumably triggered by partial ring current intensifications in the dusk sector. On the other hand, more intense GIC peaks (&gt; 20 A) generally occur several minutes after shock impacts and are located around the magnetic midnight terminator. These GIC peaks are most likely caused by intense energetic particle injections from the magnetotail which frequently occur during substorms.</description>

      <title>Astrometric and photometric characterization of $\eta$ Tel B combining two decades of observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04723v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: $\eta$ Tel is an 18 Myr system with a 2.09 M$_{\odot}$ A-type star and an M7-M8 brown dwarf companion, $\eta$ Tel B, separated by 4.2'' (208 au). High-contrast imaging campaigns over 20 years have enabled orbital and photometric characterization. $\eta$ Tel B, bright and on a wide orbit, is ideal for detailed examination.
  We analyzed three new SPHERE/IRDIS coronagraphic observations to explore $\eta$ Tel B's orbital parameters, contrast, and surroundings, aiming to detect a circumplanetary disk or close companion. Reduced IRDIS data achieved a contrast of 1.0$\times 10^{-5}$, enabling astrometric measurements with uncertainties of 4 mas in separation and 0.2 degrees in position angle, the smallest so far.
  With a contrast of 6.8 magnitudes in the H band, $\eta$ Tel B's separation and position angle were measured as 4.218'' and 167.3 degrees, respectively. Orbital analysis using Orvara code, considering Gaia-Hipparcos acceleration, revealed a low eccentric orbit (e $\sim$ 0.34), inclination of 81.9 degrees, and semi-major axis of 218 au. $\eta$ Tel B's mass was determined to be 48 \MJup, consistent with previous calculations.
  No significant residual indicating a satellite or disk around $\eta$ Tel B was detected. Detection limits ruled out massive objects around $\eta$ Tel B with masses down to 1.6 \MJup at a separation of 33 au.</description>

      <title>Synthesis and stability of biomolecules under Earth's upper mantle conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04839v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How life started on Earth is a long-time unsolved mystery. There are various hypotheses ranging from outer space to seabed. Here, we applied extensive ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations to study chemical reactions of NH3, H2O, H2, and CO at pressures (P) and temperatures (T) approximating the conditions of Earth's upper mantle (i.e. 10 - 13 GPa, 1000 -1400 K). Contrary to the previous assumption that larger organic molecules might readily dissociate in aqueous solutions at extreme P-T conditions, we found that many organic compounds formed and persisted in C-H-O-N fluids under these extreme conditions, including glycine, ribose, and uracil-like molecules. Particularly, our free energy calculations showed that the C-N bond is thermodynamically stable at 10 GPa and 1400 K. Moreover, our findings support the "RNA world" hypothesis, as we observed the exclusive formation of the 5-membered-ring form of ribose. By exploring the depths of Earth's interior, we have uncovered a previously unexplored pathway through which life may have originated. These findings have contributed to our evolving understanding of the fundamental conditions necessary for life to arise on our planet.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Life on Earth has experienced numerous upheavals over its approximately 4 billion year history. In previous work we have discussed how interruptions to stability lead, on average, to increases in habitability over time, a tendency we called Entropic Gaia. Here we continue this exploration, working with the Tangled Nature Model of co-evolution, to understand how the evolutionary history of life is shaped by periods of acute environmental stress. We find that while these periods of stress pose a risk of complete extinction, they also create opportunities for evolutionary exploration which would otherwise be impossible, leading to more populous and stable states among the survivors than in alternative histories without a stress period. We also study how the duration, repetition and number of refugia into which life escapes during the perturbation affects the final outcome. The model results are discussed in relation to both Earth history and the search for alien life.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.05310v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: HIP 65426 hosts a young giant planet that has become the first exoplanet directly imaged with JWST. Using time-series photometry from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), we classify HIP 65426 as a high-frequency $\delta$ Scuti pulsator with a possible large frequency separation of $\Delta \nu =$7.23$\pm$0.02 cycles day$^{-1}$. We check the TESS data for pulsation timing variations and use the nondetection to estimate a 95% dynamical mass upper limit of 12.8 Mjup for HIP 65426 b. We also identify a low-frequency region of signal that we interpret as stellar latitudinal differential rotation with two rapid periods of 7.85$\pm$0.08 hr and 6.67$\pm$0.04 hr. We use our TESS rotation periods together with published values of radius and $v \sin{i}$ to jointly measure the inclination of HIP 65426 to $i_{\star}=107_{-11}^{+12}$$^\circ$. Our stellar inclination is consistent with the orbital inclination of HIP 65426 b ($108_{-3}^{+6}$$^{\circ}$) at the $68\%$ percent level based on our orbit fit using published relative astrometry. The lack of significant evidence for spin-orbit misalignment in the HIP 65426 system supports an emerging trend consistent with preferential alignment between imaged long-period giant planets and their host stars.</description>

Abstract: Over the past 4 decades, the exploration of planets beyond our solar system has yielded the discovery of over 5600 exoplanets orbiting different stars. Continuous advancements in instrumentation and cutting-edge techniques empower astronomers to unveil and characterize new exoworlds with increasing frequency. Notably, direct imaging, also called high-contrast imaging (HCI), stands out as the only method capable of capturing photons emitted directly from the planetary bodies. This innovative technique proves particularly advantageous for scrutinizing nascent planetary systems, where planets shine brilliantly and emit significant heat during their initial developmental phases. HCI provides comprehensive visuals of the entire system, encompassing the central star, potential circumstellar disks, and any additional companions. However, the complexity of imaging an object 10^6 fainter than its parent star necessitates state-of-the-art instrumentation. HCI demands cutting-edge tools such as exAO systems, telescopes exceeding 8 meters in diameter, coronagraphs, and modern imagers. The pivotal role of post-processing cannot be overstated in the quest for detecting and characterizing planets through HCI. This method has not only facilitated the discovery of numerous planets but has also presented invaluable opportunities to explore the properties of young substellar companions, both planets and brown dwarfs. Insights into their interactions with parent disks or other companions within the system, the composition of their atmospheres, and the identification of still accreting planets, also known as "protoplanets," contribute significantly to our understanding of planet formation scenarios. The continued refinement of HCI promises to unveil further revelations in the captivating field of exoplanetary exploration.</description>

Abstract: Planet-forming disks turn from gas-rich, massive disks made of dust and gas into planetary systems containing only small amounts dust produced by collisions between smaller planetary objects like planetesimals, asteroids, or comets. Traditionally we talk about protoplanetary (age $\sim$1 Myr), transitional ($\sim$ 5-10 Myr), and debris disks ($\sim$ 10-hundreds of Myr), even though the overlap between these phases may be relevant. We aim to show that in the transition phase of a disk, when gas surface densities are reduced but not yet negligible, a seemingly small amount of collisional activity may lead to the production of dust on a level that is observationally relevant by creating regions of optical depth 1 or above. In particular, we aim to show that the hot dust emission component of transitional disks may in fact be debris dust produced in such collisions. We develop an analytical model to derive the conditions under which observationally relevant amounts of dust can be produced. We focus on the effect of the gas surface density during the transition phase of a disk from fully gas-dominated to the gas-poor debris stage. We show that the decrease of the gas surface density has an important effect. It allows smaller planetesimals to become collisional, starting a cascade. At the same time, small particles are not destroyed by collisions. That interrupted cascade is critical to preserve the produced dust for significant time intervals, allowing a seemingly minor amount of planetesimal collisions to be effective in producing detectable amounts of dust. The warm emission of low amounts of dust in many transitional planet-forming disks might be caused entirely by second-generation dust, exposing planetary material at a time much earlier than the age of what are traditionally considered as debris disks.</description>

Abstract: The Hayabusa 2 spacecraft sampled approximately 5.4 g of asteroid material from the Cb-type asteroid Ryugu. Initial analysis of the Ryugu materials revealed a mineralogical, chemical, and isotopic kinship to the CI chondrites. The pristine nature of Ryugu makes the returned samples ideal for constraining the composition of the Solar System. However, some elements (e.g., P, Ca, Mn, and rare earth elements) show large relative dispersions compared to the other elements in the returned materials studied so far, most likely due to the presence of aqueously formed secondary minerals (e.g., carbonates, phosphates) in Ryugu. Therefore, the estimation of the Solar System composition using currently available Ryugu data is challenging due to the so-called nugget effect of carbonates, phosphates, and possibly other accessory minerals. The nugget effect can be mitigated by analyzing a homogenized, relatively large amount of sample. We estimate that for approximately 0.1 g of Ryugu sample, the dispersion (2SD) of the bulk Mn/Cr and Rb/Sr ratios are +/-13% and +/-15%, respectively, while they will be improved to be better than +/-5% for approximately 1 g of homogenized Ryugu sample. To further constrain the Solar System composition and to evaluate if previous estimates based on CI chondrites stored in museums for decades to centuries are reliable, it is strongly recommended to determine the chemical and isotopic compositions of Ryugu using a homogenized sample prepared from relatively large (approx. 1 g) returned material. Determining Ryugu reference compositions will be used by multidisciplinary communities, including Earth and planetary sciences, astronomy, physics, and chemistry.</description>

      <title>PlatoSim: An end-to-end PLATO camera simulator for modelling high-precision space-based photometry</title>

Abstract: PLAnetary Transits and Oscillations of stars (PLATO) is the ESA M3 space mission dedicated to detect and characterise transiting exoplanets including information from the asteroseismic properties of their stellar hosts. The uninterrupted and high-precision photometry provided by space-borne instruments such as PLATO require long preparatory phases. An exhaustive list of tests are paramount to design a mission that meets the performance requirements, and as such, simulations are an indispensable tool in the mission preparation. To accommodate PLATO's need of versatile simulations prior to mission launch - that at the same time describe accurately the innovative but complex multi-telescope design - we here present the end-to-end PLATO simulator specifically developed for the purpose, namely PlatoSim. We show step-by-step the algorithms embedded into the software architecture of PlatoSim that allow the user to simulate photometric time series of CCD images and light curves in accordance to the expected observations of PLATO. In the context of the PLATO payload, a general formalism of modelling, end-to-end, incoming photons from the sky to the final measurement in digital units is discussed. We show the strong predictive power of PlatoSim through its diverse applicability and contribution to numerous working groups within the PLATO Mission Consortium. This involves the on-going mechanical integration and alignment, performance studies of the payload, the pipeline development and assessments of the scientific goals. PlatoSim is a state-of-the-art simulator that is able to produce the expected photometric observations of PLATO to a high level of accuracy. We demonstrate that PlatoSim is a key software tool for the PLATO mission in the preparatory phases until mission launch and prospectively beyond.</description>
