      <title>Quantum Hardware Roofline: Evaluating the Impact of Gate Expressivity on Quantum Processor Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The design space of current quantum computers is expansive with no obvious winning solution. This leaves practitioners with a clear question: "What is the optimal system configuration to run an algorithm?". This paper explores hardware design trade-offs across NISQ systems to guide algorithm and hardware design choices. The evaluation is driven by algorithmic workloads and algorithm fidelity models which capture architectural features such as gate expressivity, fidelity, and crosstalk. We also argue that the criteria for gate design and selection should be extended from maximizing average fidelity to a more comprehensive approach that takes into account the gate expressivity with respect to algorithmic structures. We consider native entangling gates (CNOT, ECR, CZ, ZZ, XX, Sycamore, $\sqrt{\text{iSWAP}}$), proposed gates (B Gate, $\sqrt[4]{\text{CNOT}}$, $\sqrt[8]{\text{CNOT}}$), as well as parameterized gates (FSim, XY). Our methodology is driven by a custom synthesis driven circuit compilation workflow, which is able to produce minimal circuit representations for a given system configuration. By providing a method to evaluate the suitability of algorithms for hardware platforms, this work emphasizes the importance of hardware-software co-design for quantum computing.</description>

      <title>An Experimental Study of Low-Latency Video Streaming over 5G</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-latency video streaming over 5G has become rapidly popular over the last few years due to its increased usage in hosting virtual events, online education, webinars, and all-hands meetings. Our work aims to address the absence of studies that reveal the real-world behavior of low-latency video streaming. To that end, we provide an experimental methodology and measurements, collected in a US metropolitan area over a commercial 5G network, that correlates application-level QoE and lower-layer metrics on the devices, such as RSRP, RSRQ, handover records, etc., under both static and mobility scenarios. We find that RAN-side information, which is readily available on every cellular device, has the potential to enhance throughput estimation modules of video streaming clients, ultimately making low-latency streaming more resilient against network perturbations and handover events.</description>

      <title>DeepGD: A Multi-Objective Black-Box Test Selection Approach for Deep Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.04878v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) are widely used in various application domains such as image processing, speech recognition, and natural language processing. However, testing DNN models may be challenging due to the complexity and size of their input domain. Particularly, testing DNN models often requires generating or exploring large unlabeled datasets. In practice, DNN test oracles, which identify the correct outputs for inputs, often require expensive manual effort to label test data, possibly involving multiple experts to ensure labeling correctness. In this paper, we propose DeepGD, a black-box multi-objective test selection approach for DNN models. It reduces the cost of labeling by prioritizing the selection of test inputs with high fault revealing power from large unlabeled datasets. DeepGD not only selects test inputs with high uncertainty scores to trigger as many mispredicted inputs as possible but also maximizes the probability of revealing distinct faults in the DNN model by selecting diverse mispredicted inputs. The experimental results conducted on four widely used datasets and five DNN models show that in terms of fault-revealing ability: (1) White-box, coverage-based approaches fare poorly, (2) DeepGD outperforms existing black-box test selection approaches in terms of fault detection, and (3) DeepGD also leads to better guidance for DNN model retraining when using selected inputs to augment the training set.</description>
