      <title>The asymptotic distribution of the scaled remainder for pseudo golden ratio expansions of a continuous random variable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $X=\sum_{k=1}^\infty X_k \beta^{-k}$ be the base-$\beta$ expansion of a continuous random variable $X$ on the unit interval where $\beta$ is the positive solution to $\beta^n = 1 + \beta + \cdots + \beta^{n-1}$ for an integer $n\ge 2$ (i.e., $\beta$ is a generalization of the golden mean for which $n=2$). We study the asymptotic distribution and convergence rate of the scaled remainder $\sum_{k=1}^\infty X_{m+k} \beta^{-k}$ when $m$ tends to infinity.</description>

      <title>The global and local limit of the continuous-time Mallows process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continuous-time Mallows processes are processes of random permutations of the set $\{1, \ldots, n\}$ whose marginal at time $t$ is the Mallows distribution with parameter $t$. Recently Corsini showed that there exists a unique Markov Mallows process whose left inversions are independent counting processes. We prove that this process admits a global and a local limit as $n \to \infty$. The global limit, obtained after suitably rescaling space and time, is an explicit stochastic process on $[0,1]$ whose description is based on the permuton limit of the Mallows distribution, analyzed by Starr. The local limit is a process of permutations of $\mathbb{Z}$ which is closely related to the construction of the Mallows distribution on permutations of $\mathbb{Z}$ due to Gnedin and Olshanski. Our results demonstrate an analogy between the asymptotic behavior of Mallows processes and the recently studied limiting properties of random sorting networks.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Statistics of a Random Model of Zeta over Intervals of Varying Length</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Arguin, Dubach &amp; Hartung recently conjectured that an intermediate regime exists between IID and log-correlated statistics for extreme values of a random model of the Riemann zeta function. For the same model, we prove a matching upper and lower tail for the distribution of its maximum. This tail interpolates between that of the two aforementioned regimes. We apply the result to yield a new sharp estimate on moments over short intervals, generalizing a result by Harper. In particular, we observe a hybrid regime for moments with a distinctive transition to the IID regime for intervals of length larger than $\exp(\sqrt{\log \log T})$.</description>

      <title>Zeros of random holomorphic sections of big line bundles with continuous metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08116v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a compact normal complex space, $L$ be a big holomorphic line bundle on $X$ and $h$ be a continuous Hermitian metric on $L$. We consider the spaces of holomorphic sections $H^0(X, L^{\otimes p})$ endowed with the inner product induced by $h^{\otimes p}$ and a volume form on $X$, and prove that the corresponding sequence of normalized Fubini-Study currents converge weakly to the curvature current $c_1(L,h_{\mathrm{eq}})$ of the equilibrium metric $h_{\mathrm{eq}}$ associated to $h$. We also show that the normalized currents of integration along the zero divisors of random sequences of holomorphic sections converge almost surely to $c_1(L,h_{\mathrm{eq}})$, for very general classes of probability measures on $H^0(X, L^{\otimes p})$.</description>

      <title>Finite State Mean Field Games with Common Shocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel framework for mean field games with finite state space and common noise, where the common noise is given through shocks that occur at random times. We first analyze the game for up to $n$ shocks, in which case we are able to characterize mean field equilibria through a system of parameterized and coupled forward-backward equations. We establish existence and uniqueness of solutions to this system for small time horizons. In addition, we show that mean field equilibria for the $n$-shock setting constitute approximate equilibria for the corresponding mean field game with infinitely many common shocks. Our results are illustrated in a corruption detection model with random audits.</description>

      <title>Combining Statistical Depth and Fermat Distance for Uncertainty Quantification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08476v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We measure the Out-of-domain uncertainty in the prediction of Neural Networks using a statistical notion called ``Lens Depth'' (LD) combined with Fermat Distance, which is able to capture precisely the ``depth'' of a point with respect to a distribution in feature space, without any assumption about the form of distribution. Our method has no trainable parameter. The method is applicable to any classification model as it is applied directly in feature space at test time and does not intervene in training process. As such, it does not impact the performance of the original model. The proposed method gives excellent qualitative result on toy datasets and can give competitive or better uncertainty estimation on standard deep learning datasets compared to strong baseline methods.</description>

      <title>Generalized Hydrodynamics for the Volterra lattice: Ballistic and nonballistic behavior of correlation functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08499v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, a lot of effort has been put in describing the hydrodynamic behavior of integrable systems. In this paper, we describe such picture for the Volterra lattice. Specifically, we are able to explicitly compute the susceptibility matrix and the current-field correlation matrix in terms of the density of states of the Volterra lattice endowed with a Generalized Gibbs ensemble. Furthermore, we apply the theory of linear Generalized Hydrodynamics to describe the Euler scale behavior of the correlation functions. We anticipate that the solution to the Generalized Hydrodynamics equations develops shocks at $\xi_0=\frac{x}{t}$; so this linear approximation does not fully describe the behavior of correlation functions. Intrigued but this fact, we performed several numerical investigations which show that, exactly when the solution to the hydrodynamic equations develops shock, the correlation functions show an highly oscillatory behavior. In view of this empirical observation, we believe that at this point $\xi_0$ the diffusive contribution are not sub-leading corrections to the ballistic transport, but they are of the same order.</description>

      <title>Sliding down the stairs: how correlated latent variables accelerate learning with neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural networks extract features from data using stochastic gradient descent (SGD). In particular, higher-order input cumulants (HOCs) are crucial for their performance. However, extracting information from the $p$th cumulant of $d$-dimensional inputs is computationally hard: the number of samples required to recover a single direction from an order-$p$ tensor (tensor PCA) using online SGD grows as $d^{p-1}$, which is prohibitive for high-dimensional inputs. This result raises the question of how neural networks extract relevant directions from the HOCs of their inputs efficiently. Here, we show that correlations between latent variables along the directions encoded in different input cumulants speed up learning from higher-order correlations. We show this effect analytically by deriving nearly sharp thresholds for the number of samples required by a single neuron to weakly-recover these directions using online SGD from a random start in high dimensions. Our analytical results are confirmed in simulations of two-layer neural networks and unveil a new mechanism for hierarchical learning in neural networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1705.02836v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a general framework allowing to apply the theory of regularity structures to discretisations of stochastic PDEs. The approach pursued in this article is that we do not focus on any one specific discretisation procedure. Instead, we assume that we are given a scale $\varepsilon &gt; 0$ and a "black box" describing the behaviour of our discretised objects at scales below $\varepsilon $.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing discrete measures from projections. Consequences on the empirical Sliced Wasserstein Distance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.12029v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper deals with the reconstruction of a discrete measure $\gamma_Z$ on $\mathbb{R}^d$ from the knowledge of its pushforward measures $P_i\#\gamma_Z$ by linear applications $P_i: \mathbb{R}^d \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{d_i}$ (for instance projections onto subspaces). The measure $\gamma_Z$ being fixed, assuming that the rows of the matrices $P_i$ are independent realizations of laws which do not give mass to hyperplanes, we show that if $\sum_i d_i &gt; d$, this reconstruction problem has almost certainly a unique solution. This holds for any number of points in $\gamma_Z$. A direct consequence of this result is an almost-sure separability property on the empirical Sliced Wasserstein distance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.12110v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let us consider subcritical Bernoulli percolation on a connected, transitive, infinite and locally finite graph. In this paper, we propose a new (and short) proof of the exponential decay property for the volume of clusters. We neither rely on differential inequalities nor on the BK inequality. We rather use stochastic comparison techniques, which are inspired by (and simpler than) those proposed in [Van22] to study the diameter of clusters. We are also very inspired by the adaptation of these techniques in [Eas22].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.02478v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: On weighted Riemannian manifolds we prove the existence of globally Lipschitz transport maps between the weight (probability) measure and log-Lipschitz perturbations of it, via Kim and Milman's diffusion transport map, assuming that the curvature-dimension condition $\mathrm{CD}(\rho_{1}, \infty)$ holds, as well as a second order version of it, namely $\Gamma_{3} \geq \rho_{2} \Gamma_{2}$. We get new results as corollaries to this result, as the preservation of Poincar\'e's inequality for the exponential measure on $(0,+\infty)$ when perturbed by a log-Lipschitz potential and a new growth estimate for the Monge map pushing forward the gamma distribution on $(0,+\infty)$ (then getting as a particular case the exponential one), via Laguerre's generator.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2203.01140v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For $G$ and $H_1,\dots, H_n$ finite groups, does there exist a $3$-manifold group with $G$ as a quotient but no $H_i$ as a quotient? We answer all such questions in terms of the group cohomology of finite groups. We prove non-existence with topological results generalizing the theory of semicharacteristics. To prove existence of 3-manifolds with certain finite quotients but not others, we use a probabilistic method, by first proving a formula for the distribution of the (profinite completion of) the fundamental group of a random 3-manifold in the Dunfield-Thurston model of random Heegaard splittings as the genus goes to infinity. We believe this is the first construction of a new distribution of random groups from its moments.</description>

      <title>A Dynamic Principal Agent Problem with One-sided Commitment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.06473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.06473v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we consider a principal agent problem where the agent is allowed to quit, by incurring a cost. When the current agent quits the job, the principal will hire a new one, possibly with a different type. We characterize the principal's dynamic value function, which could be discontinuous at the boundary, as the (unique) minimal solution of an infinite dimensional system of HJB equations, parametrized by the agent's type. This dynamic problem is time consistent in certain sense.
  Some interesting findings are worth mentioning. First, self-enforcing contracts are typically suboptimal. The principal would rather let the agent quit and hire a new one. Next, the standard contract for a committed agent may also be suboptimal, due to the presence of different types of agents in our model. The principal may prefer no commitment from the agent, then she can hire a cheaper one from the market at a later time by designing the contract to induce the current agent to quit. Moreover, due to the cost incurring to the agent, the principal will see only finitely many quittings.</description>

      <title>Properties of Discrete Sliced Wasserstein Losses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.10352v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Sliced Wasserstein (SW) distance has become a popular alternative to the Wasserstein distance for comparing probability measures. Widespread applications include image processing, domain adaptation and generative modelling, where it is common to optimise some parameters in order to minimise SW, which serves as a loss function between discrete probability measures (since measures admitting densities are numerically unattainable). All these optimisation problems bear the same sub-problem, which is minimising the Sliced Wasserstein energy. In this paper we study the properties of $\mathcal{E}: Y \longmapsto \mathrm{SW}_2^2(\gamma_Y, \gamma_Z)$, i.e. the SW distance between two uniform discrete measures with the same amount of points as a function of the support $Y \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d}$ of one of the measures. We investigate the regularity and optimisation properties of this energy, as well as its Monte-Carlo approximation $\mathcal{E}_p$ (estimating the expectation in SW using only $p$ samples) and show convergence results on the critical points of $\mathcal{E}_p$ to those of $\mathcal{E}$, as well as an almost-sure uniform convergence and a uniform Central Limit result on the process $\mathcal{E}_p(Y)$. Finally, we show that in a certain sense, Stochastic Gradient Descent methods minimising $\mathcal{E}$ and $\mathcal{E}_p$ converge towards (Clarke) critical points of these energies.</description>

      <title>An exactly solvable asymmetric $K$-exclusion process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.03343v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study an interacting particle process on a finite ring with $L$ sites with at most $K$ particles per site, in which particles hop to nearest neighbors with rates given in terms of $t$-deformed integers and asymmetry parameter $q$, where $t&gt;0$ and $q \geq 0$ are parameters. This model, which we call the $(q, t)$~$K$-ASEP, reduces to the usual ASEP on the ring when $K = 1$ and to a model studied by Sch\"utz and Sandow (\emph{Phys. Rev. E}, 1994) when $t = q = 1$. This is a special case of the misanthrope process and as a consequence, the steady state does not depend on $q$ and is of product form, generalizing the same phenomena for the ASEP. What is interesting here is the steady state weights are given by explicit formulas involving $t$-binomial coefficients, and are palindromic polynomials in $t$. Interestingly, although the $(q, t)$~$K$-ASEP does not satisfy particle-hole symmetry, its steady state does. We analyze the density and calculate the most probable number of particles at a site in the steady state in various regimes of $t$. Lastly, we construct a two-dimensional exclusion process on a discrete cylinder with height $K$ and circumference $L$ which projects to the $(q, t)$~$K$-ASEP and whose steady state distribution is also of product form. We believe this model will serve as an illustrative example in constructing two-dimensional analogues of misanthrope processes.

      <title>Tail Optimality and Performance Analysis of the Nudge-M Scheduling Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06588v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently it was shown that the response time of First-Come-First-Served (FCFS) scheduling can be stochastically and asymptotically improved upon by the {\it Nudge} scheduling algorithm in case of light-tailed job size distributions. Such improvements are feasible even when the jobs are partitioned into two types and the scheduler only has information about the type of incoming jobs (but not their size).
  In this paper we introduce Nudge-$M$ scheduling, where basically any incoming type-1 job is allowed to pass any type-2 job that is still waiting in the queue given that it arrived as one of the last $M$ jobs. We prove that Nudge-$M$ has an asymptotically optimal response time within a large family of Nudge scheduling algorithms when job sizes are light-tailed. Simple explicit results for the asymptotic tail improvement ratio (ATIR) of Nudge-$M$ over FCFS are derived as well as explicit results for the optimal parameter $M$. An expression for the ATIR that only depends on the type-1 and type-2 mean job sizes and the fraction of type-1 jobs is presented in the heavy traffic setting.
  The paper further presents a numerical method to compute the response time distribution and mean response time of Nudge-$M$ scheduling provided that the job size distribution of both job types follows a phase-type distribution (by making use of the framework of Markov modulated fluid queues with jumps).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15357v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We reveal the relation between the Legendre transform of convex functions and heat flow evolution, and how it applies to the functional Blaschke-Santalo inequality. We also describe local maximizers in this inequality.</description>

      <title>Estimating parameters of continuous-time multi-chain hidden Markov models for infectious diseases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18875v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study aims to estimate the parameters of a stochastic exposed-infected epidemiological model for the transmission dynamics of notifiable infectious diseases, based on observations related to isolated cases counts only. We use the setting of hidden multi-chain Markov models and adapt the Baum-Welch algorithm to the special structure of the multi-chain. From the estimated transition matrix, we retrieve the parameters of interest (contamination rates, incubation rate, and isolation rate) from analytical expressions of the moments and Monte Carlo simulations. The performance of this approach is investigated on synthetic data, together with an analysis of the impact of using a model with one less compartment to fit the data in order to help for model selection.</description>

      <title>A Dean-Kawasaki equation for reaction diffusion systems driven by Poisson noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02487v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive a stochastic partial differential equation that describes the fluctuating behaviour of reaction-diffusion systems of N particles, undergoing Markovian, unary reactions. This generalises the work of Dean [J. Phys. A: Math. and Gen., 29 (24), L613, (1996)] through the inclusion of random Poisson fields. Our approach is based on weak interactions, which has the dual benefit that the resulting equations asymptotically converge (in the N to infinity limit) on a variation of a McKean- Vlasov diffusion, whilst still being related to the case of Dean-like strong interactions via a trivial rescaling. Various examples are presented, alongside a discussion of possible extensions to more complicated reaction schemes.</description>

      <title>Nevai's condition for measures with unbounded supports</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07566v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study Nevai's condition from the theory of orthogonal polynomials on the real line. We prove that a large class of measures with unbounded Jacobi parameters satisfies Nevai's condition locally uniformly on the support of the measure away from a finite explicit set. This allows us to give applications to relative uniform and weak asymptotics of Christoffel-Darboux kernels on the diagonal and to limit theorems for unconventionally normalized global linear statistics of orthogonal polynomial ensembles.</description>
