      <title>Coevolutionary dynamics of feedback-evolving games in structured populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interdependence between an individual strategy decision and the resulting change of environmental state is often a subtle process. Feedback-evolving games have been a prevalent framework for studying such feedback in well-mixed populations, yielding important insights into the coevolutionary dynamics. However, since real populations are usually structured, it is essential to explore how population structure affects such coevolutionary dynamics. Our work proposes a coevolution model of strategies and environmental state in a structured population depicted by a regular graph. We investigate the system dynamics, and theoretically demonstrate that there exist different evolutionary outcomes including oscillation, bistability, the coexistence of oscillation and dominance, as well as the coexistence of cooperation and defection. Our theoretical predictions are validated through numerical calculations. By using Monte Carlo simulations we examine how the number of neighbors influences the coevolutionary dynamics, particularly the size of the attractive domain of the replete environmental state in the cases of bistability or cooperation-defection coexistence. Specifically, in the case of bistability, a larger neighborhood size may be beneficial to save the environment when the environmental enhancement rate by cooperation / degradation rate by defection is high. Conversely, if this ratio is low, a smaller neighborhood size is more beneficial. In the case of cooperator-defector coexistence, environmental maintenance is basically influenced by individual payoffs. When the ratio of temptation minus reward versus punishment minus sucker's payoff is high, a larger neighborhood size is more favorable. In contrast, when the mentioned ratio is low, a smaller neighborhood size is more advantageous.</description>

      <title>Flexible inference of evolutionary accumulation dynamics using uncertain observational data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding and predicting evolutionary accumulation pathways is a key objective in many fields of research, ranging from classical evolutionary biology to diverse applications in medicine. In this context, we are often confronted with the problem that data is sparse and uncertain. To use the available data as best as possible, inference approaches that can handle this uncertainty are required. One way that allows us to use not only cross-sectional data, but also phylogenetic related and longitudinal data is using 'hypercubic inference' models. In this article we introduce HyperLAU, a new algorithm for hypercubic inference that makes it possible to use datasets including uncertainties for learning evolutionary pathways. Expanding the flexibility of accumulation modelling, HyperLAU allows us to infer dynamic pathways and interactions between features, even when large sets of particular features are unobserved across the source dataset. We show that HyperLAU is able to highlight the main pathways found by other tools, even when up to 50% of the features in the input data are uncertain.</description>

      <title>Complexity and accessibility of random landscapes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: These notes introduce probabilistic landscape models defined on high-dimensional discrete sequence spaces. The models are motivated primarily by fitness landscapes in evolutionary biology, but links to statistical physics and computer science are mentioned where appropriate. Elementary and advanced results on the structure of landscapes are described with a focus on features that are relevant to evolutionary searches, such as the number of local maxima and the existence of fitness-monotonic paths. The recent discovery of submodularity as a biologically meaningful property of fitness landscapes and its consequences for their accessibility is discussed in detail.</description>

      <title>Hinderance of cooperation by individual solutions: Evolutionary dynamics of three-strategy games combining the prisoner's dilemma and stag hunt</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We considered a three-strategy game with the characteristics of the prisoner's dilemma and stag hunt games. This game was inspired by recent experimental studies that elucidated the role of individual solutions. People who adopt individual solutions do not free-ride on the cooperative efforts of others, but instead attempt to solve the problem only to the extent necessary to prevent an impact on themselves. We argue that individual solutions play a role similar to that of defection in the stag hunt game, and this study examined the effects of orthodox free-riding and the individual solution on the evolution of cooperation. Our analysis revealed that a state in which all of the agents adopt the individual solution is the only stable equilibrium in the well-mixed population. Interactions on a square lattice led to modest improvements in cooperation levels, which were mainly sustained by cyclic dominance. Payoff values favorable to cooperation resulted in full cooperation, but rare mutations could hamper the cooperative equilibrium and support the dominance of the individual solution. Our analysis echoed experimental observations and illustrated that overcoming the reliance on individual solutions is critical in understanding the evolution of cooperation.</description>

      <title>Spatial Pattern Formation in Eco-Evolutionary Games with Environment-Driven Motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sustainable management of common resources often leads to a social dilemma known as the tragedy of the commons: individuals benefit from rapid extraction of resources, while communities as a whole benefit from more sustainable extraction strategies. Such a social dilemma can be further complicated by the role played by space for both resources and harvesters, where spatial diffusion of resources and directed motion of harvesters can potentially feature the emergence of clusters of environmental resource and sustainable harvesting strategies. In this paper, we explore a PDE model of evolutionary game theory with environmental feedback, describing how the spatial distribution of resource extraction strategies and environmental resources can change due to both local eco-evolutionary dynamics and environmental-driven directed motion of harvesters. Through linear stability analysis, we show that this biased motion towards higher-quality environments can lead to spatial patterns in the distribution of extraction strategies, creating local regions with improved environmental quality and increase payoff for resource extractors. However, by measuring the average payoff and environmental quality across the spatial domain, we see that this pattern-forming mechanism can actually decrease the overall success of the population relative to the equilibrium outcome in the absence of spatial motion. This suggests that environmental-driven motion can produce a spatial social dilemma, in which biased motion towards more beneficial regions can produce emergent patterns featuring a worse overall environment for the population.</description>

      <title>Stochastic dynamics of two-compartment cell proliferation models with regulatory mechanisms for hematopoiesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19041v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an asymptotic analysis of a stochastic two-compartmental cell division system with regulatory mechanisms inspired by Getto et al. (2013). The hematopoietic system is modeled as a two-compartment system, where the first compartment consists of dividing cells in the bone marrow, referred to as type $0$ cells, and the second compartment consists of post-mitotic cells in the blood, referred to as type $1$ cells. Division and self-renewal of type $0$ cells are regulated by the population density of type $1$ cells. By scaling up the initial population, we demonstrate that the scaled dynamics converges in distribution to the solution of a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). This system of ODEs exhibits a unique non-trivial equilibrium that is globally stable. Furthermore, we establish that the scaled fluctuations of the density dynamics converge in law to a linear diffusion process with time-dependent coefficients. When the initial data is Gaussian, the limit process is a Gauss-Markov process. We analyze its asymptotic properties to elucidate the joint structure of both compartments over large times. This is achieved by proving exponential convergence in the 2-Wasserstein metric for the associated Gaussian measures on an $L^{2}$ Hilbert space. Finally, we apply our results to compare the effects of regulating division and self-renewal of type $0$ cells, providing insights into their respective roles in maintaining hematopoietic system stability.</description>
