      <title>All-optical method to directly measure the pressure-volume-temperature equation of state of fluids in the diamond anvil cell</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07935</link>

Abstract: We have developed a new all-optical method to directly measure the pressure-volume-temperature (PVT) equation of state (EOS) of fluids and transparent solids in the diamond anvil high pressure cell by measuring the volume of the sample chamber. Our method combines confocal microscopy and white light interference with a new analysis method which exploits the mutual dependence of sample density and refractive index: Experimentally, the refractive index determines the measured sample chamber thickness (and therefore the measured sample volume/density), yet the sample density is by far the dominant factor in determining the variation in refractive index with pressure. Our analysis method allows us to obtain a set of values for the density and refractive index which are mutually consistent, and agree with the experimental data within error. We have conducted proof-of-concept experiments on a variety of samples (H$_{2}$O, CH$_{4}$, C$_{2}$H$_{6}$, C$_{3}$H$_{8}$, KCl and NaCl) at ambient temperature, and at high temperatures up to just above 500 K. Our proof-of-concept data demonstrate that our method is able to reproduce known fluid and solid EOS within error. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our method allows us to directly and routinely measure the PVT EOS of simple fluids at GPa pressures up to, at least, 514 K (the highest temperature reached in our study). A reasonable estimation of the known sources of error in our volume determinations indicates that the error is currently $\pm$ 2.7% at high temperature, and that it is feasible to reduce it to ca. $\pm$ 1% in future work.</description>

      <title>$N$-bein formalism for the parameter space of quantum geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19468v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work introduces a geometrical object that generalizes the quantum geometric tensor; we call it $N$-bein. Analogous to the vielbein (orthonormal frame) used in the Cartan formalism, the $N$-bein behaves like a ``square root'' of the quantum geometric tensor. Using it, we present a quantum geometric tensor of two states that measures the possibility of moving from one state to another after two consecutive parameter variations. This new tensor determines the commutativity of such variations through its anti-symmetric part. In addition, we define a connection different from the Berry connection, and combining it with the $N$-bein allows us to introduce a notion of torsion and curvature \`{a} la Cartan that satisfies the Bianchi identities. Moreover, the torsion coincides with the anti-symmetric part of the two-state quantum geometric tensor previously mentioned, and thus, it is related to the commutativity of the parameter variations. We also describe our formalism using differential forms and discuss the possible physical interpretations of the new geometrical objects. Furthermore, we define different gauge invariants constructed from the geometrical quantities introduced in this work, resulting in new physical observables. Finally, we present two examples to illustrate these concepts: a harmonic oscillator and a generalized oscillator, both immersed in an electric field. We found that the new tensors quantify correlations between quantum states that were unavailable by other methods.</description>
