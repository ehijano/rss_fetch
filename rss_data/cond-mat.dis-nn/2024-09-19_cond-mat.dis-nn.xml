      <title>Spatially-resolved dynamics of the amplitude Schmid-Higgs mode in disordered superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11647v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the spatially-resolved dynamics of the collective amplitude Schmid-Higgs (SH) mode in disordered Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) superconductors and fermionic superfluids. We identify cases where the long-time SH response is determined by a pole in the averaged SH susceptibility, located on the unphysical sheet of its Riemann surface. Using analytic continuation across the two-particle branch cut, we obtain the zero-temperature dispersion relation and damping rate of the SH mode linked to this pole. When the coherence length significantly exceeds the mean free path, the pole is ``hidden'' behind the two-particle continuum edge at $2\Delta$, leading to SH oscillations at late times decaying as $1/t^2$ with frequency $2\Delta$. Nevertheless, the pole induces a peak in the retarded SH susceptibility at a frequency above $2\Delta$ and causes sub-diffusive oscillations with a dynamical exponent $z=4$ at both late times and long distances. Conversely, long-distance oscillations at a fixed frequency $\omega$ occur only for $\omega$ exceeding $2\Delta$, with a spatial period diverging at the threshold as $1/(\omega - 2\Delta)^{1/4}$, up to logarithmic factors. When the coherence length is comparable to the mean free path, the pole can reemerge into the continuum, resulting in additional late-time oscillations at fixed wave vectors with frequencies above $2\Delta$.</description>

      <title>Not-so-glass-like Caging and Fluctuations of an Active Matter Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simple active models of matter recapitulate complex biological phenomena. Their out-of-equilibrium nature, however, often makes these models beyond the reach of first-principle descriptions. This limitation is particularly perplexing when attempting to distinguish between different glass-forming mechanisms. We here consider a minimal active system in various spatial dimensions to identify the underlying processes at play. Activity is found to markedly impact cage escape processes and critical fluctuations, thus offering a distinct perspective on the role of activity sluggish dynamics.</description>

      <title>Mirages in the Energy Landscape of Soft Sphere Packings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12113v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The energy landscape is central to understanding low-temperature and athermal systems, like jammed soft spheres. The geometry of this high-dimensional energy surface is controlled by a plethora of minima and their associated basins of attraction that escape analytical treatment and are thus studied numerically. We show that the ODE solver with the best time-for-error for this problem, CVODE, is orders of magnitude faster than other steepest-descent solvers for such systems. Using this algorithm, we provide unequivocal evidence that optimizers widely used in computational studies destroy all semblance of the true landscape geometry, even in moderate dimensions. Using various geometric indicators, both low- and high-dimensional, we show that results on the fractality of basins of attraction originated from the use of inadequate mapping strategies, as basins are actually smooth structures with well-defined length scales. Thus, a vast number of past claims on energy landscapes need to be re-evaluated due to the use of inadequate numerical methods.</description>

      <title>Initial Guessing Bias: How Untrained Networks Favor Some Classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.00809v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding and controlling biasing effects in neural networks is crucial for ensuring accurate and fair model performance. In the context of classification problems, we provide a theoretical analysis demonstrating that the structure of a deep neural network (DNN) can condition the model to assign all predictions to the same class, even before the beginning of training, and in the absence of explicit biases. We prove that, besides dataset properties, the presence of this phenomenon, which we call \textit{Initial Guessing Bias} (IGB), is influenced by model choices including dataset preprocessing methods, and architectural decisions, such as activation functions, max-pooling layers, and network depth. Our analysis of IGB provides information for architecture selection and model initialization. We also highlight theoretical consequences, such as the breakdown of node-permutation symmetry, the violation of self-averaging and the non-trivial effects that depth has on the phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Scaling Relations of Spectrum Form Factor and Krylov Complexity at Finite Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10499v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the study of quantum chaos diagnostics, considerable attention has been attributed to the Krylov complexity and spectrum form factor (SFF) for systems at infinite temperature. These investigations have unveiled universal properties of quantum chaotic systems. By extending the analysis to include the finite temperature effects on the Krylov complexity and SFF, we demonstrate that the Lanczos coefficients $b_n$, which are associated with the Wightman inner product, display consistency with the universal hypothesis presented in PRX 9, 041017 (2019). This result contrasts with the behavior of Lanczos coefficients associated with the standard inner product. Our results indicate that the slope $\alpha$ of the $b_n$ is bounded by $\pi k_BT$, where $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant and $T$ the temperature. We also investigate the SFF, which characterizes the two-point correlation of the spectrum and encapsulates an indicator of ergodicity denoted by $g$ in chaotic systems. Our analysis demonstrates that as the temperature decreases, the value of $g$ decreases as well. Considering that $\alpha$ also represents the operator growth rate, we establish a quantitative relationship between ergodicity indicator and Lanczos coefficients slope. To support our findings, we provide evidence using the Gaussian orthogonal ensemble and a random spin model. Our work deepens the understanding of the finite temperature effects on Krylov complexity, SFF, and the connection between ergodicity and operator growth.</description>
