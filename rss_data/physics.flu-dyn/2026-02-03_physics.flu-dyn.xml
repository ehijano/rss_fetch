      <title>Geometric Reinitialization for Capillary Flows: a Comparative Study with State-of-the-Art Conservative Level-Set Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulations of immiscible flows involving surface tension (ST) require a robust high-fidelity framework. State-of-the-art multi-phase models, such as the Conservative Level-Set (CLS) approach, rely on Eulerian representations of the fluids and interface and require reinitialization methods to ensure volume conservation and accurate ST force modeling. This work focuses on the complete description of a CLS solver and proposes a novel geometric reinitialization method, based on the level-set literature. It includes a quantitative and objective comparison of this new geometric method to two reinitialization approaches: the PDE-based reinitialization proposed in the original CLS method and a simple projection-based approach. This comparison tackles three 3D application cases: the rise of a bubble, the capillary migration of a droplet, and the Rayleigh-Plateau instability development in a capillary jet. The PDE-based and geometric methods lead to high-quality, spatially-converged results in good agreement with benchmark and analytic solutions, while the projection-based reinitialization fails to capture complex 3D interfacial dynamics. The results also highlight the robustness of the novel geometric method which offers a two-parameter framework in comparison to the PDE-based method that necessitates a case-dependent selection of four parameters.</description>

      <title>Parametrization of subgrid scales in long-term simulations of the shallow-water equations using machine learning and convex limiting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a method for parametrizing sub-grid processes in the Shallow Water equations. We define coarse variables and local spatial averages and use a feed-forward neural network to learn sub-grid fluxes. Our method results in a local parametrization that uses a four-point computational stencil, which has several advantages over globally coupled parametrizations. We demonstrate numerically that our method improves energy balance in long-term turbulent simulations and also accurately reproduces individual solutions. The neural network parametrization can be easily combined with flux limiting to reduce oscillations near shocks. More importantly, our method provides reliable parametrizations, even in dynamical regimes that are not included in the training data.</description>

      <title>Digital Twin Assessment of Filter Clogging Penalties in VFD-Driven Industrial Fan Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Industrial ventilation systems equipped with variable-frequency drives (VFDs) often mask the aerodynamic impact of filter clogging by automatically increasing fan speed to maintain airflow setpoints. While effective for process stability, this control strategy creates a "blind spot" in energy management, leading to unmonitored power spikes. This study applies a rapid digital twin workflow to quantify these hidden energy penalties in a standard 50 kW draw-through fan room. Using a specialized computational fluid dynamics (CFD) solver (AirSketcher), the facility was modeled under "Clean Filter" (baseline) and "Dirty Filter" (clogged) scenarios. The physics engine was first validated against wind tunnel experimental data, confirming high agreement with the theoretical inertial pressure-drop law ($\Delta P \propto U^2$). In the industrial case study, results indicate that severe clogging (modeled via a 50% effective porosity reduction) can push the fan system beyond its available pressure head or speed limits, forcing the VFD into a saturation regime. Under these conditions, effective airflow collapses by over 50% (3,806 CFM to 1,831 CFM) despite increased fan effort. The associated energy analysis predicts an annual energy penalty of 8,818 kWh ($1,058/yr). This study demonstrates how a physics-based simulation provides a defensible, ROI-driven metric for optimizing filter maintenance cycles.

      <title>A thermodynamically consistent Johnson-Segalman-Giesekus model: numerical simulation of the rod climbing effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Viscoelastic rate-type fluids represent a popular class of non-Newtonian fluid models due to their ability to describe phenomena such as stress relaxation, non-linear creep, and normal stress differences. The presence of normal stress differences in a simple shear flow gives rise to forces acting in directions orthogonal to the primary flow direction. The rod climbing effect, i.e. the rise of a fluid along a rod rotating about its axis, is associated with this phenomenon. Within the class of viscoelastic rate-type fluids that includes the Oldroyd-B and Giesekus models with Gordon--Schowalter convected derivatives, we show -- by means of thermodynamical analysis and numerical simulations -- that a thermodynamically consistent variant of the Johnson--Segalman model captures experimental data exceedingly well and is therefore superior to other models in this class, including the standard Johnson--Segalman model, which is widely used in engineering applications but is shown here to be incompatible with the second law of thermodynamics. We release a robust and computationally efficient higher-order finite-element implementation as open-source software on GitHub. The implementation is based on an arbitrary Lagrangian--Eulerian (ALE) formulation of the governing equations and is developed using the Firedrake library.</description>

      <title>WAKESET: A Large-Scale, High-Reynolds Number Flow Dataset for Machine Learning of Turbulent Wake Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) offers transformative potential for computational fluid dynamics (CFD), promising to accelerate simulations, improve turbulence modelling, and enable real-time flow prediction and control-capabilities that could fundamentally change how engineers approach fluid dynamics problems. However, the exploration of ML in fluid dynamics is critically hampered by the scarcity of large, diverse, and high-fidelity datasets suitable for training robust models. This limitation is particularly acute for highly turbulent flows, which dominate practical engineering applications yet remain computationally prohibitive to simulate at scale. High-Reynolds number turbulent datasets are essential for ML models to learn the complex, multi-scale physics characteristic of real-world flows, enabling generalisation beyond the simplified, low-Reynolds number regimes often represented in existing datasets. This paper introduces WAKESET, a novel, large-scale CFD dataset of highly turbulent flows, designed to address this critical gap. The dataset captures the complex hydrodynamic interactions during the underwater recovery of an autonomous underwater vehicle by a larger extra-large uncrewed underwater vehicle. It comprises 1,091 high-fidelity Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes simulations, augmented to 4,364 instances, covering a wide operational envelope of speeds (up to Reynolds numbers of 1.09 x 10^8) and turning angles. This work details the motivation for this new dataset by reviewing existing resources, outlines the hydrodynamic modelling and validation underpinning its creation, and describes its structure. The dataset's focus on a practical engineering problem, its scale, and its high turbulence characteristics make it a valuable resource for developing and benchmarking ML models for flow field prediction, surrogate modelling, and autonomous navigation in complex underwater environments.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of instantaneous flow fields from transient velocity snapshots using physics-informed neural networks: Applications to pulsatile blood flow behind a stenosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) offer a promising framework by embedding partial differential equations (PDEs) into the loss function together with measurement data, making them well-suited for inverse problems. However, standard PINNs face challenges with time-dependent PDEs due to the high computational cost of space-time training and the risk of convergence to local minima. These limitations are particularly pronounced in hemodynamic analysis, where 4D-flow magnetic resonance imaging (4D-flow MRI) yields temporally sparse velocity snapshots over the cardiac cycle. To address this challenge, we propose a PINN framework that reconstructs instantaneous flow fields from transient velocity snapshots by inferring the acceleration term in the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. By designing the network without explicit time as an input, the proposed approach enables physics enforcement using spatial evaluations alone, improving training efficiency while maintaining physical consistency with transient flow characteristics. In addition, we introduce an acceleration-mismatch loss that penalizes discrepancies between predicted and measured accelerations, which improves prediction accuracy through regularization. Numerical examples on pulsatile flow behind a stenosis using temporally and spatially downsampled synthetic data generated from time-resolved CFD demonstrate that the proposed framework reliably reconstructs velocity fields even under sparse temporal sampling, and appropriate regularization for acceleration improves predictions of pressure-gradient and acceleration fields.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Chebyshev Polynomial Neural Operator for Parametric Partial Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural operators have emerged as powerful deep learning frameworks for approximating solution operators of parameterized partial differential equations (PDE). However, current methods predominantly rely on multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) for mapping inputs to solutions, which impairs training robustness in physics-informed settings due to inherent spectral biases and fixed activation functions. To overcome the architectural limitations, we introduce the Physics-Informed Chebyshev Polynomial Neural Operator (CPNO), a novel mesh-free framework that leverages a basis transformation to replace unstable monomial expansions with the numerically stable Chebyshev spectral basis. By integrating parameter dependent modulation mechanism to main net, CPNO constructs PDE solutions in a near-optimal functional space, decoupling the model from MLP-specific constraints and enhancing multi-scale representation. Theoretical analysis demonstrates the Chebyshev basis's near-minimax uniform approximation properties and superior conditioning, with Lebesgue constants growing logarithmically with degree, thereby mitigating spectral bias and ensuring stable gradient flow during optimization. Numerical experiments on benchmark parameterized PDEs show that CPNO achieves superior accuracy, faster convergence, and enhanced robustness to hyperparameters. The experiment of transonic airfoil flow has demonstrated the capability of CPNO in characterizing complex geometric problems.</description>

      <title>On Large Deformations of Oldroyd-B Drops in a Steady Electric Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The deformation of viscoelastic drops under electric fields is central to applications in microfluidics, inkjet printing, and electrohydrodynamic manipulation of complex fluids. This study investigates the dynamics of an Oldroyd-B drop subjected to a uniform electric field using numerical simulations performed with the open-source solver Basilisk. Representative pairs of conductivity ratio ($\sigma_r$) and permittivity ratio ($\epsilon_r$) are selected from six regions ($PR_A^+$, $PR_B^+$, $PR_A^-$, $PR_B^-$, $OB^+$, and $OB^-$) of the $(\sigma_r, \epsilon_r)$ phase space. In regions where the first- and second-order deformation coefficients share the same sign ($PR_A^-$, $PR_B^-$, $OB^+$), deviations from Newtonian behavior are negligible. In $PR_A^+$, drops develop multi-lobed shapes above a critical electric capillary number, with elasticity reducing deformation and increasing the critical $Ca_E$ with Deborah number ($De$). In $PR_B^+$, drops form shapes with conical ends above the critical $Ca_E$, while steady-state deformation decreases with $De$ below this threshold, and critical $Ca_E$ shows non-monotonic variation. At high $Ca_E$ and $De$, transient deformation exhibits maxima and minima before reaching steady state, with occasional oscillations between spheroidal and pointed shapes. In $OB^-$, drops deform to oblate shapes and breakup above a critical $Ca_E$, with deformation magnitude increasing and critical $Ca_E$ decreasing with $De$; at low $Ca_E$ and high $De$, dimpling and positional oscillations are observed. These results elucidate viscoelastic-electric interactions and provide guidance for controlling drop behavior in practical applications.</description>

      <title>Transition to dilatation-dominated compressible turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The kinetic energy dissipation rate is of central importance for the small-scale statistics in turbulent flows. Here, we determine the transition to the dilatation-dominated regime of 3d fully compressible, homogeneous, isotropic turbulence by moments of energy dissipation and its components up to order 4 for turbulent Mach numbers $0.1\le M_t\le 10$. Our high-resolution numerical simulations show a crossover from incompressible to $M_t$-independent, Burgers turbulence-like moment scaling with respect to Reynolds number $Re$. This confirms the statistical dominance of shocks for $M_t\gtrsim 1$.</description>

      <title>Defects, Corrugation and Temperature Govern Rarefied-Air Drag on Graphene Coatings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In rarefied atmospheric environments, where continuum fluid dynamics breaks down, aerodynamic drag is governed by gas-surface momentum exchange, making surface structure and chemistry key design knobs. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we show that coating the $\alpha$-Al2O3(0001) surface with graphene markedly reduces the tangential momentum accommodation coefficient (TMAC) of N2, shifting scattering toward more specular reflection and thereby lowering drag; we further benchmark this response against graphite. The reduction strengthens up to 900 K. While structural defects can increase TMAC via defect-induced corrugation and local atomic and electronic rearrangements, graphene retains its performance at experimentally relevant defect densities.</description>

      <title>An Oscillation-Free Real Fluid Quasi-Conservative Finite Volume Method for Transcritical and Phase-Change Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new Real Fluid Quasi-Conservative (RFQC) finite volume method is developed to address the numerical simulation of real fluids involving shock waves in transcritical and phase-change flows. To eliminate the spurious pressure oscillations inherent in fully conservative schemes, we extend the classic five-equation quasi-conservative model, originally designed for two-phase flows, to real fluids governed by arbitrary equations of state (EoS). The RFQC method locally linearizes the real fluid EoS at each grid point and time step, constructing and evolving the frozen Gr\"uneisen coefficient $\Gamma$ and the linearization remainder $E_0$ via two advection equations. At the end of each time step, the evolved $\Gamma$ and $E_0$ are utilized to reconstruct the oscillation-free pressure field, followed by a thermodynamic re-projection applied to the conserved variables. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that, in smooth regions, the energy conservation error of the RFQC method is a high-order term relative to the spatial reconstruction truncation error. In discontinuous regions, this error is determined by the entropy increase rate, thereby maintaining consistency with the inherent truncation error of shock-capturing methods. A series of numerical tests verifies that the method can robustly simulate complex flow processes with only minor energy conservation errors, including transcritical flows, phase transitions, and shock-interface interactions. The RFQC method is proven to be both accurate and robust in capturing shock waves and phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Vortex Stretching in the Navier-Stokes Equations and Information Dissipation in Diffusion Models: A Reformulation from a Partial Differential Equation Viewpoint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01071v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new inverse-time formulation of vortex stretching in the Navier-Stokes equations, based on a PDE framework inspired by score-based diffusion models. By absorbing the ill-posed backward Laplacian arising from time reversal into a drift term expressed through a score function, the inverse-time dynamics are formulated in a Lagrangian manner. Using a discrete Lagrangian flow of an axisymmetric vortex-stretching field, the score function is learned with a neural network and employed to construct backward-time particle trajectories. Numerical results demonstrate that information about initial positions is rapidly lost in the compressive direction, whereas it is relatively well preserved in the stretching direction.</description>

      <title>Third-Order Geometric-Volume Conservation in Cahn--Hilliard Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01497v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Degenerate Cahn-Hilliard phase-field models provide a robust approximation of surface-diffusion-driven interface motion without explicit front tracking. In computations, however, the geometric volume enclosed by the interface -- the region where the order parameter $\phi$ is positive -- may drift at finite interface thickness, producing artificial shrinkage or growth even when the sharp-interface limit conserves volume. We revisit and extend the improved-conservation framework of Zhou et al., where one replaces classical mass conservation by the exact conservation of a designed monotone mapping $Q(\phi)$ that more accurately approximates a step function. Building on this framework, we (i) carry out the matched-asymptotic analysis in the unscaled physical time formulation, (ii) derive a simplified representation of the first-order inner correction to the interface profile, and (iii) identify an integral-moment cancellation condition that controls the leading geometric-volume defect. This mechanism becomes a practical design rule: we select regularization kernels within parameterized families -- including exponential and Pade-type -- to reach effective higher-order behavior and satisfy the cancellation condition at moderate parameter values. As a result, the proposed kernels achieve formal third-order accuracy in geometric-volume conservation with respect to interface thickness. Finally, we describe an unconditional energy-dissipative numerical discretization that exactly preserves the discrete conserved quantity. Numerical benchmarks on multi-scale droplet coarsening and shape relaxation demonstrate that the moment-balanced kernels virtually eliminate artificial drift and prevent premature extinction of small droplets.</description>

      <title>Freezing-Melting Mediated Dewetting Transition for Droplets on Superhydrophobic Surfaces with Condensation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The water-repellence properties of superhydrophobic surfaces make them promising for many applications. However, in some extreme environments, such as high humidities and low temperatures, condensation on the surface is inevitable, which induces the loss of surface superhydrophobicity. In this study, we propose a freezing-melting strategy to achieve the dewetting transition from the Wenzel state to the Cassie-Baxter state. It requires freezing the droplet by reducing the substrate temperature and then melting the droplet by heating the substrate. The condensation-induced wetting transition from the Cassie-Baxter state to the Wenzel state is analyzed first. Two kinds of superhydrophobic surfaces, i.e., single-scale nano-structured superhydrophobic surface and hierarchical-scale micro-nano-structured superhydrophobic surface, are compared and their effects on the static contact states and impact processes of droplets are analyzed. The mechanism for the dewetting transition is analyzed by exploring the differences in the micro/nano-structures of the surfaces and it is attributed to the unique structure and strength of the superhydrophobic surface. These findings will enrich our understanding of the droplet-surface interaction involving phase changes and have great application prospects for the design of superhydrophobic surfaces.</description>

      <title>A new Energy Equation Derivation for the Shallow Water Linearized Moment Equations</title>

Abstract: Shallow Water Moment Equations (SWME) are extensions to the well-known Shallow Water Equations (SWE) for the efficient modeling and numerical simulation of free-surface flows. While the SWE typically assume a depth-averaged vertical velocity profile, the SWME allow for vertical variations of the velocity profile. The SWME therefore assume a polynomial profile and then derive additional evolution equations for the polynomial coefficients via higher order depth integration. In this work, we perform a new systematic derivation of the energy equation for a specific variant of the SWME, called the Shallow Water Linearized Moment Equations (SWLME). The derivation is based on the standard SWE energy equation derivation and includes the skew-symmetric formulation of the model. The new systematic derivation is beneficial for the extension to other SWME variants and their numerical solution.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear interaction between dynamo-generated magnetic fields, mean flows and internal gravity waves in stellar stably-stratified layers: From 3D to 1D</title>

Abstract: Magnetic fields have been constrained at the surface of several massive and intermediate-mass stars, but their origin and properties in deep stellar radiative interiors are still debated, despite recent detections in the core of some red giant stars. Therefore, the modelling of AM transport in stellar radiative layers only relies on theoretical and numerical estimates of magnetic fields. Recent 3D numerical simulations show that a dynamo could occur in deep radiative regions. A realistic setup for understanding AM transport in such layers thus requires to take into account the mutual interactions of IGW and dynamo-generated magnetic field. We model the dynamics induced by IGW and dynamo in rotating radiative stellar layers using a simple description applicable to various evolutionary stages. As dynamo action and the propagation of IGW are 3D processes that have characteristic timescales short compared to periods associated with structural evolution of stars, we propose a mean-field 1D model by taking advantage of the dynamo coefficients computed from 3D spherical simulations. In this model, the necessary mean shear flow to trigger the dynamo results from the dissipation of monochromatic IGW generated in existing adjacent convective layers, which are expected to drive the formation of an oscillating rotational shear layer, the so-called Shear Layer Oscillation (SLO). In turn, magnetic effects can act on the mean flow through the Lorentz force. We show that the inclusion of magnetic fields adds up to the already very complex nonlinear problem and gives rise to the emergence of new dynamical regimes. Particularly, the fast SLO generated very close to the place where IGW are generated is perturbed by magnetic fields. This dynamical change can filter the wave energy spectrum transmitted towards further layers, with potential influence on the long-term evolution of the inner rotation.</description>

      <title>Using wetting and ultrasonic waves to extract oil from oil/water mixtures</title>

Abstract: Oil and water placed atop of a solid surface respond differently to a MHz-level surface acoustic wave (SAW) propagating in the solid due to their different surface wetting properties. We observe that, under SAW excitation, oil films, whether non-organic silicon oil or organic sunflower oil, are extracted continuously from sessile drops, comprising emulsions of the oil in question in a solution of water and surfactants. The mechanism responsible for the extraction of oil from the mixtures is the acoustowetting phenomenon: the low surface tension oil phase leaves the mixture in the form of 'fingers' that, away from the drop, spread opposite the path of the SAW. The high surface tension water phase remains at rest. Increasing either the SAW intensity or the oil content in the mixture enhances the rate at which oil leaves the emulsion. We further observe acoustic-capillary flow instabilities at the free surface of the oil film and the formation of spatial gradients in the emulsion oil-concentrations in the presence of SAW. Our study suggests the potential for using SAW for heterogeneous removal of oil from oil-in-water mixtures to complement current phase separation methods.</description>

      <title>Stability analysis of time-periodic shear flow generated by an oscillating density interface</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13893v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the conceptual two-layered oscillating tank of Inoue &amp; Smyth (2009), which mimics the time-periodic parallel shear flow generated by low-frequency (e.g. semi-diurnal tides) and small-angle oscillations of the density interface. Such self-induced shear of an oscillating pycnocline may provide an alternate pathway to pycnocline turbulence and diapycnal mixing in addition to the turbulence and mixing driven by wind-induced shear of the surface mixed layer. We theoretically investigate shear instabilities arising in the inviscid two-layered oscillating tank configuration and show that the equation governing the evolution of linear perturbations on the density interface is a Schr\"odinger-type ordinary differential equation with a periodic potential. The necessary and sufficient stability condition is governed by a nondimensional parameter $\beta$ resembling the inverse Richardson number; for two layers of equal thickness, instability arises when $\beta\!&gt;\!1/4$. When this condition is satisfied, the flow is initially stable but finally tunnels into the unstable region after reaching the time marking the turning point. Once unstable, perturbations grow exponentially and reveal characteristics of Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) instability. The Modified Airy Function method, which is an improved variant of the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) theory, is implemented to obtain a uniformly valid, composite approximate solution to the interface evolution. Next, we analyse the fully nonlinear stages of interface evolution by modifying the circulation evolution equation in the standard vortex blob method, which reveals that the interface rolls up into KH billows. Finally, we undertake real case studies of Lake Geneva and Chesapeake Bay to provide a physical perspective.</description>

      <title>Effect of freestream turbulence on the coherent dynamics of a wind turbine wake</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23728v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The wake of a model wind turbine exposed to incoming freestream turbulence (FST) with a variety of turbulent characteristics is studied through Particle Image Velocimetry experiments. The FST cases were produced using different passive turbulence generating grids. The cases spanned turbulent intensities (T&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;) in the range 1.3% &lt; T&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; 14% and only considered short integral length scales L&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;0.2D (where D is the turbine diameter). Increasing T&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; and L&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt; in this range resulted in an earlier breakdown of the tip vortices which in turn resulted in an earlier onset of wake recovery. For all the FST cases considered, the initiation of wake meandering was found to be related to an intrinsic instability of the turbine, even for the cases with the highest FST levels. The amplitudes of wake meandering were similar for all the cases in the near wake (x&lt;2D), but the amplitudes in the far wake (x&gt;4D) were discernibly higher for all the FST cases compared to the no grid case (lowest T&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;), primarily due to the early break down of the tip vortices. Deeper insights into the origins, and subsequent evolution, of the various coherent motions (characterised by particular frequencies) in the presence of FST are obtained through analysis of the multi-scale triple-decomposed coherent kinetic energy budgets. The wake meandering modes in the presence of FST are shown to better utilize the mean velocity shear, extracting more energy from the mean flow while other sources such as non-linear triadic interactions and diffusion also become important.</description>

      <title>Retraction Dynamics of a Highly Viscous Liquid Sheet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04603v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the one-dimensional capillary-driven retraction of a finite, planar liquid sheet in the asymptotic regime where both the Ohnesorge number $\mathrm{Oh}$ and the initial length-to-thickness ratio $l_0/h_0$ are large. In this regime, the fluid domain decomposes into two regions: a thin-film region governed by one-dimensional mass and momentum equations, and a small tip region near the free edge described by a self-similar Stokes flow. Asymptotic matching between these regions yields an effective boundary condition for the thin-film region, representing a balance between viscous and capillary forces at the free edge. Surface tension drives the thin-film flow only through this boundary condition, while the local momentum balance is dominated by viscous and inertial stresses. We show that the thin-film flow possesses a conserved quantity, reducing the equation of thickness to heat equation with time-dependent boundary conditions. The reduced problem depends on a single dimensionless parameter $\mathcal{L} = l_0 / (4 h_0 \mathrm{Oh})$. Numerical solutions of the reduced model agree well with previous studies and reveal that the sheet undergoes distinct retraction regimes depending on $\mathcal{L}$ and a dimensionless time after rupture $T$. We derive asymptotic approximations for the thickness profile, velocity profile, and retraction speed during the early and late stages of retraction. At early times, the retraction speed grows as $T^{1/2}$, while at late times it decays as $1/T^2$. An intermediate regime arises for very long sheets ($\mathcal{L} \gg 1$). During this phase, the retraction speed approaches the Taylor-Culick value. When $T \approx \mathcal{L}$, the speed undergoes fast deceleration from the Taylor-Culick speed to late-time asymptotics.</description>

      <title>Capillary currents and viscous droplet spreading</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.01053v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the results of a combined experimental and theoretical study of the spreading of viscous droplets over rigid substrates. First, we experimentally investigate the wetting of a roughened glass surface by a viscous droplet of silicone oil, wide and shallow relative to the capillary length $\ell_c$. The horizontal radius of the droplet grows according to an $R_\mathrm{drop}\sim t^{1/8}$ scaling reminiscent of viscous gravity currents (Lopez et al. 1976). The droplet is preceded by a mesoscopic fluid film that percolates through the rough substrate, its radius increasing according to $R_\mathrm{film}\sim t^{3/8}/(\log t)^{1/2}$. To rationalize these observed scalings, we develop a new 'capillary current' model for the spreading of shallow droplets with arbitrary radius on rough surfaces. Furthermore, on the basis of established similarities between droplet spreading over wetted rough and smooth substrates (Cazabat &amp; Cohen Stuart 1986), we argue its relevance to a broader class of spreading problems. We propose that, throughout their evolution, shallow droplets maintain a quasi-equilibrium balance between hydrostatic and curvature pressure, perturbed only by unbalanced contact line forces arising along the droplet's edge. For drops with horizontal radii small with respect to $\ell_c$, our model converges to the original description of Hervet &amp; de Gennes (1984) and thereby recovers the classic spreading laws of Hoffman (1975), Voinov (1976), and Tanner (1979). For drops wide with respect to $\ell_c$, it rationalizes why millimetric, surface-tension-driven capillary currents exhibit the same spreading behavior as relatively large-scale viscous gravity currents.</description>

      <title>Blowup driven by critical balance in a differential kinetic model of gravity wave turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23199v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe the blowup scenarios in a phase-parametrized differential approximation kinetic model (N-DAM), inspired by the physics of deep water surface gravity waves and recently obtained using large-$N$ summation techniques under a local approximation in wavenumber space. Previous work showed that the model admits steady-state solutions interpolating between the Kolmogorov-Zakharov spectrum $E(\omega)\propto \omega^{-4}$ and either a strong-turbulence regime $E(\omega)\propto \omega^{-2}$ or the Phillips critical-balance spectrum $E(\omega) \propto \omega^{-5}$ at small scales. These solutions reproduce scaling regimes expected in gravity-wave kinetics, suggesting that the N-DAM may serve as an effective augmented version of an earlier differential approximation model introduced by Hasselmann. Here we investigate finite-time blowup in the N-DAM and show that it is generically governed by the critical-balance regime. This leads to a non-Kolmogorov finite-time transfer of the energy from the IR towards the UV for any value of the parameter $\phi \in [0,\pi)$. We observe a bifurcation in the blowup dynamics from continuous to discrete self-similarity as $\phi$ is increased above a critical value $\phi_*\simeq 2.7$. To our knowledge, this is the first example of a discretely self-similar blowup in the kinetic theory of waves.</description>

      <title>Quaternion wavefunction theory bridges quantum formalism and classical fluid dynamics: a zero-parameter derivation of sphere drag</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.07469v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a quaternion wavefunction formulation that reduces the incompressible Euler equations to a single nonlinear Schr\"odinger-type equation with a holomorphic constraint, revealing hidden geometric structure connecting quantum and classical fluid mechanics. The velocity field emerges from a complex quaternion wavefunction $\Psi \in \mathbb{C} \otimes \mathbb{H}$ satisfying a constrained Gross-Pitaevskii equation, with incompressibility enforced through quaternion analyticity conditions that generalize the Cauchy-Riemann equations to three dimensions. This geometric structure provides a selection principle for physically realized Euler solutions, resolving D'Alembert's 270-year-old paradox through geometry rather than phenomenology. The key insight is that incompressibility corresponds to quaternion holomorphicity, known as the Cauchy-Riemann-Fueter conditions, which selects physical solutions from among the infinitely many weak solutions established by De~Lellis and Sz\'ekelyhidi. Application to steady flow past a sphere yields the Newton regime drag coefficient $C_{D,\infty} = 4/9 \approx 0.44$ as a \textbf{zero-parameter prediction} from quaternion orthogonality constraints, achieving 0.04\% agreement with experiment. This represents the first derivation of this fundamental fluid mechanics constant from first principles. The mechanism parallels how the Kutta condition determines airfoil circulation: quaternion orthogonality constraints break fore-aft pressure symmetry, producing finite drag within inviscid theory.</description>

      <title>A Priori Assessment of Rotational Invariance in Multiscale Convolutional Neural Network-Based Subgrid-Scale Model for Wall-Bounded Turbulent Flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.16995v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study proposes a rotationally invariant data-driven subgrid-scale (SGS) model for large-eddy simulation (LES) of wall-bounded turbulent flows. Building upon the multiscale convolutional neural network subgrid-scale model, which outputs SGS stress tensors ($\tau_{ij}$) as the baseline, the deep neural network (DNN) architecture is modified to satisfy the principle of material objectivity by removing the bias terms and batch normalization layers while incorporating a spatial transformer network (STN) algorithm. The model was trained on a turbulent channel flow at $\mathrm{Re}_\tau = 180$ and evaluated using both non-rotated and rotated inputs. The results show that the model performs well in predicting $\tau_{ij}$ and key turbulence statistics, including dissipation, backscatter, and SGS transport. These quantities reflect the ability of the model to reproduce the energy transfer between the resolved scale and SGS. Moreover, it effectively generalizes to unseen rotated inputs, accurately predicting $\tau_{ij}$ despite the input configurations not being encountered during the training. These findings highlight that modifying the DNN architecture and integrating the STN-based algorithm improves the ability to recognize and correctly respond to rotated inputs. The proposed data-driven SGS model addresses the key limitations of common data-driven SGS approaches, particularly their sensitivity to rotated input conditions. It also marks an important advancement in data-driven SGS modeling for LES, particularly in flow configurations where rotational effects are non-negligible.</description>

      <title>Scale Collapse of Vortices at Porous-Fluid Interfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.10396v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The interaction between externally generated turbulence and porous media is central to many engineering and environmental flows, yet the fate of macroscale vortical structures at a porous/fluid interface remains uncharacterized. By numerically simulating the turbulent flow, we investigate the penetration, breakdown, and turbulence kinetic energy (TKE) transport of macroscale vortices impinging on porous matrices with high porosities $\phi$ = 0.80-0.95. For all porosities considered, macroscale vortices collapse abruptly at the porous interface and do not persist within the matrix, supporting the pore-scale prevalence of turbulence even under strong external forcing. Although vortex impingement injects TKE into the porous medium through turbulent transport at the interface, this supplied TKE is rapidly redistributed and dissipated as the flow reorganizes to satisfy pore-scale geometric constraints. Deeper within the porous layer, turbulence is sustained primarily by local shear production associated with pore-scale velocity gradients, and the internal flow becomes increasingly independent of upstream conditions. Variations in porosity modulate the relative balance between production and dissipation by altering geometric confinement and effective Reynolds number, but the dominant turbulent length scale within the porous matrix remains set by the pore size. These results demonstrate that porous media act as a robust geometric filter that enforces pore-scale-dominated turbulence regardless of the external forcing.</description>

Abstract: This work shows that the interiors of perturbed zero-helicity vortices display simply connected topology with a crescent-shaped boundary. Flux surfaces in fluid and magnetic vortices were explored analytically, while particle trajectories in the context of plasma confinement were examined numerically, demonstrating the existence of both toroidal and simply connected topologies. This new topology appears for perturbations in a broad class, with amplitudes and spatial variance allowed to be arbitrarily small. A corollary of this work proves the closedness of field lines under odd-parity perturbations of zero-helicity vortices in full three dimensional context.</description>

      <title>Global Well-Posedness of the Vacuum Free Boundary Problem for the Degenerate Compressible Navier-Stokes Equations With Large Data of Spherical Symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.06620v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The study of global-in-time dynamics of vacuum is crucial for understanding viscous flows. In particular, physical vacuum, characterized by a moving boundary with nontrivial finite normal acceleration, naturally arises in the motion of shallow water. The corresponding large-data problems for multidimensional spherically symmetric flows remain open, due to the combined difficulties of coordinate singularity at the origin and degeneracy on the moving boundary. In this paper, we analyze the free boundary problem for the barotropic compressible Navier-Stokes equations with density-dependent viscosity coefficients (as in the shallow water equations) in two and three spatial dimensions. For a general class of spherically symmetric initial densities: $\rho_0^{\beta}\in H^3$ with $\beta\in (\frac{1}{3},\gamma-1]$ ($\gamma$: adiabatic exponent), vanishing on the moving boundary in the form of a distance function, we establish the global well-posedness of classical solutions with large initial data. We note that, when $\beta=\gamma-1$, $\rho_0$ contains a physical vacuum, but fails to satisfy the condition required for the Bresch-Desjardins (BD) entropy estimate when $\gamma\ge 2$, precluding the use of the BD entropy estimate to handle the degeneracy of the shallow water equations ({\it i.e.}, the case $\gamma=2$) on the physical vacuum boundary. Our analysis relies on a region-segmentation method: near the origin, we develop an interior BD entropy estimate, leading to flow-map-weighted estimates for the density; near the boundary, to handle the physical vacuum singularity, we introduce novel $\rho_0$-weighted estimates for the effective velocity, which are fundamentally different from the classical BD entropy estimate. Together, these estimates yield the desired global regularities.</description>
