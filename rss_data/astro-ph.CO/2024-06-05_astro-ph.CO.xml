      <title>TDCOSMO. XVII. Measurement of the Hubble Constant from the Lensed Quasar WGD$\,$2038$-$4008</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-delay cosmography is a powerful technique to constrain cosmological parameters, particularly the Hubble constant ($H_{0}$). The TDCOSMO collaboration is performing an ongoing analysis of lensed quasars to constrain cosmology using this method. In this work, we obtain constraints from the lensed quasar~WGD$\,$2038$-$4008~using new time-delay measurements and previous mass models by TDCOSMO. This is the first TDCOSMO lens to incorporate multiple lens modeling codes and the full time-delay covariance matrix into the cosmological inference. The models are fixed before the time delay is measured, and the analysis is performed blinded with respect to the cosmological parameters to prevent unconscious experimenter bias. We obtain $D_{\Delta t} = 1.68^{+0.40}_{-0.38}$ Gpc using two families of mass models, a power-law describing the total mass distribution, and a composite model of baryons and dark matter, although the composite model is disfavored due to kinematics constraints. In a flat $\Lambda$CDM cosmology, we constrain the Hubble constant to be $H_{0} = 65^{+23}_{-14}\, \rm km\ s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}$. The dominant source of uncertainty comes from the time delays, due to the low variability of the quasar. Future long-term monitoring, especially in the era of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time, could catch stronger quasar variability and further reduce the uncertainties. This system will be incorporated into an upcoming hierarchical analysis of the entire TDCOSMO sample, and improved time delays and spatially-resolved stellar kinematics could strengthen the constraints from this system in the future.</description>

      <title>Geometric reheating of the Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the post-inflationary energy transfer from the inflaton ($\phi$) into a scalar field ($\chi$) non-minimally coupled to gravity through $\xi R|\chi|^2$, considering models with inflaton potential $V_{\rm inf} \propto |\phi|^{\,p}$ around $\phi = 0$. This corresponds to the paradigm of {\it geometric preheating}, which we extend to its non-linear regime via lattice simulations. Considering $\alpha$-attractor T-model potentials as a proxy, we study the viability of proper {\it reheating} for $p=2, 4, 6$, determining whether radiation domination (RD) due to energetic dominance of $\chi$ over $\phi$, can be achieved. For large inflationary scales $\Lambda$, reheating is frustrated for $p = 2$, it can be partially achieved for $p = 4$, and it becomes very efficient for $p = 6$. Efficient reheating can be however blocked if $\chi$ sustains self-interactions (unless these are extremely feeble), or if $\Lambda$ is low enough, so that inflaton fragmentation brings the universe rapidly into RD. Whenever RD is achieved, either due to reheating or to inflaton fragmentation, we characterize the energy and time scales of the problem, as a function of $\Lambda$ and $\xi$.</description>

      <title>cosmICweb: Cosmological Initial Conditions for Zoom-in Simulations in the Cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the online service cosmICweb (COSMological Initial Conditions on the WEB) - the first database and web interface to store, analyze, and disseminate initial conditions for zoom simulations of objects forming in cosmological simulations: from galaxy clusters to galaxies and more. Specifically, we store compressed information about the Lagrangian proto-halo patches for all objects in a typical simulation merger tree along with properties of the halo/galaxy across cosmic time. This enables a convenient web-based selection of the desired zoom region for an object fitting user-specified selection criteria. The information about the region can then be used with the MUSIC code to generate the zoom ICs for the simulation. In addition to some other simulations, we currently support all objects in the EAGLE simulation database, so that for example the Auriga simulations are easily reproduced, which we demonstrate explicitly. The framework is extensible to include other simulations through an API that can be added to an existing database structure and with which cosmICweb can then be interfaced. We make the web portal and database publicly available to the community.</description>

      <title>Effect of redshift bin mismatch on cross correlation between DESI Legacy Imaging Survey and Planck CMB lensing potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the importance of precise modelling of the photometric redshift error distributions on the estimation of parameters from cross correlation measurements and present a working example of the scattering matrix formalism to correct for the redshift bin mismatch of objects in tomographic cross correlation analysis. We measured the angular galaxy auto-power spectrum and cross-power spectrum in four tomographic bins with redshift intervals $z = [0.0,0.3,0.45,0.6,0.8]$ from the cross correlation of Planck Cosmic Microwave Background lensing potential and photometric galaxy catalogue from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument Legacy Imaging Survey Data Release 8. We estimated galaxy linear bias and amplitude of cross correlation using maximum likelihood estimation to put constraints on the $\sigma_{8}$ parameter. We show that the modified Lorentzian function used to fit the photometric redshift error distribution performs well only near the peaks of the distribution. We adopt a sum of Gaussians model to capture the broad tails of the error distribution. Our sum of Gaussians model yields $\sim 2-5\,\sigma$ smaller values of cross correlation amplitude compared to the $\Lambda$CDM expectations. We compute the $\sigma_{8}$ parameter after correcting for the redshift bin mismatch of objects following the scattering matrix approach. The $\sigma_{8}$ parameter becomes consistent with $\Lambda$CDM model in the last tomographic bin but shows $\sim 1-3\,\sigma$ tension in other redshift bins.</description>

      <title>Alleviating Hubble constant tension and growth tension via a transition of absolute magnitude favored by Pantheon+ sample</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a cosmological-model-independent method to extract the apparent magnitude and its derivative at different redshifts from the Pantheon+ type Ia supernova sample, and find that the obtained values deviate clearly from the prediction of the $\Lambda$CDM model at the lowest redshift. This deviation can be explained as a result of a transition of the absolute magnitude $M$ in the low redshift region. The observations seem to favor this transition since the minimum values of $\chi^2$ for two ansatzes of a varying $M$ are less than that of a constant $M$. The Hubble constant tension is alleviated from larger than $5\sigma$ to be about $1$ to $2\sigma$ for a varying $M$, and the growth tension can be resolved after attributing the variation of $M$ to a modification of the effective Newton's constant.</description>

      <title>Parameterization of Stochasticity in Galaxy Clustering and Reconstruction of Tomographic Matter Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stochasticity in galaxy clustering, the mismatch between galaxy and underlying matter distribution, suppresses the matter clustering amplitude reconstructed by the combination of galaxy auto-correlation and galaxy-galaxy lensing cross-correlation. In this work, we solve the stochasticity systematics by parameterizing the cross correlation coefficient $r(k)$ between galaxy and matter. We investigate the performance of 12 kinds of parameterization schemes, against the cosmoDC2 $\&amp;$ TNG300-1 galaxy samples over a wide range of redshift and flux cut. The 2-parameter fits are found to describe the stochasticity up to $k_{\rm max}=0.9\,{\rm Mpc^{-1}}h$, while the best performing quadratic scheme $r^2_s(k) = 1+c_1 k+c_2 k^2$ reaches better than $1\%$ accuracy for both the direct ${r}^2_s(k)$ fit and reconstructing matter clustering. Then, we apply the accurate quadratic scheme to forecast the tomographic matter clustering reconstruction by the combination DESI-like LRG $\times$ CSST-like cosmic shear. Depending on assumption of stochasticity, we find that the neglect of a serious stochasticity would result in significant systematic bias in both the reconstruction and the inferred cosmological parameters, even if we adopt scale cut $k_{\rm max}=0.1\,{\rm Mpc^{-1}}h$. We demonstrate the necessity of including stochasticity in reconstruction, and forecast that the reconstruction alone enables a $S_8$ constraint at about $1.5\%$ precision, free from galaxy bias and stochasticity. We will validate our method for DESI spectroscopic survey, and the analysis is expected to be complementary to DESI cosmological constraint by BAO and RSD.</description>

      <title>Primordial black holes: the asteroid mass window</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) are an attractive dark matter candidate, particularly if they can explain the totality of it. At PBH masses below $\sim 10^{17}$g and above $\sim 10^{23}$g this possibility is excluded from the variety of arguments and with different confidence. The range in between, often referred to as the "asteroid mass window", currently remains unconstrained. The most promising, in our view, way to probe this mass range is to use stars as the PBH detectors. If a star captures even a single PBH it starts being accreted onto it and eventually gets destroyed -- converted into a sub-solar mass black hole. This process may have a variety of signatures form a mere star disappearance to supernova-type explosions of a new kind. The viability of this approach depends crucially on the probability of PBH capture by stars. In this chapter we summarize the existing capture mechanisms and discuss their implications for constraining the abundance of (or perhaps discovering) PBHs in the asteroid mass window.</description>

      <title>Impact of the Epoch of Reionization sources on the 21-cm bispectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The morphology of the 21-cm signal emitted by the neutral hydrogen present in the intergalactic medium (IGM) during the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) depends both on the properties of the sources of ionizing radiation and on the underlying physical processes within the IGM. Variation in the morphology of the IGM 21-cm signal due to the different sources of the EoR is expected to have a significant impact on the 21-cm bispectrum, which is one of the crucial observable statistics that can evaluate the non-Gaussianity present in the signal and which can be estimated from radio interferometric observations of the EoR. Here we present the 21-cm bispectrum for different reionization scenarios assuming different simulated models for the sources of reionization. We also demonstrate how well the 21-cm bispectrum can distinguish between different IGM 21-cm signal morphologies, arising due to the differences in the reionization scenarios, which will help us shed light on the nature of the sources of ionizing photons. Our estimated large-scale bispectrum for all unique $k$-triangle shapes shows a significant difference in their magnitude and sign across different reionization scenarios. Additionally, our focused analysis of bispectrum for a few specific $k$-triangle shapes (e.g. squeezed-limit, linear, and shapes in the vicinity of the squeezed-limit) shows that the large scale 21-cm bispectrum can distinguish between reionization scenarios that show inside-out, outside-in and a combination of inside-out and outside-in morphologies. These results highlight the potential of using the 21-cm bispectrum for constraining different reionization scenarios.</description>

      <title>The FLAMINGO Project: A comparison of galaxy cluster samples selected on mass, X-ray luminosity, Compton-Y parameter, or galaxy richness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galaxy clusters provide an avenue to expand our knowledge of cosmology and galaxy evolution. Because it is difficult to accurately measure the total mass of a large number of individual clusters, cluster samples are typically selected using an observable proxy for mass. Selection effects are therefore a key problem in understanding galaxy cluster statistics. We make use of the $(2.8~\rm{Gpc})^3$ FLAMINGO hydrodynamical simulation to investigate how selection based on X-ray luminosity, thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect or galaxy richness influences the halo mass distribution. We define our selection cuts based on the median value of the observable at a fixed mass and compare the resulting samples to a mass-selected sample. We find that all samples are skewed towards lower mass haloes. For X-ray luminosity and richness cuts below a critical value, scatter dominates over the trend with mass and the median mass becomes biased increasingly low with respect to a mass-selected sample. At $z\leq0.5$, observable cuts corresponding to median halo masses between $M_\text{500c}=10^{14}$ and $10^{15}~\rm{M_{\odot}}$ give nearly unbiased median masses for all selection methods, but X-ray selection results in biased medians for higher masses. For cuts corresponding to median masses $&lt;10^{14}$ at $z\leq0.5$ and for all masses at $z\geq1$, only Compton-Y selection yields nearly unbiased median masses. Importantly, even when the median mass is unbiased, the scatter is not because for each selection the sample is skewed towards lower masses than a mass-selected sample. Each selection leads to a different bias in secondary quantities like cool-core fraction, temperature and gas fraction.</description>

      <title>Toward the measurement of neutrino masses: Performance of cosmic magnification with submillimeter galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The phenomenon of magnification bias can induce a non-negligible angular correlation between two samples of galaxies with nonoverlapping redshift distributions. This signal is particularly clear when background submillimeter galaxies are used, and has been shown to constitute an independent cosmological probe. This work extends prior studies on the submillimeter galaxy magnification bias to the massive neutrino scenario, with the aim being to assess its sensitivity as a cosmological observable to the sum of neutrino masses. The measurements of the angular cross-correlation function between moderate redshift GAMA galaxies and high-redshift submillimeter H-ATLAS galaxies are fit to the weak lensing prediction down to the arcmin scale. The signal is interpreted under the halo model, which is modified to accommodate massive neutrinos. We discuss the impact of the choice of cosmological parametrization on the sensitivity to neutrino masses. The currently available data on the magnification bias affecting submillimeter galaxies are sensitive to neutrino masses when a cosmological parametrization in terms of the primordial amplitude of the power spectrum $(A_s$) is chosen over the local root mean square of smoothed linear density perturbations $(\sigma_8$). A clear upper limit on the sum of neutrino masses can be derived if the value of $A_s$ is either fixed or assigned a narrow Gaussian prior, a behavior that is robust against changes to the chosen value.</description>

      <title>Joint Modelling of Astrophysical Systematics for Cosmology with LSST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel framework for jointly modelling the weak lensing source galaxy redshift distribution and the intrinsic alignment of galaxies via a shared luminosity function (LF). Considering this framework within the context of a Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) Year 1 and Year 10 cosmic shear analysis, we first demonstrate the substantial impact of the LF on both source galaxy redshift distributions and the intrinsic alignment contamination. We establish how the individual parameters of a Schechter LF model impact the redshift distribution of a magnitude-limited sample, and we demonstrate the effect of marginalising over the LF parameters as incorporated in the intrinsic alignment modelling of a standard cosmic shear analysis set-up. We forecast the impact of our joint modelling framework on cosmological parameter constraints. Our preliminary results are promising, indicating that this framework can yield cosmological constraints consistent with those expected from standard analyses, enhanced by the flexibility of not fixing LF parameters. We plan to further validate these findings with comprehensive Markov chain Monte Carlo simulations to robustly quantify bias avoidance and underscore the framework's efficacy. Taking advantage of our forecasting results and the parameter degeneracies, we identify the specific impact of the shape of the LF of source galaxies on the cosmic shear data vector. We also discuss the potential of this method in providing a way to model generic selection functions in redshift distribution estimation, as well as its possibilities for extension to a 3x2pt analysis, particularly with respect to incorporating galaxy bias in this luminosity-function-based framework. Although we consider the context of LSST cosmic shear in this work, the proposed joint modelling framework is generically applicable to weak lensing surveys.</description>

      <title>A field-level emulator for modified gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stage IV dark energy surveys such as the Vera C. Rubin Observatory and Euclid present a unique opportunity to shed light on the nature of dark energy. However, the full constraining power of the new data cannot be unlocked unless accurate predictions are available at all observable scales. Currently, only the linear regime is well understood in models beyond $\Lambda$CDM: on the nonlinear scales, expensive numerical simulations become necessary, making their direct use impractical in the analyses of large datasets. Recently, machine learning techniques have shown potential to break this impasse: by training emulators, we can reproduce complex data fields in a fraction of the time it takes to produce them.
  In this work, we present a field-level emulator capable of turning a $\Lambda$CDM N-body simulation into one evolved under $f(R)$ gravity. To achieve this, we build on the map2map neural network, using the strength of modified gravity $|f_{R_0}|$ as style parameter. We find that our emulator correctly estimates the changes it needs to apply to the positions and velocities of the input N-body particles to produce the target simulation.
  We test the performance of our network against several summary statistics, finding $1\%$ agreement in the power spectrum up to $k \sim 1$ $h/$Mpc, and $1.5\%$ agreement against the independent boost emulator eMantis. Although the algorithm is trained on fixed cosmological parameters, we find it can extrapolate to models it was not trained on. Coupled with available field-level emulators and simulations suites for $\Lambda$CDM, our algorithm can be used to constrain modified gravity in the large-scale structure using full information available at the field-level.</description>

      <title>Can recent DESI BAO measurements accommodate a negative cosmological constant?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anti-de Sitter vacuum, which correspond to a negative cosmological constant (CC), is theoretically important and well-motivated. It is interesting to see whether current data can allow the existence of a negative CC not. In this paper, we perform the MCMC analysis for the $w_0w_a$CDM+CC model using recent DESI BAO measurements combined with Planck CMB and Pantheon Plus dataset. The results reveal that the bestfit energy density of CC is $\Omega_\Lambda\sim -0.3$ and the fitting to DESI is slightly improved, while $\Omega_\Lambda=0$ is also $1\sigma$ consistent.</description>

      <title>Discrepancies Between JWST Observations and Simulations of Quenched Massive Galaxies at $z &gt; 3$: A Comparative Study With IllustrisTNG and ASTRID</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent JWST observations have uncovered an unexpectedly large population of massive quiescent galaxies at $z&gt;3$. Using the cosmological simulations IllustrisTNG and ASTRID, we identify analogous galaxies and investigate their abundance, formation, quenching mechanisms, and post-quenching evolution for stellar masses $9.5 &lt; \log_{10}{(M_\star/{\rm M}_\odot)} &lt; 12$. We apply three different quenching definitions and find that both simulations significantly underestimate the comoving number density of quenched massive galaxies at $z \gtrsim 3$ compared to JWST observations by up to $\sim 2$ dex. This fact highlights the necessity for improved physical models of AGN feedback in galaxy formation simulations. In both simulations, the high-$z$ quenched massive galaxies often host overmassive central black holes above the standard $M_{BH}-M_\star$ relation, implying that the AGN feedback plays a crucial role in quenching galaxies in the early Universe. The typical quenching timescales for these galaxies are $\sim 200-600$ Myr. IllustrisTNG primarily employs AGN kinetic feedback, while ASTRID relies on AGN thermal feedback, which is less effective and has a longer quenching timescale. We also study the post-quenching evolution of the high-$z$ massive quiescent galaxies and find that many experience subsequent reactivation of star formation, evolving into primary progenitors of $z=0$ brightest cluster galaxies.</description>

      <title>Higher-order corrections to phase-transition parameters in dimensional reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of phase transitions (PT) in quantum field theories at finite temperature is most accurately described within the framework of dimensional reduction. In this framework, thermodynamic quantities are computed within the 3-dimensional effective field theory (EFT) that results from integrating out the high-temperature Matsubara modes. However, strong-enough PTs, observable in gravitational wave (GW) detectors, occur often nearby the limit of validity of the EFT, where effective operators can no longer be neglected. Here, we perform a quantitative analysis of the impact of these interactions on the determination of PT parameters. We find that they allow for strong PTs in a wider region of parameter space, and that both the peak frequency and the amplitude of the resulting GW power spectrum can change by more than one order of magnitude when they are included. As a byproduct of this work, we derive equations for computing the bounce solution in the presence of higher-derivative terms, consistently with the EFT power counting.</description>

      <title>A comparison of pre-existing $\Lambda$CDM predictions with the abundance of JWST galaxies at high redshift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02672v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Observations with the James Webb Space Telescope have revealed a high abundance of bright galaxies at redshift, $z\gtrsim 12$, which has been widely interpreted as conflicting with the $\Lambda$CDM model. In Cowley et al. (2018) predictions were made - prior to the JWST observations - for the expected abundance of these galaxies using the Durham semi-analytic galaxy formation model, GALFORM, which is known to produce a realistic population of galaxies at lower redshifts including the present day. Key to this model is the assumption of a "top-heavy" initial mass function of stars formed in bursts (required to explain the number counts and redshift distribution of sub-millimetre galaxies). Here, we compare the rest-frame ultraviolet luminosity functions derived from JWST observations with those predicted by the Cowley et al. model up to $z=14$ and make further predictions for $z=16$. We find that below $z\sim 10$, the Cowley et al. predictions agree very well with observations, while agreement at $z\gtrsim12$ requires extending the model to take into account the timescale for the growth of obscuring dust grains and its dependence on gas metallicity. We trace the evolution of these galaxies from $z=14$ to $z=0$ and find that their descendants typically reside in halos with a median mass of $10^{13.6}\,h^{-1}\,\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$. The stellar masses of the descendants range from $10^{7}\,h^{-1}\,\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ to $10^{11.5}\,h^{-1}\,\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$. Although these galaxies were all central galaxies at $z=14$, nearly half of their descendants end up as satellites in massive halos.</description>

      <title>Holographic motivations and observational evidence for decreasing dark energy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02688v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Negative lambda gravitational effective field theories dual to holographic CFTs have potentially realistic cosmological solutions. Generic cosmological solutions of these effective field theories have scalar field evolution that can lead to a period of accelerated expansion when the scalar field is at positive values of its potential (Fig. 1). If such a model describes our universe, significant evolution of dark energy is expected over a Hubble time as the scalar descends from positive to negative values of its potential towards the AdS extremum. Our recent observational study 2305.04946 based on supernova and baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) observations suggests that significant evolution of dark energy associated with a descending scalar field may be preferred by data (Fig. 2). Taking a linear approximation to the scalar potential around the present value, a standard likelihood analysis gives an $e^{- \chi^2/2}$ distribution in which $dV/dt$ is presently negative in $99.99 \%$ of the distribution, with a mean fractional variation of the potential of $36 \%$ over the period $z \lessapprox 2$ over which supernova data is available. In this note, we review these theoretical and observational results and provide an update on the question of how the physics of these cosmological solutions can be related to the physics of the underlying CFT.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: \textit{LiteBIRD}, the next-generation cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiment, aims for a launch in Japan's fiscal year 2032, marking a major advancement in the exploration of primordial cosmology and fundamental physics. Orbiting the Sun-Earth Lagrangian point L2, this JAXA-led strategic L-class mission will conduct a comprehensive mapping of the CMB polarization across the entire sky. During its 3-year mission, \textit{LiteBIRD} will employ three telescopes within 15 unique frequency bands (ranging from 34 through 448 GHz), targeting a sensitivity of 2.2\,$\mu$K-arcmin and a resolution of 0.5$^\circ$ at 100\,GHz. Its primary goal is to measure the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ with an uncertainty $\delta r = 0.001$, including systematic errors and margin. If $r \geq 0.01$, \textit{LiteBIRD} expects to achieve a $&gt;5\sigma$ detection in the $\ell=$2-10 and $\ell=$11-200 ranges separately, providing crucial insight into the early Universe. We describe \textit{LiteBIRD}'s scientific objectives, the application of systems engineering to mission requirements, the anticipated scientific impact, and the operations and scanning strategies vital to minimizing systematic effects. We will also highlight \textit{LiteBIRD}'s synergies with concurrent CMB projects.</description>

      <title>No Significant Redshift Evolution in the Intrinsic Scatter of the $M_\bullet$-$M_\star$ Relation for Overmassive Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the local Universe, the ratio between the mass of a central black hole and the stellar mass of its host galaxy is $\sim 0.1 \%$. Recently, JWST discovered numerous galaxies at $z&gt;4$ that seem to deviate from the local relation, with black holes overmassive by $10-100$ times. Similar galaxies were also discovered at cosmic noon. The intrinsic scatter in the relation describes how much the evolutionary histories of the single galaxies deviate from the mean evolutionary pattern of their parent dataset. This Research Note examines whether a cosmic evolution of the intrinsic scatter can be detected by assessing its value for datasets in various redshift ranges. Using data from the local Universe ($z &lt; 0.055$), low ($ 0.4 \leq z \leq 0.9$), intermediate ($ 0.9 \leq z \leq 4$), and high ($z &gt; 4$) redshift, we conclude that there is no statistically significant redshift evolution of the intrinsic scatter.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Dark Frontier: White Dwarf-Based Constraints on Light Dark Matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the vast expanse of our galaxy, white dwarfs (WDs) are natural sentinels, capturing the enigmatic dark matter (DM) particles that incessantly traverse their interiors. These celestial bodies provide a unique vantage point for probing interactions between DM particles and their constituents-nuclei or electrons-should such interactions exist. The captured DM particles may accumulate, undergo mutual annihilation, or be evaporated by the WD's own nuclei or electrons, thereby perturbing the standard cooling sequence predicted by stellar evolution theory. This letter reports pioneering constraints on DM-electron interactions derived from an in-depth analysis of four pulsating WDs. By leveraging the period variation rates of their pulsation modes, we delineate the following constraints: for a form factor $F(q) = 1$, in the DM mass range $20 \mathrm{MeV}/c^{2} \lesssim m_{\chi} \lesssim 80 \mathrm{MeV}/c^{2}$ with a cross-section limit of $\sigma_{\chi,e} \lesssim 10^{-56} \mathrm{cm}^{2}$; for a form factor $F(q) = (\alpha m_{e})^{2}/q^{2}$, in a the DM mass range $20\mathrm{MeV}/c^{2} \lesssim m_{\chi} \lesssim 70 \mathrm{MeV}/c^{2}$ with a limit of $\sigma_{\chi,e} \lesssim 10^{-52} \mathrm{cm}^{2}$. These newly established constraints surpass current direct detection experiments by over fifteen orders of magnitude, forging a path into the uncharted territories of the DM parameter space. This work not only advances our understanding of light dark matter-electron interactions but also exemplifies the potential of WDs as important astrophysical laboratories for probing the elusive nature of DM.</description>

Abstract: Increased interest in pushing the frontier of gravitational wave searches to higher frequencies (kHz and beyond) has resulted in a variety of different proposed experimental concepts. A significant fraction of them are based on the coupling between classical electromagnetism and gravity. We highlight some differences and similarities between different approaches, showcasing the rich phenomenology arising from this coupling. We use the opportunity to re-derive the response function of interferometers as the low-frequency limit of a broader picture.

Abstract: Pulsar timing array (PTA) data releases showed strong evidence for a stochastic gravitational-wave background in the nanohertz band. When the signal is interpreted by a scenario of scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGWs), we encounter overproduction of primordial black holes (PBHs). We wonder if varying the equation of state (EoS) of the early Universe can resolve this issue and thereby lead to a consistent interpretation of the PTA data. Analyzing a data combination of PTA, big-bang nucleosynthesis, and cosmic microwave background, we find that an epoch with EoS $w\sim\mathcal{O}(10^{-2})$ between the end of inflation and the onset of radiation domination can significantly suppress the production of PBHs, leading to alleviation of the PBH-overproduction issue. With the inferred interval $w=0.44_{-0.40}^{+0.52}$ at 95\% confidence level, our scenario can interpret the PTA data just as well as the conventional scenario of SIGWs produced during the radiation domination.</description>

      <title>FREmu: Power Spectrum Emulator for $f(R)$ Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05840v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To investigate gravity in the non-linear regime of cosmic structure using measurements from Stage-IV surveys, it is imperative to accurately compute large-scale structure observables, such as non-linear matter power spectra, for gravity models that extend beyond general relativity. However, the theoretical predictions of non-linear observables are typically derived from N-body simulations, which demand substantial computational resources. In this study, we introduce a novel public emulator, termed FREmu, designed to provide rapid and precise forecasts of non-linear power spectra specifically for the Hu-Sawicki $f(R)$ gravity model across scales $0.0089 h \mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}&lt;k&lt;0.5 h \mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ and redshifts $0&lt;z&lt;3$. FREmu leverages Principal Component Analysis and Artificial Neural Networks to establish a mapping from parameters to power spectra, utilizing training data derived from the Quijote-MG simulation suite. With a parameter space encompassing 7 dimensions, including $\Omega_m$, $\Omega_b$, $h$, $n_s$, $\sigma_8$, $M_{\nu}$ and $f_{R_0}$, the emulator achieves an accuracy exceeding 95% for the majority of cases, thus proving to be highly efficient for constraining parameters.</description>

      <title>Regularized-Renormalized-Resummed loop corrected power spectrum of non-singular bounce with Primordial Black Hole formation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06882v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a complete and consistent exposition of the regularization, renormalization, and resummation procedures in the setup of having a contraction and then non-singular bounce followed by inflation with a sharp transition from slow-roll (SR) to ultra-slow roll (USR) phase for generating primordial black holes (PBHs). We consider following an effective field theory (EFT) approach and study the quantum loop corrections to the power spectrum from each phase. We demonstrate the complete removal of quadratic UV divergences after renormalization and softened logarithmic IR divergences after resummation and illustrate the scheme-independent nature of our renormalization approach. We further show that the addition of a contracting and bouncing phase allows us to successfully generate PBHs of solar-mass order, $M_{\rm PBH}\sim {\cal O}(M_{\odot})$, by achieving the minimum e-folds during inflation to be $\Delta N_{\rm Total}\sim {\cal O}(60)$ and in this process successfully evading the strict no-go theorem. We notice that varying the effective sound speed between $0.88\leq c_{s}\leq 1$, allows the peak spectrum amplitude to lie within $10^{-3}\leq A \leq 10^{-2}$, indicating that causality and unitarity remain protected in the theory. We analyse PBHs in the extremely small, $M_{\rm PBH}\sim {\cal O}(10^{-33}-10^{-27})M_{\odot}$, and the large, $M_{\rm PBH}\sim {\cal O}(10^{-6}-10^{-1})M_{\odot}$, mass limits and confront the PBH abundance results with the latest microlensing constraints. We also study the cosmological beta functions across all phases and find their interpretation consistent in the context of bouncing and inflationary scenarios while satisfying the pivot scale normalization requirement. Further, we estimate the spectral distortion effects and shed light on controlling PBH overproduction.</description>

Abstract: Cosmic shear is a key probe of modern cosmology. Amongst its challenges are shape noise and intrinsic alignments, both due to our ignorance of the unlensed shape of the source galaxies. I argue here that Einstein rings may be used as standard shapes to measure the external shear along their line of sight. In the Euclid era, this new observable is expected to be a competitive and complementary probe of the large-scale structure of the Universe.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19910v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cosmic objects with magnetic fields (quasars, radiogalaxies) are observed at redshifts $z\geq 7$ (Wang et al., 2021, Fan et al., 2023, Yang et al., 2024) and more (for instance, for $z = 10.073\pm 0.002$, Goulding et al., 2023) indicates the early creation of magnetic fields. The observations of the cosmic telescope JWST show that the first galaxies were formed at redshifts $z\simeq$ 15 -- 20. We link the transformation of the low mass dark matter halos into galaxies with the creation of the first stars owing to the radiative cooling of partly ionized hydrogen at $z\geq 10$. The early formation of galaxies creates favourable conditions for high impact of the Compton scattering of the relic radiation photons and electrons on the electron temperature and leads to the partial separation of electrons and protons. Together with turbulent motions such separation stimulates creation of magnetic fields on a galactic scale. The same processes distort the primordial perturbations of the relic radiation what can be observed and confirmed in special simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01668v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: If millicharged particles (MCPs) exist they can be created in the atmosphere when high energy cosmic rays collide with nuclei and could subsequently be detected at neutrino experiments. We extend previous work, which considered MCPs from decays of light mesons and proton bremsstrahlung, by including production from $\Upsilon$ meson decays and the Drell-Yan process. MCPs with masses below a GeV primarily arise from proton bremsstrahlung, while heavier MCPs predominantly originate from heavy meson decays and Drell-Yan. We analyse the resulting single scatter and multiple scatter signals at SuperK and JUNO. Searches for low energy coincident signals at JUNO will be sensitive to MCPs with milli-charges up to an order of magnitude beyond current constraints for MCP masses between 2 GeV and 10 GeV.</description>

Abstract: Dark photons that kinetically mix with the Standard Model photon give rise to new spectral anisotropies (patchy dark screening) in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) due to conversion of photons to dark photons within large-scale structure. We utilize predictions for this patchy dark screening signal to provide the tightest constraints to date on the dark photon kinetic mixing parameter ($\varepsilon \lesssim 4\times 10^{-8}$ (95% confidence level)) over the mass range $10^{-13} \,\, {\rm eV} \lesssim m_{{A^\prime}} \lesssim 10^{-11}$ eV, almost an order of magnitude stronger than previous limits, by applying state-of-the-art component separation techniques to the cross-correlation of $\textit{Planck}$ CMB and $\textit{unWISE}$ galaxy survey data.</description>
