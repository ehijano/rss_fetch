      <title>Genetics-based deperturbation analysis for the spin-orbit coupled ${\rm A}^1\Sigma^+$ and ${\rm b}^3\Pi_{0^+}$ states of LiRb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a deperturbation analysis of the spin-orbit coupled $\rm A^1\Sigma^+$ and $\rm b^3\Pi_{0^+}$ states of LiRb based on the rovibrational energy levels observed previously by photoassociation spectroscopy in bosonic $^7$Li$^{85}$Rb molecule. Using the genetic algorithm, we fit the potential energy curves of the $\rm A^1\Sigma^+$ state and the $\rm b^3\Pi$ state into point-wise form. We then fit these point-wise potentials along with the spin-orbit coupling into expanded Morse oscillator functional form and optimise analytical parameters based on the experimental data. From the fitted results, we calculate the transition dipole moment matrix elements for transitions from the rovibrational levels of the coupled $\rm A^1\Sigma^+$-$\rm b^3\Pi_{0^+}$ state to the Feshbach state and the absolute rovibrational ground state for fermionic $^6$Li$^{87}$Rb molecule. Based on the calculated transition dipole moment matrix elements, several levels of the coupled $\rm A^1\Sigma^+$-$\rm b^3\Pi_{0^+}$ state are predicted to be suitable as the intermediate state for stimulated Raman adiabatic passage transfer from the Feshbach state to the absolute rovibrational ground state. In addition, we also provide a similar estimation for ${\rm B}^1\Pi$-${\rm c}^3\Sigma_1^+$-${\rm b}^3\Pi_1$ state based on available $ab\ initio$ interaction potentials.</description>

      <title>Exploring atom-ion Feshbach resonances below the s-wave limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Revealing the quantum properties of matter requires a high degree of experimental control accompanied by a profound theoretical understanding. At ultracold temperatures, quantities that appear continuous in everyday life, such as the motional angular momentum of two colliding particles, become quantized, leaving a measurable imprint on experimental results. Embedding a single particle within a larger quantum bath at lowest temperatures can result in resonant partial-wave dependent interaction, whose strength near zero energy is dictated by universal threshold scaling laws. Hybrid atom-ion systems have emerged as a novel platform in which a single charged atom in an ultracold bath serves as a well-controlled impurity of variable energy. However, entering the low-energy s-wave regime and exploring the role of higher-partial-wave scattering within has remained an open challenge. Here, we immerse a Barium ion in a cloud of ultracold spin-polarized Lithium atoms, realize tunable collision energies below the s-wave limit and explore resonant higher-partial-wave scattering by studying the energy dependence of Feshbach resonances. Utilizing precise electric field control, we tune the collision energy over four orders of magnitude, reaching from the many-parital-wave to the s-wave regime. At the lowest energies, we probe the energy dependence of an isolated s-wave Feshbach resonance and introduce a theoretical model that allows to distinguish it from higher-partial-wave resonances. Additionally, at energies around the p-wave barrier, we find and identify an open-channel f-wave resonance, consistent with threshold laws. Our findings highlight and benchmark the importance of higher-partial-wave scattering well within the s-wave regime and offer control over chemical reactions and complex many-body dynamics in atom-ion ensembles - on the level of individual angular momentum quanta.</description>

      <title>Simulation of sympathetic cooling efficiency in a linear Paul trap driven by alternative waveforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cooling of ions or other charged particles in electromagnetic traps is an essential tool to achieve control over their degrees of freedom on the quantum level. For many objects, there is no viable route for direct cooling, such as an accessible laser cooling transition. In such a case, the sympathetic cooling can be used, where a particle with such a direct route is used to cool down the other particle via Coulomb interaction. On the downside, this cooling process often is inefficient. Here, we numerically evaluate the sympathetic cooling performance in a quadrupole ion trap for different driving waveforms. We find that using different driving waveforms and optimized trap parameters the sympathetic cooling performance can be enhanced. These results will open up the way to achieve larger sympathetic cooling rates from which many techniques, such as aluminum ion clocks, might profit.</description>

      <title>Clock-line-mediated Sisyphus Cooling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate sub-recoil Sisyphus cooling using the long-lived $^{3}\mathrm{P}_{0}$ clock state in alkaline-earth-like ytterbium. A 1388 nm optical standing wave nearly resonant with the $^{3}\textrm{P}_{0}$$\,\rightarrow$$\,^{3}\textrm{D}_{1}$ transition creates a spatially periodic light shift of the $^{3}\textrm{P}_{0}$ clock state. Following excitation on the ultranarrow clock transition, we observe Sisyphus cooling in this potential, as the light shift is correlated with excitation to $^{3}\textrm{D}_{1}$ and subsequent spontaneous decay to the $^{1}\textrm{S}_{0}$ ground state. We observe that cooling enhances the loading efficiency of atoms into a 759 nm magic-wavelength one-dimensional (1D) optical lattice, as compared to standard Doppler cooling on the $^{1}\textrm{S}_{0}$$\,\rightarrow\,$$^{3}\textrm{P}_{1}$ transition. Sisyphus cooling yields temperatures below 200 nK in the weakly confined, transverse dimensions of the 1D optical lattice. These lower temperatures improve optical lattice clocks by facilitating the use of shallow lattices with reduced light shifts, while retaining large atom numbers to reduce the quantum projection noise. This Sisyphus cooling can be pulsed or continuous and is applicable to a range of quantum metrology applications.</description>

      <title>Observation of full contrast icosahedral Bose-Einstein statistics in laser desorbed, buffer gas cooled C$_{60}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum mechanical nature of spherical top molecules is particularly evident at low angular momentum quantum number J. Using infrared spectroscopy on the 8.4$\mu$m rovibrational band of buffer gas cooled $^{12}$C$_{60}$, we observe the hitherto unseen R(J = 0 - 29) rotational progression, including the complete disappearance of certain transitions due to the molecule's perfect icosahedral symmetry and identical bosonic nuclei. The observation of extremely weak C$_{60}$ absorption is facilitated by a laser desorption C$_{60}$ vapor source, which transfers 1000-fold less heat to the cryogenic buffer gas cell than a traditional oven source. This technique paves the way to cooling C$_{60}$ and other large gas phase molecules to much lower temperatures, providing continued advances for spectral resolution and sensitivity.</description>

      <title>Achieving Cooling Without Repump Lasers Through Ion Motional Heating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Laser cooling typically requires one or more repump lasers to clear dark states and enable recycling transitions. Here, we have achieved cooling of Be+ ions using a single laser beam, facilitated by one-dimensional heating through micromotion. By manipulating the displacement from the trap's nodal line, we precisely controlled the ion micromotion direction and speed, reaching up to 3144 m/s, which corresponds to a 7.1 GHz Doppler frequency shift in our experiment. This approach eliminates the necessity of a 1.25 GHz offset repump laser while keeping the Be+ ions cold in the perpendicular direction. Measurements were taken using cooling laser detuning and imaging of ion trajectories. Molecular dynamics simulations, based on machine learned time-dependent electric field E(X, Y, Z, t) inside the trap, accurately reproduced the experimental observation, illuminating the relationship between the direction of micromotion and the trapping electric filed vector. This work not only provides a robust method for managing the micromotion velocity of ions but also sheds light on laser cooling complex systems that require multiple repumping lasers. Additionally, it offers a method for controlling energy in the context of ion-molecule collision investigations.</description>

      <title>A Space Group Symmetry Informed Network for O(3) Equivariant Crystal Tensor Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12888v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the prediction of general tensor properties of crystalline materials, including dielectric, piezoelectric, and elastic tensors. A key challenge here is how to make the predictions satisfy the unique tensor equivariance to O(3) group and invariance to crystal space groups. To this end, we propose a General Materials Tensor Network (GMTNet), which is carefully designed to satisfy the required symmetries. To evaluate our method, we curate a dataset and establish evaluation metrics that are tailored to the intricacies of crystal tensor predictions. Experimental results show that our GMTNet not only achieves promising performance on crystal tensors of various orders but also generates predictions fully consistent with the intrinsic crystal symmetries. Our code is publicly available as part of the AIRS library (https://github.com/divelab/AIRS).</description>

      <title>Long-range interactions in Weyl dense atomic arrays protected from dissipation and disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Long-range interactions are a key resource in many quantum phenomena and technologies. Free-space photons mediate power-law interactions but lack tunability and suffer from decoherence processes due to their omnidirectional emission. Engineered dielectrics can yield tunable and coherent interactions, but typically at the expense of making them both shorter-ranged and sensitive to material disorder and photon loss. Here, we propose a platform that can circumvent all these limitations based on three-dimensional subwavelength atomic arrays subjected to magnetic fields. Our key result is to show how to design the polaritonic bands of these atomic metamaterials to feature a pair of frequency-isolated Weyl points. These Weyl excitations can thus mediate interactions that are simultaneously long-range, due to their gapless nature; robust, due to the topological protection of Weyl points; and decoherence-free, due to their subradiant character. We demonstrate the robustness of these isolated Weyl points for a large regime of interatomic distances and magnetic field values and characterize the emergence of their corresponding Fermi arcs surface states. The latter can as well lead to two-dimensional, non-reciprocal atomic interactions with no analogue in other chiral quantum optical setups.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Instabilities of Strongly Interacting Ultracold Fermions in an Optical Cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13548v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent quench experiments on ultra cold fermions in optical cavities provide a clean platform for studying how long-range interactions between fermions structure their dynamics. Motivated by these experiments, we provide a theoretical analysis of the dynamical instabilities that lead to the formation of superradiance as the hybrid system is driven across the self-organization transition. We compute the rate at which order forms and quantify the fluctuations of the pre-quench state which seed the instability. Our results quantitatively match existing experiments on free fermions and make predictions for quench experiments involving near unitary fermi gases coupled to an optical cavity. Our work suggests that the non-local nature of the photon-mediated interactions between fermions generates ordering dynamics that are qualitatively different than those observed in short-range interacting systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.10120v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we conduct atomistic-level molecular dynamics simulations on fixed-sized silicon-germanium (Si$_{1-x}$Ge$_{x}$) crystals to elucidate the effects of dopant concentration and temperature on the crystalline inter-planar distances. Our calculations consider a range of Ge dopant concentrations between pure Si (0%) and 15%, and for both the optimised system state and a temperature of 300 K. We observe a linear relationship between Ge concentration and inter-planar distance and lattice constant, in line with the approximation of Vegard's Law, and other experimental and computational results. These findings will be employed in conjunction with future studies to establish precise tolerances for use in crystal growth, crucial for the manufacture of crystals intended for emerging gamma-ray crystal-based light source technologies.</description>

      <title>Chip-Scale Point-Source Sagnac Interferometer by Phase-Space Squeezing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16972v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Matter-wave interferometry is essential to both science and technology. Phase-space squeezing has been shown to be an advantageous source of atoms, whereby the spread in momentum is decreased. Here, we show that the opposite squeezing may be just as advantageous. As an exemplification, we analyze the effect of such a source on point source atom interferometry (PSI), which enables rotation sensing. We describe how a squeezed PSI (SPSI) increases the sensitivity and dynamic range while facilitating short cycle times and high repetition rates. We present regions in parameter space for which the figures of merit are improved by orders of magnitude and show that under some definition of compactness, the SPSI is superior by more than four orders of magnitude. The SPSI thus enables either enhancing the performance for standard size devices or maintaining the performance while miniaturizing to a chip-scale device, opening the door to real-life applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.15779v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A unitary Fermi gas in an isotropic harmonic trap is predicted to show scale and conformal symmetry that have important consequences in its thermodynamic and dynamical properties. By experimentally realizing a unitary Fermi gas in an isotropic harmonic trap, we demonstrate its universal expansion dynamics along each direction and at different temperatures. We show that as a consequence of SO(2,1) symmetry, the measured release energy is equal to that of the trapping energy. We further observe the breathing mode with an oscillation frequency twice the trapping frequency and a small damping rate, providing the evidence of SO(2,1) symmetry. In addition, away from resonance when scale invariance is broken, we determine the effective exponent $\gamma$ that relates the chemical potential and average density along the BEC-BCS crossover, which qualitatively agrees with the mean field predictions. This work opens the possibility of studying non-equilibrium dynamics in a conformal invariant system in the future.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.16177v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Assembling and maintaining large arrays of individually addressable atoms is a key requirement for continued scaling of neutral-atom-based quantum computers and simulators. In this work, we demonstrate a new paradigm for assembly of atomic arrays, based on a synergistic combination of optical tweezers and cavity-enhanced optical lattices, and the incremental filling of a target array from a repetitively filled reservoir. In this protocol, the tweezers provide microscopic rearrangement of atoms, while the cavity-enhanced lattices enable the creation of large numbers of optical traps with sufficient depth for rapid low-loss imaging of atoms. We apply this protocol to demonstrate near-deterministic filling (99% per-site occupancy) of 1225-site arrays of optical traps. Because the reservoir is repeatedly filled with fresh atoms, the array can be maintained in a filled state indefinitely. We anticipate that this protocol will be compatible with mid-circuit reloading of atoms into a quantum processor, which will be a key capability for running large-scale error-corrected quantum computations whose durations exceed the lifetime of a single atom in the system.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of a Generalized Dicke Model for Spin-1 Atoms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01716v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Dicke model is a staple of theoretical cavity Quantum Electrodynamics (cavity QED), describing the interaction between an ensemble of atoms and a single radiation mode of an optical cavity. It has been studied both quantum mechanically and semiclassically for two-level atoms, and demonstrates a rich variety of dynamics such as phase transitions, phase multistability, and chaos. In this work we explore an open, spin-1 Dicke model with independent co- and counter-rotating coupling terms as well as a quadratic Zeeman shift enabling control over the atomic energy-level structure. We investigate the stability of operator and moment equations under two approximations and show the system undergoes phase transitions. To compliment these results, we relax the aforementioned approximations and investigate the system semiclassically. We show evidence of phase transitions to steady-state and oscillatory superradiance in this semiclassical model, as well as the emergence of chaotic dynamics. The varied and complex behaviours admitted by the model highlights the need to more rigorously map its dynamics.</description>

Abstract: Rabi oscillations have long been thought to be out of reach in simulations using time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT), a prominent symptom of the failure of the adiabatic approximation for non-perturbative dynamics. We present a reformulation of TDDFT which requires response quantities only, thus enabling an adiabatic approximation to predict such dynamics accurately because the functional is evaluated on a density close to the ground-state, instead of on the fully non-perturbative density. Our reformulation applies to it any real-time dynamics, redeeming TDDFT far from equilibrium. Examples of a resonantly-driven local excitation in a model He atom, and charge-transfer in the LiCN molecule are given.</description>
