      <title>Fabrication, drug delivery kinetics and cell viability assay of PLGA-coated vancomycin-loaded silicate porous microspheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Porous ceramic microspheres are a desirable substance for bone tissue reconstruction and delivery applications. This study focuses on Mg-Ca silicate microspheres encapsulated in biodegradable poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) to serve as a biocompatible carrier for the controlled release of vancomycin hydrochloride. In this regard, diopside (MgCaSi2O6), bredigite (MgCa7Si4O16) and akermanite (MgCa2Si2O7) powders were synthesized by sol-gel and subsequent calcination methods. Then, porous akermanite, diopside and bredigite microspheres of 700-1000 um in diameter were fabricated by using carbon porogen, droplet extrusion and sintering, then loaded with the drug and eventually coated with PLGA. The bare microspheres showed a considerable burst release mode of the drug into a physiological medium, whereas PLGA coating of the microspheres reduced the burst release level. To investigate effective mechanisms governing in the drug release from the carriers, the contribution of burst, degradation, and diffusion was analyzed by the sequential quadratic programming algorithm method. It was found that the relative contribution of diffusion to bioresorption is ranked as diopside &gt; akermanite &gt; bredigite, whereas PLGA coating dominates the diffusion mechanism. The dental pulp stem cells cytocompatibility MTT assay of the microspheres also showed that the drug loading deteriorates but PLGA coating improves the cell biocompatibility significantly. Comparatively, the biocompatibility of the PLGA-coated microspheres was ranked as akermanite &gt; diopside &gt; bredigite, as a result of a compromise between the release of the constituting ions of the ceramic carriers and vancomycin molecules. It was eventually concluded that PLGA-coated Mg-Ca silicate microspheres are promising candidates for drug-delivery bone tissue engineering and dental bone grafting applications.</description>

      <title>Microscopic and spectroscopic evidences for multiple ion-exchange reactions controlling biomineralization of CaO.MgO.2SiO2 nanoceramics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study is focused on the mechanism of in vitro biomineralization on the surface of CaO.MgO.2SiO2 (diopside) nanostructured coatings by scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and inductively coupled plasma spectroscopy assessments. A homogeneous diopside coating of almost 2 um in thickness was deposited on a medical-grade stainless steel by coprecipitation, dipping and sintering sequences. After soaking the sample in a simulated body fluid (SBF) for 14 days, a layer with the thickness of 8 {\mu}m is recognized to be substituted for the primary diopside deposit, suggesting the mineralization of apatite on the surface. Investigations revealed that the newly-formed layer is predominantly composed of Ca, P and Si, albeit with a biased accumulations of P and Si towards the surface and substrate, respectively. The variations in the ionic composition and pH of the SBF due to the incubation of the sample were also correlated with the above-interpreted biomineralization. In conclusion, the multiple ion-exchange reactions related to Ca, Mg, Si and P were found to be responsible for the in vitro bioactivity of nanodiopside.</description>

      <title>Non-Intrusive Parametrized-Background Data-Weak Reconstruction of Cardiac Displacement Fields from Sparse MRI-like Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14844v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Personalized cardiac diagnostics require accurate reconstruction of myocardial displacement fields from sparse clinical imaging data, yet current methods often demand intrusive access to computational models. In this work, we apply the non-intrusive Parametrized-Background Data-Weak (PBDW) approach to three-dimensional (3D) cardiac displacement field reconstruction from limited Magnetic Resonance Image (MRI)-like observations. Our implementation requires only solution snapshots -- no governing equations, assembly routines, or solver access -- enabling immediate deployment across commercial and research codes using different constitutive models. Additionally, we introduce two enhancements: an H-size minibatch worst-case Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (wOMP) algorithm that improves Sensor Selection (SS) computational efficiency while maintaining reconstruction accuracy, and memory optimization techniques exploiting block matrix structures in vectorial problems. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the method through validation on a 3D left ventricular model with simulated scar tissue. Starting with noise-free reconstruction, we systematically incorporate Gaussian noise and spatial sparsity mimicking realistic MRI acquisition protocols. Results show exceptional accuracy in noise-free conditions (relative L2 error of order O(1e-5)), robust performance with 10% noise (relative L2 error of order O(1e-2)), and effective reconstruction from sparse measurements (relative L2 error of order O(1e-2)). The online reconstruction achieves four-order-of-magnitude computational speed-up compared to full Finite Element (FE) simulations, with reconstruction times under one tenth of second for sparse scenarios, demonstrating significant potential for integration into clinical cardiac modeling workflows.</description>

      <title>Functional dual-slope frequency-domain near-infrared spectroscopy data interpreted with two- and three-layer models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05877v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is impacted by signal contamination from superficial hemodynamics. It is important to develop methods that account for such contamination and provide accurate measurements of cerebral hemodynamics. This work aims to investigate whether simulated data with two-layer or three-layer tissue models are able to reproduce in vivo data collected with dual-slope (DS) frequency-domain (FD) near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) on human subjects during brain activation. We performed Monte Carlo simulations to generate DS FD-NIRS data from two- and three-layer media with a range of layer thicknesses and optical properties. We collected in vivo data with DS FD-NIRS (source-detector distances: 25, 37 mm; wavelengths: 690, 830 nm; modulation frequency: 140 MHz) over the occipital lobe of human subjects during visual stimulation. Simulated and in vivo data were analyzed with diffusion theory for a homogeneous medium and results were compared for each DS FD-NIRS data type. We found that the main qualitative features of in vivo data could be reproduced by simulated data from a three-layer medium, with a second layer (representing the cerebrospinal fluid in the subarachnoid space) that is less absorbing and less scattering than the other two layers, and with a top layer thickness that represents the combined scalp and skull thickness. A three-layer model is a viable improvement over a homogeneous model to analyze DS FD-NIRS data (or any other fNIRS data) to generate more accurate measurements of cerebral hemodynamic changes without a need for large data sets for tomographic reconstructions.</description>

      <title>Fine-tuning physics-informed neural networks for cavity flows using coordinate transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01122v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have attracted attention as an alternative approach to solve partial differential equations using a deep neural network (DNN). Their simplicity and capability allow them to solve inverse problems for many applications. Despite the versatility of PINNs, it remains challenging to reduce their training cost. Using a DNN pre-trained with an arbitrary dataset with transfer learning or fine-tuning is a potential solution. However, a pre-trained model using a different geometry and flow condition than the target may not produce suitable results. This paper proposes a fine-tuning approach for PINNs with coordinate transformation, modelling lid-driven cavity flows with various shapes. We formulate the inverse problem, where the reference data inside the domain and wall boundary conditions are given. A pre-trained PINN model with an arbitrary Reynolds number and shape is used to initialize a target DNN. To reconcile the reference shape with different targets, governing equations as a loss of the PINNs are given with coordinate transformation using a deformation gradient tensor. Numerical examples for various cavity flows with square, rectangular, shear deformed and inflated geometries demonstrate that the proposed fine-tuning approach improves the training convergence compared with a randomly-initialized model. A pre-trained model with a similar geometry to the target further increases training efficiency. These findings are useful for real-world applications such as modelling intra-aneurysmal blood flows in clinical use.</description>

      <title>Very-low-field MRI scanners: from the ideal to the real permanent magnet array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11762v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Very-low-field MRIs are becoming increasingly popular due to their portability and adaptability to different environments. They are being successfully used for various clinical applications, leading to a paradigm shift in the way imaging care is typically performed. The development of low-cost MRI scanner prototypes began a few years ago, with some interesting and promising open-source projects emerging in both hardware and software design. Using permanent magnets (PMs) to generate the static magnetic field B0 can substantially reduce the manufacturing cost while achieving satisfactory homogeneity. This article aims to explore the reasons behind discrepancies between magnet design and prototype performance in terms of magnetic field homogeneity. Understanding the impact of the practical implementation of magnet design could inform the development of more tolerant designs in future, simplifying subsequent B0 shimming procedures or even making them unnecessary. This work also evidences the impact of using different numerical model approximations in the modelling phase, proving how they also impact the quality of the design outcomes.</description>
