      <title>Measurements of $D^{0}$ and $D^{*}$ production in p+p collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 510 GeV in STAR experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: These proceedings present an investigation into the production of $D^{0}$ and $D^{*}$ mesons as a function of transverse momentum in proton-proton (p+p) collisions at a center-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s}$ = 510 GeV, in the STAR experiment at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). Objective of this analysis is to test the perturbative QCD calculations with the charm-anticharm production cross-sections obtained through $D^{0}$ and $D^{*}$ measurements. This report includes ongoing signal extractions of the $D^{0}$ and $D^{*}$ mesons from minimum bias events recorded during the p+p collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 510 GeV at STAR in 2017. Signals were reconstructed through the hadronic decay channels of these mesons. Like-sign combination and track rotation methods have been used to estimate the combinatorial background for $D^{0}$ measurement from $p_{T}$ = 0.0 to 2.1 GeV/$c$. For $D^{*}$, wrong-sign and side band combination of the decay daughters were utilized to reconstruct the combinatorial background from $p_{T}$ = 2.0 to 6.0 GeV/$c$.</description>

      <title>Phenomenological Modeling of the $^{163}$Ho Calorimetric Electron Capture Spectrum from the HOLMES Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive phenomenological analysis of the calorimetric electron capture (EC) decay spectrum of $^{163}$Ho as measured by the HOLMES experiment. Using high-statistics data, we unfold the instrumental energy resolution from the measured spectrum and model it as a sum of Breit-Wigner resonances and shake-off continua, providing a complete set of parameters for each component. Our approach enables the identification and tentative interpretation of all observed spectral features, including weak and overlapping structures, in terms of atomic de-excitation processes. We compare our phenomenological model with recent {\it ab initio} theoretical calculations, finding good agreement for both the main peaks and the spectral tails, despite the limitations of current theoretical and experimental precision. The model delivers an accurate description of the endpoint region, which is crucial for neutrino mass determination, and allows for a realistic treatment of backgrounds such as pile-up and tails of low-energy components. Furthermore, our decomposition facilitates the generation of Monte Carlo toy spectra for sensitivity studies and provides a framework for investigating systematic uncertainties related to solid-state and detector effects. This work establishes a robust foundation for future calorimetric neutrino mass experiments employing $^{163}$Ho, supporting both data analysis and experimental design.</description>

      <title>Evidence of medium response to hard probes using correlations of Z bosons with hadrons in heavy ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The first measurement of pseudorapidity and azimuthal angle distributions relative to the momentum vector of a Z boson for low transverse momentum ($p_\mathrm{T}$) charged hadrons in lead-lead (PbPb) collisions is presented. By studying the hadrons produced in an event with a high-$p_\mathrm{T}$ Z boson (40 $\lt$ $p_\mathrm{T}$ $\lt$ 350 GeV), the analysis probes how the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) medium created in these collisions affects the parton recoiling opposite to the Z boson. Utilizing PbPb data at a nucleon-nucleon center-of-mass energy $\sqrt{s_{_\mathrm{NN}}}$ = 5.02 TeV from 2018 with an integrated luminosity of 1.67 nb$^{-1}$ and proton-proton (pp) data at the same energy from 2017 with 301 pb$^{-1}$, the distributions are examined in bins of charged-hadron $p_\mathrm{T}$. A significant modification of the distributions for charged hadrons in the range 1$\lt$ $p_\mathrm{T}$ $\lt$ 2 GeV in PbPb collisions is observed when compared to reference measurements from pp collisions. The data provide new information about the correlation between hard and soft particles in heavy ion collisions, which can be used to test predictions of various jet quenching models. The results are consistent with expectations of a hydrodynamic wake created when the QGP is depleted of energy by the parton propagating through it. Based on comparisons of PbPb data with pp references and predictions from theoretical models, this Letter presents the first evidence of medium-recoil and medium-hole effects caused by a hard probe.</description>

      <title>Theoretical evaluation of decay mode of $ {}^{229m} \mathrm{Th} $ in solid samples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The excitation energy of $ {}^{229m} \mathrm{Th} $ is extremely low at $ 8.4 \, \mathrm{eV} $; thus, this isotope exhibits changes in its decay modes depending on the chemical state, specifically the outermost electronic states. However, the reported half-lives of $ \gamma $-ray transition are not consistent among the previous experiments. In this study, we investigate the chemical states of $ {}^{229m} \mathrm{Th} $ by DFT calculations. Based on these results, we evaluate the relationship between the experimental half-life for each sample and the electronic state of $ \mathrm{Th} $. The calculation results indicate that ion trap method, $ \mathrm{Ca} \mathrm{F}_2 $ model and $ \mathrm{Mg} \mathrm{F}_2 $ one decay only via the $ \gamma $-ray transition, whereas $ \mathrm{Li} \mathrm{Sr} \mathrm{Al} \mathrm{F}_6 $ decay via the $ \gamma $-ray transition and has a possibility of decay via internal conversion, and electron bridge.</description>

      <title>CycleGAN-Driven Transfer Learning for Electronics Response Emulation in High-Purity Germanium Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09106v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-Purity Germanium (HPGe) detectors are a key technology for rare-event searches such as neutrinoless double-beta decay ($0\nu\beta\beta$) and dark matter experiments. Pulse shapes from these detectors vary with interaction topology and thus encode information critical for event classification. Pulse shape simulations (PSS) are essential for modeling analysis cuts that distinguish signal events from backgrounds and for generating reliable simulations of energy spectra. Traditional PSS methods rely on a series of first-principles corrections to replicate the effect of readout electronics, requiring challenging fits over large parameter spaces and often failing to accurately model the data. We present a neural network architecture, the Cyclic Positional U-Net (CPU-Net), that performs translations of simulated pulses so that they closely resemble measured detector signals. Using a Cycle Generative Adversarial Network (CycleGAN) framework, this Response Emulation Network (REN) learns a data-driven mapping between simulated and measured pulses with high fidelity, without requiring a predetermined response model. We use data from a High-Purity Germanium (HPGe) detector with an inverted-coaxial point contact (ICPC) geometry to show that CPU-Net effectively captures and reproduces critical pulse shape features, allowing more realistic simulations without detector-specific tuning. CPU-Net achieves up to a factor-of-four improvement in distribution-level agreement for pulse shape parameter reconstruction, while preserving the topology-dependent information required for pulse-shape discrimination.</description>

      <title>Proton radioactivity in deformed nuclei with microscopic optical potential: a novel angular-dependent emission mechanism in the nanosecond-emitter $^{149}$Lu</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first microscopic description of proton radioactivity in $^{149}$Lu, the most oblate deformed proton emitter known, using a deformed $ab\ initio$ optical potential derived from relativistic Brueckner-Hartree-Fock theory. We predict a novel angular-dependent phenomenon unprecedented in spherical proton emitters: the disappearance of classically allowed regions at small polar angles $(\theta\leq 21^\circ)$. Combining the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin penetration probabilities and the assault frequency of the emitted proton estimated with a new harmonic-oscillator-inspired scheme, our framework yields a half-life $T_{1/2}=467^{+143}_{-108}$ ns for $^{149}$Lu, in excellent agreement within uncertainties with the experimental value $450^{+170}_{-100}$ ns. Deformation analysis rigorously excludes configurations with $|\beta_2|\geq 0.32$. Extensions to $^{150, 151}$Lu and their isomers also achieve excellent agreement with experimental half-life data. We further predict $^{148}$Lu as another highly oblate $(\beta_2 = -0.166)$ proton emitter with a half-life of 33 $\mu$s. This work validates deformed microscopic optical potentials as a robust predictive tool for drip-line proton emitters and provides quantitative evidence for deformation effects in exotic decays.</description>

      <title>Fragmentation of fully heavy tetraquarks: The TQ4Q1.1 functions as a case study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09744v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the study of exotic matter formation via the {\tt TQ4Q1.1} set of collinear, variable-flavor-number-scheme fragmentation functions for fully charmed or bottomed tetraquarks in three quantum configurations: scalar ($J^{PC} = 0^{++}$), axial vector ($J^{PC} = 1^{+-}$), and tensor ($J^{PC} = 2^{++}$). We adopt single-parton fragmentation at leading power and implement a nonrelativistic QCD factorization scheme tailored to tetraquark Fock-state configurations. Short-distance inputs at the initial scale are modeled using updated calculations for both gluon- and heavy-quark-initiated channels. A threshold-consistent DGLAP evolution is then applied via HFNRevo. We provide the first systematic treatment of uncertainties propagated from the color-composite long-distance matrix elements that govern the nonperturbative hadronization of tetraquarks. To support phenomenology, we compute NLL/NLO$^+$ cross sections for tetraquark-jet systems at the HL-LHC and FCC using (sym)JETHAD, incorporating angular multiplicities as key observables sensitive to high-energy QCD dynamics. This work connects the investigation of exotic hadrons with state-of-the-art precision QCD.</description>

      <title>Performance of newly constructed plastic scintillator barrel in the WASA-FRS experiments and evaluation of radiation damage effects on multi-pixel photon counter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A barrel-shaped plastic scintillation counter with Multi-Pixel Photon Counter (MPPC) readout has been developed and operated in the first WASA-FRS experimental campaign at GSI. The detector was used to measure charged particles emitted from reactions induced by a 2.5 GeV proton beam incident on a carbon target, providing particle identification in combination with momentum reconstruction in a 1 T magnetic field. The performance of this detector, particularly its response to energy deposition and time resolution, was systematically investigated as a function of count rate and total number of irradiating protons. A time resolution of 45-75 ps ($\sigma$), depending on the energy deposition, was achieved. Stable performance was maintained under high-rate conditions up to 1.35 MHz per single counter, with no significant degradation in either signal amplitude or timing response. Radiation-induced damage to the MPPCs was observed primarily as a reduction in signal amplitude, with approximately $35\%$ decrease at an estimated 1 MeV neutron-equivalent fluence of $2.4 \times 10^{10}$ cm$^{-2}$.</description>

      <title>Particles in finite volumes and a toy model of decaying neutrons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16784v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is well-known that the momentum spectra of particles confined to finite spatial volumes deviate from the continuous spectra used for unconfined particles. In this article, we consider real scalar particles confined to finite volumes with periodic boundary conditions, such that the particles' spectra are discrete. We directly compute the density matrices describing the decay processes $\phi \to \varphi^2$ and $\phi \to \varphi\chi\nu$, and subsequently derive expressions for the decay probabilities both for confined and unconfined particles. The latter decay process is used as a rough toy model for a neutron decaying into a proton, an electron, and an anti-electron neutrino. We propose that finite volume effects can have an impact on the outcomes of experiments measuring the neutron lifetime. In addition, our findings at the toy model level suggest that taking into account possible initial correlations between neutrons and their daughter particles might be relevant as well.</description>

      <title>Theoretical modeling of approximate universality of tidally deformed neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05429v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quasi-universal relations are known to exist among various neutron star observables that do not depend sensitively on the underlying nuclear matter equations of state. For example, some of these relations imply that the tidally induced multipole moments are approximately characterized by the electric-type quadrupolar tidal deformability. Such relations can be used to reduce the number of independent tidal parameters in gravitational-waveform modeling, thereby allowing us to infer extreme nuclear matter properties more accurately and test General Relativity in an insensitive manner to uncertainties in nuclear physics. We present a comprehensive theoretical investigation into approximate universality of neutron stars. Our approach employs a semi-analytic relativistic stellar interior model, which extends the Tolman VII solution, thereby enabling a refined exploration of the tidal properties of nonrotating stars within a semi-analytic framework. The derived power-law relations among various tidal deformabilities -- referred to as the universal Love relations -- agree well with expressions in previous work found empirically. We elucidate how the equation-of-state dependence is suppressed in a particular combination of macroscopic physical parameters induced by perturbations and demonstrate that the relation between the moment of inertia and electric-type quadrupolar tidal deformability (I-Love relation) rests on the same underlying mechanism. Our findings indicate that the approximate universality of neutron stars can be attributed to low compressibility, consistent with some of the previous studies on the possible origin of the universality.</description>

      <title>Comparing effective temperatures in standard and Tsallis distributions from transverse momentum spectra in small collision systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00339v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The transverse momentum ($p_T$) spectra of identified light charged hadrons, specifically bosons ($\pi^{\pm}$ and $K^{\pm}$) as well as fermions [$p(\bar p)$], produced in small collision systems, namely deuteron-gold (d+Au) and proton-proton (p+p) collisions at the top energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) with a center-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200$ GeV, are investigated in this paper. In present study, d+Au collisions are categorized into three centrality classes: central (0--20\%), semi-central (20--40\%), and peripheral (40--100\%) collisions. Various types of distributions, including standard [Bose-Einstein (Fermi-Dirac) and Boltzmann] and Tsallis distributions, are employed to fit the same $p_T$ spectra to derive different effective temperatures denoted as $T_{eff}$. The results indicate that $T_{eff}$ values obtained from Bose-Einstein, Boltzmann, Fermi-Dirac, and Tsallis distributions exhibit systematically a decreasing trend. Meanwhile, these $T_{eff}$ values also show a decreasing trend with a decrease in collision centrality. Furthermore, based on the spectra of given particles, a perfect linear relationship is observed between different pairwise combinations of $T_{eff}$ derived from both Boltzmann and Bose-Einstein (Fermi-Dirac) distributions as well as between Tsallis and Bose-Einstein (Fermi-Dirac) distributions.</description>

Abstract: The collective-flow-assisted nuclear shape-imaging method in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions has recently been used to characterize nuclear collective states. In this paper, we assess the foundations of the shape-imaging technique employed in these studies. We conclude that, on the whole, the discussion regarding low-energy nuclear physics is confusing and the suggested impact on nuclear structure research is overstated. Conversely, efforts to incorporate existing knowledge on nuclear shapes into analysis pipelines can be beneficial for benchmarking tools and calibrating models used to extract information from ultra-relativistic heavy ion experiments.</description>
