      <title>A Systematic Study of Single-Anchor Logical Gadgets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a systematic study of logical gadgets for 3-coloring under a single anchor constraint, where only one color representing logical falsehood is fixed to a vertex. We introduce a framework of what we call ladgets (logical gadgets), graph gadgets that implement Boolean functions. Then, we define a set of core gadgets, called primitives, which help identify and analyze the logical behavior of ladgets. Next, we examine the structure of several standard ladgets and present structural constraints applicable to all ladgets. Through an exhaustive search of all non-isomorphic connected graphs up to 10 vertices, we verify all minimal constructions for standard ladgets. Notably, we identify exactly two non-isomorphic minimal XNOR ladgets in approximately 29 billion gadget configurations, highlighting the rarity of graphs capable of expressing logical behavior. We also present a general embedding technique that embeds ladgets from 3-coloring into k-coloring. Our work shows how the single anchor constraint creates a fundamentally different framework from the two anchor gadgets used in SAT reductions.</description>

      <title>Stronger Hardness for Maximum Robust Flow and Randomized Network Interdiction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the following fundamental network optimization problem known as Maximum Robust Flow (MRF): A planner determines a flow on $s$-$t$-paths in a given capacitated network. Then, an adversary removes $k$ arcs from the network, interrupting all flow on paths containing a removed arc. The planner's goal is to maximize the value of the surviving flow, anticipating the adversary's response (i.e., a worst-case failure of $k$ arcs). It has long been known that MRF can be solved in polynomial time when $k = 1$ (Aneja et al., 2001), whereas it is $N\!P$-hard when $k$ is part of the input (Disser and Matuschke, 2020). However, the complexity of the problem for constant values of $k &gt; 1$ has remained elusive, in part due to structure of the natural LP description preventing the use of the equivalence of optimization and separation.
  This paper introduces a reduction showing that the basic version of MRF described above encapsulates the seemingly much more general variant where the adversary's choices are constrained to $k$-cliques in a compatibility graph on the arcs of the network. As a consequence of this reduction, we are able to prove the following results: (1) MRF is $N\!P$-hard for any constant number $k &gt; 1$ of failing arcs. (2) When $k$ is part of the input, MRF is $P^{N\!P[\log]}$-hard. (3) The integer version of MRF is $\Sigma_2^P$-hard.</description>

      <title>Stable non-minimal fixed points of threshold-linear networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In threshold-linear networks (TLNs), a fixed point is called minimal if no proper subset of its support is also a fixed point. Curto et al (Advances in Applied Mathematics, 2024) conjectured that every stable fixed point of any TLN must be a minimal fixed point. We provide a counterexample to this conjecture: an explicit competitive TLN on 3 neurons that exhibits a stable fixed point whose support is not minimal (it contains the support of another stable fixed point). We prove that there is no competitive TLN on 2 neurons which contains a stable non-minimal fixed point, so our 3-neuron construction is the smallest such example. By expanding our base example, we show for any positive integers $i, j$ with $i &lt; j-1$ that there exists a competitive TLN with stable fixed point supports $\tau \subsetneq \sigma$ for which $|\tau| = i$ and $|\sigma| = j$. Using a different expansion of our base example, we also show that chains of nested stable fixed points in competitive TLNs can be made arbitrarily long.</description>

      <title>When Arcs Extend Uniquely: A Higher-Dimensional Generalization of Barlotti's Result</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this short communication, we generalize a classical result of Barlotti concerning the unique extendability of arcs in the projective plane to higher-dimensional projective spaces. Specifically, we show that for integers \( k \ge 3 \), \( s \ge 0 \), and prime power \( q \), any \((n, k + s - 1)\)-arc in PG\((k - 1, q)\) of size \( n = (s+1)(q+1) + k - 3 \) admits a unique extension to a maximal arc, provided \( s + 2 \mid q \) and \( s &lt; q - 2 \). This result extends the classical characterizations of maximal arcs in PG\((2,q)\) and connects naturally to the theory of A$^s$MDS codes. Our findings establish conditions under which linear codes of given dimension and Singleton defect can be uniquely extended to maximal-length projective codes.</description>

      <title>Fair Allocation of Indivisible Goods with Variable Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06218v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the fair allocation of indivisible goods with variable groups. In this model, the goal is to partition the agents into groups of given sizes and allocate the goods to the groups in a fair manner. We show that for any number of groups and corresponding sizes, there always exists an envy-free up to one good (EF1) outcome, thereby generalizing an important result from the individual setting. Our result holds for arbitrary monotonic utilities and comes with an efficient algorithm. We also prove that an EF1 outcome is guaranteed to exist even when the goods lie on a path and each group must receive a connected bundle. In addition, we consider a probabilistic model where the utilities are additive and drawn randomly from a distribution. We show that if there are $n$ agents, the number of goods $m$ is divisible by the number of groups $k$, and all groups have the same size, then an envy-free outcome exists with high probability if $m = \omega(\log n)$, and this bound is tight. On the other hand, if $m$ is not divisible by $k$, then an envy-free outcome is unlikely to exist as long as $m = o(\sqrt{n})$.</description>

      <title>UAIC_Twin_Width: An Exact yet Efficient Twin-Width Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Twin-width is a recently formulated graph and matrix invariant that intuitively quantifies how far a graph is from having the structural simplicity of a co-graph. Since its introduction in 2020, twin-width has received increasing attention and has driven research leading to notable advances in algorithmic fields, including graph theory and combinatorics. The 2023 edition of the Parameterized Algorithms and Computational Experiments (PACE) Challenge aimed to fulfill the need for a diverse and consistent public benchmark encompassing various graph structures, while also collecting state-of-the-art heuristic and exact approaches to the problem. In this paper, we propose two algorithms for efficiently computing the twin-width of graphs with arbitrary structures, comprising one exact and one heuristic approach. The proposed solutions performed strongly in the competition, with the exact algorithm achieving the best student result and ranking fourth overall. We release our source code publicly to enable practical applications of our work and support further research.</description>

      <title>Subspace State Transfer in Coined Quantum Walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a transport phenomenon in certain coined quantum walks where a subspace of states localized at a vertex gets transferred to another vertex. We first develop characterizations for perfect and pretty good subspace state transfer using the spectral properties of a Hermitian weighted digraph obtained from the underlying graph. We then provide a polynomial-time algorithm that tests whether perfect pointwise subspace state transfer occurs at an integer step, given that the subspace and coins are rational. Finally, we construct several infinite families of examples that admit perfect pointwise $d$-dimensional subspace state transfer where $d\ge 2$.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Chazelle's Implementation of the Bottom-Left Heuristic: A Corrected and Rigorous Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07008v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Strip Packing Problem is a classical optimization problem in which a given set of rectangles must be packed, without overlap, into a strip of fixed width and infinite height, while minimizing the total height of the packing. A straightforward and widely studied approach to this problem is the Bottom-Left Heuristic. It consists of iteratively placing each rectangle in the given order at the lowest feasible position in the strip and, in case of ties, at the leftmost of those. Due to its simplicity and good empirical performance, this heuristic is widely used in practical applications. The most efficient implementation of this heuristic was proposed by Chazelle in 1983, requiring $O(n^2)$ time and $O(n)$ space to place $n$ rectangles. However, although Chazelle's original description was largely correct, it omitted several formal details. Furthermore, our analysis revealed a critical flaw in the original runtime analysis, which, in certain cases, results in $\Omega(n^3)$ running time. Motivated by this finding, this paper provides a rigorous and corrected presentation of the implementation, addressing the imprecise arguments and resolving the identified flaw. The resulting analysis establishes a formally verified version of Chazelle's implementation and confirms its quadratic time complexity.</description>

      <title>Polynomial-time algorithms for PATH COVER and PATH PARTITION on trees and graphs of bounded treewidth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the PATH COVER problem, one asks to cover the vertices of a graph using the smallest possible number of (not necessarily disjoint) paths. While the variant where the paths need to be pairwise vertex-disjoint, which we call PATH PARTITION, is extensively studied, surprisingly little is known about PATH COVER. We start filling this gap by designing a linear-time algorithm for PATH COVER on trees.
  We show that PATH COVER can be solved in polynomial time on graphs of bounded treewidth using a dynamic programming scheme. It runs in XP time $n^{t^{O(t)}}$ (where $n$ is the number of vertices and $t$ the treewidth of the input graph) or $\kappa^{t^{O(t)}}n$ if there is an upper-bound $\kappa$ on the solution size. A similar algorithm gives an FPT $2^{O(t\log t)}n$ algorithm for PATH PARTITION, which can be improved to (randomized) $2^{O(t)}n$ using the Cut\&amp;Count technique. These results also apply to the variants where the paths are required to be induced (i.e. chordless) and/or edge-disjoint.</description>

      <title>New small regular graphs of given girth: the cage problem and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The cage problem concerns finding $(k,g)$-graphs, which are $k$-regular graphs with girth $g$, of the smallest possible number of vertices. The central goal is to determine $n(k,g)$, the minimum order of such a graph, and to identify corresponding extremal graphs. In this paper, we study the cage problem and several of its variants from a computational perspective. Four complementary graph generation algorithms are developed based on exhaustive generation of lifts, a tabu search heuristic, a hill climbing heuristic and excision techniques. Using these methods, we establish new upper bounds for eleven cases of the classical cage problem: $n(3,16) \leq 936$, $n(3,17) \leq 2048$, $n(4,9) \leq 270$, $n(4,10) \leq 320$, $n(4,11) \leq 713$, $n(5,9) \leq 1116$, $n(6,11) \leq 7783$, $n(8,7) \leq 774$, $n(10,7) \leq 1608$, $n(12,7) \leq 2890$ and $n(14,7) \leq 4716$. Notably, our results improve upon several of the best-known bounds, some of which have stood unchanged for 22 years. Moreover, the improvement for $n(4,10)$, from the longstanding upper bound of 384 down to 320, is surprising and constitutes a substantial improvement.
  While the main focus is on the cage problem, we also adapted our algorithms for variants of the cage problem that received attention in the literature. For these variants, additional improvements are obtained, further narrowing the gaps between known lower and upper bounds.</description>

      <title>Approximate cycle double cover</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Cycle double cover (CDC) conjecture states that for every bridgeless graph $G$, there exists a family $\mathcal{F}$ of cycles such that each edge of the graph is contained in exactly two members of $\mathcal{F}$. Given an embedding of a graph~$G$, an edge $e$ is called a \emph{singular edge} if it is visited twice by the boundary of one face. The CDC conjecture is equivalent to bridgeless cubic graphs having an embedding with no singular edge. In this work, we introduce nontrivial upper bounds on the minimum number of singular edges in an embedding of a cubic graph. Moreover, we present efficient algorithms to find embeddings satisfying these bounds.</description>

      <title>Decoupling of clusters in independent sets in a percolated hypercube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Independent sets in graphs are sets of vertices containing no neighbors, and they represent a canonical spin system with hardcore constraints. Of particular interest is the setting of the boolean hypercube, where counting independent sets was the original motivator for Sapozhenko's famous graph container method. A modern perspective on such problems is to consider the effect of disorder, and the study of independent sets in random subgraphs of the hypercube obtained via bond percolation with parameter $p$ was initiated by Kronenberg and Spinka. They employed tools from statistical mechanics to obtain detailed information about the moments of the number of independent sets (now a random variable), and posed many interesting questions. Previous work by the authors addressed many of these questions in the regime $p \geq \frac{2}{3}$, where the behavior is relatively simple and can be modeled well by a related family of independent particles.
  As $p$ decreases, though, typical independent sets become larger and feature more intricate clustering behavior. In the present article we overcome many of the challenges presented by this phenomenon and analyze the model for all $p&gt; 0.465$. We obtain a sharp in-probability approximation for the number of independent sets in the percolated hypercube in terms of explicit random variables, as well as provide a sampling algorithm. Note that this shows, curiously, that $p = \frac{1}{2}$ is not a natural barrier for this problem unlike in many other problems where it appears as a point of a phase transition. A key contribution of this work is the introduction of a new probabilistic framework to handle the clustering behavior for these low values of $p$. Although our analysis is restricted to $p &gt; 0.465$, our arguments are expected to be helpful for studying this model at even lower values of $p$, and possibly for other related problems.</description>

Abstract: We solve a recent question of Caro, Patk\'os and Tuza by determining the exact maximum number of edges in a bipartite connected graph as a function of the longest path it contains as a subgraph and of the number of vertices in each side of the bipartition. This was previously known only in the case where both sides of the bipartition have equal size and the longest path has size at most $5$. We also discuss possible generalizations replacing "path" with some specific types of trees.</description>

      <title>Aircraft routing: periodicity and complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05532v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The aircraft routing problem is one of the most studied problems of operations research applied to aircraft management. It involves assigning flights to aircraft while ensuring regular visits to maintenance bases. This paper examines two aspects of the problem.
  First, we explore the relationship between periodic instances, where flights are the same every day, and periodic solutions. The literature has implicitly assumed-without discussion-that periodic instances necessitate periodic solutions, and even periodic solutions in a stronger form, where every two airplanes perform either the exact same cyclic sequence of flights, or completely disjoint cyclic sequences. However, enforcing such periodicity may eliminate feasible solutions. We prove that, when regular maintenance is required at most every four days, there always exist periodic solutions of this form.
  Second, we consider the computational hardness of the problem. Even if many papers in this area refer to the NP-hardness of the aircraft routing problem, such a result is only available in the literature for periodic instances. We establish its NP-hardness for a non-periodic version. Polynomiality of a special but natural case is also proven.</description>

      <title>Random generation of universal cycles and de Bruijn sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16545v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present practical algorithms for generating universal cycles uniformly at random. In particular, we consider universal cycles for shorthand permutations, subsets and multiset permutations, weak orders, and orientable sequences. Additionally, we consider de Bruijn sequences, weight-range de Bruin sequences, and de Bruijn sequences, with forbidden $0^z$ substring. Each algorithm, seeded with a random element from the given set, applies a random walk of an underlying Eulerian de Bruijn graph to obtain a random arborescence (spanning in-tree). Given the random arborescence and the de Bruijn graph, a corresponding random universal cycle can be generated in constant time per symbol. We present experimental results on the average cover time needed to compute a random arborescence for each object using a Las Vegas algorithm.</description>

      <title>Extremal Results on Conflict-free Coloring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.02570v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A conflict-free open neighborhood coloring of a graph is an assignment of colors to the vertices such that for every vertex there is a color that appears exactly once in its open neighborhood. For a graph $G$, the smallest number of colors required for such a coloring is called the conflict-free open neighborhood (CFON) chromatic number and is denoted by $\chi_{ON}(G)$. By considering closed neighborhood instead of open neighborhood, we obtain the analogous notions of conflict-free closed neighborhood (CFCN) coloring, and CFCN chromatic number (denoted by $\chi_{CN}(G)$). The notion of conflict-free coloring was introduced in 2002, and has since received considerable attention.
  In this paper, we study some extremal questions related to CFON and CFCN coloring.</description>

      <title>Bounds and Hardness Results for Conflict-free Choosability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12672v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A 'conflict-free coloring' of a hypergraph $\mathcal{H}$ is an assignment of colors to the vertex set of $\mathcal{H}$ such that every hyperedge in $\mathcal{H}$ has a vertex whose color is distinct from every other vertex in that hyperedge. The minimum number of colors required for such a coloring is known as the 'conflict-free chromatic number' of $\mathcal{H}$. Conflict-free coloring has also been studied on the open/closed neighborhood hypergraphs of a given graph under the name open/closed neighborhood conflict-free coloring. In this paper, we study the list variant of conflict-free coloring where, for every vertex $v$, we are given a list of admissible colors $L_v$ such that $v$ is allowed to be colored only from $L_v$.
  It was shown by Pach and Tardos [Combinatorics, Probability and Computing, 2009] that for any constant $\epsilon &gt; 0$, the closed-neighborhood conflict-free chromatic number of a graph $G$ is at most $O(\ln^{2 + \epsilon}\Delta)$, where $\Delta$ represents the maximum degree of $G$. Later, Glebov, Szab\'o, and Tardos [Combinatorics, Probability and Computing, 2014] showed that there exist graphs $G$ that require $\Omega(\ln^2\Delta)$ colors for a closed neighborhood conflict-free coloring. Bhyravarapu, Kalyanasundaram, and Mathew [Journal of Graph Theory, 2021] bridged the gap between the upper and the lower bound. They showed that the closed-neighborhood conflict-free chromatic number of any graph $G$ is at most $O(\ln^2 \Delta)$.
  In this paper, we extend the $O(\ln^2 \Delta)$ upper bound to the list variant of the closed-neighborhood conflict-free chromatic number. Further, we establish computational complexity results concerning the list open/closed-neighborhood conflict-free chromatic numbers.</description>

      <title>The exact subgraph hierarchy and its vertex-transitive variant for the stable set problem for Paley graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12958v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The stability number of a graph, defined as the cardinality of the largest set of pairwise non-adjacent vertices, is NP-hard to compute. The exact subgraph hierarchy (ESH) provides a sequence of increasingly tighter upper bounds on the stability number, starting with the Lov\'asz theta function at the first level and including all exact subgraph constraints of subgraphs of order $k$ into the semidefinite program to compute the Lov\'asz theta function at level $k$.
  In this paper, we investigate the ESH for Paley graphs, a class of strongly regular, vertex-transitive graphs. We show that for Paley graphs, the bounds obtained from the ESH remain the Lov\'asz theta function up to a certain threshold level, i.e., the bounds of the ESH do not improve up to a certain level.
  To overcome this limitation, we introduce the vertex-transitive ESH for the stable set problem for vertex-transitive graphs such as Paley graphs. We prove that this new hierarchy provides upper bounds on the stability number of vertex-transitive graphs that are at least as tight as those obtained from the ESH. Additionally, our computational experiments reveal that the vertex-transitive ESH produces superior bounds compared to the ESH for Paley graphs.</description>

      <title>When Should Selfish Miners Double-Spend?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03227v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conventional double-spending attack models ignore the revenue losses stemming from the orphan blocks. On the other hand, selfish mining literature usually ignores the chance of the attacker to double-spend at no-cost in each attack cycle. In this paper, we give a rigorous stochastic analysis of an attack where the goal of the adversary is to double-spend while mining selfishly. To do so, we first combine stubborn and selfish mining attacks, i.e., construct a strategy where the attacker acts stubborn until its private branch reaches a certain length and then switches to act selfish. We provide the optimal stubbornness for each parameter regime. Next, we provide the maximum stubbornness that is still more profitable than honest mining and argue a connection between the level of stubbornness and the $k$-confirmation rule. We show that, at each attack cycle, if the level of stubbornness is higher than $k$, the adversary gets a free shot at double-spending. At each cycle, for a given stubbornness level, we rigorously formulate how great the probability of double-spending is. We further modify the attack in the stubborn regime in order to conceal the attack and increase the double-spending probability.</description>

      <title>Explicit Min-wise Hash Families with Optimal Size</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10431v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study explicit constructions of min-wise hash families and their extension to $k$-min-wise hash families. Informally, a min-wise hash family guarantees that for any fixed subset $X\subseteq[N]$, every element in $X$ has an equal chance to have the smallest value among all elements in $X$; a $k$-min-wise hash family guarantees this for every subset of size $k$ in $X$. Min-wise hash is widely used in many areas of computer science such as sketching, web page detection, and $\ell_0$ sampling.
  The classical works by Indyk and P\u{a}tra\c{s}cu and Thorup have shown $\Theta(\log(1/\delta))$-wise independent families give min-wise hash of multiplicative (relative) error $\delta$, resulting in a construction with $\Theta(\log(1/\delta)\log N)$ random bits. Based on a reduction from pseudorandom generators for combinatorial rectangles by Saks, Srinivasan, Zhou and Zuckerman, Gopalan and Yehudayoff improved the number of bits to $O(\log N\log\log N)$ for polynomially small errors $\delta$. However, no construction with $O(\log N)$ bits (polynomial size family) and sub-constant error was known before.
  In this work, we continue and extend the study of constructing ($k$-)min-wise hash families from pseudorandomness for combinatorial rectangles and read-once branching programs. Our main result gives the first explicit min-wise hash families that use an optimal (up to constant) number of random bits and achieve a sub-constant (in fact, almost polynomially small) error, specifically, an explicit family of $k$-min-wise hash with $O(k\log N)$ bits and $2^{-O(\log N/\log\log N)}$ error. This improves all previous results for any $k=\log^{O(1)}N$ under $O(k \log N)$ bits. Our main techniques involve several new ideas to adapt the classical Nisan-Zuckerman pseudorandom generator to fool min-wise hashing with a multiplicative error.</description>

      <title>Edge open packing on subclasses of chordal graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16236v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $G=(V, E)$ be a graph where $V(G)$ and $E(G)$ are the vertex and edge sets, respectively. In a graph $G$, two edges $e_1, e_2\in E(G)$ are said to have a \emph{common edge} $e\neq e_1, e_2$ if $e$ joins an endpoint of $e_1$ to an endpoint of $e_2$ in $G$. A subset $D\subseteq E(G)$ is called an \emph{edge open packing set} in $G$ if no two edges in $D$ share a common edge in $G$, and the largest size of such a set in $G$ is known as the \emph{edge open packing number}, represented by $\rho_{e}^o(G)$. The \textsc{Maximum Edge Open Packing Problem} is to find an edge open packing set of a given graph with maximum size. In [Bre{\v{s}}ar and Samadi. Edge open packing: complexity, algorithmic aspects, and bounds. Theor. Comput. Sci., 2024.], Bre{\v{s}}ar and Samadi pose an open question of the edge open packing problem in chordal graphs. In this paper, we partially answer this open question by showing a polynomial-time algorithm to solve the maximum edge open packing problem in the subclasses of chordal graphs. First, we show that the \textsc{Maximum Edge Open Packing Problem} can be solved in polynomial time for \emph{proper interval graphs}. Furthermore, we show that in \emph{block graphs} we can solve this problem in polynomial time. Finally, we prove that this problem can be solved in linear time for \emph{split graphs}.</description>
