      <title>Towards Sign Distance Function based Metamaterial Design: Neural Operator Transformer for Forward Prediction and Diffusion Models for Inverse Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The inverse design of metamaterial architectures presents a significant challenge, particularly for nonlinear mechanical properties involving large deformations, buckling, contact, and plasticity. Traditional methods, such as gradient-based optimization, and recent generative deep-learning approaches often rely on binary pixel-based representations, which introduce jagged edges that hinder finite element (FE) simulations and 3D printing. To overcome these challenges, we propose an inverse design framework that utilizes a signed distance function (SDF) representation combined with a conditional diffusion model. The SDF provides a smooth boundary representation, eliminating the need for post-processing and ensuring compatibility with FE simulations and manufacturing methods. A classifier-free guided diffusion model is trained to generate SDFs conditioned on target macroscopic stress-strain curves, enabling efficient one-shot design synthesis. To assess the mechanical response of the generated designs, we introduce a forward prediction model based on Neural Operator Transformers (NOT), which accurately predicts homogenized stress-strain curves and local solution fields for arbitrary geometries with irregular query meshes. This approach enables a closed-loop process for general metamaterial design, offering a pathway for the development of advanced functional materials.</description>

      <title>Random Phase Approximation Correlation Energy using Real-Space Density Functional Perturbation Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a real-space method for computing the random phase approximation (RPA) correlation energy within Kohn-Sham density functional theory, leveraging the low-rank nature of the frequency-dependent density response operator. In particular, we employ a cubic scaling formalism based on density functional perturbation theory that circumvents the calculation of the response function matrix, instead relying on the ability to compute its product with a vector through the solution of the associated Sternheimer linear systems. We develop a large-scale parallel implementation of this formalism using the subspace iteration method in conjunction with the spectral quadrature method, while employing the Kronecker product-based method for the application of the Coulomb operator and the conjugate orthogonal conjugate gradient method for the solution of the linear systems. We demonstrate convergence with respect to key parameters and verify the method's accuracy by comparing with planewave results. We show that the framework achieves good strong scaling to many thousands of processors, reducing the time to solution for a lithium hydride system with 128 electrons to around 150 seconds on 4608 processors.</description>

      <title>The Critical Importance of Software for HEP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01050v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Particle physics has an ambitious and broad global experimental programme for the coming decades. Large investments in building new facilities are already underway or under consideration. Scaling the present processing power and data storage needs by the foreseen increase in data rates in the next decade for HL-LHC is not sustainable within the current budgets. As a result, a more efficient usage of computing resources is required in order to realise the physics potential of future experiments. Software and computing are an integral part of experimental design, trigger and data acquisition, simulation, reconstruction, and analysis, as well as related theoretical predictions. A significant investment in computing and software is therefore critical.
  Advances in software and computing, including artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), will be key for solving these challenges. Making better use of new processing hardware such as graphical processing units (GPUs) or ARM chips is a growing trend. This forms part of a computing solution that makes efficient use of facilities and contributes to the reduction of the environmental footprint of HEP computing. The HEP community already provided a roadmap for software and computing for the last EPPSU, and this paper updates that, with a focus on the most resource critical parts of our data processing chain.</description>

      <title>Hard-constraining Neumann boundary conditions in physics-informed neural networks via Fourier feature embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel approach to hard-constrain Neumann boundary conditions in physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) using Fourier feature embeddings. Neumann boundary conditions are used to described critical processes in various application, yet they are more challenging to hard-constrain in PINNs than Dirichlet conditions. Our method employs specific Fourier feature embeddings to directly incorporate Neumann boundary conditions into the neural network's architecture instead of learning them. The embedding can be naturally extended by high frequency modes to better capture high frequency phenomena. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach through experiments on a diffusion problem, for which our method outperforms existing hard-constraining methods and classical PINNs, particularly in multiscale and high frequency scenarios.</description>

      <title>Near-energy-free Photonic Fourier Transformation for Convolution Operation Acceler</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Convolutional operations are computationally intensive in artificial intelligence services, and their overhead in electronic hardware limits machine learning scaling. Here, we introduce a photonic joint transform correlator (pJTC) using a near-energy-free on-chip Fourier transformation to accelerate convolution operations. The pJTC reduces computational complexity for both convolution and cross-correlation from O(N4) to O(N2), where N2 is the input data size. Demonstrating functional Fourier transforms and convolution, this pJTC achieves 98.0% accuracy on an exemplary MNIST inference task. Furthermore, a wavelength-multiplexed pJTC architecture shows potential for high throughput and energy efficiency, reaching 305 TOPS/W and 40.2 TOPS/mm2, based on currently available foundry processes. An efficient, compact, and low-latency convolution accelerator promises to advance next-generation AI capabilities across edge demands, high-performance computing, and cloud services.</description>

      <title>Precise Determination of Electric Quadrupole Moments and Isotope Shift Constants of Yb$^+$ in Pursuance of Probing Fundamental Physics and Nuclear Radii</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01438v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Contemplating to register signature of a new vector boson unambiguously from the measured non-linear isotope shift (IS) effects in three recent experiments [Phys. Rev. X {\bf 12}, 021033 (2022); Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 128}, 163201 (2022) and Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 134}, 063002 (2025)], very precise values of quadrupole moments and IS constants for the $6s ~ ^2S_{1/2} \rightarrow 5d ~ ^2D_{3/2}$ and $6s ~ ^2S_{1/2} \rightarrow 5d ~ ^2D_{5/2}$ clock transitions of $^{171}$Yb$^+$ are presented. This is accomplished by incorporating contributions from the computationally challenging triply excited configurations through the relativistic coupled-cluster (RCC) theory. Testament of quality atomic wave functions of states of the above transitions, obtained using the RCC theory, are gauged by comparing the calculated energies and magnetic dipole hyperfine structure constants with their measurements. The improved quadrupole moments from this work will be immensely useful to estimate quadrupole shifts of the clock transitions of Yb$^+$. Complementary approaches are employed to ascertain accuracy and comprehend roles of orbital relaxation and correlation effects in evaluating the IS constants. Combining these constants with the IS measurements from Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 128}, 163201 (2022), differential nuclear charge radii of the Yb isotopes are inferred that deviate by 6-7\% from the literature data.</description>

      <title>Density estimation via mixture discrepancy and moments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01570v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the aim of generalizing histogram statistics to higher dimensional cases, density estimation via discrepancy based sequential partition (DSP) has been proposed [D. Li, K. Yang, W. Wong, Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (2016) 1099-1107] to learn an adaptive piecewise constant approximation defined on a binary sequential partition of the underlying domain, where the star discrepancy is adopted to measure the uniformity of particle distribution. However, the calculation of the star discrepancy is NP-hard and it does not satisfy the reflection invariance and rotation invariance either. To this end, we use the mixture discrepancy and the comparison of moments as a replacement of the star discrepancy, leading to the density estimation via mixture discrepancy based sequential partition (DSP-mix) and density estimation via moments based sequential partition (MSP), respectively. Both DSP-mix and MSP are computationally tractable and exhibit the reflection and rotation invariance. Numerical experiments in reconstructing the $d$-D mixture of Gaussians and Betas with $d=2, 3, \dots, 6$ demonstrate that DSP-mix and MSP both run approximately ten times faster than DSP while maintaining the same accuracy.</description>

      <title>Acoustic Propagation/Refraction Through Diffuse Interface Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel approach for simulating acoustic (pressure) wave propagation across different media separated by a diffuse interface through the use of a weak compressibility formulation. Our method builds on our previous work on an entropy-stable discontinuous Galerkin spectral element method for the incompressible Navier-Stokes/Cahn-Hilliard system \cite{manzanero2020entropyNSCH}, and incorporates a modified weak compressibility formulation that allows different sound speeds in each phase. We validate our method through numerical experiments, demonstrating spectral convergence for acoustic transmission and reflection coefficients in one dimension and for the angle defined by Snell's law in two dimensions. Special attention is given to quantifying the modeling errors introduced by the width of the diffuse interface. Our results show that the method successfully captures the behavior of acoustic waves across interfaces, allowing exponential convergence in transmitted waves. The transmitted angles in two dimensions are accurately captured for air-water conditions, up to the critical angle of $13^\circ$. This work represents a step forward in modeling acoustic propagation in incompressible multiphase systems, with potential applications to marine aeroacoustics.</description>

      <title>Multi-stream Physics Hybrid Networks for solving Navier-Stokes equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding and solving fluid dynamics equations efficiently remains a fundamental challenge in computational physics. Traditional numerical solvers and physics-informed neural networks struggle to capture the full range of frequency components in partial differential equation solutions, limiting their accuracy and efficiency. Here, we propose the Multi-stream Physics Hybrid Network, a novel neural architecture that integrates quantum and classical layers in parallel to improve the accuracy of solving fluid dynamics equations, namely Kovasznay flow problem. This approach decomposes the solution into separate frequency components, each predicted by independent Parallel Hybrid Networks, simplifying the training process and enhancing performance. We evaluated the proposed model against a comparable classical neural network, the Multi-stream Physics Classical Network, in both data-driven and physics-driven scenarios. Our results show that the Multi-stream Physics Hybrid Network achieves a reduction in root mean square error by 36% for velocity components and 41% for pressure prediction compared to the classical model, while using 24% fewer trainable parameters. These findings highlight the potential of hybrid quantum-classical architectures for advancing computational fluid dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13214v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Interpreting scattered acoustic and electromagnetic wave patterns is a computational task that enables remote imaging in a number of important applications, including medical imaging, geophysical exploration, sonar and radar detection, and nondestructive testing of materials. However, accurately and stably recovering an inhomogeneous medium from far-field scattered wave measurements is a computationally difficult problem, due to the nonlinear and non-local nature of the forward scattering process. We design a neural network, called Multi-Frequency Inverse Scattering Network (MFISNet), and a training method to approximate the inverse map from far-field scattered wave measurements at multiple frequencies. We consider three variants of MFISNet, with the strongest performing variant inspired by the recursive linearization method--a commonly used technique for stably inverting scattered wavefield data--that progressively refines the estimate with higher frequency content. MFISNet outperforms past methods in regimes with high-contrast, heterogeneous large objects, and inhomogeneous unknown backgrounds.</description>

      <title>Plane-Wave Decomposition and Randomised Training; a Novel Path to Generalised PINNs for SHM</title>

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a formulation of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), based on learning the form of the Fourier decomposition, and a training methodology based on a spread of randomly chosen boundary conditions. By training in this way we produce a PINN that generalises; after training it can be used to correctly predict the solution for an arbitrary set of boundary conditions and interpolate this solution between the samples that spanned the training domain. We demonstrate for a toy system of two coupled oscillators that this gives the PINN formulation genuine predictive capability owing to an effective reduction of the training to evaluation times ratio due to this decoupling of the solution from specific boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Enhanced thermoelectric properties of two-dimensional Janus ferromagnetic LaBrI with strain-induced valley degeneracy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.01683v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Since the successful synthesis of the MoSSe monolayer, which violated the out-of-plane mirror symmetry of TMDs monolayers, considerable and systematic research has been conducted on Janus monolayer materials. By systematically analyzing the LaBrI monolayer, we are able to learn more about the novel Janus material by focusing on the halogen family next to group VIA (S, Se, Te). The structural optimizations have been carried out using pseudopotential based Quantum espresso code. Computed structural parameters are in good agreement with literature reports. The optimized crystal structures were used for computing effect of strain on electronic and thermoelectric properties. Dynamical stability predicts that this material can withstand up to 10% of tensile strain. Computed electronic structure reveals material to be indirect wide band gap ferromagnet with magnetic moment 1{\mu}B. With increase in the biaxial tensile strain the band gap decreases. Furthermore, the computed magneto-thermoelectric properties predict high Seebeck coefficient ~ 400 {\mu}V/K and low thermal conductivity of ~ 0.93 W/m.K in LaBrI which results in a high ZT ~ 1.84 for 4% strain at 800 K. The present study supports the fact that tensile strain on ferromagnetic LaBrI material can further enhance TE properties making it to be a promising material for TE applications at higher temperatures.</description>

      <title>Phase vs coin vs position disorder as a probe for the resilience and revival of single particle entanglement in cyclic quantum walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12710v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum states exhibiting single-particle entanglement (SPE) can encode and process quantum information more robustly than their multi-particle analogs. Understanding the vulnerability and resilience of SPE to disorder is therefore crucial. This letter investigates phase, coin, and position disorder via discrete-time quantum walks on odd and even cyclic graphs to study their effect on SPE. The reduction in SPE is insignificant for low levels of phase or coin disorder, showing the resilience of SPE to minor perturbations. However, SPE is seen to be more vulnerable to position disorder. We analytically prove that maximally entangled single-particle states (MESPS) at time step $t=1$ are impervious to phase disorder regardless of the choice of the initial state. Further, MESPS at timestep $t=1$ is also wholly immune to coin disorder for phase-symmetric initial states. Position disorder breaks odd-even parity and distorts the physical time cone of the quantum walker, unlike phase or coin disorder. SPE saturates towards a fixed value for position disorder, irrespective of the disorder strength at large timestep $t$. Furthermore, SPE can be enhanced with moderate to significant phase or coin disorder strengths at specific time steps. Interestingly, disorder can revive single-particle entanglement from absolute zero in some instances, too. These results are crucial in understanding single-particle entanglement evolution and dynamics in a lab setting.</description>

Abstract: For polymer nanocomposites, disordered microstructural nature makes processing control and tailoring properties to desired values a challenge. Understanding process-structure-property relation can provide guidelines for process and constituents design. Our work explores nuances of PSP relation for polymer nanocomposites with attractive pairing between particles and polymer bulk. In the absence of any nano or micro-scale local property measurement, we develop a material model that can represent decay for small strain elastoplastic properties in interfacial regions and simulate representative or statistical volume element behavior. This interfacial model is further combined with a microstructural design of experiments for agglomerated nanocomposite systems. Agglomerations are particle aggregations that are microstructural defects resulting from lack of processing control. Twin screw extrusion process can reduce extent of aggregation in hot pressed samples via erosion or rupture depending on screw rpms and toque. We connect this process-structure relation to structure-property relation that emerges from our study. We discover that balancing between local stress concentration zone and interfacial property decay governs how fast yield stress can improve if we break down agglomeration via erosion. Rupture is relatively less effective in helping improve nanocomposite yield strength. Additionally, we allude to yield initiation and progression in these multiphase materials. We have come up with a field quantity called local yield resistance that indicates balance stress concentration zones and interfacial effects. Yield resistance map from linear regime acts as a predictor of local yielding process and can be a useful tool for interface design for plastic deformation behavior.</description>

      <title>Modeling biases in binary decision-making within the generalized nonlinear q-voter model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10172v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Collective decision-making is a process by which a group of individuals determines a shared outcome that shapes societal dynamics; from innovation diffusion to organizational choices. A common approach to model these processes is using binary dynamics, where the choices are reduced to two alternatives. One of the most popular models in this context is the $q$-voter model, which assumes that opinion changes are driven by peer pressure from a unanimous group. However, real-world decisions are also shaped by prior personal choices and external influences, such as mass media, which introduce biases that can favor certain options over others. To address this, we propose a generalized $q$-voter model that incorporates these biases. In our model, when the influence group is not unanimous, the probability that an individual changes its opinion depends on its current state, breaking the symmetry between opinions. In limiting cases, our model recovers both the original $q$-voter model and several recently introduced modifications of the $q$-voter model, while extending the framework to capture a broader range of scenarios. We analyze the model on a complete graph using analytical methods and Monte Carlo simulations. Our results highlight two key findings: (1) for larger influence groups ($q&gt;3$), a phase emerges where both adopted and partially adopted states coexist, (2) in small systems, greater initial support for an opinion does not necessarily increase its likelihood of widespread adoption, as reflected in the unique form of the exit probability. These results point to one of the key issues in social science, the importance of group size in collective action.</description>

      <title>Modeling conductive thermal transport in three-dimensional fibrous media with fiber-to-fiber contacts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17318v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding heat transfers in fibrous materials, particularly conduction, is a major challenge due to their heterogeneous and multiscale nature, and the unknown contribution of fiber-to-fiber contacts. In most previous modeling studies, the existence of thermal contact resistance is not considered, and the computational complexity limits the size of simulated samples, which often leads to imprecise or inaccurate predictions. The same problem arises when considering electrical conduction through fibrous materials. In this work, we describe a computationally efficient simulation approach based on multinodal representation to analyze the steady-state heat conduction through the solid structure in numerically generated three-dimensional nanofiber networks, including contact resistance. We show that the solid conductivity in these networks is governed by a master curve that depends on a single parameter: a characteristic ratio representing the interplay between the intrinsic fiber conductivity and contact resistance as well as the influence of other geometric parameters, which numerically validates previous theoretical studies. However, we observe a deviation to this established theory for poorly connected networks. We derive an expression for a correction factor, considering the influence of correlations between fiber temperatures, and we then find good agreement with our simulation data. Our results demonstrate that the solid conductivity can be fully predicted based on geometric quantities, regardless of the extent of network connectivity, thus generalizing previous studies on this topic. This work, contributing to improve our understanding of conductive heat transport in fibrous media, may prove useful in the development of accurate predictive models and optimization strategies for fibrous insulation materials.</description>

      <title>Parametric-ROM of Structures with Varying Geometry using Direct Parameterization of Invariant Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20872v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work presents a framework for parametric reduction in FEM, where geometry is controlled by a parameter without altering material properties or stress states. The inverse determinant in the weak form is expanded as a power series, with explicit expressions for the zeroth and first-order terms. External forcing and parameter dependence are incorporated into an enlarged autonomous system, reduced via the direct parameterization of invariant manifolds method and homological equations. The parameter is treated as an additional variable with trivial dynamics, isolated for inclusion in the ROM. This approach enables efficient parametric studies and advances reduced-order modeling in structural dynamics.</description>
