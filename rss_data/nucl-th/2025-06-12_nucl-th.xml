      <title>Charged-current quasielastic neutrino scattering off nuclei with nucleon-nucleon short-range correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, many studies on neutrino-nucleus scattering have been carried out to investigate nuclear structures and the interactions between neutrinos and nucleons. This paper develops a charged-current quasielastic (CCQE) neutrino-nucleus scattering model to explore the nuclear mean-field dynamics and short-range correlation effects. In this model, the nuclear structure effect is depicted using the scaling function, while the neutrinonucleon interaction is represented by the elementary weak cross section. Results indicate that the double-differential cross section of scattered muon is influenced by the energy and momentum of nucleon in nuclei, and the total cross section depends primarily on the incident neutrino energy. Furthermore, incorporating short-range correlations yields the flux-integrated differential cross sections at high-T region producing larger values, a longer tail, and achieving better experimental consistency. It eventually elucidates the physical relationship between the neutrinonucleus scattering cross section and the variation in incident neutrino energy. The studies in this paper furnishes insights for the research of nucleon dynamics and provides detailed examinations of the neutrino-nucleus scattering mechanism.</description>

      <title>Schwinger-Keldysh approach to tunneling transport at a hadron-quark interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically discuss quantum tunneling transport and frictions at a hadron-quark matter interface based on the Schwinger-Keldysh approach combined with the tunneling Hamiltonian, which has been developed in the context of condensed matter physics. In the inner core of massive neutron stars, it is expected that cold quark matter appears at sufficiently high densities and hence exhibits color superconductivity, surrounded by nucleon superfluids at lower densities. The perturbative expressions of the tunneling current and the friction at the interface are obtained in terms of the non-equilibrium Green's functions. We demonstrate the DC Josephson current that occurs at the hadron-quark superfluid interface in the present scheme. Our framework can be applied to various conflagrations involving the interfaces relevant to astrophysical phenomena.</description>

      <title>Universal Efimov spectra and fermionic doublets in highly mass-imbalanced cold-atom mixtures with van der Waals and dipole interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the Efimov states in highly mass-imbalanced three-body systems composed of two identical heavy atoms and one light atom, focusing on the Er-Er-Li and Dy-Dy-Li cold-atom mixtures with strong dipole-dipole interactions between the heavy atoms. By solving the Born-Oppenheimer equation for varying $s$-wave scattering lengths between the heavy and light atoms, we demonstrate for both bosonic and fermionic systems that the Efimov spectra and hence the three-body parameters are universal even with the dipole interaction comparable in strength to the van der Waals interaction. While the bosonic systems exhibit Efimov states only in the $M_z=0$ channel, the fermionic systems show a characteristic doublet of the Efimov states in the $M_z=0$ and $M_z = \pm 1$ channels due to the interplay of finite angular momentum and the anisotropy of the dipole interaction. Both numerical results and analytical formula obtained with the first-order perturbation show that the ratio of the three-body parameters between these two fermionic channels exhibits universality, particularly well in the limit of large mass imbalance. Leveraging this universality, we provide quantitative predictions for the values and ratios of the three-body parameters for experimentally relevant Er-Li and Dy-Li isotopes.</description>

      <title>Energy Correlators: A Journey From Theory to Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collider experiments offer a unique opportunity to explore the Standard Model (SM), and to search for new physics, new interactions, and new principles of nature. The theoretical abstraction of a collider, namely the study of correlations in asymptotic fluxes, provides one of the most basic examples of an observable in quantum field theory (QFT) and quantum gravity. Energy flux is described in QFT by energy flow operators, a particular example of light-ray operators. In addition to their central role in the theoretical description of collider physics, energy flow operators play an important role in diverse areas of formal QFT and gravity, providing a connection between real world collider phenomenology, and the deep underlying principles of QFT.
  Recently it has become possible to measure correlation functions of energy flow operators in a wide variety of collider experiments, providing an exciting new connection between collider physics and formal theory. In this review, we provide a survey of recent progress in our understanding of energy operators and their correlators, highlighting their importance in both formal theory and collider phenomenology, and in particular, their great potential for bridging these areas to provide new ways to understand the real world. We intend this article as a resource for both formal theorists interested in understanding how light-ray operators are being applied in particle and nuclear physics, as well as for experimentalists interested in the theoretical motivation for these observables. Most importantly, we aim to stimulate further interaction between the formal, phenomenological and experimental communities through the common lens of energy correlators.</description>

      <title>Spin alignment of Quarkonia: A Possible Probe of a Deconfined QCD matter in Heavy-ion Collisions at TeV Energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the influence of deconfined QCD matter on quarkonium spin alignment in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions. We estimate the spin alignment of charmonium ($J/\psi$, and $\psi$(2S)) and bottomonium ($\Upsilon$(1S), and $\Upsilon$(2S)) states by calculating the energy eigenvalues in a thermal rotating medium. We solve the Schr\"odinger equation with a medium-modified color-singlet potential considering the coupling of spin with vorticity and magnetic field. Furthermore, we evaluate the effect of medium temperature, vorticity, magnetic field, and momentum-space anisotropy on the elements of the spin density matrix. Our findings reveal that vorticity increases the spin alignment, while the magnetic fields and anisotropy modify the observables in a state-dependent manner. These findings deepen our understanding of quarkonium spin alignment in an anisotropic magneto-vortical thermal medium, shedding light on spin transport phenomena in heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Heavy Quark State Production via p-p and O-O Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Here we have considered $J/\Psi$ is a normal charmonium meson, while $\Psi(2S)$ is a mixed hybrid charmonium meson. Similarly $\Upsilon(1S)$ and$\Upsilon(2S)$ are normal upsilon mesons, while $\Upsilon(3S)$ is a mixed hybrid upsilon meson. We discuss the differential rapidity cross sections for $J/\Psi$, $\Psi(2S)$, $\Upsilon(1S)$, $\Upsilon(2S)$, $\Upsilon(3S)$ production via p-p, and O-O collisions at proton-proton energy $\equiv \sqrt{s_{pp}}$= 5.44 TeV. The rapidity taken for the present study goes from y=-1 to 1.</description>

      <title>Baryon-antibaryon generalized distribution amplitudes and $e^+ e^- \to B \bar{B} \gamma$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Baryon-antibaryon generalized distribution amplitudes (GDAs) give an access to timelike gravitational form factors (GFFs) which are complementary to the spacelike ones which can be deduced from the hadronic generalized parton distributions (GPDs) measured in deep exclusive electroproduction processes. They allow to probe the GFFs of unstable baryons in the baryon octet, since the second moments of hadronic generalized distribution amplitudes (GDAs) lead to the timelike GFFs. These GDAs can be measured in the process $e^+ e^- \to B \bar{B} \gamma$, in the generalized Bjorken regime where the invariant mass of the $B \bar{B}$ pair is near threshold at high energy facilities, such as BESIII, Belle II, and the proposed Super Tau-Charm Facility. In this work, we investigate this process using the QCD collinear factorization framework, where the scattering amplitudes are expressed in terms of the baryon timelike electromagnetic (EM) FFs and Compton FFs. We also provide a numerical estimate of the cross sections with a model for baryon-antibaryon GDAs. Our work provides us a possibility to extract the timelike baryon GFFs from near future experimental measurements, and these GFFs may be further used to study longstanding questions in hadronic physics such as the baryon spin decomposition and D-term.</description>

      <title>Parton distribution functions from scalar light-front parton gas model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.09340</link>
      <description>arXiv:1812.09340v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an application of a microcanonical ensemble with light-front kinematics to model the phase-space distribution of relativistic constituents of a bound state. These constituents denoted by partons are treated as classical spin-zero particles confined inside the bound state with inter-parton collisions as their only interaction. The microcanonical molecular dynamics ensemble is applied to obtain the phase-space distribution of such a thermodynamic system. We sample this phase-space distribution using Monte Carlo algorithms to obtain the parton distribution functions (PDFs) in scenarios with $3$, $4$, and $5$ identical partons. In addition PDFs when a selected number of massless partons are mixed with $3$ massive partons are also presented.</description>

      <title>Nuclear structure study using a hybrid approach of shell model and Gogny-type density functionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01072v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nuclear density functional theory (DFT) is able to reproduce the saturation properties of nuclear matter, as well as properties of finite nuclei. Consequently, the DFT calculations are applicable to nuclei across a wide range of masses on nuclear chart. The Gogny-type density functional, which is equivalent to the mean-field calculations with finite-range density-dependent effective interactions, is a successful example. In contrast, the shell-model (configuration-interaction) calculation is a powerful tool to describe nuclear structure, especially spectroscopic properties. The shell model is able to take into account correlations beyond mean field in a truncated model space. In this work, we report investigation on $\textit{sd}$-shell nuclei and Ca isotopes using a hybrid approach of the shell model and Gogny-type DFT.</description>

      <title>Partial Rate Matrix for Dark Matter Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.01480v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I present a highly efficient integration method for scattering calculations, and a ``partial rate matrix'' that encodes the scattering rate as a function of the $SO(3)$ orientation of the detector. This replaces the original multidimensional rate integral with a simple exercise in vector multiplication, speeding up the rate calculation by a factor of around $10^8$. I include a scheme to fully factorize the dark matter particle model, its astrophysical velocity distribution, and the properties of the target material from each other, enabling efficient calculation of the partial rate matrix even in studies comparing large sets of these input functions. This is now the only sensible way to evaluate the dark matter scattering rate in anisotropic detector materials. It is straightforward to generalize this method to other difficult but linear problems.</description>

      <title>Wavelet-Harmonic Integration Methods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.01483v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A new integration method drastically improves the efficiency of the dark matter direct detection calculation. In this work I introduce a complete, orthogonal basis of spherical wavelet-harmonic functions, designed for the new vector space integration method. This factorizes the numeric calculation into a ``vector'' that depends only on the astrophysical velocity distribution; a second vector, depending only on the detector form factor; and a scattering matrix defined on the basis functions, which depends on the details of the dark matter (DM) particle model (e.g.~its mass). For common spin-independent DM--Standard Model interactions, this scattering matrix can be evaluated analytically in the wavelet-harmonic basis. This factorization is particularly helpful for the more complicated analyses that have become necessary in recent years, especially those involving anisotropic detector materials or more realistic models of the local DM velocity distribution. With the new method, analyses studying large numbers of detector orientations and DM particle models can be performed more than 10~million times faster.
  This paper derives several analytic results for the spherical wavelets, including an extrapolation in the space of wavelet coefficients, and a generalization of the vector space method to a much broader class of linear functional integrals. Both results are highly relevant outside the field of DM direct detection.</description>

      <title>Shear viscosity from perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics to the hadron resonance gas at finite baryon, strangeness, and electric charge densities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04968v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Through model-to-data comparisons from heavy-ion collisions, it has been shown that the Quark Gluon Plasma has an extremely small shear viscosity at vanishing densities. At large baryon densities, significantly less is known about the nature of the shear viscosity from Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). Within heavy-ion collisions, there are three conserved charges: baryon number (B), strangeness (S), and electric charge (Q). Here we calculate the shear viscosity in two limits using perturbative QCD and an excluded-volume hadron resonance gas at finite BSQ densities. We then develop a framework that interpolates between these two limits such that shear viscosity is possible to calculate across a wide range of finite BSQ densities. We find that the pQCD and hadron resonance gas calculations have different BSQ densities dependence such that a rather non-trivial shear viscosity appears at finite densities.</description>

      <title>New Angles on Energy Correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16368v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Energy correlators have recently come to the forefront of jet substructure studies at colliders due to their remarkable properties: they naturally separate physics at different scales, are robust to contamination from soft radiation, and offer a direct connection with quantum field theory. The current parametrization used for energy correlators, however, is based on redundant pairwise angles with complex phase space restrictions. In this Letter, we introduce a new parametrization of energy correlators that features a simpler phase space structure and preserves information about the orientation of jet constituents. Further, our parametrization drastically reduces the computational cost to compute energy correlators on experimental data; whereas the time to compute a traditional projected $N$-point energy correlator scales as $M^N/N!$ on a jet with $M$ particles, our new parametrization achieves a scaling of $M^2 \log M$, remarkably independently of N. Even for N=3, this improved scaling is particularly important for studies of heavy ion collisions, and higher values of $N$ will enable new qualitative understanding of gauge theories. Theoretical calculations for our new energy correlators differ from those of traditional parametrizations only at next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy and beyond, and we expect that our simpler phase space structure will simplify those calculations. We also discuss how to extend our parametrization to resolved $N$-point energy correlators that encode angular distances between greater numbers of particles, yielding intuitive visualizations of jet substructure that are qualitatively different for different jet samples. We propose two possible generalizations for probing multi-prong jets and testing jet scaling behavior.</description>

      <title>The effect of pressure anisotropy on quark stars structure in the Starobinsky model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06170v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The structure and stability of quark stars (QSs) made of interacting quark matter are discussed in this study, taking color superconductivity and perturbative QCD corrections into account. By combining this EoS with the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations, we explore the mass-radius ($M-R$) relations of QSs. The analysis is conducted within the framework of $R^2$ gravity, where the gravity model is described by $f(R) = R + a R^2$. Our primary goal is to investigate how variations in the $R^2$ gravity parameter $a$ affect the mass-radius and mass-central density ($M-\rho_c$) relationships of QSs. Furthermore, we study the dynamical stability of these stars by analyzing the impact of anisotropy parameters $\beta$ and the interaction parameter $\lambda$ derived from the EoS, on their stability. Our results demonstrate that the presence of pressure anisotropy plays a significant role in increasing the maximum mass of QSs, with potential implications for the existence of super-massive pulsars. These findings are in agreement with recent astronomical observations, which suggest the possibility of neutron stars exceeding $2M_{\odot}$.</description>

      <title>Neutrino-nucleon elastic scattering in presence of non-standard interactions: cross sections and nucleon polarizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04818v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: New physics beyond the Standard Model (SM) may appear in the form of non-standard neutrino interactions (NSI). We have studied neutral current (anti)neutrino-nucleon scattering in presence of NSI. We obtain that in this scenario, nucleon matrix elements depend not only on the isovector axial nucleon form factor but also on the isoscalar one. For the axial form factors we consequently rely on the quark flavor decomposition performed by QCD simulations in the lattice (LQCD). We have examined cross sections and polarization observables. For the current bounds on diagonal muon flavor NSI couplings we find substantial deviations from the SM predictions in cross sections and transverse polarizations of the outgoing nucleons. In view of the progress in the precision of LQCD determinations of nucleon properties, modern measurements of neutral current (anti)neutrino-nucleon scattering will be in the position to discover or significantly constrain NSI.</description>

      <title>NNPDFpol2.0: a global determination of polarised PDFs and their uncertainties at next-to-next-to-leading order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11814v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present NNPDFpol2.0, a new set of collinear helicity parton distribution functions (PDFs) of the proton based on legacy measurements of structure functions in inclusive neutral-current longitudinally polarised deep-inelastic scattering (DIS), and of W -boson, single-inclusive, and di-jet production asymmetries in longitudinally polarised proton-proton collisions. The determination is accurate to next-to-next-to-leading order in the strong coupling, and includes heavy quark mass corrections in the analysis of DIS data. Uncertainties due to missing higher-order corrections are systematically incorporated by means of a covariance matrix determined by scale variations. NNPDFpol2.0 is based on a machine learning methodology, that makes use of Monte Carlo sampling for the representation of uncertainties into PDFs, of a neural network for the parametrisation of PDFs, of stochastic gradient descent for the optimisation of PDF parameters, and of hyperoptimisation for the selection of the best fitting model. We study the impact on PDFs of higher-order corrections, of the positivity constraint, and of the data. We demonstrate two phenomenological applications of NNPDFpol2.0, specifically the determination of the proton spin fraction carried by gluons and quarks, and of theoretical predictions for single-hadron production in longitudinally polarised DIS and proton-proton collisions.</description>

      <title>Pion-Nucleon Scattering in Baryon Chiral Perturbation Theory combined with the ${ 1/N_c}$ Expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05224v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work implements the combined BChPT and 1/Nc expansions for pion-nucleon elastic scattering. The effective theory is based on the baryon sector dynamical spin-flavor SU(4) symmetry emergent in the large Nc limit, whose breaking is controlled by the $1/N_c$ expansion. The non-commutativity of the chiral and 1/Nc expansions in unitarity corrections (loops) requires a linking of both expansions. As it was shown in the case of baryon masses and currents, the natural linking is the $\xi$-expansion, in which $O(p) = O(1/Nc ) = O(\xi)A$. The spin-flavor symmetry requires that the ground state baryons span an SU(4) symmetric irreducible representation which implies that in particular $N$ and $\Delta$ are active degrees of freedom in the effective theory. The scattering amplitude is expanded to the next-to-next-to leading order in the $\xi$ expansion, corresponding to the one-loop contributions with the LO Lagrangian. The results are given for generic $N_c$ in order to demonstrate the consistency of the framework. The spin-flavor symmetry plays a central role in maintaining the consistency of the effective theory with respect to the $1/N_c$ expansion. This consistency manifests itself in an improvement in the convergence of the low energy expansion with respect to the case of the ordinary BChPT without an explicit dynamical $\Delta$, which is known to be inconsistent with the constraints of $N_c$ scaling. Fits to the $\pi N \to \pi N$ S, P and D partial wave amplitudes from the SAID data base are finally used to test the framework and to determine the energy range of its applicability.</description>

      <title>Modern approach to muonic x-ray spectroscopy demonstrated through the measurement of stable Cl radii</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08804v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in muonic x-ray experiments have reinvigorated efforts in measurements of absolute nuclear charge radii. Here, a modern approach is presented, and demonstrated through determination of the charge radii of the two stable chlorine nuclides $^{35}$Cl and $^{37}$Cl. Knowledge of these radii has implications for fundamental studies in nuclear and atomic physics. For this purpose, a state-of-the-art experiment was performed at the $\pi$E1 beamline in the Paul Scherrer Institute (Switzerland), using a large-scale HPGe detector array in order to extract precise energies of the muonic $^{35}$Cl and $^{37}$Cl $np1s$ transitions. The nuclear charge radius extraction relies on modern calculations for QED effects and nuclear polarization with rigorous uncertainty quantification, including effects that were not accounted for in older studies. Additionally, we established a new method for applying the nuclear shape correction directly from energy density functionals, which are amenable to isotopes for which no high-quality electron scattering experiments are available. The resulting charge radii are $3.3335(23) fm$ for $^{35}$Cl and $3.3445(23) fm$ for $^{37}$Cl, thus improving the uncertainty of the available electron scattering values by a factor of seven. The correlation of several observables was evaluated between the different isotopes in order to produce a more precise value of the differential mean square charge radius $\delta \langle r^2 \rangle^{37, 35}=+0.0771(66) fm^{2}$. In this case, improvement of the uncertainty by more than one order of magnitude was achieved compared to the literature value. This precision is sufficient to use this differential as input for isotope shift factor determination.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Suppression, Quantum Statistics and Symmetries in Spin-3/2 Baryon Scatterings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08960v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the interplay among entanglement suppression, quantum statistics and enhanced symmetries in the non-relativistic $S$-wave scattering involving the lowest-lying spin-3/2 baryons, which can be considered as four-dimensional qudits. These baryons form a ten-dimensional representation (decuplet) under the $\text{SU}(3)$ light-flavor symmetry and, in this limit, are considered indistinguishable under strong interactions. Treating the $S$-matrix in the spin-3/2 baryon-baryon scattering as a quantum logic gate in the spin space, we study the consequence of entanglement suppression and compute the entanglement power of the $S$-matrix. When the entanglement power vanishes, the $S$-matrix is either an Identity or a SWAP gate and spin-flavor symmetries and/or non-relativistic conformal invariance emerge, as previously observed in spin-1/2 baryons. In the case of scattering identical particles, the entanglement power never vanishes due to constraints from spin statistics, which we interpret as projection-valued measurements onto symmetric or antisymmetric Hilbert space and define the entanglement power accordingly. When the entanglement power is non-vanishing but sits at a global or local minimum, enhanced symmetries still emerge and the $S$-matrix can be interpreted as an Identity or a SWAP gate acting on the restricted Hilbert space allowed by quantum statistics. In general, when scattering identical spin-$s$ particles, we identify an enhanced $\text{SU}(2s+1)_{\text{spin}}$ symmetry for the Identity gate.</description>
