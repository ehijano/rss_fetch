      <title>Cascading failures with group support in interdependent hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The functionality of an entity frequently necessitates the support of a group situated in another layer of the system. To unravel the profound impact of such group support on a system's resilience against cascading failures, we devise a framework comprising a double-layer interdependent hypergraph system, wherein nodes are capable of receiving support via hyperedges. Our central hypothesis posits that the failure may transcend to another layer when all support groups of each dependent node fail, thereby initiating a potentially iterative cascade across layers. Through rigorous analytical methods, we derive the critical threshold for the initial node survival probability that marks the second-order phase transition point. A salient discovery is that as the prevalence of dependent nodes escalates, the system dynamics shift from a second-order to a first-order phase transition. Notably, irrespective of the collapse pattern, systems characterized by scale-free hyperdegree distributions within both hypergraph layers consistently demonstrate superior robustness compared to those adhering to Poisson hyperdegree distributions. In summary, our research underscores the paramount significance of group support mechanisms and intricate network topologies in determining the resilience of interconnected systems against the propagation of cascading failures. By exploring the interplay between these factors, we have gained insights into how systems can be designed or optimized to mitigate the risk of widespread disruptions, ensuring their continued functionality and stability in the face of adverse events.</description>

      <title>Hands-on STEM Learning Experiences using Digital Technologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00781v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The facilitation of STEM education can be enhanced by the provision of opportunities for learners to gain a better understanding of science through the utilization of tangible and visual examples. The objective of this work is to present an account of our experiences and activities carried out in Italian schools with this novel approach. The selection of projects and experiences discussed --in which students develop a range of core competencies such as collaboration, creativity, critical thinking, experimentation, prototyping, communication and problem-solving; include tangible complex 3D printed structures, large micro-controller board replicas and the visualization of wind dynamics and tiny invisible elementary particles among others. These hands-on experiences demonstrate the benefits on the use of digital fabrication technologies implemented within a FabLab for STEM learning.</description>

      <title>A value-focused thinking approach to measure community resilience</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00901v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Community resilience refers to the ability to prepare for, absorb, recover from, and adapt to disruptive events, but specific definitions and measures for resilience can vary widely from researcher to researcher or from discipline to discipline. Community resilience is often measured using a set of indicators based on census, socioeconomic, and community organizational data, but these metrics and measures for community resilience provide little guidance for policymakers to determine how best to increase the community resilience. This article proposes to measure community resilience based on value focused thinking. We propose an objectives hierarchy that begins with a community decision makers' fundamental objective for resilience. Six high level objectives for community resilience, including social resilience, economic resilience, infrastructure resilience, environmental resilience, availability of resources, and functionality of critical services, are broken down into measurable attributes that focus on specific outcomes that a decision maker would like to achieve if a disruption occurs. This new way of assessing resilience is applied to measure the resilience of an illustrative community to an improvised explosive device, a cyberattack, a tornado, a flood, and a winter storm. Keywords: Community Resilience, Resiliency, Risk Analysis</description>

      <title>Prompt Refinement or Fine-tuning? Best Practices for using LLMs in Computational Social Science Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01346v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models are expressive tools that enable complex tasks of text understanding within Computational Social Science. Their versatility, while beneficial, poses a barrier for establishing standardized best practices within the field. To bring clarity on the values of different strategies, we present an overview of the performance of modern LLM-based classification methods on a benchmark of 23 social knowledge tasks. Our results point to three best practices: select models with larger vocabulary and pre-training corpora; avoid simple zero-shot in favor of AI-enhanced prompting; fine-tune on task-specific data, and consider more complex forms instruction-tuning on multiple datasets only when only training data is more abundant.</description>

      <title>A new framework for calibrating COVID-19 SEIR models with spatial-/time-varying coefficients using genetic and sliding window algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08524v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A susceptible-exposed-infected-removed (SEIR) model assumes spatial-/time-varying coefficients to model the effect of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) on the regional and temporal distribution of COVID-19 disease epidemics. A significant challenge in using such model is their fast and accurate calibration to observed data from geo-referenced hospitalized data, i.e., efficient estimation of the spatial-/time-varying parameters. In this work, a new calibration framework is proposed towards optimizing the spatial-/time-varying parameters of the SEIR model. We also devise a method for combing the overlapping sliding window technique (OSW) with a genetic algorithm (GA) calibration routine to automatically search the segmented parameter space. Parallelized GA is used to reduce the computational burden. Our framework abstracts the implementation complexity of the method away from the user. It provides high-level APIs for setting up a customized calibration system and consuming the optimized values of parameters. We evaluated the application of our method on the calibration of a spatial age-structured microsimulation model using a single objective function that comprises observed COVID-19-related ICU demand. The results reflect the effectiveness of the proposed method towards estimating the parameters in a changing environment.</description>
