      <title>Intuitive control of myoelectric prostheses with agonist-antagonist interface and magnetomicrometery: narrative review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Proprioception is crucial in intuitive control of prosthetic limbs and therefor contributes to intuitive prosthetic use. The agonist-antagonist myoneural interface (AMI) is an prosthetic innovation with enhanced control, reduced pain, and heightened proprioceptive sensation in clinical experiments. Furthermore, studies have addressed surgical techniques to make this myoelectric interface available to a larger group of patients. A narrative review on AMI developmental process, surgical implementations, and validation has been conducted for clinical and pre-clinical experimental research, embedded in a theoretical background on feedback control and proprioception. The closing chapter on magnetomicrometery serves to illustrate how motor control reading, as an example component, can benefit from technical innovations to enhance intuitive prosthetic control in AMI.</description>

      <title>Reproducibility Made Easy: A Tool for Methodological Transparency and Efficient Standardized Reporting based on the proposed MRSinMRS Consensus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A recent expert consensus found that non-standard reporting in MRS studies led to poor reproducibility. In order to address this, MRSinMRS guidelines were introduced; however, because of the disparate nomenclature and data formats, adoption has been slow. To get around this problem, REMY, a toolbox that supports major vendor formats, was created. By efficiently filling in important fields in the MRSinMRS table, it improves reproducibility. Even with certain hardware-related restrictions, REMY makes a substantial contribution to the completion of acquisition parameters, which facilitates reporting. Its compatibility and user-friendly interface should promote widespread adoption of MRSinMRS, raising the caliber of MRS research.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The status of the LINrem project is presented, focusing on the development of innovative neutron dosimeters with enhanced energy sensitivity, time resolution, and portability. Designed to meet the technical demands of radiation protection in modern particle and nuclear facilities, these dosimeters are discussed in detail. Results from experimental campaigns showcasing their efficacy in pulsed fields generated by fusion plasmas and high-intensity pulsed lasers are presented. Additionally, prospects and future plans for the LINrem project are outlined.</description>

      <title>Noise-reduction techniques for 1H-FID-MRSI at 14.1T: Monte-Carlo validation &amp; in vivo application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.11204v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (1H-MRSI) is a powerful tool that enables the multidimensional non-invasive mapping of the neurochemical profile at high-resolution over the entire brain. The constant demand for higher spatial resolution in 1H-MRSI led to increased interest in post-processing-based denoising methods aimed at reducing noise variance. The aim of the present study was to implement two noise-reduction techniques, the Marchenko-Pastur principal component analysis (MP-PCA) based denoising and the low-rank total generalized variation (LR-TGV) reconstruction, and to test their potential and impact on preclinical 14.1T fast in vivo 1H-FID-MRSI datasets. Since there is no known ground truth for in vivo metabolite maps, additional evaluations of the performance of both noise-reduction strategies were conducted using Monte-Carlo simulations. Results showed that both denoising techniques increased the apparent signal-to-noise ratio SNR while preserving noise properties in each spectrum for both in vivo and Monte-Carlo datasets. Relative metabolite concentrations were not significantly altered by either methods and brain regional differences were preserved in both synthetic and in vivo datasets. Increased precision of metabolite estimates was observed for the two methods, with inconsistencies noted on lower concentrated metabolites. Our study provided a framework on how to evaluate the performance of MP-PCA and LR-TGV methods for preclinical 1H-FID MRSI data at 14.1T. While gains in apparent SNR and precision were observed, concentration estimations ought to be treated with care especially for low-concentrated metabolites.</description>

      <title>So You Want to Image Myelin Using MRI: Magnetic Susceptibility Source Separation for Myelin Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03690v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In MRI, researchers have long endeavored to effectively visualize myelin distribution in the brain, a pursuit with significant implications for both scientific research and clinical applications. Over time, various methods such as myelin water imaging, magnetization transfer imaging, and relaxometric imaging have been developed, each carrying distinct advantages and limitations. Recently, an innovative technique named as magnetic susceptibility source separation has emerged, introducing a novel surrogate biomarker for myelin in the form of a diamagnetic susceptibility map. This paper comprehensively reviews this cutting-edge method, providing the fundamental concepts of magnetic susceptibility, susceptibility imaging, and the validation of the diamagnetic susceptibility map as a myelin biomarker that indirectly measure myelin content. Additionally, the paper explores essential aspects of data acquisition and processing, offering practical insights for readers. A comparison with established myelin imaging methods is also presented, and both current and prospective clinical and scientific applications are discussed to provide a holistic understanding of the technique. This work aims to serve as a foundational resource for newcomers entering this dynamic and rapidly expanding field.</description>

      <title>A New Family of High-Current Cyclotrons for Isotope Production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.19160v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We are developing a high-current cyclotron as a driver for the IsoDAR neutrino experiment. It accelerates 5 mA H2+ to 60 MeV/amu, after which the electron is removed to produce a 10 mA, 60 MeV proton beam. The enabling innovations that offset space-charge effects occur at injection and in the first few turns, allowing one to construct cyclotrons with energies ranging from below 5 MeV up to 60 MeV/amu, or possibly higher, with the same performance for accelerated ions with Q/A = 0.5 (H2+, D+, He++, ...). In this paper, we discuss the possible uses of such cyclotrons for isotope production, including production of long-lived generator parents (68Ga, 44Ti, 82Sr,...), as well as intense fast neutron beams from deuteron breakup for (n,2n) production of isotopes like 225Ac.</description>
