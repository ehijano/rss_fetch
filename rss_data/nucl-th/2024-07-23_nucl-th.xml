      <title>Superfluid fraction in the rod phase of the inner crust of neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rod phase as it is expected in the bottom layers of neutron-star crusts is analyzed within the Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov framework. In order to well describe the interplay between band structure and superfluidity, periodicity of the lattice is taken into account using Bloch boundary conditions. A relative flow between the rods and the surrounding neutron gas is introduced in a time-independent way. This induces a non-trivial phase of the complex order parameter, leading to a counterflow between neutrons inside and outside the rods. With the resulting current, we compute the actual neutron superfluid fraction. For the latter our results are significantly larger than previous ones obtained in normal band theory, indicating that the normal band theory overestimates the entrainment effect.</description>

      <title>Restricted Boltzmann Machines Propagators for Auxiliary Field Diffusion Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The auxiliary field diffusion Monte Carlo method uses imaginary-time projection techniques to accurately solve the ground-state wave function of atomic nuclei and infinite nuclear matter. In this work, we present a novel representation of the imaginary-time propagator based on restricted Boltzmann machines. We test its accuracy against the routinely employed Hubbard-Stratonovich transformations by evaluating ground-state energies and single-particle densities of selected light nuclei. This analysis paves the way for incorporating more realistic nuclear potentials in the auxiliary field diffusion Monte Carlo method, including isospin-dependent spin-orbit terms and cubic spin-isospin operators, which characterize accurate phenomenological and chiral effective field theory Hamiltonians.</description>

      <title>Shape coexistence in Ne isotopes and hyperon impurity effect on low-lying states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on the beyond-mean-field Skyrme-Hartree-Fock model, we investigate the shape coexistence in Ne isotopes and the effect of $\la$ hyperon on the energy level structure in the nuclei. The up-to-date Skyrme-type $N\la$ interaction SLL4 and the $NN$ interaction SGII are employed. Low-lying energy spectra of $^{20,22,24,26,28,30,32,34}$Ne, including the low-lying states with $J\leq 6$, are predicted, discussed in detail, and found in good agreement with experimental results. The electric quadrupole transition rate is also examined. The coexistences of a ground state rotational band and a $\be$ vibrational band are revealed in $^{20,22,24}$Ne. Unlike the previously discovered shrinkage effect of $\la_{s}$ on the ground state nuclei, it is found that the $\la_{s}$ may alter the excitation mode of the second band by affecting the distribution of the collective wave function, thereby causing the $\be$ vibrational band transitions to a vibrational band with equidistant energy levels.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic flow fluctuation as a possible signature of clustered nuclear geometry in O-O collisions at the Large Hadron Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nuclei having $4n$ number of nucleons are theorized to possess clusters of $\alpha$ particles ($^4$He nucleus). The Oxygen nucleus ($^{16}$O) is a doubly magic nucleus, where the presence of an $\alpha$-clustered nuclear structure grants additional nuclear stability. In this study, we exploit the anisotropic flow coefficients to discern the effects of an $\alpha$-clustered nuclear geometry w.r.t. a Woods-Saxon nuclear distribution in O--O collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=7$ TeV using a hybrid of IP-Glasma + MUSIC + iSS + UrQMD models. In addition, we use the multi-particle cumulants method to measure anisotropic flow coefficients, such as elliptic flow ($v_{2}$) and triangular flow ($v_{3}$), as a function of collision centrality. Anisotropic flow fluctuations, which are expected to be larger in small collision systems, are also studied for the first time in O--O collisions. It is found that an $\alpha$-clustered nuclear distribution gives rise to an enhanced value of $v_{2}$ and $v_3$ towards the highest multiplicity classes. Consequently, a rise in $v_3/v_2$ is also observed for the (0-10)\% centrality class. Further, for $\alpha$-clustered O--O collisions, fluctuations of $v_{2}$ are larger for the most central collisions, which decrease towards the mid-central collisions. In contrast, for a Woods-Saxon $^{16}$O nucleus, $v_{2}$ fluctuations show an opposite behavior with centrality. This study, when confronted with experimental data may reveal the importance of nuclear density profile on the discussed observables.</description>

      <title>The Relative Abundance of Correlated Spin-zero Nucleon Pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We utilize the generalized contact formalism in conjunction with the Woods-Saxon mean-field description of the long-range part of the nuclear wave function to assess the relative prevalence of short-range correlation pairs within atomic nuclei. We validate our approach by fitting experimental charge density results and electron scattering experiments to a very good agreement. Applying our model, we calculate the spin-zero short-range correlations contact ratios. Interestingly, for nuclei with $A&gt;50$, we observe a notable dependence on the neutron-to-proton ratio $N/Z$. Specifically, the probability per nucleon to find neutron-neutron pairs increases, while that of proton-proton pairs decreases, whereas the probability of finding neutron-proton pairs remains relatively constant. To interpret this isospin symmetry breaking effect, we employ a simple model based on generalized Levinger constants, linking it to differences in nuclear proton and neutron radii.</description>

      <title>Reaction of deuteron with a heavy nucleus at low energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the recently proposed mechanism for inducing low energy nuclear reactions (LENR) to compute the reaction rate of deuteron with a heavy nucleus. The process gets dominant contribution at second order in the time dependent perturbation theory and is assisted by a resonance. The reaction proceeds by breakdown of deuteron into a proton and a neutron due to the action of the first perturbation. In the second, nuclear perturbation, the neutron gets captured by the heavy nucleus. Both perturbations are assumed to be electromagnetic and lead to the emission of two photons, one at each vertex. The heavy nucleus is taken to be ${}^{58}$Ni although many other may be considered.The reaction rate is found to be very small unless assisted by some special conditions. In the present case we assume the presence of a nuclear resonant state. In the presence of such a state we find that the reaction rate
  is sufficiently large to be observable in laboratory even at low energies.</description>

      <title>Average speed of sound in neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The structure of the dense-matter equation of state is essential for the phenomenology of neutron stars. In this work, we relate the thermodynamic properties to the average speed of sound in the interior of a star. We study the consequences of the restoration of conformal symmetry. In particular, we show that if the trace anomaly vanishes in the centers of maximally massive neutron stars, the speed of sound likely exceeds its conformal value and exhibits nonmonotonic behavior. We also find that the additional assumption of positive definiteness of the trace anomaly naturally induces a local peak of the speed of sound at densities realized in the cores of neutron stars. We also discuss the stability condition for the hybrid neutron stars Possible implications for the dense matter equation of state and the phenomenology of neutron stars are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Triply charm and bottom tetraquarks in a constituent quark model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14548v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, the singly, doubly and fully charmed tetraquark candidates, $T_{c\bar{s}}(2900)$, $T^+_{cc}(3875)$ and $X(6900)$ are experimentally reported by the LHCb collaboration. Hence, it is quite necessary to implement a theoretical investigation on the triply heavy tetrquarks. In this study, the S-wave triply charm and bottom tetraquarks, $\bar{Q}Q\bar{q}Q$ $(q=u,\,d,\,s;\,Q=c,\,b)$, with spin-parity $J^P=0^+$, $1^+$ and $2^+$, isospin $I=0$ and $\frac{1}{2}$ are systematically studied in a constituent quark model. Particularly, a complete S-wave tetraquark configurations, which include the meson-meson, diquark-antidiquark and K-type arrangements of quarks, along with all allowed color structures, are comprehensively considered. A high accuracy and efficient computational approach, the Gaussian expansion method (GEM), in cooperation with a powerful complex-scaling method (CSM), which is quite ingenious in dealing with the bound and resonant state of a multiquark system simultaneously, are adopted in solving the complex scaled Schr\"odinger equation. This theoretical framework has already been successfully applied in various tetra- and penta-quark systems. Bound state of triply heavy tetraquark system is unavailable in our study, nevertheless, in a fully coupled-channel calculation by the CSM, several narrow resonances are found in each $I(J^P)$ quantum states of the charm and bottom sector. In particular, triply charm and bottom tetraquark resonances are obtained in $5.59-5.94$ GeV and $15.31-15.67$ GeV, respectively. Compositeness of exotic states, such as the inner quark distance, magnetic moment and dominant component, are also analyzed. These exotic hadrons in triply heavy sector are expected to be confirmed in future high energy experiments.</description>

      <title>Attractor for 1+1D viscous hydrodynamics with general rapidity distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15209v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Attractor, supposed to be one of the possible answer for the early applicability of hydrodynamics in the evolution with different initial conditions, has attracted great attention to the fast decreasing of degrees of freedom in heavy ion collision. We found attractor behaviors for 1+1D viscous hydrodynamics with general rapidity distribution based on MIS theory. Meanwhile, we also observe that a rapid expansion in the fluid velocity is essential for a rapid early time attractor.</description>

      <title>First experimental test of the ratio method for nuclear-reaction analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15535v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nuclear halos are very exotic quantal structures observed far from stability. Because of their short lifetime, they are mostly studied through reactions. The ratio method offers a new observable: the ratio of angular differential cross sections for breakup and scattering. It is predicted to be much more sensitive to the projectile structure than individual cross sections thanks to its independence of the reaction process. We test this new observable experimentally for the first time considering the collision of 11Be on C at 22.8 MeV/nucleon. We extend this analysis to similar data recently measured on Pb at 19.1 MeV/nucleon. Both analyses confirm the theoretical predictions, which opens the door to a new era in the study of nuclear structure near the neutron dripline. This should prove invaluable in conjunction with the start of FRIB. The ratio method could also be extended to other fields of quantum physics beyond nuclear reactions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.14293v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A geometrical analysis of the stability of nuclei against deformations is presented. In particular, we use Catastrophe Theory to illustrate discontinuous changes in the behavior of nuclei with respect to deformations as one moves in the N - Z space. We construct a minimalistic deformation model using the microscopic-macroscopic approach. A third-order phase transition is found in the liquid-drop model, which translates to a complete loss of stability (using the Fold catastrophe) when shell effects are included. The analysis is found to explain the instability of known fissile nuclei and also justify known decay chains of heavy nuclei.</description>

      <title>Simulations of stochastic fluid dynamics near a critical point in the phase diagram</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10608v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present simulations of stochastic fluid dynamics in the vicinity of a critical endpoint belonging to the universality class of the Ising model. This study is motivated by the challenge of modeling the dynamics of critical fluctuations near a conjectured critical endpoint in the phase diagram of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). We focus on the interaction of shear modes with a conserved scalar density, which is known as model H. We show that the observed dynamical scaling behavior depends on the correlation length and the shear viscosity of the fluid. As the correlation length is increased or the viscosity is decreased we observe a cross-over from the dynamical exponent of critical diffusion, $z\simeq 4$, to the expected scaling exponent of model H, $z\simeq 3$. We use our method to investigate time-dependent correlation function of non-Gaussian moments $M^n(t)$ of the order parameter. We find that the relaxation time depends in non-trivial manner on the power $n$.</description>

      <title>Multiplicity fluctuations and rapidity correlations in ultracentral proton-nucleus collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14671v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A collision between a proton and a heavy nucleus at ultrarelativistic energy creates particles whose rapidity distribution is asymmetric, with more particles emitted in the direction of the nucleus than in the direction of the proton. This asymmetry becomes more pronounced as the centrality estimator, defined from the energy deposited in a calorimeter, increases. We argue that for high-multiplicity collisions, the variation of the impact parameter plays a negligible role, and that the fluctuations of the multiplicity and of the centrality estimator are dominated by quantum fluctuations, whose probability distribution can be well approximated by a correlated gamma distribution. We show that this simple model reproduces existing data, and we make quantitative predictions for collisions in the $0-0.1\%$ and $0-0.01\%$ centrality windows. We argue that by repeating the same analysis with a different centrality estimator, one can obtain direct information about the rapidity decorrelation in particle production.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05570v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The determination of the speed of sound in quark-gluon plasma is a crucial aspect of understanding the properties of strongly interacting matter created in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. In this study, we investigate the impact of initial-state fluctuations on the extraction of the speed of sound in a quark-gluon plasma in the ultra-central collisions. By employing the TRENTo model for simulating initial conditions, we demonstrate that these fluctuations lead to sizable volume effect, which in turn corrects the measured values of the sound velocity. With respect to realistic conditions of high-energy heavy-ion experiments, we provide quantitative estimate of these corrections.</description>

Abstract: We discuss the sensitivity of tunneling processes to the initial preparation of the quantum state. We compare the case of Gaussian wave packets of different positional variances using a generalised Woods-Saxon potential for which analytical expressions of the tunneling coefficients are available. Using realistic parameters for barrier potentials we find that the usual plane wave approximation underestimates fusion reactivities by an order of magnitude in a range of temperatures of practical relevance for controlled energy production.</description>

      <title>Elements of Confinement for QCD with Twelve Massless Quarks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.12203v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider continuum formulation QCD in four dimensions with twelve massless fundamental quark flavors. Splitting the SU(N) gauge field into background and fluctuation parts, we use well developed techniques to calculate the one-loop effective action for the theory. We find that for constant self-dual background field-strength tensor the notorious infrared divergences of the effective action cancel between gauge and matter sectors if the number of massless quark flavors is exactly $N_f = 4N$. The ultraviolet divergencies of the effective action are non-perturbatively renormalized with a $\beta$-function that matches the known perturbative result in the weak coupling limit. The resulting UV- and IR-finite effective action possesses a non-trivial minimum which has lower free energy than the perturbative vacuum, and for which the expectation value of the Polyakov loop vanishes. Inclusion of finite temperature effects points to the presence of a first-order phase transition to the perturbative vacuum with a calculable critical temperature.</description>

      <title>Hybrid analysis of radiative corrections to neutron decay with current algebra and effective field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08976v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a useful framework for high-precision studies of the neutron beta decay by merging the current algebra description and the fixed-order effective field theory calculation of the electroweak radiative corrections to the neutron axial form factor. We discuss the advantages of this hybrid method and show that it only requires a minimal amount of lattice QCD inputs to achieve a $10^{-4}$ theory accuracy for the Standard Model prediction of the neutron lifetime and the axial-to-vector coupling ratio $\lambda$, both important to the search for physics beyond the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>Detecting superfluid transition in the pulsar core</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11539v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is believed that the core of a neutron star can be host to various novel phases of matter, from nucleon superfluid phase to exotic high baryon density quantum chromodynamics (QCD) phases. Different observational signals for such phase transitions have been discussed in the literature. Here, we point out a unique phenomenon associated with phase transition to a superfluid phase, which may be the nucleon superfluid phase or a phase like the CFL phase, allowing for superfluid vortices. In any superfluid phase transition, a random network of vortices forms via the so-called Kibble-Zurek mechanism, which eventually mostly decays away, finally leaving primarily vortices arising from the initial angular momentum of the core. This transient, random vortex network can have a non-zero net angular momentum for the superfluid component, which will generally be oriented in an arbitrary direction. This is in contrast to the final vortices, which arise from initial rotation and hence have the initial angular momentum of the neutron star. The angular momentum of the random vortex network is balanced by an equal and opposite angular momentum in the normal fluid due to the conservation of angular momentum, thereby imparting an arbitrarily oriented angular momentum component to the outer shell of the neutron star. This will affect the pulse timing and pulse profile of a pulsar. These changes in the pulses will decay away in a characteristic manner such that the random vortex network decays, obeying specific scaling laws leading to universal features for the detection of superfluid transitions occurring in a pulsar core.</description>

      <title>Spectra of correlators in the relaxation time approximation of kinetic theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17769v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The relaxation time approximation (RTA) of the kinetic Boltzmann equation is likely the simplest window into the microscopic properties of collective real-time transport. Within this framework, we analytically compute all retarded two-point Green's functions of the energy-momentum tensor and a conserved $U(1)$ current in thermal states with classical massless particles (a `CFT') at non-zero density, and in the absence and presence of broken translational symmetry. This is done in $2+1$ and $3+1$ dimensions. RTA allows a full explicit analysis of the analytic structure of different correlators (poles versus branch cuts) and the transport properties that they imply (the thermoelectric conductivities, and the hydrodynamic, quasihydrodynamic and gapped mode dispersion relations). Our inherently weakly coupled analysis thereby also enables a direct comparison with previously known strongly coupled results in holographic CFTs dual to the Einstein-Maxwell-axion theories.</description>

      <title>Upper Limit of Sound Speed in Nuclear Matter: A Harmonious Interplay of Transport Calculation and Perturbative QCD Constraint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09563v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Very recently, it has been shown that there is an upper bound on the squared sound speed of nuclear matter from the transport, which reads $c_{\rm s}^2 \leq 0.781$. In this work, we demonstrate that this upper bound is corroborated by the reconstructed equation of state (EOS; modeled with a nonparametric method) for ultra-dense matter. The reconstruction integrates multi-messenger observation for neutron stars (NSs), in particular, the latest radius measurements for PSR J0437-4715 ($11.36^{+0.95}_{-0.63}$ km), PSR J0030+0451 ($11.71^{+0.88}_{-0.83}$ km, in the ST+PDT model), and PSR J0740+6620 ($12.49^{+1.28}_{-0.88}$ km) by NICER have been adopted. The result shows in all cases, the $c_{\rm s}^2 \leq 0.781$ upper limit for EOS will naturally yield the properties of matter near center of the massive neutron star consistent with the causality-driven constraint from pQCD, where in practice, the constraint is applied at ten nuclear saturation density ($n_{\rm L}=10n_{\rm s}$). We also note that there is a strong correlation for the maximum $c_s^2$ with $n_{\rm L}$, and $c_{\rm s}^2 \leq 0.781$ is somehow violated when $n_{\rm L} = n_{\rm c,TOV}$. The result indicates that a higher density in implementing the pQCD constraint, even considering the uncertainties from statistics, is more natural. Moreover, the remarkable agreement between the outcomes derived from these two distinct and independent constraints (i.e., the transport calculation and pQCD boundary) lends strong support to their validity. Besides, the latest joint constraint for $R_{1.4}$, $R_{2.0}$, $R_{1.4}-R_{2.0}$, and $M_{\rm TOV}$ are $11.94_{-0.68}^{+0.77}$ km, $11.99_{-0.67}^{+0.88}$ km, $-0.1_{-0.27}^{+0.42}$ km, and $2.24_{-0.10}^{+0.13}M_\odot$ (at $90\%$ credible level), respectively.</description>

      <title>Isotope-shift factors with quantum electrodynamics effects for many-electron systems: A study of the nuclear charge radius of $^{26m}$Al</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13369v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A method for calculating the field shift contribution to isotope shifts in many-electron atoms, incorporating quantum electrodynamics (QED) effects, is introduced. We also implement the model QED approach to incorporate QED contribution to the nuclear recoil effect at the high-order correlation effects treatment level. The proposed computational scheme is used to revise the value of the root-mean-square (rms) nuclear charge radius of the isomer of aluminium-26, $^{26m}$Al. This radius is important for the global analysis of the $V_{ud}$ element of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix. The difference in mean-square nuclear charge radii of $^{27}$Al and $^{26m}$Al, obtained by combining the calculated atomic factors with recently measured isotope shift (IS) of the $3s^23p~^2P_{3/2} \to 3s^24s~^2S_{1/2}$ transition in Al, is $0.443(44)(19)~{\rm fm}^2$, where the first and second uncertainties are experimental and theoretical ones, respectively. The latter is reduced by a factor of 4 with respect to the previous study. Using this value and the known value of the rms charge radius of $^{27}$Al, the resultant value $R_c(^{26m}$Al) = 3.132(10)~fm is obtained. With the improved accuracy of the calculated IS factors the error in $R_c(^{26m}$Al) is now dominated by the experimental uncertainty. Similar revision of rms charge radii is made for the $^{28}$Al, $^{29}$Al, $^{30}$Al, $^{31}$Al and $^{32}$Al isotopes using existing IS measurements. Additionally, atomic factors are computed for the $3s^23p~^2P_{3/2} \to 3s^24s~^2S_{1/2}$, $3s^23p~^2P_{1/2} \to 3s^25s~^2S_{1/2}$ and $3s^23p~^2P_{3/2} \to 3s^25s~^2S_{1/2}$ transitions in Al, which can be used in future experimental studies.</description>

      <title>Observation of Universal Expansion Anisotropy from Cold Atoms to Hot Quark-Gluon Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02847v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Azimuthal anisotropy has been ubiquitously observed in high-energy proton-proton, proton-nucleus, and nucleus-nucleus (heavy-ion) collisions, shaking the early belief that those anisotropies must stem from utterly strong interactions. This work reports a study of anisotropic expansion of cold $^{6}$Li Fermi gases, initially trapped in an anisotropic potential, as a function of the interaction strength that can be readily tuned by an external magnetic field. It is found that the expansion anisotropy builds up quickly at small interaction strength, without the need of utterly strong interactions. A universal behavior of the expansion anisotropy is quantitatively observed between cold-atom and heavy-ion systems, despite their vast differences in physics. This universality will potentially unify a variety of disciplines in nature, from the weakly interacting dilute systems of gases to the strongly interacting quark-gluon plasma of the early universe.</description>
