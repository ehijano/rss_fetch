      <title>Polarizability of the kaonic helium atom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The static dipole polarizability of metastable states in the kaonic helium atoms is studied. We use the complex coordinate rotation method to properly account for the resonant nature of the states. Our calculations show that some of the states are not stable with respect to collisional quenching in a dense helium target and should not be detected in the experiment.</description>

      <title>Smallness of the nuclear polarization effect in the hyperfine structure of heavy muonic atoms as a stimulus for next-generation experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is renewed interest in studies of muonic atoms, which may provide detailed information on nuclear structure. A major limiting factor in the interpretation of measurements is the nuclear polarization contribution. We propose a method to determine this contribution to the hyperfine structure in muonic atoms from a combination of theory and experiment for hydrogenlike ions and muonic atoms. Applying the method to $^{203,205}$Tl and $^{209}$Bi, for which there are H-like ion and muonic atom hyperfine experimental data, we find that the nuclear polarization contribution for these systems is small, and place a limit on its size of less than $10\%$ the total hyperfine splitting. We have also performed direct calculations of the nuclear polarization contribution using a semi-analytical model, which indicate that it may be as much as two orders of magnitude smaller. Therefore, we conclude that the nuclear polarization correction to the hyperfine structure of muonic atoms does not represent a limiting factor for next-generation experiments.</description>

      <title>Revisiting collisional broadening of $^{85}$Rb Rydberg levels: conclusions for vapor cell manufacture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrometry based on electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) in alkali Rydberg vapor cells may suffer reduced sensitivity due to spurious line broadening effects, caused by surface charges, contaminant gases, or other manufacturing defects. In order to draw conclusions about the deleterious effects of potential contaminant gases inside Rydberg electrometry vapor cells, we revisit collisional broadening and shifts of both the D$_2$ line and Rydberg levels of rubidium. Specifically, we measure the broadening and shifts of the $5{\rm S}_{1/2}\rightarrow 5{\rm P}_{3/2}$ (i.e., the D$_2$ line) and $5{\rm S}_{1/2}\rightarrow 5{\rm P}_{3/2}\rightarrow (25{\rm D},27{\rm S},30{\rm D},32{\rm S},35{\rm D},37{\rm S})$ transitions of $^{85}$Rb due to He, Ne, N$_2$ and Ar. By combining these measurements with observations of velocity changing collisions in the sub-Doppler spectrum of the D$_2$ line, we conclude the following: (1) that contaminant gases are most likely not the cause of irregular line shapes or shifts of Rydberg transitions due to the high pressures required, and (2) the sub-Doppler spectrum of the D$_2$ line, through its accompanying loss of contrast at high pressures, can validate that a vapor cell is sufficiently free of contaminant gas for EIT electrometry. We use the theory of Omont, J. Phys. France 38, 1343 (1977), to extend our results to a wide variety of possible contaminant gases and further derive scaling laws applicable to all gases.</description>

      <title>Universal bound states and resonances with Coulomb plus short-range potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06011v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study charged particles in three dimensions interacting via a short-range potential in addition to the Coulomb potential. When the Bohr radius and the scattering length are much larger than the potential range, low-energy physics of the system becomes independent from details of the short-range potential. We develop the zero-range theory to describe such universal physics in terms of the Bohr radius and the scattering length by generalizing the Bethe-Peierls boundary condition, which is then applied to two charged particles to reveal their bound states and resonances. Infinite resonances are found for a repulsive Coulomb potential, one of which turns into a bound state with increasing inverse scattering length, whereas infinite bound states exist for an attractive Coulomb potential with no resonances at any scattering length. The zero-range theory is also applied to three equally charged particles at infinite scattering length under the variational Born-Oppenheimer approximation. We find that the effective potential between two heavy particles induced by a light particle is an inverse-square attraction at distances shorter than the Bohr radius, leading to infinite deep bound states, whereas shallow ones successively turn into resonances with increasing Coulomb repulsion.</description>

      <title>Group Conductivity and Nonadiabatic Born Effective Charges of Disordered Metals, Warm Dense Matter and Hot Dense Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16230v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The average ionization state is a critical parameter in plasma models for charged particle transport, equation of state, and optical response. The dynamical or nonadiabatic Born effective charge (NBEC), calculated via first principles time-dependent density functional theory, provides exact ionic partitioning of bulk electron response for both metallic and insulating materials. The NBEC can be trivially transformed into a ''group conductivity", that is, the electron conductivity ascribed to a subset of ions. We show that for disordered metallic systems, such as warm dense matter (WDM) and hot dense plasma, the static limit of the NBEC is different from the average ionization state, but that the ionization state can be extracted from the group conductivity even in mixed systems. We demonstrate this approach using a set of archetypical examples, including cold and warm aluminium, low- and high- density WDM carbon, and a WDM carbon-beryllium-hydrogen mixture.</description>

      <title>Estimation Enhancing in Optoelectronic Property: A Novel Approach Using Orbital Interaction Parameters and Tight-Binding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper advocates for an innovative approach designed for estimating optoelectronic properties of quantum structures utilizing Tight-Binding (TB) theory. Predicated on the comparative analysis between estimated and actual properties, the study strives to validate the efficacy of this proposed technique; focusing notably on the computation of bandgap energy. It is observed that preceding methodologies offered a restricted accuracy when predicting complex structures like super-lattices and quantum wells. To address this gap, we propose a methodology involving three distinct phases using orbital interaction parameters (OIPs) and the TB theory. The research employed Aluminium Arsenide (AlAs) and Gallium Arsenide (GaAs) as the primary bulk materials. Our novel approach introduces a computation framework that first focuses on bulk computation, subsequently expanding to super-lattice structures. The findings of this research demonstrate promising results regarding the accuracy of predicated optoelectronic properties, particularly the cut-off wavelength. This study paves the way for future research, potentially enhancing the precision of the proposed methodology and its application scope within the field of quantum optoelectronics.</description>

Abstract: The study of the magnetic properties of atoms and nuclei was performed. A linear dependence between the strength of the magnetic field at the nucleus and the effective charge divided by the major quantum number were analyzed and explained. The calculations of the magnetic field at the nucleus were done for a wide set of electron configurations within the framework of relativistic Dirac-Hartree-Fock method.

      <title>Constraints on exotic interactions from scalar spin-spin coupling in tritium deuteride (DT)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15442v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A comparison of theoretical and experimental values of the scalar spin-spin interaction ($J$-coupling) in tritium deuteride molecules yield constraints for nucleon-nucleon exotic interactions of the dimensionless coupling strengths $g_Vg_V$, $g_Ag_A$ and $g_pg_p$, corresponding to the exchange of an vector, axial-vector, and pseudoscalar (axionlike) boson. The couplings between proton ($p$) and nucleon ($N$), denoted by $g_V^p g_V^N$, $g_p^p g_p^N$ are constrained to be less than $1.4 \times 10^{-6}$ and $2.7\times 10^{-6}$, respectively, for boson masses around 5 keV. The coupling constant $g_A^p g_A^N$ is constrained to be less than $1.0 \times 10^{-18}$ for boson masses $\leq 100$ eV. It is noteworthy that this study represents the first instance in which constraints on $g_V g_V$ have been established through the analysis of the potential term $V_2 + V_3$ for both tritium deuteride and hydrogen deuteride molecules.</description>

      <title>Searching for axion forces with spin precession in atoms and molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.10023v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose to use atoms and molecules as quantum sensors of axion-mediated monopole-dipole forces. We show that electron spin precession experiments using atomic and molecular beams are well-suited for axion searches thanks to the presence of co-magnetometer states and single-shot temporal resolution. Experimental strategies to detect axion gradients from localised sources and the earth are presented, taking ACME III as a prototype example. Other possibilities including atomic beams, and laser-cooled atoms and molecules are discussed.</description>

      <title>Spin-dependent exotic interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15691v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Novel interactions beyond the four known fundamental forces in nature (electromagnetic, gravitational, strong and weak interactions), may arise due to "new physics" beyond the standard model, manifesting as a "fifth force". This review is focused on spin-dependent fifth forces mediated by exotic bosons such as spin-0 axions and axionlike particles and spin-1 Z' bosons, dark photons, or paraphotons. Many of these exotic bosons are candidates to explain the nature of dark matter and dark energy, and their interactions may violate fundamental symmetries. Spin-dependent interactions between fermions mediated by the exchange of exotic bosons have been investigated in a variety of experiments, particularly at the low-energy frontier. Experimental methods and tools used to search for exotic spin-dependent interactions, such as atomic comagnetometers, torsion balances, nitrogen-vacancy spin sensors, and precision atomic and molecular spectroscopy, are described. A complete set of interaction potentials, derived based on quantum field theory with minimal assumptions and characterized in terms of reduced coupling constants, are presented. A comprehensive summary of existing experimental and observational constraints on exotic spin-dependent interactions is given, illustrating the current research landscape and promising directions of further research.</description>
