      <title>Topolectrical circuit theory and realizations of topological, non-linear, and non-Hermitian phenomena</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrical circuits offer a unique platform to explore physical phenomena, from topology to non-Hermitian effects. Investigations of the fundamental properties of this metamaterial platform are crucial to distinguish observed/measured quantities from intrinsic circuit responses. In this thesis, we delve into the analysis of voltage and impedance responses and their role in unveiling complex dynamics and profound physical principles. We reveal that even the simplest one-dimensional circuits exhibit intriguing voltage profiles. Our study of multi-dimensional and multi-structural lattice models shows size-dependent impedance responses, which challenge our current textbook knowledge. Building on these insights, we will present non-linear and non-Hermitian circuit applications, showcasing how electrical circuits provide a suitable platform for realizing intriguing physical phenomena.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Interfacial Quantum Dipoles in Charge Transfer Heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hysteretic gate responses of two-dimensional material heterostructures serve as sensitive probes of the underlying electronic states and hold significant promise for the development of novel nanoelectronic devices. Here we identify a new mechanism of hysteretic behavior in graphene/$h$BN/$\alpha$-$\mathrm{RuCl_3}$ charge transfer field effect devices. The hysteresis loop exhibits a sharp onset under low temperatures and evolves symmetrically relative to the charge transfer equilibrium. Unlike conventional flash memory devices, the charge transfer heterostructure features a transparent tunneling barrier and its hysteretic gate response is induced by the dynamic tuning of interfacial dipoles originating from quantum exchange interactions. The system acts effectively as a ferroelectric and gives rise to remarkable tunability of the hysteretic gate response under external electrical bias. Our work unveils a novel mechanism for engineering hysteretic behaviors via dynamic interfacial quantum dipoles.</description>

      <title>Opto- and magneto-tunable exceptional degeneracies in non-Hermitian ferromagnet/$p$-wave magnet junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unconventional $p$-wave magnets (UPMs) with odd-parity spin textures have attracted interest for their zero net magnetization and anisotropic spin-split Fermi surfaces. Here, we explore a non-Hermitian open quantum system composed of a ferromagnet and a UPM, subjected to an external magnetic field and off-resonant circularly polarized light (CPL), serving as tunable control parameters. We demonstrate the emergence of exceptional points (EPs) in the proposed junction, whose locations can be modulated by the intrinsic properties of the UPM. These EPs exhibit different multiplicities and formation conditions compared to those in even-parity magnets (dubbed $d$- wave altermagnets), a distinction attributable to the preserved time-reversal and broken inversion symmetries characteristic of UPMs. We find that both the unidirectional magnetic field (with adjustable strength and orientation) and the CPL induce momentum-direction-dependent modifications to the EPs, such as their shifting, tilting, merging, or annihilation, supported by analyses of spin projection and eigenvector overlap. Although both perturbations influence the EP structure, they operate via distinct mechanisms: CPL induces a global Floquet re-normalization, enabling dynamic tunability through light, whereas the unidirectional magnetic field selectively alters orientation-aligned terms, lacking such tunability. Beyond revealing EP dynamics in UPM-based junctions, our results highlight UPMs as promising platforms for non-Hermitian phenomena in future spintronics.</description>

      <title>Metallophilicity Enhances Electron Transport through Parallel Organometallic 1D Chain Junctions Formed In Situ</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We reveal the role of aurophilic interactions in the formation and conductance of gold cyanide molecular wires of variable length-to-width ratios assembled at the tip of an STM break junction in ambient conditions. Specifically, we identify electron transport signatures through 1D single chains containing variable number of monomeric repeats of gold cyanide AuCN, linked in series (AuCN)n, and through adjacent molecular wires linked in parallel. When bound in series, destructive quantum interference causes an exponential decay of conductance in (AuCN)n 1D wires for n=1-3. But when bound in parallel, aurophilic coupling through the gold atoms of neighboring chains reorders electronic states and results in significant enhancement of conductance. Our work reveals that metallophilicity can play a significant role in junction assembly and electron transport characteristics.</description>

      <title>Unconventional Altermagnetism in Quasicrystals: A Hyperspatial Projective Construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnetism, a novel magnetic phase characterized by symmetry-protected, momentum-dependent spin splitting and collinear compensated magnetic moments, has thus far been explored primarily in periodic crystals. In this Letter, we extend the concept of altermagnetism to quasicrystals -- aperiodic systems with long-range order and noncrystallographic rotational symmetries. Using a hyperspatial projection framework, we construct decorated Ammann-Beenker and Penrose quasicrystalline lattices with inequivalent sublattices and investigate a Hubbard model with anisotropic hopping. We demonstrate that interaction-induced N\'eel order on such lattices gives rise to alternating spin-polarized spectral functions that reflect the underlying quasicrystalline symmetry, revealing the emergence of unconventional $g$-wave (octagonal) and $h$-wave (decagonal) altermagnetism. Our symmetry analysis and low-energy effective theory further reveal unconventional altermagnetic spin splitting, which is compatible with quasicrystalline rotational symmetry. Our work shows that quasicrystals provide a fertile ground for realizing unconventional altermagnetic phases beyond crystallographic constraints, offering a platform for novel magnetisms and transport phenomena unique to quasiperiodic systems.</description>

      <title>Using surface plasmons to detect spin inertia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent experiments demonstrate that spin dynamics may acquire an inertial effect in a few metallic magnets, deviating from the traditional inertia-free dynamics. It remains an open question to ascertain the physical mechanisms and universality of the spin inertia across diverse magnetic systems. Here, we show that spin inertia generates nutation spin waves in the terahertz regime, which can hybridize with the surface plasmons in two-dimensional (2D) conducting materials such as graphene. By exciting hybrid spin wave-plasmon modes and analyzing the reflection spectrum of a 2D material$|$magnet heterostructure, we propose a method to quantitatively determine the strength of spin inertia in magnetic layers. Our approach is universally applicable to all types of magnetic insulators and could advance the future exploration of the magnitude and physical mechanism of spin inertia.</description>

      <title>The birefringent spin-laser as a system of coupled harmonic oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adding spin-polarized carriers to semiconductor lasers strongly changes their properties and, through the transfer of angular momentum, leads to the emission of the circularly polarized light. In such spin-lasers the polarization of the emitted light can be modulated an order of magnitude faster than its intensity in the best conventional lasers. This ultrafast operation in spin-lasers relies on the large linear birefringence, usually viewed as detrimental in spin and conventional lasers, which couples the two linearly-polarized emission modes. We show that the dynamical properties of birefringent spin-lasers under intensity and polarization modulation are accurately described as coupled harmonic oscillators. Our model agrees with the intensity-equation description which, unlike the common complex field components describing the role of birefringence in laser dynamics, uses simpler real quantities and allows analytical solutions. We further predict unexplored operation regimes and elucidate the difference between the weak and strong coupling in spin-lasers.</description>

      <title>Orbital Inverse Faraday and Cotton-Mouton Effects in Hall Fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report two light-induced orbital magnetization effects in quantum Hall (QH) fluids, stemming from their transverse response. The first is a purely transverse contribution to the inverse Faraday effect (IFE), where circularly polarized light induces a DC magnetization by stirring the charged fluid. This contribution dominates the IFE in the QH regime. The second is the orbital inverse Cotton-Mouton effect (ICME), in which linearly polarized light generates a DC magnetization. Since the applied field in the ICME does not break time-reversal symmetry, the induced magnetization directly probes the chiral orbital response of the fluid at the driving frequency. We estimate that the resulting magnetization lies in the range of 0.5-10 Bohr magnetons per charge carrier in materials such as graphene and transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) in the QH regime. Finally, we show that the induced magnetization is accompanied by a local correction to the static particle density, enabling optical quantum printing of density profiles into the QH fluid.</description>

      <title>Topological phases and spontaneous symmetry breaking: the revenge of the original Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the interplay of spontaneous symmetry breaking and topological properties in interacting one-dimensional models. We solve these models using bozonization and identify topologically non-trivial phases by counting the additional degeneracy (affiliated with the edge modes) of a finite-size system relative to the infinite one. We find even if the mean-field solution is topological, this may not be true when it arises from spontaneous symmetry breaking, including in the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model. This implies that the original SSH model, as presented by Su, Schrieffer, and Heeger, is topologically trivial, as opposed to its mean-field version. A spinful version, on the other hand, does exhibit a topologically non-trivial phase. In that state, both mean-field solutions are topologically non-trivial and correspond to non-interacting SSH chains in the opposite phases with the winding number $\nu=1$. We show that this phase is protected by a chiral symmetry, similar to the non-interacting phases.</description>

      <title>Significant Mobility Enhancement in Coupled AlGaN/GaN Quantum Wells considering Inter-Well Distance and Asymmetric Widths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that coupled AlGaN/GaN quantum wells with asymmetric widths ($L_1-L_2&lt;30 $ A achieve up to 4.5 times higher mobility than single wells at optimal separation (d = 100 A). Crucially, mobility surpasses single wells when d&gt;40 A reversing the trend at smaller distances. This enhancement stems from double-layer screening that suppresses remote/background impurities and dislocations, while LO phonon scattering remains unaffected. For identical wells, coupled systems underperform single wells at d&lt;40 A but exceed them beyond this threshold. Peak gains occur at cryogenic temperatures (77 K). Our results provide a robust theoretical framework to optimize mobility in AlGaN/GaN heterostructures, reducing experimental trial-and-error in quantum device engineering.</description>

      <title>A Clarification on Quantum-Metric-Induced Nonlinear Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the years, Berry curvature, which is associated with the imaginary part of the quantum geometric tensor, has profoundly impacted many branches of physics. Recently, quantum metric, the real part of the quantum geometric tensor, has been recognized as indispensable in comprehensively characterizing the intrinsic properties of condensed matter systems. The intrinsic second-order nonlinear conductivity induced by the quantum metric has attracted significant recent interest. However, its expression varies across the literature. Here, we reconcile this discrepancy by systematically examining the nonlinear conductivity using the standard perturbation theory, the wave packet dynamics, and the Luttinger-Kohn approach. Moreover, inspired by the Dirac model, we propose a toy model that suppresses the Berry-curvature-induced nonlinear transport, making it suitable for studying the quantum-metric-induced nonlinear conductivity. Our theory can be further extended to include disorder effects and higher-order quantum geometric contributions, paving the way for a more comprehensive and systematic understanding of nonlinear transport.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-adapted models for multifold fermions with spin-orbit coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multifold fermions, quasiparticles with multiple degeneracy protected by crystalline symmetries, exhibit a variety of intriguing phenomena stemming from their large topological charges and unique band structures. A comprehensive understanding of their response to external stimuli remains challenging, especially for types protected by nonsymmorphic symmetries where various degrees of freedom are intricately coupled. Here, we systematically construct effective models for multifold fermions that incorporate external fields based on crystalline symmetry. Specifically, we develop a $\boldsymbol{k} \cdot \boldsymbol{p}$ model for the threefold fermion protected by space group I2$_1$3 (No.~199) in the presence of spin--orbit coupling, and derive the terms for external fields. By complementing this with a tight-binding model, we investigate the magnetic field response and reveal the pair annihilation of magnetic monopoles. Furthermore, we construct a $\boldsymbol{k} \cdot \boldsymbol{p}$ model for the eightfold fermion in space group P$\bar{4}3n1'$ (No.~218), including its coupling to external fields. This work provides a robust theoretical foundation for advancing the study of external field responses and transport phenomena in multifold fermions, opening new avenues to explore their rich physics.</description>

      <title>Inertial Imaging of Dual Mass Distributions on a Graphene Nanodrum: A Computational Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the possibility for inertial imaging of spatially patterned annular mass distributions of a circular graphene nanodrum resonator. By placing two distinct analytes in concentric annular regions, we harness the vibrational mode-specific sensitivities of the nanodrum to estimate their respective mass densities. An analytical formulation based on the Rayleigh-Ritz principle is developed to relate radial mass loading to modal frequency shifts. Finite element simulations are performed in COMSOL Multiphysics to obtain the shifts in the resonance frequency of vibrational modes under varying geometrical configurations of annular rings. By processing these frequency shifts through a transformation matrix, we estimate the concomitant mass distributions of annular rings. The results indicate that the estimation errors are lower for analytes placed near the antinodal regions of the dominant vibration mode, with the lowest error being 1.82 % for analyte A and 2.03 % for analyte B. Furthermore, thinner annular rings demonstrate enhanced detection accuracy due to reduced modal overlap. This study demonstrates an analytical strategy for mass detection using a graphene nanodrum by providing insights into optimal analyte placement and structural design for high-precision multi-target mass sensing applications.</description>

      <title>Efforts in Modeling the Mechanics and Chemistry of Energetic Materials Across Scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent developments dedicated to the building of multiscale mechanical and chemical constitutive laws for energetic molecular crystals are presented and discussed. In particular, various tools have been specifically incorporated in molecular dynamics codes to facilitate the subsequent information transfer to the continuum, i.e. finite elements simulation codes. Atomistic simulations have been augmented with the capability to follow specific deformation paths as well as local Lagrangian mechanical metrics, enabling the computation of materials flow stress surface. This mechanistic library allowed the construction of a comprehensive non-linear hyperelastic continuum model including crystal plasticity and twinning for TATB. Besides, recent advances in analyzing reactive molecular dynamics simulations with unsupervised learning algorithms has enabled the identification and calibration of chemical decomposition kinetics for RDX and TATB single crystal. In the present work, the procedure is applied to $\beta$-HMX and extended with the calibration of a multi-components equation of state. These two ingredients are implemented in a finite-element code in order to model the shock-to-detonation transition at the mesoscale level and to study dimensionality effects in quasi-static hotspots. Finally, these dedicated efforts towards a comprehensive multiscale modeling of explosives has also given rise to the need for new prospective experiments, discussed throughout the paper.</description>

      <title>Breaking Peierls theorem in polyacetylene chains via topological design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Peierls theorem postulates that a one-dimensional (1D) metallic chain must undergo a metal-to-insulator transition via lattice distortion, resulting in bond length alternation (BLA) within the chain. The validity of this theorem has been repeatedly proven in practice, as evidenced by the absence of a metallic phase in low-dimensional atomic lattices and electronic crystals, including conjugated polymers, artificial 1D quantum nanowires, and anisotropic inorganic crystals. Overcoming this transition enables realizing long-sought organic quantum phases of matter, including 1D synthetic organic metals and even high-temperature organic superconductors. Herein, we demonstrate that the Peierls transition can be globally suppressed by employing lattice topology engineering of classic trans-polyacetylene chains connected to open-shell nanographene terminals. The appropriate topology connection enables an effective interplay between the zero-energy modes (ZMs) of terminal and the finite odd-membered polyacetylene (OPA) chains. This creates a critical topology-defined highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) that compensates for bond density variations, thereby suppressing BLA and reestablishing their quasi-1D metallic character. Moreover, it also causes the formation of an unconventional boundary-free resonance state, being delocalized over the entire chain with non-decaying spectral weight, distinguishing them from traditional solitons observed in polyacetylene. Our finding sets the stage for pioneering the suppression of material instability and the creation of synthetic organic quantum materials with unconventional quantum phases previously prohibited by the Peierls transition.</description>

      <title>Detecting entanglement with transport measurement in weakly interacting and fluctuating systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measuring entanglement entropy in interacting, multipartite systems remains a significant experimental challenge. We address this challenge by developing a protocol to measure von Neumann entropy (VNE) and mutual information in quantum transport systems with both many-body interactions and multiple subsystems. Our analysis indicates that the vital connection between VNE and two-point correlation functions persists under these realistic conditions. The measurement is shown to be feasible for systems with boundary interactions and, critically, for bulk-interacting systems subject to a quantum quench of their internal couplings. Our work provides a pathway to experimentally quantify entanglement in complex interacting systems and establishes mutual information as an experimentally accessible indicator for system-environment entanglement.</description>

      <title>Classical-to-Quantum Crossover in 2D TMD Field-Effect Transistors: A First-Principles Study via Sub-10 nm Channel Scaling Beyond the Boltzmann Tyranny</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides present compelling prospects for next-generation low-power and high-frequency field-effect transistors. However, scaling 2D TMD FETs into the sub-10 nm regime remains challenging due to technical complexity. Moreover, short-channel effects in this length scale are not yet fully understood. In this work, we investigate the transport properties of 2D TMD nanojunctions with channel lengths from 12 down to 3 nm, using first-principles calculations that integrate the nonequilibrium Green function formalism implemented in density functional theory (NEGF-DFT) and an effective gate model. Our simulations reveal a classical-to-quantum crossover in electron transport during transistor downscaling, governed by two critical temperatures: Tc, which marks the crossover from thermionic emission to quantum tunneling, and Tt, beyond which thermionic emission dominates and the subthreshold swing approaches its classical limit. The shortest 3 nm junction exhibits pronounced quantum tunneling up to 500 K and achieves a subthreshold swing superior to the Boltzmann tyranny, enabled by the steep energy dependence of the transmission coefficient. This quantum-tunneling-enhanced switching behavior demonstrates the potential of ultra-scaled 2D FETs to surpass classical efficiency constraints, offering a promising route toward energy-efficient, quantum-enabled computing technologies. This study presents a predictive, atomistic methodology for quantifying quantum transport and identifies the transition in electron transport mechanisms from semiclassical thermionic current in long-channel to quantum tunneling in short-channel 2D TMD FETs, offering critical design insights for leveraging quantum-classical hybrid transistor technology.</description>

      <title>Three-magnon scattering of spin wave on edge-localized mode in thin ferromagnetic film</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Three-wave scattering is a fascinating phenomenon with many applications in various technologies. Reducing the system symmetry greatly affects three-wave scattering, which, in this case, goes beyond the simple momentum conservation law. In this study, we examine three-magnon scattering at the edge of a thin ferromagnetic film, when a bulk spin wave interacts with an edge-localized propagating spin-wave upon the reflection. This creates new bulk spin waves at mixed frequencies by means of three-magnon confluence or stimulated splitting processes. Using our developed analytical theory, which has been confirmed by full micromagnetic simulations, we demonstrate that the amplitude of the wave generated in the stimulated splitting process is several times larger than that generated in the confluence process, primarily due to the lower group velocity. Furthermore, intensity of inelastically scattered waves exhibit a pronounced dependence on the incidence angle and frequency of the edge spin wave that goes beyond existing qualitative models. We show that the observed behaviors can only be explained by taking into account, that the scattered waves are created by several elementary three-magnon processes involving the incident and reflected waves. The complex nature of the scattered wave creation results in a strong sensitivity of its amplitude to the phase accumulation of spin waves upon reflection.</description>

      <title>Theory of nonlinear magnetoelectric transport effects in normal-metal $-$ magnetic-insulator heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heterostructures of normal metals (N) and magnetic insulators (F) show paradigmatic effects, such as spin-Hall magnetoresistance and electric drag currents. These effects are linear in the applied electric field $E(\omega)$. Normal-metal $-$ magnetic-insulator heterostructures also exhibit a characteristic nonlinear response quadratic in $E(\omega)$, referred to as unidirectional spin-Hall magnetoresistance or spin-torque diode effect. In this article, we develop a theory of the bilinear response of FN bilayers and NFN trilayers for finite frequencies $\omega$ of the driving field and for four contributions that have been previously considered in the literature: Joule heating, phonon-mediated unidirectional magnetoresistance, the spin-torque diode effect, and magnonic unidirectional spin-Hall magnetoresistance. We identify their distinct dependencies on frequency and the magnetization direction of the magnetic insulator and examine their scaling with magnetic field and system geometry, providing a framework for experimental differentiation.</description>

      <title>Floquet odd-parity collinear magnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.02542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnets (AMs), recently discovered unconventional magnets distinct from ferro- and antiferromagnets, have rapidly emerged as a prominent frontier in condensed matter physics. AMs are characterized by alternating collinear magnetic moments with zero net magnetization in real space, and spin splittings with even-parity symmetry in momentum space. However, their counterparts exhibiting odd-parity spin splitting remain largely unexplored. Here, based on symmetry argument, we show that such unconventional odd-parity magnets can be induced from collinear antiferromagnets. Remarkably, using effective model analysis within Floquet-theory framework, we demonstrate that circularly polarized light irradiation of conventional antiferromagnetic lattices induces both $p$- and $f$-wave magnets, realizing novel magnetic states dubbed Floquet odd-parity collinear magnets. Moreover, we also uncover light-induced antiferromagnetic Chern insulating states in the $f$-wave magnets. The proposed Floquet odd-parity magnet is confirmed by first-principles calculations of MnPSe$_{3}$ under circularly polarized light. Our work not only proposes a new class of unconventional magnets, but also opens an avenue for light-induced magnetic phenomena in spintronic applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.00999v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interplay of topology and correlations defines a new playground to study boundary criticality in quantum systems. We employ large scale auxiliary field quantum Monte Carlo simulations to study a two-dimensional Kane-Mele-Hubbard model on the honeycomb lattice with zig-zag edges and the Hubbard U-term tuned to the three-dimensional XY bulk critical point. Upon varying the Hubbard-U term on the edge we observe a boundary phase transition from an ordinary phase with a helical Luttinger liquid edge decoupled from the critical bulk to an extraordinary-log phase characterized by a logarithmically diverging spin stiffness. We find that the spectral functions exhibit distinct features in the two phases giving potential experimental signatures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.01033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In conventional exchange-only (EO) spin qubit demonstrations, quantum gates have been implemented using sequences of individually pulsed pairwise exchange interactions with only one exchange coupling active at a time. Alternatively, multiple non-commuting exchange interactions can be pulsed simultaneously, reducing circuit depths and providing protection against leakage. We demonstrate high-fidelity quantum control of an always-on exchange-only (AEON) qubit, operated using simultaneous exchange pulses in a triangular quantum dot (QD) array. We use blind randomized benchmarking to characterize the performance of the full AEON single-qubit Clifford gate set, achieving an average Clifford gate fidelity $F_{\rm C1}$ = 99.86\%. Extensions of this work may enable more efficient EO two-qubit entangling gates as well as the implementation of native $i$-Toffoli gates in Loss-DiVincenzo single-spin qubits.</description>

      <title>Transport in Single Quantum Dots: A Review from Linear Response to Nonlinear Regimes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.01376v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum dots are versatile systems for exploring quantum transport, electron correlations, and many-body phenomena such as the Kondo effect. While equilibrium properties are well understood through methods like the numerical renormalization group and density matrix renormalization group, nonequilibrium transport remains a major theoretical challenge. From the experimental point of view, recent advances in nanofabrication and measurement techniques have enabled the investigation of far-from-equilibrium regimes. These conditions give rise to new transport phenomena, where strong correlations and nonequilibrium dynamics interplay in complex ways; beyond the reach of conventional linear response theory. To meet these challenges, new approaches such as nonequilibrium Green's functions, real-time NRG, and time-dependent DMRG have emerged. This work reviews the established results for quantum dot transport in and beyond the linear regime, highlights recent theoretical and experimental advances, and discusses open problems and future prospects.</description>

      <title>Floquet theory and applications in open quantum and classical systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.01783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article reviews theoretical methods for analyzing Floquet engineering (FE) phenomena in open (dissipative) quantum or classical systems, with an emphasis on our recent results. In many theoretical studies for FE in quantum systems, researchers have used the Floquet theory for closed (isolated) quantum systems, that is based on the Schr\"odinger equation. However, if we consider the FE in materials driven by an oscillating field like a laser, a weak but finite interaction between a target system and an environment (bath) is inevitable. In this article, we describe these periodically driven dissipative systems by means of the quantum master (GKSL) equation. In particular, we show that a nonequilibrium steady state appears after a long driving due to the balance between the energy injection by the driving field and the release to the bath. In addition to quantum systems, if we try to simply apply Floquet theory to periodically driven classical systems, it failed because the equation of motion (EOM) is generally nonlinear, and the Floquet theorem can be applied only to linear differential equations. Instead, by considering the distribution function of the classical variables (i.e., Fokker-Planck equation), one can arrive at the effective EOM for the driven systems. We illustrate the essence of the Floquet theory for classical systems. On top of fundamentals of the Floquet theory, we review representative examples of FEs (Floquet topological insulators, inverse Faraday effects in metals and magnets, Kapitza pendulum, etc.) and dissipation-assisted FEs.</description>

      <title>Mesoscale variations of chemical and electronic landscape on the surface of Weyl semimetal Co$_3$Sn$_2$S$_2$ visualized by ARPES and XPS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01826v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The multiple crystalline terminations in magnetic Weyl semimetal Co$_3$Sn$_2$S$_2$ display distinct topological and trivial surface states, which have successfully been distinguished experimentally. However, a model of pure terminations is known to be inadequate because these surfaces exhibit a high degree of spatial heterogeneity and point disorder. Here we perform a spectromicroscopy study of the surface chemistry and surface electronic structure using photoemission measurements in combination with first-principles calculations of core levels. We identify an intermediate region with properties distinct from both the sulfur and tin terminations, and demonstrate that the spectral features in this region can be associated with a disordered tin termination with a varying density of surface tin-vacancies. Finally, we show how a combination of algorithmic and machine learning analysis of photoemission data can be used to extract identifying features, classify spatial regions, and correlate local chemistry with local electronic structure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.01838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low temperature transport measurements are presented of ferromagnetic MnSb devices with the magnetic properties patterned using a Ga focused ion beam FIB system at 30 keV. FIB patterning introduces disorder and this is quantified in this paper through measurements of the longitudinal resistivity and the anomalous Hall effect contribution to the Hall conductivity. The MnSb structural phase is the niccolite phase with a surface state in addition to bulk states. FIB doses up to 1E16 Ga ions per square cm reduces the anisotropic magnetoresistance signal but increases the size of the anomalous Hall effect signal in out of plane magnetic fields, B. The anomalous Hall effect contribution to the Hall conductivity is e squared divided by h in the undamaged devices, where e is the electronic charge and h is Plancks constant. This quantity is sensitive to the level of disorder induced by the Ga ion beam, reducing to zero at dose levels greater than 1E16 Ga ions per square cm. The resistivity shows a logarithmic B dependence after the magnetization has saturated with the low field anisotropic magnetoresistance contribution of 0.12 percent. The conductivity change is e squared divided by h in the magnetic field range of logarithmic B behavior. The resistivity shows a reduced fit to a logarithmic B dependence at high FIB dose levels and is dependent on the damage uniformity. Patterning nanostructured magnetic behavior in MnSb, with compatibility to altermagnetic materials, in particular the niccolite phase of CrSb and non trivial Berry phase contributions to transport make this ferromagnetic material and patterning technique useful for future spintronic device development.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.02011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For the chiral limit of two sheets of $n$-layer Bernal-stacked graphene established in the Physical Review Letters arXiv:2109.10325 and arXiv:2109.11514, we prove a trichotomy: depending on the twisting angle, we have either (1) generically, the band crossing of the first two bands is of order $n$; or (2) at a discrete set of magic angles, the first two bands are completely flat; or (3) for another discrete set of twisting parameters, the bands exhibit Dirac cones. This new mathematical discovery disproves the common belief in physics that such a twisted multilayer graphene model can only have higher order band crossings or flat bands, and it leads to a new type of topological phase transition.</description>

      <title>The analytically tractable zoo of similarity-induced exceptional structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.02565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exceptional points (EPs) are non-Hermitian spectral degeneracies marking a simultaneous coalescence of eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Despite the fact that multiband $n$-fold EPs (EP$n$s) generically emerge as special points on manifolds of EP$m$s, where $m&lt;n$, EP$n$s as well as their topological properties have hitherto been studied as isolated objects. In this work we address this issue and carefully map out the emerging properties of multifold exceptional structures in three and four dimensions under the influence of one or multiple generalized similarities, revealing diverse combinations of EP$m$s in direct connection to EP$n$s. We find that simply counting the number of constraints defining the EP$n$s is not sufficient in the presence of similarities; the constraints can also be satisfied by the EP$m$-manifolds obeying certain spectral symmetries in the complex eigenvalue plane, reducing their dimension beyond what is expected from counting the number of constraints. Furthermore, the induced spectral symmetries not always allow for any EP$m$-manifold to emerge in $n$-band systems, making the plethora of exceptional structures deviate further from naive expectations. We illustrate our findings in simple periodic toy models. By relying on similarity relations instead of the less general symmetries, we simultaneously cover several physically relevant scenarios, ranging from optics and topolectrical circuits, to open quantum systems. This makes our predictions highly relevant and broadly applicable in modern research, as well as experimentally viable within various branches of physics.</description>

Abstract: The emergence of high transition temperature (Tc) superconductivity in strongly correlated materials remains a major unsolved problem in physics. High-Tc materials, such as cuprates, are generally complex and not easily tunable, making theoretical modelling difficult. Although the Hubbard model--a simple theoretical model of interacting electrons on a lattice--is believed to capture the essential physics of high-Tc materials, obtaining accurate solutions of the model, especially in the relevant regime of moderate correlation, is challenging. The recent demonstration of robust superconductivity in moir\'e WSe2, whose low-energy electronic bands can be described by the Hubbard model and are highly tunable, presents a new platform for tackling the high-Tc problem. Here, we tune moir\'e WSe2 bilayers to the moderate correlation regime through the twist angle and map the phase diagram around one hole per moir\'e unit cell (v = 1) by electrostatic gating and electrical transport and magneto-optical measurements. We observe a range of high-Tc phenomenology, including an antiferromagnetic insulator at v = 1, superconducting domes upon electron and hole doping, and unusual metallic states at elevated temperatures including strange metallicity. The highest Tc occurs adjacent to the Mott transition, reaching about 6% of the effective Fermi temperature. Our results establish a new material system based on transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) moir\'e superlattices that can be used to study high-Tc superconductivity in a highly controllable manner and beyond.</description>

      <title>Proper Definition of Intrinsic Nonlinear Current</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11180v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the three commonly employed approaches that define the same dc (or low-frequency) intrinsic linear anomalous Hall response actually lead to different results for intrinsic nonlinear transport. The difference is due to an intrinsic anomalous distribution (IAD). It originates from a nonlinear field effect during scattering, but its value is completely independent of scattering, because it represents the local equilibration of electron wave packets with field corrected energy. The proper definition of intrinsic current that is detectable in experiment must incorporate the effect of IAD. We also show that IAD is indispensable for consistency with fundamental physical relations. In addition, we predict that under ac driving, the intrinsic reponses in rectified and double-frequency channels exhibit distinct frequency dependence, for which we estimate the signals that can be probed in antiferromagnetic CuMnAs.</description>

Abstract: Thermal radiation features of dynamical axion insulators, which are characterized by an antiferromagnetic order with simultaneously broken time-reversal and space-inversion symmetries, are investigated. Planck's radiation law is shown to exhibit remarkable anisotropic behavior as a result of the strong dispersion caused by the light-matter interaction. A crossover scenario at low temperature is identified and an associated phase highly populated by slow thermal photons is revealed. We show that the asymmetry degree of the heat radiation and its angular distribution can be controlled via a magnetic field, paving the way toward a directional-tunable mechanism for thermal quantum manipulation and storage. Analogies are drawn with the expected behavior of blackbody radiation in the core of neutron stars.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13099v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electron-magnon coupling at the interface between a normal metal and a magnetically ordered insulator modifies the electrical conductivity of the normal metal, an effect known as spin-Hall magnetoresistance. It can also facilitate magnon-mediated current drag, the nonlocal electric current response of two normal metal layers separated by a magnetic insulator. Additionally, spin and heat transport are coupled both in the magnetic insulator and across the interfaces to normal metals. In this article, we present a theory of these spintronic and spin-caloritronic effects for time-dependent applied electric fields $E(\omega)$, with driving frequencies $\omega$ up to the THz regime. Our model describes how the dominant transport mechanism, coherent or incoherent magnons, evolves with the driving frequency $\omega$.</description>

Abstract: The combination of a strong pump and a weak probe has been widely applied to investigate both optical and nanomechanical devices. Such pump-probe measurements allows for the exploration of nonlinear dynamics, driven by the large pump tone, by measuring the system response to a probe tone. In contrast, here we report on the dynamics of a mechanical Duffing resonator driven with a combination of two large tones at different frequencies. Our results indicate the presence of various distinct regimes with very different dynamics. We systematically investigate the impact of the relative strength and detuning between the two drives on the dynamical response. This provides an illustrative example of dynamical phase transitions in out-of-equilibrium systems.</description>

      <title>Anomalous and Topological Hall Effects with Phase-Space Berry Curvatures: Electric, Thermal, and Thermoelectric Transport in Magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04376v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a theory for the electrical and thermal transverse linear response functions such as the Hall, Nernst and thermal Hall effects in magnetic materials that harbor topological spin textures like skyrmions. In addition to the ordinary transverse response that arises from the Lorentz force due to the external magnetic field, there is an anomalous and a topological response. The intrinsic anomalous response derives from the momentum space Berry curvature arising from the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in a system with a nonzero magnetization, while the topological response arises from real space Berry curvature related to the the topological charge density of the spin texture. To take into account all these effects on an equal footing, we develop a semiclassical theory that incorporates all phase-space Berry curvatures. We show within a controlled, semiclassical approach that all conductivities -- electrical, thermoelectric, and thermal Hall -- can be written as the sum of three contributions: ordinary, anomalous and topological, when the conduction electron SOC is weaker than the exchange coupling to the spin texture. All other contributions, including those arising from mixed real-momentum space Berry curvature, are negligible in the regime where our calculations are controlled. We derive various general relations that remain valid at low temperatures including the Weidemann-Franz relation between the electrical and thermal conductivities and the Mott relation between the thermoelectric and electrical conductivities. We also discuss how an in-plane Hall response arises in three-dimensional materials with sufficiently low symmetry. Finally, the Hall response is qualitatively different when the conduction electron SOC is stronger than the exchange coupling to the spin texture, where we find that the anomalous term dominates and the topological term vanishes.</description>

      <title>Berry Phase Dynamics of Sliding Electron Crystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03399v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Systems such as Wigner crystals and incommensurate charge density waves that spontaneously break a continuous translation symmetry have unusual transport properties arising from their ability to slide coherently in space. Recent experimental and theoretical studies suggest that spontaneous translation symmetry breaking in some two-dimensional materials with nontrivial quantum geometry (e.g., rhombohedral pentalayer graphene) leads to a topologically nontrivial electron crystal state called the anomalous Hall crystal and characterized by a vanishing linear-response dc longitudinal conductivity and a non-vanishing Hall conductivity. In this work we present a theoretical investigation of the sliding dynamics of this new type of electron crystal, taking into account the system's nontrivial quantum geometry. We find that when accelerated by an external electric field, the crystal acquires a transverse anomalous velocity that stems from not only the Berry curvature of the parent band but also the Galilean non-invariance of the crystal state (i.e., crystal states with different momenta are not related by simple momentum boosts). We further show that acceleration of the crystal modifies its internal current from the static crystal value that is determined by the Chern number of the crystal state. The net Hall conductance including contributions from center-of-mass motion and internal current is in general not quantized. As an experimentally relevant example, we present numerical results in rhombohedral pentalayer graphene and discuss possible experimental implications.</description>

      <title>Fermi Velocity Dependent Critical Current in Ballistic Bilayer Graphene Josephson Junctions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10640v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform transport measurements on proximitized, ballistic, bilayer graphene Josephson junctions (BGJJs) in the intermediate-to-long junction regime ($L&gt;\xi$). We measure the device's differential resistance as a function of bias current and gate voltage for a range of different temperatures. The extracted critical current $I_{C}$ follows an exponential trend with temperature: $ \exp(-k_{B} T/ \delta E)$. Here $\delta E = \hbar \nu_F /2\pi L $: an expected trend for intermediate-to-long junctions. From $\delta E$, we determine the Fermi velocity of the bilayer graphene, which is found to increase with gate voltage. Simultaneously, we show the carrier density dependence of $\delta E$, which is attributed to the quadratic dispersion of bilayer graphene. This is in contrast to single layer graphene Josephson junctions, where $\delta E$ and the Fermi velocity are independent of the carrier density. The carrier density dependence in BGJJs allows for additional tuning parameters in graphene-based Josephson Junction devices.</description>

      <title>Tunable Coupling, Topology, and Chirality by Antimagnons in Magnetic Multilayer</title>

Abstract: Realizing novel topological states in magnonic systems unlocks robust, low-power spin-wave devices. In this letter, we show that incorporating left-handed spin waves (antimagnons) fundamentally reorganizes band topology, and enables tunable spin-wave coupling and chirality. We proposed a two-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger like model, the 2D-SSH4 chain, where dipolar interactions between magnons and antimagnons generate topological bands with nonzero Chern numbers. This framework explains the origin of topological surface states in ferromagnetic multilayer and shows they share the same topological origin as classic magnetostatic surface spin waves. Our model also offers a straightforward framework for designing more complex magnetic multilayer connected by dipolar interactions, such as antiferromagnetic/ferromagnetic multilayer. In these dipolar-coupled multilayers, both coherent and dissipative interlayer spin-wave couplings together with the layer resolved chirality, are tunable via external magnetic fields and spin torques. Our results provide a practical platform for topological magnonics, enabling control of magnon chirality and coupling in future devices.</description>

Abstract: The narrow bandgap of semiconductors allows for thick, uniform Josephson junction barriers, potentially enabling reproducible, stable, and compact superconducting qubits. We study vertically stacked van der Waals Josephson junctions with semiconducting weak links, whose crystalline structures and clean interfaces offer a promising platform for quantum devices. We observe robust Josephson coupling across 2--12 nm (3--18 atomic layers) of semiconducting WSe$_2$ and, notably, a crossover from proximity- to tunneling-type behavior with increasing weak link thickness. Building on these results, we fabricate a prototype all-crystalline merged-element transmon qubit with transmon frequency and anharmonicity closely matching design parameters. We demonstrate dispersive coupling between this transmon and a microwave resonator, highlighting the potential of crystalline superconductor-semiconductor structures for compact, tailored superconducting quantum devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05544v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The semiclassical Boltzmann equation is widely used to study transport effects. However, being semiclassical and borrowing heavily from classical mechanics, the formalism calls for verification from the perspective of quantum mechanics. Although previous works discussed the relation between the quantum density matrix and the semiclassical formalism, direct comparison, especially of disorder effects, including side jumps and skew scattering in the two approaches, has not been fully conducted. In this work, we systematically and directly compare the semiclassical Boltzmann equation and its counterpart arising from the density matrix. We find that there is an additional correction to the side-jump velocity, the longitudinal velocity, which is longitudinal in the leading order, and its resultant current does not require time-reversal symmetry breaking. Moreover, we find the semiclassical side-jump collision integral is an approximation of the quantum result at moderate temperatures, and it also contains a correction induced by the longitudinal velocity. We also show that the scattering rate obtained from the density matrix agrees with the semiclassical results. Our work illuminates the quantum roots of the semiclassical Boltzmann equation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18850v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a quantum phase transition (QPT) in quantum point contacts by analyzing the gate-voltage-dependent quasiparticle energy at the Fermi level at zero temperature. This energy is computed using the local density of states at the site of the localized spin, which is extracted from the replicated gate-voltage-dependent differential conductance shaped by entangled-state tunneling. The QPT occurs between symmetric ($G \geq 0.7 G_0$) and asymmetric ($G &lt; 0.7 G_0$) Kondo coupling states, where $G_0 = 2e^2/h$, and is driven by the migration of a localized spin in response to the side-gate voltage. The asymmetric state exhibits two distinct Kondo temperatures, while the symmetric state has only one. The existence of two Kondo temperatures in the $G &lt; 0.7 G_0$ regime accounts for both the anomalous gate-voltage dependence of the zero-bias anomaly width and the inability to define a Kondo temperature in the $G &lt; 0.7 G_0$ region.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21209v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the topological properties of Rashba spin-orbit coupling and exchange coupling induced pseudospin-$1$ system Dice lattice under the influence of a staggered electric potential and magnetization. The band structure and topological phases of the system are investigated and compared with the pseudospin-$\frac{1}{2}$ system honeycomb lattice. Under individual influence of the staggered electric field and magnetization, the system undergoes a distinct phase transition: (i) a staggered electric potential drives the system from a quantum anomalous Hall $(C_n = 2)$ to a valley polarized quantum anomalous Hall phase $(C_n = -1)$ associated with edge modes with a flip in the chirality; while (ii) a staggered magnetization changes the system to a topological metal associated with unconventional antichiral edge bands, from a topological insulator. These results are further supported by calculations of the Chern phase diagrams, Hall conductance, zigzag, and armchair edge states. Our findings enhance the understanding of new topological phases in the 2D pseudospin-$1$ system and open up a new platform to explore the anti-chiral edge states.</description>

Abstract: In multilayer structures, the coupling between layers gives rise to unique plasmon modes, but analytic solutions are typically available only for bilayers due to the increasing complexity as the number of layers increases. We investigate plasmons in multilayer structures, including the effects of interlayer tunneling. By introducing the Coulomb eigenvector basis for multilayer systems, which can be solved exactly using Kac-Murdock-Szeg\H{o} Toeplitz matrices, we analytically derive the long-wavelength plasmon dispersions both with and without interlayer tunneling. In the $N$-layer systems, we find that, in the absence of interlayer tunneling, the out-of-phase acoustic or charge neutral plasmon modes with linear dispersions ($\omega_\alpha\propto q/\sqrt{{1-\cos{\left(\frac{\alpha-1}{N}\pi\right)}}}$ for $\alpha = 2, 3, \cdots, N$) exist, while the in-phase classical plasmon mode exhibits its conventional dispersion ($\omega_1\propto \sqrt{q}$). When interlayer tunneling is present, the out-of-phase modes develop plasmon gaps that are governed by specific interband transitions, whereas the classical mode remains unaffected. These findings have broad applicability to general coupled-layer structures.</description>

Abstract: We analyze two simple model planar molecules: an ionic molecule with D3 symmetry and a covalent molecule with D6 symmetry. Both symmetries allow the existence of chiral molecular orbitals and normal modes that are coupled to each other in a Jahn-Teller manner, invariant under U (1) symmetry with generator a pseudo angular momentum. In the ionic molecule, the chiral mode possesses an electric dipole but lacks physical angular momentum, whereas, in the covalent molecule, the situation is reversed. In spite of that, we show that in both cases the chiral modes can be excited by a circularly polarized light and are subsequently able to induce rotational motion of the entire molecule.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20958v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnons represent quantised collective motions of long-range ordered spins. For wavelength below 100 nm, exchange interactions dominate their physics, which gives rise to a so far unexplored regime of nonlinearities and couplings between magnons and other quasiparticles. Besides their selective excitation, also the detection of such short-wavelength spin waves remains a challenge of current research and technology. Here, we probe the intensity and wave vector of magnons by means of quasi-elastic, resonant soft-X-ray scattering. This Magnon Momentum Microscopy (MMM) can access magnons directly in momentum space with remarkable sensitivity and high photon efficiency up to THz frequencies and down to few-nanometre wavelengths. The two-dimensional information obtained by this light-scattering-based technique is especially valuable for studying the nonlinear interactions of exchange-dominated magnons within technologically relevant thin-film samples. In doing so, we uncover a rich variety of deeply nonlinear magnon interactions, highlighting their potential for applications in novel computing schemes. With its intrinsic element-selectivity and ability to probe also buried layers, soft-X-ray MMM has the potential to establish itself as an advanced tool for ultrabroadband studies of short-wavelength magnonics.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic layer polarization and multi-flatband transport in non-centrosymmetric mixed-stacked multilayer graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.12478v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graphene multilayers exhibit electronic spectra that depend sensitively on both the number of layers and their stacking order. Beyond trilayer graphene, mixed stacking sequences (alternating Bernal and rhombohedral layers) give rise to multiple coexisting low-energy bands. Here we investigate ABCBC-stacked pentalayer graphene, a less-studied non-centrosymmetric mixed sequence. This stacking can be regarded as an ABC (rhombohedral) trilayer on top of an AB (Bernal) bilayer, so its low-energy band structure contains both a cubic band and a parabolic band that hybridize. In transport measurements, we observe an intrinsic band gap at charge neutrality whose magnitude changes asymmetrically under an applied perpendicular displacement field. This behavior reflects the spontaneous layer polarization inherent to the broken inversion symmetry and mirror symmetry. By tuning the displacement field and carrier density, we drive multiple Lifshitz transitions in the Fermi surface topology and realize Landau levels with different degeneracies arising from the multi-flatband system. Remarkably, a v = -6 quantum Hall state emerges at an exceptionally low magnetic field (~20 mT), indicating the interplay between spontaneous symmetry breaking and Berry curvatures. Our results establish mixed-stacked multilayer graphene as a tunable platform with various broken symmetries and multiple flatbands, suitable for exploring emergent correlated electronic states.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic Uncertainty Relation in Hybrid Normal-Superconducting Systems: The Role of superconducting coherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02904v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the violation of thermodynamic uncertainty relations (TURs) in hybrid superconducting/normal metal leads coupled to a central region containing localized levels. We find violations of the TUR, also in its formulation recently derived for coherent conductors [Phys. Rev. Lett. 135, 046302 (2025)], due to the presence of macroscopic quantum coherence related to the superconducting condensate. To support our conclusion, we introduce a dephasing probe, demonstrating that the violation is directly correlated with the superconducting coherence, as measured by the pair amplitude in the central region. When the central region is a Cooper-pair splitter, crossed Andreev processes introduce nonlocal superconducting correlations that further enhance the violation. Finally, we derived a new inequality, fulfilled in hybrid superconducting - normal metal systems, in the limit in which quasi-particle tunneling can be ignored.</description>

      <title>Strain-Controlled Topological Phase Transitions and Chern Number Reversal in Two-Dimensional Altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22474v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a theoretical and first-principles study of a two-dimensional altermagnet exhibiting spin-valley locking and strain-tunable topological phases. By constructing a minimal tight-binding model constrained by altermagnetic symmetry, we show that biaxial strain can drive a transition from a trivial insulator to a type-II quantum spin Hall (QSH) phase. Furthermore, we derive an analytical strain-induced perturbation theory that identifies two critical curves, dividing the phase space into four regions corresponding to a trivial insulator, a type-II QSH phase, and two quantum anomalous Hall phases with opposite Chern numbers. Remarkably, the Chern number can be reversed purely by changing the strain direction --without modifying magnetization or applying magnetic fields. The model reveals a universal phase diagram for materials with the same symmetry and valley structure. First-principles calculations on monolayer CrO confirm the predicted topological transitions, establishing strain engineering as an effective route for topological control in two-dimensional altermagnetic materials.</description>

      <title>Lattice tuning of charge and spin transport in $\beta_{12}$-borophene nanoribbons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22571v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: $\beta_{12}$-borophene nanoribbons (BNRs) exhibit magnetic zigzag edges, while other edge configurations are nonmagnetic. However, when the source, central, and drain regions of a logic device are all composed of zigzag BNRs (ZBNRs), the resulting spin polarization remains weak, unless a high voltage is applied. In this work, we demonstrate that lattice vibrations-introduced for example, via a thermal bath coupled to the central BNR-can enhance spin polarization in ZBNRs. This enhancement manifests as marked changes in the current-voltage characteristics, enabling direct experimental probing. In contrast, nonmagnetic edge configurations exhibit phonon-enhanced charge transport. We employ a tight-binding approach augmented with local electron-phonon interactions described by the Holstein model, and compute the phonon-renormalized Green's functions and transport currents using the Landauer-B\"{u}ttiker formalism. The mechanism is supported by analyzing both spinless and spinful electronic dispersions and the corresponding density of states. Compared to the phonon-free edges, structural distortions lead to anisotropic electron-phonon couplings, which significantly modify both charge and spin transport. These results position phonon as an effective tuning parameter for optimizing borophene-based logic devices via engineered edge configurations.</description>

      <title>Discovery of Itinerant Magnetic Domain Wall and Quasiparticle Boundary State in Spin-Density-Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15999v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conventional magnetic domain walls are characterized by reorientation of local spins. However, what occurs at the boundary of itinerant magnets is largely unknown. Here using spin-sensitive scanning tunneling microscopy, we investigated the microscopic domain wall structure of the spin-density-wave (SDW) state in a prototypical itinerant antiferromagnet - chromium (Cr). At the boundary of two incommensurate SDW domains, we found the spins undergo finite-scale decay rather than reorientation. This generates a double-Q SDW state, which is further evidenced by an accompanying second-order charge modulation. In the commensurate SDW domains, a clear SDW energy gap is observed. Interestingly, the screw dislocations induced half vortex and anti-vortex of SDW, paired by antiphase domain wall. The spin density vanished at such antiphase domain walls. Remarkably, for the first time we observed the SDW quasiparticle states at the boundary, resembling the Andreev bound states in superconductors. These unique SDW boundary structures can be viewed as consequences of local interference of two SDWs, either with different Q or reversed phases. Our findings thus reveal a new type of domain wall distinct to that of local moment magnetism, with a mechanism rooted in the itinerant nature of SDW.</description>

      <title>Topology in the Random Scattering of Light</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13277v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Light scattering in random media is usually considered within the framework of the three-dimensional Anderson universality class, with modifications for the vector nature of electromagnetic waves. We propose that the linear dispersiveness of light introduces topological aspects into the picture. The dynamics of electromagnetic waves follow the same differential equations as those of a spin-$1$ Weyl semimetal. In the presence of disorder, this equivalence leads to a range of phenomena explored in this paper. These include topological protection against localization when helicity hybridization is weak, the emergence of exotic phases in weakly scattering media, and anomalies in optical transparency in the presence of synthetic `magnetic fields'. We argue that some of these effects should be visible and investigated already in weakly disordered optical materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07628v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Aging in a single crystal spin glass ($\mathrm{Cu}_{0.92}\mathrm{Mn}_{0.08}$) has been measured using ac susceptibility techniques over a temperature range of $0.3 - 0.8 \, T_g$. In these studies, traditional aging experiments (or ``quench'' aging protocols) are compared to aging curves constructed from finite-cooling-rate curves. By comparing the growth rates of spin glass order between the two types of aging curves, it is determined that quantitative comparisons between protocols which are taken by quenching and protocols using a finite cooling rate are not possible without a deeper understanding of the interplay between aging and rejuvenation. We then demonstrate that the data presented indicate that rejuvenation, rather than cumulative aging, is the cause for the discrepancies between the two growth rates.</description>

      <title>Flat bands on spherical surface: from Landau levels to giant-quantum-number orbitals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06922v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Flat bands result in a divergent density of states and high sensitivity to interactions in physical systems. While such bands are well known in systems under magnetic fields, their realization and behavior in zero-field settings remain largely unexplored. Here we compare the behavior of electrons confined to a single flat band on the surface of a sphere to those in flat bands under a magnetic field. The zero-field flat band exhibits an additional C(2) symmetry, which causes electrons to symmetrically cluster on opposite sides of the sphere's center when a trapping potential is introduced, resulting in a unique form of long-range "entanglement". To explore these findings experimentally, we propose a feasible setup to explore the unique properties of zero-field flat bands on spherical substrates, offering a promising route for studying interaction-driven states in spherical geometry without external fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03442v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper provides a mathematical perspective on fragile topology phenomena in condensed matter physics. In dimension $d \leq 3$, vanishing Chern classes of bundles of Bloch eigenfunctions characterize operators with exponentially localized Wannier functions (these functions form convenient bases of spectrally determined subspaces of $L^2$). However, for systems with additional symmetries, such as the $C_{2}T$ (space-time reversal) or the $PT$ (parity-time) symmetry, a set of exponentially localized Wannier functions compatible with such symmetry may not exist. We show that for rank 2 Bloch bundles with such symmetry, non-trivial Euler classes are obstructions to constructing exponentially localized compatible Wannier functions. We also show that this obstruction can be lifted by adding additional Bloch bundles with the symmetry, even though the Stiefel--Whitney class of the total bundle is non-trivial. This allows a construction of exponentially localized Wannier functions compatible with the symmetry and that is referred to as topological fragility.</description>

      <title>Superconducting phenomena in systems with unconventional magnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15400v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we review the recent advances on superconducting phenomena in junctions formed by superconductors and unconventional magnets. Conventional magnets, such as ferromagnets and antiferromagnets, are characterized by broken time-reversal symmetry but only ferromagnets produce a finite net magnetization due to parallel spin alignment and spin-split bands in momentum. Very recently, a new type of magnets has been reported and here we refer to them as unconventional magnets because they exhibit special properties of both ferromagnets and antiferromagnets: they exhibit zero net magnetization (like antiferromagnets) and a nonrelativistic spin splitting of energy bands (like ferromagnets), both leading to anisotropic spin-polarized Fermi surfaces. An interesting property of unconventional magnets is that their magnetic order can be even or odd with respect to momentum, where $d$-wave altermagnets and $p$-wave magnets are the most representative examples. In this regard, $d$-wave altermagnets and $p$-wave magnets are seen as counterparts in magnetism of the unconventional $d$- and $p$-wave superconducting states, respectively. While the impact of conventional magnetism on superconductivity has been largely studied, the combination of unconventional magnets and superconductivity has only lately attracted considerably attention. This work provides a comprehensive review of the recent progress on the interplay between superconductivity and unconventional magnets. In particular, we focus on the fundamental emerging superconducting phenomena and also discuss the potential implications towards quantum applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19599v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional superconductors with spin-textured Fermi surfaces can be a platform for realizing unconventional pairing states and are of substantial interest in the context of quantum information science, and superconducting spintronics/orbitronics. We observed an unusual in-plane uniaxial anisotropy in the superconducting 2D electron gas (2DEG) formed at EuOx/KTaO3 (110) interfaces, where the EuOx is magnetic. This anisotropy is not evident in AlOx/KTaO3 (110) where the overlayer is non-magnetic. Our results are consistent with a highly anisotropic 'half-Rashba' spin-textured Fermi surface in 2DEGs formed at the KTaO3 (110) interface that is hidden from external magnetic fields due to a near cancellation between orbital and spin moments but revealed by exchange interactions of the electrons in the 2DEG with Eu moments near the EuOx/KTaO3 (110) interface. The interactions between the uniaxial spin texture and the magnetic overlayer offer new ways to explore the interplay between magnetism and 2D superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Superfluid stiffness bounds in time-reversal symmetric superconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18081v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum geometry has been shown to make an important contribution to the superfluid stiffness of superconductors, especially for flat-band systems such as moir\'e materials. In this work we use mean-field theory to derive an expression for the superfluid stiffness of time-reversal symmetric superconductors at zero temperature by computing the energy of the mean-field ground state as a function of pairing momentum. We show that the quantum geometric contribution to superfluid stiffness is a consequence of broken Galilean invariance in the interaction Hamiltonian, arising from momentum-dependent form factors related to the momentum dependence of Bloch states. The effects of broken Galilean invariance are not fully parametrized by the quantum metric considered in previous work. We obtain general lower and upper bounds that apply to both continuum and lattice models and present numerical calculations of the precise value in several important cases. The superfluid stiffness of superconductivity in a Landau level saturates the lower bound and the superfluid stiffness of the other cases we consider is close to the general lower bound we derive. In multilayer rhombohedral graphene the geometric contribution is shown not to be the dominant contribution to the superfluid stiffness, despite the flat band behavior in the vicinity of the Fermi level. Finally, assuming contact interaction and uniform pairing, we show that the superfluid stiffness is proportional to the ``minimal quantum metric" introduced in previous work. We provide a continuum version of the minimal quantum metric and explain its physical origin.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12776v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report a significant reduction of low-temperature damping losses in tensile-strained, ultrathin Y3Fe5O12 (YIG) films grown by pulsed laser deposition, exhibiting ultralow damping constants and tunable magnetic anisotropy. Comparative broadband FMR measurements show that tensile-strained YIG films on Gd3Sc2Ga3O12 (GSGG) retain low damping even at nanometer thicknesses and cryogenic temperatures, outperforming relaxed films on Gd3Ga5O12. Based on static magnetometry measurements and microstructural characterization, we attribute these enhanced dynamic properties to the suppression of interdiffusion across the YIG/GSGG interface, resulting from enhanced chemical stability and favorable growth kinetics by the presence of Sc. Our findings highlight the importance of chemical and kinetic factors in achieving few-nanometer-thick YIG film with negligible low-temperature damping dissipation and perpendicular magnetic anisotropy for cryogenic spintronic applications.</description>
