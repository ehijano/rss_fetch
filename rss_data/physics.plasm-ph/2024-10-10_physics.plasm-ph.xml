      <title>Particle-in-cell simulations of the tearing instability for relativistic pair plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations explore the collisionless tearing instability developing in a Harris equilibrium configuration in a pair (electron-positron) plasma, with no guide field, for a range of parameters from non-relativistic to relativistic temperatures and drift velocities. Growth rates match predictions of Zelenyi &amp; Krasnosel'skikh (1979) modified for relativistic drifts by Hoshino (2020) as long as the assumption holds that the thickness $a$ of the current sheet is larger than the Larmor radius $\rho_L$, with the fastest growing mode at $ka \approx 1/\sqrt{3}$. Aside from confirming these predictions, we explore the transitions from thick to thin current sheets and from classical to relativistic temperatures. We show that for thinner current sheets ($a&lt; \rho_L$), the growth rate matches the prediction for the case $a=\rho_L$. We also explore the nonlinear evolution of the modes. While the wave number with the fastest growth rate initially matches the prediction of Zelenyi &amp; Krasnosel'skikh (1979), these modes saturate moving the dominant mode to lower wave numbers (especially for thick current sheets with low growth rates). Furthermore, at a late, non-linear stage, the growth rate (initially following the growth rate prediction proportional to $(\rho_L/a)^{3/2} &lt; 1$) increases faster than exponentially, reaching a maximum growth rate equivalent to the linear growth rate prediction at $\rho_L/a = 1$, before eventually saturating.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian structure of single-helicity, incompressible magnetohydrodynamics and application to magnetorotational instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A four-field reduced model of single helicity, incompressible MHD is derived in cylindrical geometry. An appropriate set of noncanonical variables is found, and the Hamiltonian, the Lie-Poisson bracket and the Casimir invariants are clarified. Detailed proofs of properties of the Lie-Poisson bracket, (i) antisymmetry, (ii) Leibniz rule, and (iii) Jacobi identity, are given. Two applications are presented: the first is that the local dispersion relation of axisymmetric magnetohydrodynamics (MRI) is properly reproduced, and the second is that linear stability analyses including negative-energy MRI were successfully performed.</description>

      <title>Numerical analysis of partial discharge ignition in H2 bubbles floating in dielectric oils, for High-Voltage Solid State Transformer applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on a self-consistent numerical analysis campaign of partial discharge (PD) ignition in H2 bubbles floating in biobased dielectric oils. We investigate various configurations (bubble sizes, bubble position, existence of protrusion) on a cylinder-to-cylinder setup that emulates a specific SST module (from SSTAR Horizon Europe project) under transient overvoltage as well as in its design operational conditions (VRMS = 66 kV, AC excitation of 50 Hz). Our results on electrical characteristics and plasma dynamics leading to the PD ignition, indicate that under transient overvoltage and for mm size bubbles (diameter 1 -4.5 mm), the smaller the bubble the less the inception voltage, while the peak inception voltage is higher than 70 kV. The existence of metallic protrusion can affect the inception voltage of a remote floating bubble only slightly and when this is close to the sharp tip. The extreme scenario of a protrusion in contact (inside) a gas bubble severely affects the insulation properties and drops the PD inception voltage remarkably. The larger the bubble and the sharper the tip of the protrusion the lower the inception peak voltage, that can reach values well below 40 kV. On the contrary and under design operation, larger bubbles increase the severity and probability of PD events, leading to lower instantaneous inception voltages. Current pulses produced in bubbles can quickly transit to intense streamer discharges (which can also transit to catastrophic arcing) if the operational frequency is reduced and/or under transient, HF overvoltage.</description>

      <title>Trapping of electromagnetic waves by two dimensional plasma-metamaterial composite structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we (i) extend previous 1D studies of electromagnetic (EM) wave propagation in an over-dense plasma-metamaterial composite into two spatial dimensions and (ii) study trapping of EM waves by the composite 2D structures (barriers). Such barriers are formed when metamaterial spatially co-exists with a plasma density depletion in a form of a slab or two-dimensional density rectangular depletions (DRDs). This is analogous to EM wave trapping by preformed density cavities in near-critical density plasmas, studied before. We find that plasma-metamaterial composite allows to trap EM waves by both slab and DRD configurations, thus forming a standing wave at the edge of an opaque region. The standing wave subsequently damps which offers applications such as heat deposition or substrate materials (micro)machining depending on EM wave intensity. The established results may find future applications such as: more efficient plasma vapour deposition, controlling EM wave propagation (EM wave trapping) in invisibility cloaks and alike. The EM wave trapping conditions are elucidated by a set of particle-in-cell (PIC) numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Analytic model of stable shock-like structures in laser interaction with underdense plasma for identifying of phase and polarization dependent regime of laser wakefield accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an analytical model describing a stable shock-like structure that is formed when an ultra-intense laser propagates through an underdense plasma. It is shown that such structures exist in a wide range of laser-plasma parameters, with a unique sub-luminal shock front velocity for each parameter. Numerical methods to accurately describe such shock-front is developed. The formalism is applied to describe the parameter space in which the Carrier-Envelope-Phase (CEP) effect under which phase and polarization dependent super-ponderomotive effects becomes significant. The developed formalism will enable quick identification of regimes in which CEP effects become significant, expediting designing of Laser Wakefield Accelerators operating in the superponderomotive regime.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of The Brightest Nano-size Gamma Source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gamma rays consist of high-energy photons that selectively interact with nuclei, induce and mediate nuclear reactions and elementary particle interactions, and exceed x-rays in penetrating power and thus are indispensable for analysis and modification of dense or compressed object interior. Yet, the available gamma sources lack power and brightness which, if available, would revolutionize science and technology. The predicted laser-driven Gamma Flash (GF) would be the highest-power and the brightest terrestrial gamma source with a 30-40% laser-to-gamma energy conversion. It is based on inverse Compton scattering in a laser-solid interaction at irradiance typically above $10^{23}W/cm^2$. GF is one of the motivating goals for the most advanced laser facilities. However, till now GF remains overshadowed by simultaneously generated low-brightness Bremsstrahlung. Here we experimentally differentiate these two mechanisms and demonstrate a GF dominant regime producing several times the number of Bremsstrahlung photons. We found steep GF yield growth with the laser power and irradiance. Simulations revealed a Terawatt GF with nanometre source and an attosecond pulse train with a record brightness of $~10^{22}photons/mm^2mrad^2s0.1\%BW$ at up to tens of MeV. The small source size and high brightness paves the way towards spatially coherent gamma rays. At high photon energies, our regime is comparable in brightness to astrophysical Gamma Ray Bursts. We anticipate that the gamma ray source based on our findings will facilitate a breakthrough in research on future inertial fusion energy by enabling high-spatial-resolution time-resolved radiography of fuel mixing instabilities in extremely compressed targets. Such a new compact bright ultrafast gamma source could facilitate significant advances in time-resolved nuclear physics, homeland security, and nuclear waste management and non-proliferation.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The plasma screening model, taking into account the electronic exchange-correlation effects and the ionic non-ideality in dense quantum plasmas, is presented. This model can be used as an input in various plasma interaction models to calculate the scattering cross-sections and transport properties. The application of the presented plasma screening model is demonstrated on the example of the temperature relaxation rate in dense hydrogen and warm dense aluminum. Additionally, we compute the conductivity of warm-dense aluminum in the regime where collisions are dominated by electron-ion scattering. The obtained results are compared with available theoretical results and simulation data.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Cnoidal Waves and Formation of Patterns and Coherent Structures in Intense Charged Particle Beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The longitudinal dynamics of an intense high energy beam moving in a resonator cavity has been studied in some detail. Through the method of separation of variables and its obvious straightforward generalization, a solution of the Vlasov equation for the distribution function of an intense charged particle beam in the longitudinal direction has been obtained. The thus found Bernstein-Greene-Kruskal (BGK) equilibrium has been utilized to construct stationary wave patterns in the special case when the velocity distribution (energy error distribution) is Maxwellian. These are cnoidal wave patterns, showing rather intriguing and in a sense unexpected analogy between the equilibrium wave patterns in an intense charged particle beam and similar wave clusters originally observed in shallow water.
  Based on the hydrodynamic model, fully equivalent to the coupled nonlinear system of the Vlasov equation for the distribution function of an intense beam in the longitudinal direction and the equation for the resonator cavity potential, an amplitude equation in the most general form has been derived. A very interesting and important property of the nonlinear amplitude equation is the fact that it is of hyperbolic type (nonlinear wave equation with complex coefficients) in the entire interval of admissible values for the wave number except for a single critical point, in which it is of parabolic type (non-linear Schrodinger equation with complex coefficients).</description>

      <title>Nonlinear evolution of a cold non-relativistic electron-ion plasma with an arbitrary initial density profile: A phase mixing perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using a perturbative approach, an evolution equation for the space charge density, correct up to the third order, is deduced for arbitrary initial density profiles of the electron and ion fluids in a cold nonrelativistic plasma. The evolution equation is solved to reproduce known results pertaining to the phase mixing time in the immobile ion limit as well as in the case of mobile ions, for a homogeneous plasma as well as for a plasma with a periodic inhomogeneity. The case of non-periodic plasma inhomogeneity, as in a finite-size plasma, is also discussed and some insights are given which are well supported by fluid simulation observations.</description>

      <title>Unified mesoscale picture of nonlinear generation of zonal flows in toroidal geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent experimental findings on limit-cycle-oscillations indicate that the nonlinear driving of the turbulent poloidal Reynolds stress to zonal flows is not a significant factor in the toroidal geometry, sparking fundamental controversial issues within the fusion community. By using the global nonlinear gyrokinetic simulations, we propose a unified mesoscale picture of nonlinear driving of zonal flows in the ion-temperature-gradient turbulence. Zonal flows are nonlinearly driven by the turbulent energy flux and the turbulent poloidal Reynolds stress. The turbulent energy flux is not shielded by the toroidal geometry effect in nonlinearly driving zonal flows. The turbulent poloidal Reynolds stress is not shielded on the time scale shorter than the ion bounce period; however, on the time scale longer than the ion bounce period, the turbulent poloidal Reynolds stress is indeed shielded by the toroidal geometry effect.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intel Max GPUs are a new option available to CGYRO fusion simulation users. This paper outlines the changes that were needed to successfully run CGYRO on Intel Max 1550 GPUs on TACC's Stampede3 HPC system and presents benchmark results obtained there. Benchmark results were also run on Stampede3 Intel Max CPUs, as well as NVIDIA A100 and AMD MI250X GPUs at other major HPC systems. The Intel Max GPUs are shown to perform comparably to the other tested GPUs for smaller simulations but are noticeably slower for larger ones. Moreover, Intel Max GPUs are significantly faster than the tested Intel Max CPUs on Stampede3.</description>

      <title>Ultra-High-Energy Cosmic Rays Accelerated by Magnetically Dominated Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05546v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultra-High-Energy Cosmic Rays (UHECRs), particles characterized by energies exceeding $10^{18}$ eV, are generally believed to be accelerated electromagnetically in high-energy astrophysical sources. One promising mechanism of UHECR acceleration is magnetized turbulence. We demonstrate from first principles, using fully kinetic particle-in-cell simulations, that magnetically dominated turbulence accelerates particles on a short timescale, producing a power-law energy distribution with a rigidity-dependent, sharply defined cutoff well approximated by the form $f_{\rm cut}\left({E, E_{\rm cut}}\right) = {\text{sech}}\left[ ( {{E}/{E_{\rm cut}}} )^2 \right]$. Particle escape from the turbulent accelerating region is energy-dependent, with $t_{\rm esc} \propto E^{-\delta}$ and $\delta \sim 1/3$. The resulting particle flux from the accelerator follows $dN/dEdt \propto E^{-s} {\text{sech}}\left[ ( {{E}/{E_{\rm cut}}} )^2 \right]$, with $s \sim 2.1$. We fit the Pierre Auger Observatory's spectrum and composition measurements, taking into account particle interactions between acceleration and detection, and show that the turbulence-associated energy cutoff is well supported by the data, with the best-fitting spectral index being $s = 2.1^{+0.06}_{-0.13}$. Our first-principles results indicate that particle acceleration by magnetically dominated turbulence may constitute the physical mechanism responsible for UHECR acceleration.</description>

      <title>Exact Nonlinear Decomposition of Ideal-MHD Waves Using Eigenenergies II: Fully Analytical EEDM Equations and Pseudo-Advective Energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physical insight into plasma evolution in the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) limit can be revealed by decomposing the evolution according to the characteristic modes of the system. In this paper we explore aspects of the eigenenergy decomposition method (EEDM) introduced in an earlier study (Raboonik et al. 2024 , ApJ, 967:80). The EEDM provides an exact decomposition of nonlinear MHD disturbances into their component eigenenergies associated with the slow, Alfv\'en, and fast eigenmodes, together with two zero-frequency eigenmodes. Here we refine the EEDM by presenting globally analytical expressions for the eigenenergies. We also explore the nature of the zero-frequency ``pseudo-advective modes'' in detail. We show that in evolutions with pure advection of magnetic and thermal energy (without propagating waves) a part of the energy is carried by the pseudo advective modes. Exact expressions for the error terms associated with these modes--commonly encountered in numerical simulations--are also introduced. The new EEDM equations provide a robust tool for the exact and unique decomposition of nonlinear disturbances governed by homogeneous quasi-linear partial differential equations, even in the presence of local or global degeneracies.</description>

      <title>Quantum kinetic theory of photons in degenerate plasmas: a field-theoretical approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05917v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A rigorous treatment of light-matter interactions typically requires an interacting quantum field theory. However, many practical results are often derived using classical or semiclassical approximations, which are valid only when quantum-field fluctuations can be neglected. This approximation breaks down in scenarios involving large light intensities or degenerate matter, where additional quantum effects become significant. In this work, we address these limitations by developing a quantum kinetic framework that treats both light and matter fields on equal footing, naturally incorporating both linear and nonlinear interactions. To accurately account for light fluctuations, we introduce a photon distribution function that, together with the classical electromagnetic fields, provides a better description of the photon fluid. From this formalism, we derive kinetic equations from first principles that recover classical electrodynamical results while revealing novel couplings absent in classical theory. Furthermore, by addressing the Coulomb interaction in the Hartree-Fock approximation, we include the role of fermionic exchange exactly in both the kinetic and fluid regimes through a generalized Fock potential. The latter provides corrections not only to the electrostatic forces but also to the plasma velocity field, which are important in degenerate conditions.</description>

      <title>Systematic 2.5 D resistive MHD simulations with ambipolar diffusion and Hall effect for fast magnetic reconnection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06391v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the possibility of the Hall effect and ambipolar diffusion as a mechanism for fast reconnection. The reconnected flux of our resistive and resistive+Hall simulations replicates the GEM results. Furthermore, we investigate, for the first time, the effect of ambipolar diffusion in the GEM. The reconnected flux of the resistive+ambipolar and resistive+Hall+ambipolar simulations showed increases of up to 75\% and 143\%, respectively, compared to the resistive and resistive+Hall simulations, showing that ambipolar diffusion contributes significantly to the reconnected flux. Our second scenario has a magnetic Harris field without perturbations but with an out-of-plane component, known as a guide field. We found that the reconnection rate increased faster with ambipolar diffusion, reaching values close to 0.1 for the resistive+Hall+ambipolar simulation followed by the resistive+Hall. These two simulations achieved the highest kinetic energy, implying more efficient energy conversion during reconnection.</description>

      <title>Effect of Dielectric Wakefields in a Capillary Discharge for Plasma Wakefield Acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dielectric capillaries are widely used to generate plasmas for plasma wakefield acceleration. When a relativistic drive bunch travels through a capillary with misaligned trajectory with respect to the capillary axis, it is deflected by the effect of the dielectric transverse wakefields it drives. We experimentally show that the deflection effect increases along the bunch and with larger misalignment, and we investigate the decay of dielectric wakefields by measuring the effect on the front of a trailing bunch. We discuss the implications for the design of a plasma wakefield accelerator based on dielectric capillaries.</description>

      <title>Laser Interactions with Gas Jets: EMP Emission and Nozzle Damage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19519v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the physics of electromagnetic pulse emission and nozzle damage is critical for the long-term operation of laser experiments with gas targets, particularly at facilities looking to produce stable sources of radiation at high repetition rate. We present a theoretical model of plasma formation and electrostatic charging when high-power lasers are focused inside gases. The model can be used to estimate the amplitude of gigahertz electromagnetic pulses (EMPs) produced by the laser and the extent of damage to the gas jet nozzle. Looking at a range of laser and target properties relevant to existing high-power laser systems, we find that EMP fields of tens to hundreds of kV/m can be generated several metres from the gas jet. Model predictions are compared with measurements of EMP, plasma formation and nozzle damage from two experiments on the VEGA-3 laser and one experiment on the Vulcan Petawatt laser.</description>

      <title>Barrier discharges in CO$_2$ -- optical emission spectra analysis and E/N determination from intensity ratio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14105v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study barrier discharges in CO$_2$ using optical emission spectroscopy and electrical measurements. We record the spectra of weak CO$_2$ barrier discharge emission in UV-VIS-NIR range. The CO spectral bands of 3rd positive, Angstrom and Asundi systems are identified in the spectra, together with the CO+2 bands of the UV-doublet and the Fox-Duffendack-Baker systems. The effect of CO$_2$ flow rate variations on the relative intensities of the CO and CO$_2$ optical emissions is also investigated. We analyze the optical emission of selected vibrational spectral bands and attempt to determine the E/N using intensity ratio method with kinetic data available in the literature. The method, using intensities from different spectral bands, is tested on sinusoidal driven atmospheric pressure Townsend (APTD) and single-filament barrier discharges at atmospheric pressure. For APTD at different flows and known CO conversion factors, an attempt is made to use the ratio of selected CO to CO$_2$ band intensities. The technique of time-correlated single photon counting is used to obtain necessary sub-nanosecond temporal resolution and, importantly, high signal sensitivity for the single-filament experiment and its utilization gives a promising result, E/N of 330 Td in barrier discharge streamer. Nevertheless, the uncertainties coming from different kinetic data and the low sensitivity of some rate coefficient ratios complicate an easy utilisation of the method. Future steps are therefore proposed, including uncertainty quantification and sensitivity analysis of the simplified model and necessary CO+2 and CO synthetic spectra fitting.</description>

      <title>DeepCSNet: a deep learning method for predicting electron-impact doubly differential ionization cross sections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09778v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electron-impact ionization cross sections of atoms and molecules are essential for plasma modelling. However, experimentally determining the absolute cross sections is not easy, and ab initio calculations become computationally prohibitive as molecular complexity increases. Existing AI-based prediction methods suffer from limited data availability and poor generalization. To address these issues, we propose DeepCSNet, a deep learning approach designed to predict electron-impact ionization cross sections using limited training data. We present two configurations of DeepCSNet: one tailored for specific molecules and another for various molecules. Both configurations can typically achieve a relative L2 error less than 5%. The present numerical results, focusing on electron-impact doubly differential ionization cross sections, demonstrate DeepCSNet's generalization ability, predicting cross sections across a wide range of energies and incident angles. Additionally, DeepCSNet shows promising results in predicting cross sections for molecules not included in the training set, even large molecules with more than 10 constituent atoms, highlighting its potential for practical applications.</description>

      <title>Large radiation back-flux from Monte Carlo simulations of fusion neutron-material interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16614v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Radiation back-fluxes, generated from neutron-material interactions in fusion power reactors, can dramatically impact the plasma dynamics, e.g., by seeding runaway electrons during disruptions via Compton scattering of background electrons by wall-emitted gamma radiation. Here, we quantify these back-fluxes, including neutrons, gamma rays, and electrons, using Monte Carlo calculations for a range of structural material candidates and first wall thicknesses. The radiation back-flux magnitudes are remarkably large, with neutron and gamma radiation back-fluxes on the same order of magnitude as the incident fusion neutron flux. Electron back-fluxes are two orders of magnitudes lower, but are emitted at sufficiently high energies to provide a relatively large back-current through the sheath which may cause sheath reversal. Material configuration plays a key role in determining back-flux magnitudes. The structural material chiefly determines the neutron back-flux magnitude, while the first wall thickness principally attenuates the gamma ray and electron back-fluxes. In addition to prompt back-fluxes, which are emitted immediately after fusion neutrons impact the surface, significant delayed gamma ray and electron back-fluxes arise from nuclear decay processes in the activated materials. These delayed back-flux magnitudes range from 2%--7% of the prompt back-fluxes, and remain present during transients when fusion no longer occurs. During disruptions, build-up of delayed gamma radiation back-flux represents potential runaway electron seeding mechanisms, posing additional challenges for disruption mitigation in a power reactor compared with non-nuclear plasma operations. This work highlights the impact of these radiation back-fluxes plasma performance and demonstrates the importance of considering back-flux generation in materials selection for fusion power reactors.</description>

      <title>Applicability criteria of proper charge neutrality and special relativistic MHD models extended by two-fluid effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03317v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The applicability of relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (RMHD) and its generalization to two-fluid models (including the Hall and inertial effects) is systematically investigated by using the method of dominant balance in the two-fluid equations. Although proper charge neutrality or quasi-neutrality is the key assumption for all MHD models, this condition is difficult to be met when both relativistic and inertial effects are taken into account. The range of application for each MHD model is illustrated in the space of dimensionless scale parameters. Moreover, the number of field variables of relativistic Hall MHD (RHMHD) is shown to be greater than that of RMHD and Hall MHD. Nevertheless, the RHMHD equations may be solved at a lower computational cost than RMHD, since root-finding algorithm, which is the most time-consuming part of the RMHD code, is no longer required to compute the primitive variables.</description>

      <title>Superluminal spacetime boundary, time reflection and quantum light generation from relativistic plasma mirrors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01287v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A plasma mirror is an optical device for high-power, ultrashort-wavelength electromagnetic fields, utilizing a sheet of relativistic oscillating electrons to generate and manipulate light. In this work, we propose that the spatiotemporally varying plasma oscillation, induced by an ultra-high-intensity laser beam, functions as a "spacetime mirror" with significant potential for exploring quantum light. We find that the spacetime mirror exhibits several exotic features: (i) a superluminal spacetime boundary, (ii) time reflection and refraction, and (iii) quantum light sources with pair generation. Our theoretical and simulation results are in excellent agreement, and experimental verification is underway. Our work demonstrates the interplay with emerging fields such as time varying media, suggesting the plasma mirror as an ideal platform to study strong-field quantum optics at extremes.</description>

      <title>Photospheric hot spots at solar coronal loop footpoints revealed by hyperspectral imaging observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04964v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Poynting flux generated by random shuffling of photospheric magnetic footpoints is transferred through the upper atmosphere of the Sun where the plasma is heated to over 1 MK in the corona. High spatiotemporal resolution observations of the lower atmosphere at the base of coronal magnetic loops are crucial to better understand the nature of the footpoint dynamics and the details of magnetic processes that eventually channel energy into the corona. Here we report high spatial resolution ($\sim$0.1\arcsec) and cadence (1.33 s) hyperspectral imaging of the solar H$\alpha$ line, acquired by the Microlensed Hyperspectral Imager prototype installed at the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope, that reveal photospheric hot spots at the base of solar coronal loops. These hot spots manifest themselves as H$\alpha$ wing enhancements, occurring on small spatial scales of $\sim$0.2\arcsec, and timescales of less than 100 s. By assuming that the H$\alpha$ wings and the continuum form under the local thermodynamic equilibrium condition, we inverted the H$\alpha$ line profiles and found that the hot spots are compatible with a temperature increase of about 1000 K above the ambient quiet-Sun temperature. The H$\alpha$ wing integrated Stokes $V/I$ maps indicate that hot spots are related to magnetic patches with field strengths comparable to or even stronger than the surrounding network elements. But they do not show the presence of parasitic polarity magnetic field that would support the interpretation that these hot spots are reconnection-driven Ellerman bombs. Therefore, we interpret these features as proxies of locations where convection-driven magnetic field intensification in the photosphere can lead to energy transfer into higher layers. We suggest that such hot spots at coronal loop footpoints may be indicative of the specific locations and onset of energy flux injection into the upper atmosphere.</description>
