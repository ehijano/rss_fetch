      <title>Heterogeneous immune recovery after viral response through a dynamical model of feedback-driven persistence and clearance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Viral infections trigger complex immune responses with heterogeneous outcomes shaped by nonlinear feedbacks. An ordinary differential equation model is developed to investigate immune response dynamics during viral infection, incorporating six modules: viral load, innate immunity, cellular immunity, humoral immunity, immune suppression, and IL-6 levels. Bifurcation analysis reveals that under continuous viral exposure, when viral clearance rate and intrinsic viral death rate satisfy specific conditions, the system exhibits up to five stable equilibria. This indicates that different health and disease states may coexist depending on initial conditions, while severe inflammation mainly arises from strong activation of cellular immunity, highlighting the complexity of immune responses. Simulations of finite-time viral exposure demonstrate multi-timescale recovery characteristics: viral load and IL-6 levels decline rapidly, whereas humoral immune activation and immunosuppression show delayed and sustained patterns. Furthermore, analysis of infectious period and disease duration also indicates that during transition from early acute response to chronic disease, viral replication rate plays a critical role, while immune response intensity is sensitive to both viral clearance and immune self-activation. Subsystem analysis identifies the three-component subsystem of viral load, innate immunity, and cellular immunity as core drivers of bistability and oscillations, while humoral immunity, immune suppression, and IL-6 primarily modulate response amplitude and timing. This work establishes a theoretical framework for analyzing immune response and chronic risks through feedback dynamical modelling, providing insights for intervention strategies.</description>

      <title>Aneurysm Growth Time Series Reconstruction Using Physics-informed Autoencoder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Arterial aneurysm (Fig.1) is a bulb-shape local expansion of human arteries, the rupture of which is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in US. Therefore, the prediction of arterial aneurysm rupture is of great significance for aneurysm management and treatment selection. The prediction of aneurysm rupture depends on the analysis of the time series of aneurysm growth history. However, due to the long time scale of aneurysm growth, the time series of aneurysm growth is not always accessible. We here proposed a method to reconstruct the aneurysm growth time series directly from patient parameters. The prediction is based on data pairs of [patient parameters, patient aneurysm growth time history]. To obtain the mapping from patient parameters to patient aneurysm growth time history, we first apply autoencoder to obtain a compact representation of the time series for each patient. Then a mapping is learned from patient parameters to the corresponding compact representation of time series via a five-layer neural network. Moving average and convolutional output layer are implemented to explicitly taking account the time dependency of the time series.
  Apart from that, we also propose to use prior knowledge about the mechanism of aneurysm growth to improve the time series reconstruction results. The prior physics-based knowledge is incorporated as constraints for the optimization problem associated with autoencoder. The model can handle both algebraic and differential constraints. Our results show that including physical model information about the data will not significantly improve the time series reconstruction results if the training data is error-free. However, in the case of training data with noise and bias error, incorporating physical model constraints can significantly improve the predicted time series.</description>

      <title>Harmonic fields and the mechanical response of a cellular monolayer to ablation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multicellular tissues, such as the epithelium coating a developing embryo, often combine complex tissue shapes with heterogeneity in the spatial arrangement of individual cells. Discrete approximations, such as the cell vertex model, can accommodate these geometric features, but techniques for analysis of such models are underdeveloped. Here, we express differential operators defined on a network representing a monolayer of confluent cells in the framework of discrete exterior calculus, considering scalar fields defined over cell vertices and centres and vector fields defined over cell edges. We achieve this by defining Hodge stars, wedge products and musical isomorphisms that are appropriate for a disordered monolayer for which cell edges and links between cell centres are not orthogonal, as is generic for epithelia. We use this framework to evaluate the harmonic vector field arising in an ablated monolayer, demonstrating an approximate 1/\textit{r} scaling of the upper bound of the field's amplitude, where \textit{r} is the distance from the ablation. Using a vertex model that incorporates osmotic effects, we then calculate the mechanical response of a monolayer in a jammed state to ablation. Perturbation displacements exhibit long-range coherence, monopolar and quadrupolar features, and an approximate 1/\textit{r} near-hole upper-bound scaling, implicating the harmonic field. The upper bounds on perturbation stress amplitudes scale approximately like 1/\textit{r}$^2$, a feature relevant to long-range mechanical signalling.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning for Clinical Reasoning: Aligning LLMs with ACR Imaging Appropriateness Criteria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Medical imaging has revolutionized diagnosis, yet unnecessary procedures are rising, exposing patients to radiation and stress, limiting equitable access, and straining healthcare systems. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria, developed through extensive multidisciplinary review, provide evidence-based guidance but remain underutilized. Leveraging advances in LLM reasoning, we introduce a Reasoning Agent trained with Reinforcement Learning (RL), specifically Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), to replicate expert clinical reasoning from the ACR Criteria. We present a novel RL approach for structured medical reasoning, systematically comparing reasoning-focused reward functions and evidence integration strategies. Our lightweight 8B model, MedReason-Embed, improves macro F1 by 18% over baseline, shows stronger reasoning alignment, and outperforms both larger and alternatively trained models, showing that reasoning-based supervision enables efficient, trustworthy clinical AI. Building on this, we design a modular end-to-end agentic architecture that automates imaging referrals: mapping diagnoses to ICD codes, retrieving PubMed evidence, and recommending optimal procedures. Crucially, the ability to generalize beyond static ACR guidelines not only enables clinicians to handle out-of-distribution cases, but also supports scaling the guideline development process itself, potentially reducing the significant effort required to create and update them. This work shows the potential of reasoning-focused RL within agentic architectures to deliver transparent, scalable, and reliable clinical decision support.

      <title>Reducing Latency and Noise in PPG-Based SpO2 Measurements: A Kalman Filtering Approach Towards Acute Hypoxia Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photoplethysmography (PPG) is a common tool for monitoring cardiopulmonary health. Relying on absorption or reflectance of light by hemoglobin in the blood, the measured PPG waveform can be analyzed per heart beat using physiological assumptions to extract metrics ranging from heart rate to specific blood oxygenation (SpO2). This has led to the widespread use of PPG for bedside clinical monitoring to wearable consumer health monitoring. However, PPG is notoriously noisy and the measured absorption or reflectance of light is sensitive to factors such as body movement and contact with the skin. To reduce the noise in the PPG-derived SpO2, we developed combined traditional methods of estimating SpO2 from the PPG waveform with a new method to extract changes in SpO2 from the PPG waveform in a Kalman filter, and demonstrated its ability to better estimate SpO2 in humans undergoing controlled hypoxia (down to 14% atmospheric oxygen). The Kalman filter reduced variability in SpO2 to 4.30%SpO2 compared to the beat-to-beat SpO2 variability of 12.59%SpO2. This mirrored current methods of window-averaging the beat-to-beat SpO2, with a 30s window-average reducing SpO2 variability to 4.73%. However, current window-average methods also introduce delays, with 10s and 30s window-averaging introducing delays of 5s and 14s respectively compared to the beat-to-beat SpO2. The Kalman filter reduced this delay to within 3s of the beat-to-beat SpO2, highlighting its ability to reduce noise while maintaining SpO2 dynamics. This capability is particularly useful in reliably detecting clinically meaningful, but transient, hypoxic states, such as those observed during apnea.</description>

      <title>Mathematical Analysis for a Class of Stochastic Copolymerization Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05383v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a stochastic model of a copolymerization process that has been extensively investigated in the physics literature. The main questions of interest include: (i) what are the criteria for transience, null recurrence, and positive recurrence in terms of the system parameters; (ii) in the transient regime, what are the limiting fractions of the different monomer types; and (iii) in the transient regime, what is the speed of growth of the polymer? Previous studies in the physics literature have addressed these questions using heuristic methods. Here, we utilize rigorous mathematical arguments to derive the results from the physics literature. Moreover, the techniques developed allow us to generalize to the copolymerization process with finitely many monomer types. We expect that the mathematical methods used and developed in this work will also enable the study of even more complex models in the future.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Machine Learning in Biomedical Science and Engineering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.05433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physics-informed machine learning (PIML) is emerging as a potentially transformative paradigm for modeling complex biomedical systems by integrating parameterized physical laws with data-driven methods. Here, we review three main classes of PIML frameworks: physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs), and neural operators (NOs), highlighting their growing role in biomedical science and engineering. We begin with PINNs, which embed governing equations into deep learning models and have been successfully applied to biosolid and biofluid mechanics, mechanobiology, and medical imaging among other areas. We then review NODEs, which offer continuous-time modeling, especially suited to dynamic physiological systems, pharmacokinetics, and cell signaling. Finally, we discuss deep NOs as powerful tools for learning mappings between function spaces, enabling efficient simulations across multiscale and spatially heterogeneous biological domains. Throughout, we emphasize applications where physical interpretability, data scarcity, or system complexity make conventional black-box learning insufficient. We conclude by identifying open challenges and future directions for advancing PIML in biomedical science and engineering, including issues of uncertainty quantification, generalization, and integration of PIML and large language models.</description>

      <title>acia-workflows: Automated Single-cell Imaging Analysis for Scalable and Deep Learning-based Live-cell Imaging Analysis Workflows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Live-cell imaging (LCI) technology enables the detailed spatio-temporal characterization of living cells at the single-cell level, which is critical for advancing research in the life sciences, from biomedical applications to bioprocessing. High-throughput setups with tens to hundreds of parallel cell cultivations offer the potential for robust and reproducible insights. However, these insights are obscured by the large amount of LCI data recorded per experiment. Recent advances in state-of-the-art deep learning methods for cell segmentation and tracking now enable the automated analysis of such large data volumes, offering unprecedented opportunities to systematically study single-cell dynamics. The next key challenge lies in integrating these powerful tools into accessible, flexible, and user-friendly workflows that support routine application in biological research. In this work, we present acia-workflows, a platform that combines three key components: (1) the Automated live-Cell Imaging Analysis (acia) Python library, which supports the modular design of image analysis pipelines offering eight deep learning segmentation and tracking approaches; (2) workflows that assemble the image analysis pipeline, its software dependencies, documentation, and visualizations into a single Jupyter Notebook, leading to accessible, reproducible and scalable analysis workflows; and (3) a collection of application workflows showcasing the analysis and customization capabilities in real-world applications. Specifically, we present three workflows to investigate various types of microfluidic LCI experiments ranging from growth rate comparisons to precise, minute-resolution quantitative analyses of individual dynamic cells responses to changing oxygen conditions. Our collection of more than ten application workflows is open source and publicly available at https://github.com/JuBiotech/acia-workflows.</description>

      <title>Binding Affinity Prediction: From Conventional to Machine Learning-Based Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00709v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Protein-ligand binding is the process by which a small molecule (drug or inhibitor) attaches to a target protein. Binding affinity, which characterizes the strength of biomolecular interactions, is essential for tackling diverse challenges in life sciences, including therapeutic design, protein engineering, enzyme optimization, and elucidating biological mechanisms. Much work has been devoted to predicting binding affinity over the past decades. Here, we review recent significant works, with a focus on methods, evaluation strategies, and benchmark datasets. We note growing use of both traditional machine learning and deep learning models for predicting binding affinity, accompanied by an increasing amount of data on proteins and small drug-like molecules. With improved predictive performance and the FDA's phasing out of animal testing, AI-driven in silico models, such as AI virtual cells (AIVCs), are poised to advance binding affinity prediction; reciprocally, progress in building binding affinity predictors can refine AIVCs. Future efforts in binding affinity prediction and AI-driven in silico models can enhance the simulation of temporal dynamics, cell-type specificity, and multi-omics integration to support more accurate and personalized outcomes.</description>

      <title>Inverse statistics of active matter trajectories to distinguish interaction kernel anisotropy from emergent correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04193v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-resolution imaging provides dense trajectories of migrating cells, flocking animals, and synthetic active particles, from which interaction laws can be determined with a wide variety of methods. Yet, distinguishing whether front-back or lateral biases seen in such data reflect intrinsic anisotropy in the interaction kernel or emergent correlations that are nevertheless produced by isotropic pairwise interaction forces remains an open challenge. We resolve this ambiguity by deriving a linear partial differential equation that connects measurable two-point velocity correlations to an unknown, distance- and angle-dependent interaction kernel. Turing-like instabilities can occur which allows for dipolar or quadrupolar patterns to arise even when agents interact according to an underlying attraction-repulsion law that is angle-independent. We then show that incorporating a weak velocity-alignment force can interfere with anisotropic pattern formation by suppressing dipolar patterns. We validate these predictions with agent-based simulations and provide design guidance for experiments that seek to discriminate intrinsic anisotropy from emergent effects.</description>

      <title>A Graph-Based Framework for Interpretable Whole Slide Image Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11846v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The histopathological analysis of whole-slide images (WSIs) is fundamental to cancer diagnosis but is a time-consuming and expert-driven process. While deep learning methods show promising results, dominant patch-based methods artificially fragment tissue, ignore biological boundaries, and produce black-box predictions. We overcome these limitations with a novel framework that transforms gigapixel WSIs into biologically-informed graph representations and is interpretable by design. Our approach builds graph nodes from tissue regions that respect natural structures, not arbitrary grids. We introduce an adaptive graph coarsening technique, guided by learned embeddings, to efficiently merge homogeneous regions while preserving diagnostically critical details in heterogeneous areas. Each node is enriched with a compact, interpretable feature set capturing clinically-motivated priors. A graph attention network then performs diagnosis on this compact representation. We demonstrate strong performance on challenging cancer staging and survival prediction tasks. Crucially, our resource-efficient model ($&gt;$13x fewer parameters and $&gt;$300x less data) achieves results competitive with a massive foundation model, while offering full interpretability through feature attribution. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/HistoGraph31/pix2pathology.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty-Guided Model Selection for Tabular Foundation Models in Biomolecule Efficacy Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02476v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In-context learners like TabPFN are promising for biomolecule efficacy prediction, where established molecular feature sets and relevant experimental results can serve as powerful contextual examples. However, their performance is highly sensitive to the provided context, making strategies like post-hoc ensembling of models trained on different data subsets a viable approach. An open question is how to select the best models for the ensemble without access to ground truth labels. In this study, we investigate an uncertainty-guided strategy for model selection. We demonstrate on an siRNA knockdown efficacy task that a TabPFN model using straightforward sequence-based features can surpass specialized state-of-the-art predictors. We also show that the model's predicted inter-quantile range (IQR), a measure of its uncertainty, has a negative correlation with true prediction error. We developed the OligoICP method, which selects and averages an ensemble of models with the lowest mean IQR for siRNA efficacy prediction, achieving superior performance compared to naive ensembling or using a single model trained on all available data. This finding highlights model uncertainty as a powerful, label-free heuristic for optimizing biomolecule efficacy predictions.</description>
