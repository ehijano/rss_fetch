      <title>Quantitative Contraction Rates for McKean-Vlasov Stochastic Differential Equations with Multiplicative Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work focuses on the quantitative contraction rates for McKean-Vlasov stochastic differential equations (SDEs) with multiplicative noise. Under suitable conditions on the coefficients of the SDE, this paper derives explicit quantitative contraction rates for the convergence in Wasserstein distances of McKean-Vlasov SDEs using the coupling method.The contraction results are then used to prove a propagation of chaos uniformly in time, which provides quantitative bounds on convergence rate of interacting particle systems, and establishes exponential ergodicity for McKean-Vlasov SDEs.</description>

      <title>On a convergence of positive continuous additive functionals in terms of their smooth measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A compactness of the Revuz map is established in the sense that the locally uniform convergence of a sequence of positive continuous additive functionals is derived in terms of their smooth measures. To this end, we first introduce a metric on the space of measures of finite energy integrals and show some structures of the metric. Then, we show the compactness and give some examples of positive continuous additive functionals that the convergence holds in terms of the associated smooth measures.</description>

      <title>Uniform-in-time estimates for mean-field type SDEs and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Via constructing an asymptotic coupling by reflection, in this paper we establish uniform-in-time estimates on probability distances for mean-field type SDEs, where the drift terms under consideration are dissipative merely in the long distance. As applications, we (i) explore the long time probability distance estimate between an SDE and its delay version; (ii) investigate the issue on uniform-in-time propagation of chaos for McKean-Vlasov SDEs, where the drifts might be singular with respect to the spatial variables and need not to be of convolution type; (iii) tackle the discretization error bounds in an infinite-time horizon for stochastic algorithms (e.g. backward/tamed/adaptive Euler-Maruyama schemes as three typical candidates) associated with McKean-Vlasov SDEs.</description>

      <title>Precise Large Deviations For The Total Population Of Heavy-Tailed Subcritical Branching Process With Immigration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we focus on the partial sum $S_{n}=X_{1}+\cdots+X_{n}$ of the subcritical branching process with immigration $\{X_{n}\}_{n\in\mathbb{N_{+}}}$, under the condition that one of the offspring $\xi$ or immigration $\eta$ is regularly varying. The tail distribution of $S_n$ is heavily dependent on that of $\xi$ and $\eta$, and a precise large deviation probability for $S_{n}$ is specified. (i)When the tail of offspring $\xi$ is lighter than immigration $\eta$, uniformly for $x\geq x_{n}$, $P(S_{n}-ES_{n}&gt;x)\sim c_{1}nP(\eta&gt;x)$ with some constant $c_{1}$ and sequence $\{x_{n}\}$, where $c_{1}$ is only related to the mean of offspring; (ii) When the tail of immigration $\eta$ is not heavier than offspring $\xi$, uniformly for $x\geq x_{n}$,$P(S_{n} ES_{n}&gt;x)\sim c_{2}nP(\xi&gt;x)$ with some constant $c_{2}$ and sequence $\{x_{n}\}$, where $c_{2}$ is related to both the mean of offspring and the mean of immigration.</description>

      <title>2d Sinh-Gordon model on the infinite cylinder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For $R&gt;0$, we give a rigorous probabilistic construction on the cylinder $\mathbb{R} \times (\mathbb{R}/(2\pi R\mathbb{Z}))$ of the (massless) Sinh-Gordon model. In particular we define the $n$-point correlation functions of the model and show that these exhibit a scaling relation with respect to $R$. The construction, which relies on the massless Gaussian Free Field, is based on the spectral analysis of a quantum operator associated to the model. Using the theory of Gaussian multiplicative chaos, we prove that this operator has discrete spectrum and a strictly positive ground state.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics of the partition function for beta-ensembles at high temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a model for a gas of $N$ confined particles interacting via a two-body logarithmic interaction, namely the real $\beta$-ensembles. We are interested in the regime where the inverse temperature scales as $N\beta=2P$ with $P$ a fixed positive parameter; this is called the high-temperature regime. The confining potential is of the form $x^2+\phi$ with bounded smooth function $\phi$. We establish for this model, the existence of a large-$N$ asymptotic expansion for the associated partition function. We also prove the existence of a large-$N$ asymptotic expansion of linear statistics for general confining potentials. Our method is based on the analysis of the loop equations. Finally, we establish a continuity result for the equilibrium density with respect to the potential dependence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider a subcritical branching Markov chain. Let $Z_n$ denote the counting measure of particles of generation $n$. Under some conditions, we give a probabilistic proof for the existence of the Yaglom limit of $(Z_n)_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ by the moment method, based on the spinal decomposition and the many-to-few formula. As a result, we give explicit integral representations of all quasi-stationary distributions of $(Z_n)_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$, whose proofs are direct and probabilistic, and don't rely on Martin boundary theory.</description>

      <title>The tail distribution function of the partition function for directed polymer in the weak disorder phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the upper tail distribution of the partition function of the directed polymer in a random environment on $\mathbb Z^d$ in the weak disorder phase. We show that the distribution of the infinite volume partition function $W^{\beta}_{\infty}$ displays a power-law decay, with an exponent $p^*(\beta)\in [1+\frac{2}{d},\infty)$. We also prove that the distribution of the suprema of the point-to-point and point-to-line partition functions display the same behavior. On the way to these results, we prove a technical estimate of independent interest: the $L^p$-norm of the partition function at the time when it overshoots a high value $A$ is comparable to $A$. We use this estimate to extend the validity of many recent results that were proved under the assumption that the environment is upper bounded.</description>

      <title>Coherent distributions: Hilbert space approach and duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a Bernoulli random variable with the success probability $p$. We are interested in tight bounds on $\mathbb{E}[f(X_1,X_2)]$, where $X_i=\mathbb{E}[X| \mathcal{F}_i]$ and $\mathcal{F}_i$ are some sigma-algebras. This problem is closely related to understanding extreme points of the set of coherent distributions. A distribution on $[0,1]^2$ is called $\textit{coherent}$ if it can be obtained as the joint distribution of $(X_1, X_2)$ for some choice of $\mathcal{F}_i$. By treating random variables as vectors in a Hilbert space, we establish an upper bound for quadratic $f$, characterize $f$ for which this bound is tight, and show that such $f$ result in exposed coherent distributions with arbitrarily large support. As a corollary, we get a tight bound on $\mathrm{cov}\,(X_1,X_2)$ for $p\in [1/3,\,2/3]$. To obtain a tight bound on $\mathrm{cov}\,(X_1,X_2)$ for all $p$, we develop an approach based on linear programming duality. Its generality is illustrated by tight bounds on $\mathbb{E}[|X_1-X_2|^\alpha]$ for any $\alpha&gt;0$ and $p=1/2$.</description>

      <title>A Random Walk Approach to Broadcasting on Random Recursive Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the broadcasting problem on trees, a $\{0,1\}$-message originating in an unknown node is passed along the tree with a certain error probability $q$. The goal is to estimate the original message without knowing the order in which the nodes were informed. A variation of the problem is considering this broadcasting process on a randomly growing tree, which Addario-Berry et al. have investigated for uniform and linear preferential attachment recursive trees. We extend their studies of the majority estimator to the entire group of very simple increasing trees as well as shape exchangeable trees using the connection to inhomogeneous random walks and other stochastic processes with memory effects such as P\'olya Urns.</description>

      <title>The Large Deviation Principle for $W$-random spectral measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $W$-random graphs provide a flexible framework for modeling large random networks. Using the Large Deviation Principle (LDP) for $W$-random graphs from [9], we prove the LDP for the corresponding class of random symmetric Hilbert-Schmidt integral operators. Our main result describes how the eigenvalues and the eigenspaces of the integral operator are affected by the large deviations in the underlying random graphon. To prove the LDP, we demonstrate continuous dependence of the spectral measures associated with integral operators on the underlying graphons and use the Contraction Principle. To illustrate our results, we obtain leading order asymptotics of the eigenvalues of the integral operators corresponding to certain random graph sequences. These examples suggest several representative scenarios of how the eigenvalues and the eigenspaces of the integral operators are affected by large deviations. Potential implications of these observations for bifurcation analysis of Dynamical Systems and Graph Signal Processing are indicated.</description>

      <title>Limiting distributions of the Spherical model and Spin $O(N)$ model: Appearance of GFF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the relation between the spherical model of Berlin-Kac and the spin $O(N)$ model in the limit $N \to \infty$ and explain how they are related via the discrete Gaussian free field (GFF).
  More precisely, using probabilistic limit theorems and concentration of measure we first prove that the infinite volume limit of the spherical model on a $d$-dimensional torus is a massive GFF in the high-temperature regime, a standard GFF at the critical temperature, and a standard GFF plus a Rademacher random constant in the low-temperature regime. The proof in the case of the critical temperature appears to be new and requires a fine understanding of the zero-average Green's function on the torus.
  For the spin $O(N)$ model, we study the model in the double limit of the spin-dimensionality and the torus size. We take the limit as first the spin-dimension $N$ goes to infinity, and then the size of the torus, and obtain that the different spin coordinates become i.i.d. fields, whose distribution in the high-temperature regime is a massive GFF, a standard GFF at the critical temperature, and a standard GFF plus a Gaussian random constant in the low-temperature regime.
  In particular, this means that although the limiting free energies per site of the two models agree at all temperatures, their actual finite-dimensional laws still differ in terms of their zero modes in the low-temperature regime.</description>

      <title>Macroscopic flow out of a segment for Activated Random Walks in dimension 1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Activated Random Walk is a system of interacting particles which presents a phase transition and a conjectured phenomenon of self-organized criticality. In this note, we prove that, in dimension 1, in the supercritical case, when a segment is stabilized with particles being killed when they jump out of the segment, a positive fraction of the particles exits the segment with positive probability.
  This was already known to be a sufficient condition for being in the active phase of the model, and the result of this paper shows that this condition is also necessary, except maybe precisely at the critical point. This result can also be seen as a partial answer to some of the many conjectures which connect the different points of view on the phase transition of the model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This research aims to estimate three parameters in a stochastic generalized logistic differential equation. We assume the intrinsic growth rate and shape parameters are constant but unknown. To estimate these two parameters, we use the maximum likelihood method and establish that the estimators for these two parameters are strongly consistent. We estimate the diffusion parameter by using the quadratic variation processes. To test our results, we evaluate two data scenarios, complete and incomplete, with fixed values assigned to the three parameters. In the incomplete data scenario, we apply an Expectation Maximization algorithm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The pattern $(k_1, k_2, \dots, k_\ell)$ is defined to have at least $k_1$ consecutive $1$'s followed by at least $k_2$ consecutive $2$'s, $\dots$, followed by at least $k_\ell$ consecutive $\ell$'s. By iteratively applying the method that was developed previously to decouple the combinatorial complexity involved in studying complicated patterns in random sequences, the distribution of pattern $(k_1, k_2, \dots, k_\ell)$ is derived for arbitrary $\ell$. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explain how the (shifted) Ratios Conjecture for $L(s,\chi)$ would extend a randomization argument of Harper from a conductor-limited range to an unlimited range of ``beyond square-root cancellation'' for character twists of the Liouville function. As a corollary, the Liouville function would have nontrivial cancellation in arithmetic progressions of modulus just exceeding the well-known square-root barrier. Morally, the paper passes from random matrices to random multiplicative functions.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Markovian Arrivals and Service with Applications to Intermittent Overload</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04102v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Almost all queueing analysis assumes i.i.d. arrivals and service. In reality, arrival and service rates fluctuate over time. In particular, it is common for real systems to intermittently experience overload, where the arrival rate temporarily exceeds the service rate, which an i.i.d. model cannot capture. We consider the MAMS system, where the arrival and service rates each vary according to an arbitrary finite-state Markov chain, allowing intermittent overload to be modeled.
  We derive the first explicit characterization of mean queue length in the MAMS system, with explicit bounds for all arrival and service chains at all loads. Our bounds are tight in heavy traffic. We prove even stronger bounds for the important special case of two-level arrivals with intermittent overload.
  Our key contribution is an extension to the drift method, based on the novel concepts of relative arrivals and relative completions. These quantities allow us to tractably capture the transient correlational effect of the arrival and service processes on the mean queue length.</description>

      <title>Three variations of Heads or Tails Game for Bitcoin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04168v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present three very simple variants of the classic Heads or Tails game using chips, each of which contributes to our understanding of the Bitcoin protocol. The first variant addresses the issue of temporary Bitcoin forks, which occur when two miners discover blocks simultaneously. We determine the threshold at which an honest but temporarily ``Byzantine'' miner persists in mining on their fork to save his orphaned blocks. The second variant of Heads or Tails game is biased in favor of the player and helps to explain why the difficulty adjustment formula is vulnerable to attacks of Nakamoto's consensus. We derive directly and in a simple way, without relying on a Markov decision solver as was the case until now, the threshold beyond which a miner without connectivity finds it advantageous to adopt a deviant mining strategy on Bitcoin. The third variant of Heads or Tails game is unbiased and demonstrates that this issue in the Difficulty Adjustment formula can be fully rectified. Our results are in agreement with the existing literature that we clarify both qualitatively and quantitatively using very simple models and scripts that are easy to implement.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of integrals for the emptiness formation probability in the square-ice model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04358v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the emptiness formation probability (EFP) in the six-vertex model with domain wall boundary conditions. We present a conjecture according to which at the ice point, i.e., when all the Boltzmann weights are equal, the known multiple integral representation (MIR) for the EFP can be given as a finite-size matrix determinant of Fredholm type. Our conjecture is based on the explicit evaluation of the MIR for particular values of geometric parameters and on two kinds of identities for the boundary correlation function. The obtained representation can be further written as the Fredholm determinant of some linear integral operator. We show that as the geometric parameters of the EFP are tuned to the vicinity of the arctic curve arising in the scaling limit, the conjectured determinant turns into the GUE Tracy--Widom distribution.</description>

Abstract: We identify an assumption on linear forms $\phi_1, \dots, \phi_k: \mathbb{F}_p^n \to \mathbb{F}_p$ that is much weaker than approximate joint equidistribution on the Boolean cube $\{0,1\}^n$ and is in a sense almost as weak as linear independence, but which guarantees that every subset of $\{0,1\}^n$ on which none of $\phi_1, \dots, \phi_k$ has full image has a density which tends to 0 with $k$. This density is at most quasipolynomially small in $k$, a bound that is necessarily close to sharp.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04439v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper contains the probabilistic analysis of the Brownian motion on the simplest quantum graph, spider: a system of N-half axis connected only at the graph's origin by the simplest (so-called Kirchhoff's) gluing conditions. The limit theorems for the diffusion on such a graph, especially if $N \to \infty$ are significantly different from the classical case $N = 2$ (full axis). Additional results concern the properties of the spectral measure of the spider Laplacian and the corresponding generalized Fourier transforms. The continuation of the paper will contain the study of the spectrum for the class of Schr\"odinger operators on the spider graphs: Laplacian perturbed by unbounded potential and related phase transitions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the recent work of [Michelen, Perkins, Comm. Math. Phys. 399:1 (2023)], a new lower bound of $eC_{\phi}(\beta)^{-1}$ is obtained for the positive activity up to which the pressure of a classical system of particles with repulsive pair interactions is analytic. In this paper, we extend their method to the class of radially symmetric, locally stable, and tempered pair potentials. Our main result is that the pressure of such systems is analytic for positive activities up to $e^{2(1-W(eA_{\phi}(\beta)/C_{\phi}(\beta)))}C_{\phi}(\beta)^{-1}e^{-(\beta C+1)}$, where $C&gt;0$ is the local stability constant, $W(\cdot)$ the Lambert $W$-function, and $A_{\phi}(\beta)$ the contribution from the attractive part of the pair potential to the temperedness constant. In the high-temperature limit, our result improves the classical Penrose-Ruelle bound of $C_{\phi}(\beta)^{-1}e^{-(\beta C+1)}$ by a factor of $e^{2}$. This proves the absence of phase transitions in these systems in the Lee-Yang sense for activities up to the above threshold.</description>

Abstract: This paper investigates the Harnack inequality for nonnegative solutions to second-order parabolic equations in double divergence form. We impose conditions where the principal coefficients satisfy the Dini mean oscillation condition in $x$, while the drift and zeroth-order coefficients belong to specific Morrey classes. Our analysis contributes to advancing the theoretical foundations of parabolic equations in double divergence form, including Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov equations for probability densities.</description>

      <title>Real roots of random polynomials: asymptotics of the variance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.05478v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the precise leading asymptotics of the variance of the number of real roots for a large class of random polynomials, where the random coefficients have polynomial growth. Our results apply to many classical ensembles, including the Kac polynomials, hyperbolic polynomials, their derivatives, and any linear combinations of these polynomials. Prior to this paper, such asymptotics was only established for the Kac polynomials in the 1970s, with the seminal contribution of Maslova. The main ingredients of the proof are new asymptotic estimates for the two-point correlation function of the real roots, revealing geometric structures in the distribution of the real roots of these random polynomials. As a corollary, we obtain asymptotic normality for the real roots for these random polynomials, extending and strengthening a related result of O. Nguyen and V. Vu.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a new class of large structured random matrices characterized by four fundamental properties which we discuss. We prove that this class is stable under matrix-valued and pointwise non-linear operations. We then formulate an efficient method, based on an extremization problem, for computing the spectrum of subblocks of such large structured random matrices. We present different proofs -- combinatorial or algebraic -- of the validity of this method, which all have some connection with free probability. We illustrate this method with well known examples of unstructured matrices, including Haar randomly rotated matrices, as well as with the example of structured random matrices arising in the quantum symmetric simple exclusion process. tured random matrices arising in the quantum symmetric simple exclusion process.</description>

      <title>Renewal structure of the Tree Builder Random Walk</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.19190v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a class of random walks that build their own tree. At each step, the walker attaches a random number of leaves to its current position. The model can be seen as a subclass of the Random Walk in Changing Environments (RWCE) introduced by G. Amir, I. Benjamini, O. Gurel-Gurevich and G. Kozma. We develop a renewal framework for the process analogous to that established by A-S. Sznitman and M. Zerner in the context of RWRE. This provides a more robust foundation for analyzing the model. As a result of our renewal framework, we estabilish several limit theorems for the walker's distance, which include the Strong Law of Large Numbers (SLLN), the Law of the Iterated Logarithm (LIL), and the Invariance Principle, under an i.i.d. hypothesis for the walker's leaf-adding mechanism. Further, we show that the limit speed defined by the SLLN is a continuous function over the space of probability distributions on $\mathbb{N}$.</description>

      <title>Random walks on simplicial complexes</title>

Abstract: The notion of Laplacian of a graph can be generalized to simplicial complexes and hypergraphs, and contains information on the topology of these structures. Even for a graph, the consideration of associated simplicial complexes is interesting to understand its shape. Whereas the Laplacian of a graph has a simple probabilistic interpretation as the generator of a continuous time Markov chain on the graph, things are not so direct when considering simplicial complexes. We define here new Markov chains on simplicial complexes. For a given order~$k$, the state space is the set of $k$-cycles that are chains of $k$-simplexes with null boundary. This new framework is a natural generalization of the canonical Markov chains on graphs. We show that the generator of our Markov chain is the upper Laplacian defined in the context of algebraic topology for discrete structure. We establish several key properties of this new process: in particular, when the number of vertices is finite, the Markov chain is positive recurrent. This result is not trivial, since the cycles can loop over themselves an unbounded number of times. We study the diffusive limits when the simplicial complexes under scrutiny are a sequence of ever refining triangulations of the flat torus. Using the analogy between singular and Hodge homologies, we express this limit as valued in the set of currents. The proof of tightness and the identification of the limiting martingale problem make use of the flat norm and carefully controls of the error terms in the convergence of the generator. Uniqueness of the solution to the martingale problem is left open. An application to hole detection is carried.</description>

      <title>Reoptimization Nearly Solves Weakly Coupled Markov Decision Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.01961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.01961v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new policy, called the LP-update policy, to solve finite horizon weakly-coupled Markov decision processes. The latter can be seen as multi-constraint multi-action bandits, and generalize the classical restless bandit problems. Our solution is based on re-solving periodically a relaxed version of the original problem, that can be cast as a linear program (LP). When the problem is made of $N$ statistically identical sub-components, we show that the LP-update policy becomes asymptotically optimal at rate $O(T^2/\sqrt{N})$. This rate can be improved to $O(T/\sqrt{N})$ if the problem satisfies some ergodicity property and to $O(1/N)$ if the problem is non-degenerate. The definition of non-degeneracy extends the same notion for restless bandits. By using this property, we also improve the computational efficiency of the LP-update policy. We illustrate the performance of our policy on randomly generated examples, as well as a generalized applicant screening problem, and show that it outperforms existing heuristics.</description>

Abstract: We study several basic problems about colouring the $p$-random subgraph $G_p$ of an arbitrary graph $G$, focusing primarily on the chromatic number and colouring number of $G_p$. In particular, we show that there exist infinitely many $k$-regular graphs $G$ for which the colouring number (i.e., degeneracy) of $G_{1/2}$ is at most $k/3 + o(k)$ with high probability, thus disproving the natural prediction that such random graphs must have colouring number at least $k/2 - o(k)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.12352v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given an operator system $\mathcal{S}$, we define the parameters $r_k(\mathcal{S})$ (resp. $d_k(\mathcal{S})$) defined as the maximal value of the completely bounded norm of a unital $k$-positive map from an arbitrary operator system into $\mathcal{S}$ (resp. from $\mathcal{S}$ into an arbitrary operator system).
  In the case of the matrix algebras $M_n$, for $1 \leq k \leq n$, we compute the exact value $r_k(M_n) = \frac{2n-k}{k}$ and show upper and lower bounds on the parameters $d_k(M_n)$.
  Moreover, when $\mathcal{S}$ is a finite-dimensional operator system, adapting recent results of Passer and the 4th author, we show that the sequence $(r_k( \mathcal{S}))$ tends to $1$ if and only if $\mathcal{S}$ is exact and that the sequence $(d_k(\mathcal{S}))$ tends to $1$ if and only if $\mathcal{S}$ has the lifting property.</description>

Abstract: This manuscript derives locally weighted ensemble Kalman methods from the point of view of ensemble-based function approximation. This is done by using pointwise evaluations to build up a local linear or quadratic approximation of a function, tapering off the effect of distant particles via local weighting. This introduces a candidate method (the locally weighted Ensemble Kalman method for inversion) with the motivation of combining some of the strengths of the particle filter (ability to cope with nonlinear maps and non-Gaussian distributions) and the Ensemble Kalman filter (no filter degeneracy).</description>

      <title>Explicit Formula for Partial Information Decomposition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.03554v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mutual information between two random variables is a well-studied notion, whose understanding is fairly complete. Mutual information between one random variable and a pair of other random variables, however, is a far more involved notion. Specifically, Shannon's mutual information does not capture fine-grained interactions between those three variables, resulting in limited insights in complex systems. To capture these fine-grained interactions, in 2010 Williams and Beer proposed to decompose this mutual information to information atoms, called unique, redundant, and synergistic, and proposed several operational axioms that these atoms must satisfy. In spite of numerous efforts, a general formula which satisfies these axioms has yet to be found. Inspired by Judea Pearl's do-calculus, we resolve this open problem by introducing the do-operation, an operation over the variable system which sets a certain marginal to a desired value, which is distinct from any existing approaches. Using this operation, we provide the first explicit formula for calculating the information atoms so that Williams and Beer's axioms are satisfied, as well as additional properties from subsequent studies in the field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15205v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we derive estimates for the Hessian of the logarithm (log-Hessian) for solutions to the heat equation. For initial data in the form of log-Lipschitz perturbation of strongly log-concave measures, the log-Hessian admits an explicit, uniform (in space) lower bound. This yields a new estimate for the Lipschitz constant of a transport map pushing forward the standard Gaussian to a measure in this class. Further connections are discussed with score-based diffusion models and improved Gaussian logarithmic Sobolev inequalities. Finally, we show that assuming only fast decay of the tails of the initial datum does not suffice to guarantee uniform log-Hessian upper bounds.</description>
