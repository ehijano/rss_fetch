      <title>Conductive Heat Flux Driven by a Pressure Gradient in Non-Maxwellian Reference States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Standard Navier--Stokes--Fourier theory and Maxwellian-based Grad 13-moment closures yield no independent pressure-gradient driving of the conductive heat flux in an isothermal, single-component gas in the hydrodynamic (small-Knudsen) regime. This absence is specific to the Maxwellian local-equilibrium weight. We show that when the closure is constructed about a generalized class of isotropic non-Maxwellian reference weights with finite fourth moment -- characterized by a single shape parameter (a kurtosis-like moment ratio) that deforms the distribution continuously away from a Maxwellian -- the small-Knudsen constitutive reduction retains a bulk pressure-gradient (barothermal) contribution to the conductive heat flux. This mechanism predicts pressure-driven conduction as a direct kinetic signature of non-Maxwellian equilibrium moment structure.</description>

      <title>Constructing Barut-Girardello coherent states for the isotonic oscillator in the DOOT approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study the quantum system of the isotonic oscillator from the perspective of the diagonal operator ordering technique (DOOT). Within this framework, we construct the associated Barut-Girardello and Gazeau-Klauder coherent states. We examine their mathematical properties using reproducing kernels and compute the expectation values of observables that characterize the system and its relevant physical features. Further, we perform the quantization of main classical variables in the complex plane. Then, by exploring the thermal behavior of the physical system in the constructed coherent states, we analyze the properties of mixed states described by a canonical density operator. We also obtain the corresponding Glauber-Sudarshan P-representation.</description>

      <title>Lorentz-boosted diffusion: initial value formulation and exact solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well known that the diffusion equation, when treated as a stand-alone partial differential equation, exhibits exponential instabilities in boosted frames, which render the corresponding initial-value problem ill-posed. Recently, however, it was shown that Fick-type diffusion arises as the exact hydrodynamic sector of relativistic Fokker-Planck kinetic theory. In this work, we exploit this kinetic embedding to formulate a modified initial-value problem for one-dimensional Lorentz-boosted diffusion. We show that the resulting dynamics are well posed both forward and backward in time, provided the boosted density profiles admit a kinetic-theory realization. Such profiles form a space of band-limited functions, within which the evolution can be expressed as a discrete superposition of spatially sampled initial data, weighted by a Shannon-Whittaker-type Green function defined on the full Minkowski plane. The Green function is obtained in closed analytic form.</description>

      <title>A kinetic interpretation of thermomechanical restrictions of continua</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rajagopal and Srinivasa's thermodynamic framework derives constitutive relations in continuum mechanics from two scalar functions describing energy storage and entropy production via a constrained optimization principle. In parallel, kinetic theory obtains constitutive laws through moment closure, most notably via the Chapman-Enskog expansion.
  In this work we establish a connection between these approaches by providing a kinetic interpretation of the Rajagopal-Srinivasa principle of maximal entropy production. For Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook-type kinetics, we show that this principle is equivalent to a minimal relaxation-time principle, selecting among admissible constitutive responses the one with the fastest compatible relaxation toward equilibrium.
  We show how the caloric equation of state, entropy balance, and entropy production can be computed from kinetic theory, and we propose a hybrid methodology in which the Chapman--Enskog expansion is used only to compute entropy production and equilibrium thermodynamic relations, while full constitutive closures are obtained through constrained optimization. The proposed hybrid Chapman-Enskog-Rajagopal-Srinivasa approach recovers the standard Euler and Navier-Stokes-Fourier constitutive laws for monatomic gases. We demonstrate how different choices of selection procedure can be more informative than the classical Chapman-Enskog closure in the context of an inviscid compressible Leslie-Ericksen model arising in liquid crystals.</description>

      <title>Normal-ordered equivalent of the Weyl ordering of $\hat{q}^j \hat{p}^k$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problem of quantizing a bivariate dynamical system can be reduced to evaluating the ordering of $\hat{q}^j \hat{p}^k$. Here, we consider the Weyl ordering of $\hat{q}^j \hat{p}^k$ that is then expressed in term of the annihilation $\hat{a}$ and creation $\hat{a}^\dagger$ operator. The explicit formula for the normal-ordered equivalent (all $\hat{a}^\dagger$'s preceeding all $\hat{a}$'s) of the resulting expression is then given, and some relations are discussed.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the ground-state of a Fermi gas with short range attrative interactions in one or two dimensions. N fermions are placed in a confining potential, and interact with each other through a negative potential, whose range is larger than the typical distance between particles. We show the convergence of the ground state energy of the Hamiltonian to a Thomas-Fermi energy in the large N limit. Furthermore, we prove convergence of the ground states, in the sense of their Husimi functions.</description>

      <title>On some mathematical problems for open quantum systems with varying particle number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive the effective Hamiltonian $H - \mu N$ for open quantum systems with varying particle number from first principles within the framework of non-relativistic quantum statistical mechanics. We prove that under physically motivated assumptions regarding the size of the system and the range of the interaction, this form of the Hamiltonian is unique up to a constant. Our argument relies firstly on establishing a rigorous version of the surface-to-volume ratio approximation, which is routinely used in an empirical form in statistical mechanics, and secondly on showing that the Hilbert space for systems with varying particle number must be isomorphic to Fock space. Together, these findings provide a rigorous mathematical justification for the standard grand canonical formalism employed in statistical physics.</description>

      <title>Particle, kinetic and hydrodynamic models for sea ice floes. Part II: Rotating floes with nonlinear contact forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper extends the multiscale modeling framework introduced in Part I (Deng and Ha, Physica D: Nonlinear Phenomena 483 (2025) 134951) for sea-ice floe dynamics with non-rotating floes to the case with rotational floes and nonlinear contact interactions. Building on the particle-kinetic-hydrodynamic hierarchy developed for non-rotating floes, we generalize the particle model to describe ice floes as rigid bodies characterized by position, linear velocity, angular velocity, size, and moment of inertia. The interaction rules now include nonlinear contact forces and torques arising from short-range compression, restitution, and tangential friction laws, together with hydrodynamic drag that couples translational and rotational motions. These particle descriptions lead to an enriched Vlasov-type kinetic equation posed on an extended phase space, whose moments yield a hydrodynamic system for mass, momentum, and angular-momentum balances. Compared with Part I, the resulting macroscopic equations feature additional stress contributions, rotational transport, and dissipative mechanisms stemming from nonlinear collisions. The proposed framework provides a more realistic description of sea-ice floe dynamics and offers a systematic pathway toward multiscale modeling of sea-ice rheology under complex environmental forcing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.22060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an approach to construct three-dimensional lattice models using line defects in state integral models on shaped triangulations of 3-manifolds. The Boltzmann weights for these models satisfy a variant of the tetrahedron equation, which implies integrability under suitable assumptions on R-matrices and transfer matrices. As an explicit example, we present a solution produced by Teichm\"uller TQFT.</description>

      <title>Detecting Higher Berry Phase via Boundary Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Higher Berry phase has recently been proposed to study the topology of the space of gapped many-body quantum systems. In this work, we develop a boundary-scattering approach to detect higher Berry phases in one-dimensional gapped free-fermion systems. By coupling a gapless lead to the gapped system, we demonstrate that the higher Berry invariant can be obtained by studying the higher winding number of the boundary reflection matrix. The resulting topological invariant is robust against perturbations such as disorder. Our approach establishes a connection between higher Berry invariants and transport properties, thereby providing a potentially experimentally accessible probe of parametrized topological phases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.21323v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ermakov has shown how the solution to the classical harmonic oscillator in one spatial dimension with general time-dependent frequency can be reduced to the time-independent case and an associated nonlinear ordinary differential equation, an analysis which has been applied to the Schr\"odinger equation as well. We extend this analysis to the Landau problem of a charged particle in a uniform magnetic field in two dimensions and construct the generalized Laughlin wave functions for the case when the magnetic field is time-dependent. We also work out the dynamics of density fluctuations (the Girvin, MacDonald, Platzman or GMP mode) and argue that it is possible to tune the frequency of the magnetic field to obtain a compressible droplet of fermions. We also analyze the dynamics of the edge modes of the droplet for the integer Hall effect.</description>

      <title>Geometry of two- and three-dimensional integrable systems related to affine Weyl groups $W(E_8^{(1)})$ and $W(E_7^{(1)})$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21391v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We find a general framework for the construction of birational involutions on two- and three-dimensional varieties obtained from $\mathbb P^2$, $\mathbb P^1\times \mathbb P^1$, and $\mathbb P^3$ by blow-up at nine, respectively eight points. Each such involution is based on a divisor class with a one-dimensional linear system with a generic element of genus zero. Classical Manin involutions represent the simplest particular case. Novel, more sophisticated cases identified here include birational involutions of $\mathbb P^2$ along conics and along nodal cubic curves, as well as birational involutions of $\mathbb P^3$ along quadratic cones and along Cayley nodal cubic surfaces. We prove a general formula for the induced action of geometric birational involutions on the respective Picard group, and give a general result about decomposition of translational elements of the respective affine Weyl group of symmetries into a product of two geometric birational involutions.</description>

      <title>Resurgence and Hyperasymptotics in Wave Optics Astronomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the discovery of gravitational waves and fast radio bursts, wave optics has become increasingly relevant in astrophysics. This paper studies the behaviour of random gravitational and plasma lenses, presenting the refractive and diffractive expansions, with higher-order terms that allow error estimates and embody the counterintuitive resurgence phenomenon.
  Specifically, we show that the diffractive expansion converges for a broad class of bounded lens models and provides an efficient description of interference patterns across frequency regimes. Next, building on Picard-Lefschetz techniques, we derive the full refractive expansion to arbitrary order, organising it into a transseries. Near caustics, the standard transseries is supplemented with uniform asymptotics. We study this transseries, with both Borel and hyperasymptotic resummation yielding systematic approximations to lensing integrals at all frequencies. Our results give a framework for modelling wave optics lensing near caustics and beyond the geometric optics approximation and thereby illustrate how tools from resurgence and asymptotic analysis can be applied to practical problems in astrophysics.
  Near caustic singularities, the post-refractive corrections diverge, while the uniform asymptotic expansion becomes accurate. We use the leading uniform approximation to derive the strong wave optics suppression of off-axis caustics, which clarifies their subdominant role.</description>

      <title>Confinement-Induced Symmetry Breaking of Active Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The actomyosin cortex, a thin layer of a cross-linked polymer network near the cell surface, generates active forces that are responsible for cell shape changes. Many developmental processes that involve such cell shape changes, most prominently embryonic cell division, are spatially confined by eggshells. To investigate the potential role of confinement in redirecting active stresses and enabling symmetry breaking phenomena during cell shape transformations, we study a hydrodynamic minimal model in which the cell cortex is represented as an active fluid surface that undergoes symmetric division in the absence of confinement. When enclosed by an ellipsoidal shell, a spontaneous symmetry-breaking transition emerges at a critical degree of confinement, where symmetrically dividing surfaces become unstable and polarized geometries appear. We show that this transition is controlled by the tightness of the confinement and analyze the solution space of stationary surfaces to identify the mechanisms underlying confinement-induced symmetry breaking.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.21541v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an exact integral formula for the multi-particle propagator of the one-dimensional Fermi--Hubbard model on an infinite lattice. The proof is based on the nested Bethe ansatz without relying on the string hypothesis. Our formula enables an explicit integral representation of the time evolution of arbitrary finite-particle wave functions and thereby provides a foundation for the exact analysis of nonequilibrium dynamics in the Hubbard model. It can further be applied to related open quantum models.</description>

      <title>Phase transitions in the charged compact abelian lattice Higgs model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21679v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the (compact) abelian lattice Higgs model with charge \( k \geq 1 \) and show, using charged Wilson~loop observables and charged versions of the Marcu--Fredenhagen ratio, that this model exhibits several distinct phase transitions. In particular, we show that if \(k = 2\), then the Marcu--Fredenhagen ratio and Wilson~loop observables together can distinguish among three distinct phases of the parameter space, and hence both can be used as order parameters for the model.</description>

      <title>Spectral entropy of the discrete Hasimoto effective potential exposes sub-residue geometric transitions in protein secondary structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21787v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Characterizing the geometric boundaries of protein secondary structures is fundamental to understanding macromolecular folding. By applying the discrete Hasimoto map to translate backbone geometry into a one-dimensional discrete nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger potential $V_{\mathrm{re}}[n]$, we establish a frequency-domain framework for protein conformations. Short-time Fourier transform analysis across 320,453 residues from 1,986 non-redundant proteins defines a local spectral entropy $H_{\mathrm{spec}}$ that consistently orders structural states. Helical segments emerge as narrow-band low-entropy regimes dominated by zero-frequency components, whereas coils manifest as broadband noise. We demonstrate that boundaries separating these states exhibit step-like sharpness characteristic of a first-order-like geometric transition with a sub-residue median width of 0.145 residues. This abrupt kinematic transition provides a spatial counterpart to the cooperative Zimm--Bragg thermodynamic model of helix nucleation. The extreme spatial narrowness exposes an intrinsic limitation governed by the Gabor uncertainty principle, explaining why the pointwise integrability residual $E[n]$ acts as an effective high-pass filter for boundary detection. Guided by this limit we introduce a dual-probe approach combining the high-pass residual for local torsion discontinuities with a low-frequency energy ratio $R_{\mathrm{LF}}$ measuring the DC-dominated flatness of helical interiors. Unifying these complementary signals improves the detection area under the curve from 0.783 to 0.815. Because high-entropy broadband regions coincide with the flexible loops and hinges implicated in allostery, the spectral entropy of the Hasimoto potential may serve as a sequence-agnostic geometric proxy for mapping functional dynamics from backbone coordinates.</description>

      <title>Imperfect Graphs from Unitary Matrices -- I</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.21808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Matrix representations of quantum operators are computationally complete but often obscure the structural topology of information flow within a quantum circuit \cite{nielsen2000}. In this paper, we introduce a generalized graph-theoretic framework for analyzing quantum operators by mapping unitary matrices to directed graphs; we term these structures \emph{Imperfect Graphs} or more formally as \emph{Topological Structure of Superpositions}(TSS) as a tool to devise better Quantum Algorithms. In this framework, we represent computational basis states as vertices. A directed edge exists between two vertices if and only if there is a non-zero amplitude transition between them, effectively mapping the support of the unitary operator. In this paper we deliberately discard probability amplitudes and phase information to isolate the connectivity and reachability properties of the operator. We demonstrate how TSS intuitively helps describe gates such as the Hadamard, Pauli-(X,Y,Z) gates, etc \cite{nielsen2000}. This framework provides a novel perspective for viewing quantum circuits as discrete dynamical systems \cite{childs2009,aharonov2001}

      <title>Computing Nonequilibrium Transport from Short-Time Transients: From Lorentz Gas to Heat Conduction in One Dimensional Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21901v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We test the Transient Time Correlation Function (TTCF) method to compute nonequilibrium transport coefficients, highlighting its conceptual and practical difference from the standard time-average approach. While time averages extract transport properties from long stationary trajectories and discard transient dynamics, TTCF adopts the complementary strategy: it exploits the information contained in short-time transients following the onset of an external perturbation, while discarding the long-time evolution once stationarity is reached. We revisit the theoretical framework of TTCF and assess its numerical performance through representative case studies, the Lorentz gas and a many-body system, namely a chain of oscillators with anharmonic pinning potential. By direct comparison with time averages, we show that for the Lorentz gas TTCF yields consistent transport coefficients in both linear and nonlinear regimes at a reduced computational cost. Moreover, the TTCF displays superior precision in the linear-response regime, and remains reliable in non-ergodic situations, revealing the presence of regions of phase space corresponding to different behaviors, as well as the possibility of phase transitions. For the anharmonic chain, we show that TTCF is a scalable and efficient alternative for the numerical study of nonequilibrium transport.</description>

      <title>Fractal dimension of singular times for SPDEs: Energy bounds, criticality, and weak-strong uniqueness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21981v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For several physically relevant SPDEs, it is known that global weak solutions coexist with local strong ones. Typically, weak-strong uniqueness results are known, and ensure that the global and strong solutions coincide as long as the latter exist. Times at which a weak solution does not coincide with a strong one are called singular times. Determining their fractal dimension is fundamental to capturing the regularity of weak solutions.
  We define singular times for a wide class of semilinear SPDEs. We show that sets of singular times have fractal dimension (i.e., Hausdorff and/or Minkowski) at most $ 1-\ell\, \mathsf{Exc}$, where $\ell$ and $\mathsf{Exc}$ are the time integrability and the excess of spatial regularity compared to the critical regularity of the energy bound associated with weak solutions, respectively. Moreover, their corresponding $(1-\ell\,\mathsf{Exc} )$-dimensional measure is zero. We formulate and apply our theory to quenched strong Leray-Hopf solutions of 3D Navier-Stokes equations (NSEs) with physically relevant noises, including rough Kraichnan and Lie transport. In particular, we extend the fundamental $1/2$-dimensional bound of Leray and Scheffer on singular times for 3D NSEs to the stochastic setting, and we prove new conditional results under supercritical Serrin's conditions, irrespective of the roughness of the noise. Our framework is new even in the deterministic case, and provides the first partial regularity results for weak solutions to SPDEs with multiplicative noise.</description>

      <title>Spin chains for ADE quiver theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.22065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spectral problem of four-dimensional superconformal quiver gauge theories can be mapped to one-dimensional spin chains with restricted Hilbert spaces, where the composition of neighbouring spins follows the path algebra of the quiver. To better understand such spin chains, we compute the one-loop planar dilatation operator for the 4d N=2 ADE quiver gauge theories obtained by orbifolding the N=4 Super-Yang-Mills theory and marginally deforming by independently varying the gauge couplings. This extends previous work which was mainly focused on the Z2 quiver. We characterise the general features of the resulting ADE spin-chain models and construct the 2-magnon Bethe ansatz for holomorphic states. We also evaluate, at large N, the N=2 superconformal index of these gauge theories and use it to study their protected spectrum in specific sectors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.22104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The conditions under which stochastic systems of infinitely many interacting particles can maintain sufficient spatial order to move coherently along a time-periodic orbit, thereby breaking the time-translation invariance of the underlying dynamical equation, have been an elusive issue. Via a free energy technique, we prove that if a non-reversible interacting particle system on $\mathbb{Z}^d$, $d=1,2$, with strictly positive rates admits a product measure as a stationary measure, then it cannot exhibit time-periodic behaviour. This provides a first step towards a general conjecture that time-periodic behaviour cannot occur in one- and two-dimensional systems with short-range interactions and constitutes the first result for non-reversible dynamics in dimension two.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional Coulomb gases with multiple outposts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22184v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study two-dimensional Coulomb gases in the presence of $m\in\mathbb{N}_{&gt;0}$ outposts. An outpost is a connected component of the coincidence set that lies outside the droplet.
  The case $m=1$ was previously investigated by Ameur, Charlier, and Cronvall. They showed that, as the total number of particles in the Coulomb gas tends to infinity, the number of particles accumulating near the outpost remains of order one and converges in distribution to the Heine distribution.
  In this work, we extend this analysis to the case of an arbitrary but fixed number $m$ of outposts. We prove that the joint distribution of the numbers of particles near the outposts converges to a multidimensional Heine distribution. Our results reveal a interesting phenomenon: although the outposts are geometrically disconnected, the particle count near each outpost is strongly correlated with the particle counts near all other outposts, not only the nearest ones (provided the outposts are not separated by a component of the droplet).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.22199v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $i$-dimensional Potts lattice Higgs model is a random assignment of spins in $\mathbb{Z}_q$ to the $i$-dimensional cells of a cell complex induced by a Hamiltonian with a Potts interaction on the $(i+1)$-cells and an additional term playing the role of an external field. We develop a representation of this model as a pair of dependent plaquette percolations, and prove that Wilson line expectations can be expressed in terms of the probability of a topological event. As an application, we prove the existence of a phase transition for the Marcu--Fredenhagen ratio in the Potts lattice Higgs model on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ when $i=1.$</description>

      <title>Controlled jump in the Clifford hierarchy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.22201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a simple and systematic route to higher levels of the qubit Clifford hierarchy by coherently controlling Clifford operations. Our approach is based on Pauli periodicity, defined for a Clifford unitary $U$ as the smallest integer $m\ge 1$ such that $U^{2^{m}}$ is a Pauli operator up to phase. We prove a sharp controlled-jump rule showing that the controlled gate $CU$ lies strictly in level $m+2$ of the hierarchy, and equivalently that $CU$ lies in level $k$ if $U^{2^{k-2}}$ is Pauli while no smaller positive power of $U$ is Pauli. We further quantify the resources required to realize large level jumps in the Clifford hierarchy by proving an essentially tight upper bound on Pauli periodicity as a function of the number of qubits, which implies that accessing high hierarchy levels through controlled Cliffords requires a number of target qubits that grows exponentially with the desired level. We complement this limitation with explicit infinite families of Pauli-periodic Cliffords whose controlled versions achieve asymptotically optimal jumps. As an application, we propose a protocol for preparing logical catalyst states that enable logical $Z^{1/2^k}$ phase gates via phase kickback from a single jumped Clifford.</description>

      <title>Quantum jumps in open cavity optomechanics and Liouvillian versus Hamiltonian exceptional points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22205v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exceptional points, where two or more eigenstates of a non-Hermitian system coalesce, are now of interest across many fields of physics, from the perspective of open-system dynamics, sensing, nonreciprocal transport, and topological phase transitions. In this work, we investigate exceptional points in cavity optomechanics, a platform of interest to diverse communities working on gravitational-wave detection, macroscopic quantum mechanics, quantum transduction, etc. Specifically, we clarify the role of quantum jumps in making a clear distinction between Liouvillian and Hamiltonian exceptional points in optomechanical systems. While the Liouvillian exceptional point arises from the unconditional Lindblad dynamics and is independent of the phonon-bath temperature, the Hamiltonian exceptional point emerges from the conditional no-jump evolution and acquires a thermal shift due to an enhanced conditional damping. Employing the thermofield formalism, we derive a unified spectral framework that interpolates between these regimes via an analytical hybrid-Liouvillian description. Remarkably, in the weak-quantum-jump regime, the exceptional point is perturbed only at the second order, highlighting the robustness of the Hamiltonian exceptional point under small hybrid perturbations. Our work reveals a continuous family of hybrid exceptional points, clarifies the operational and physical differences between the conditional and unconditional dissipative dynamics in optomechanical systems, and provides a probe for thermal baths.</description>

Abstract: We study the Dirac spectrum in a sine-Gordon soliton background, where the induced position-dependent mass reduces the spectral problem to a Heun-type differential equation. Bound and scattering sectors are treated within a unified framework, with spectral data encoded in Wronskians matching local Heun solutions and exhibiting explicit dependence on the soliton parameters and the bare fermion mass. This formulation enables a systematic analysis of spinor bound and scattering states, supported by analytic and numerical verification of wave function matching across the soliton domain. The present work is related to arXiv:2512.07658 and emphasizes a pedagogical treatment of scattering states within the Heun-equation formalism.</description>

Abstract: We study perfect matchings on the rail-yard graphs in which the right boundary condition is given by the empty partition and the left boundary can be divided into finitely many alternating line segments where all the vertices along each line segment are either removed or remained. When the edge weights satisfy certain conditions, we show that the distributions of the locations of certain types of dimers near the right boundary converge to the spectra of independent GUE minor processes. The proof is based on new quantitative analysis of a formula to compute Schur functions at general points discovered in \cite{ZL18}.</description>

      <title>Bridging Classical and Quantum Information Scrambling with the Operator Entanglement Spectrum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05575v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Universal features of chaotic quantum dynamics underlie our understanding of thermalization in closed quantum systems and the complexity of quantum computations. Reversible automaton circuits, comprised of classical logic gates, have emerged as a tractable means to study such dynamics. Despite generating no entanglement in the computational basis, these circuits nevertheless capture many features expected from fully quantum evolutions. In this work, we demonstrate that the differences between automaton dynamics and fully quantum dynamics are revealed by the operator entanglement spectrum, much like the entanglement spectrum of a quantum state distinguishes between the dynamics of states under Clifford and Haar random circuits. While the operator entanglement spectrum under random unitary dynamics is governed by the eigenvalue statistics of random Gaussian matrices, we show evidence that under random automaton dynamics it is described by the statistics of Bernoulli random matrices, whose entries are random variables taking values $0$ or $1$. We study the crossover between automaton and generic unitary operator dynamics as the automaton circuit is doped with gates that introduce superpositions, namely Hadamard or $R_x = e^{-i\frac{\pi}{4}X}$ gates. We find that a constant number of superposition-generating gates is sufficient to drive the operator dynamics to the random-circuit universality class, similar to earlier results on Clifford circuits doped with $T$ gates. This establishes the operator entanglement spectrum as a useful tool for probing the chaoticity and universality class of quantum dynamics.</description>

      <title>Radiation-Reaction on the Straight-Line Motion of a Point Charge accelerated by a constant applied Electric Field in an Electromagnetic Bopp-Land\'e-Thomas-Podolsky vacuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08799v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The radiation-reaction problem of standard Lorentz electrodynamics with point charges is pathological, standing in contrast to Bopp--Land\'e--Thomas--Podolsky (BLTP) electrodynamics where it is in fact well-defined and calculable, as reported in a previous publication. To demonstrate the viability of BLTP electrodynamics, we consider the BLTP analogue of the radiation reaction of a classical point charge accelerated from rest by a static homogeneous capacitor plate field, and calculate it up to $O(\varkappa^4)$ in a formal expansion about $\varkappa=0$ in powers of $\varkappa$, Bopp's reciprocal length, a new electrodynamics parameter introduced by BLTP theory. In a paper by Carley and Kiessling (arXiv:2303.01720 [physics.class-ph]) the radiation-reaction corrections to test-particle motion were explicitly computed to $O(\varkappa^3)$, the first non-vanishing order. In this article a crucial question regarding this ``small-$\varkappa$'' expansion, raised by Carley and Kiessling, is answered as follows: The motions computed with terms $O(\varkappa^3)$ included are mathematically accurate approximations to {physically reasonable} solutions of the actual BLTP initial value problem for short times $t$, viz. when $\varkappa c t \ll 1$, where $c$ is the speed of light in vacuo, but their unphysical behavior over {much} longer times does not accurately approximate the actual BLTP solutions even when the dimensionless parameter $\varkappa e^2 / |m_b| c^2 \ll 1$, where $e$ is the elementary charge and $m_b$ the bare rest mass of the electron. This has the important implication that BLTP electrodynamics remains a viable contender for an accurate classical electrodynamics with point charges that does not suffer from the infinite self-interaction problems of textbook Lorentz electrodynamics with point charges.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10130v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we give a detailed proof of the classification of extremal (=massless) unitary highest weight representations in the Neveu Schwarz and Ramond sectors of the big $N=4$ superconformal algebra which can be found in [5]. Our results agree with the general conjectures about classification of unitary highest weight representation of minimal $W$-algebras attached to basic Lie superalgebras formulated in [10], [11], and complete their proof for the big $N=4$ superconformal algebra.</description>

      <title>Matrix Correlators as Discrete Volumes of Moduli Space I: Recursion Relations, the BMN-limit and DSSYK</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17728v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show certain correlators in generic one-matrix models define a notion of ``discrete'' volumes of the moduli space of Riemann surfaces, generalizing the connection between random matrices and JT gravity. We prove they obey a discrete, Mirzakhani-like recursion relation. Their fundamental discreteness crucially relies upon studying these matrix integrals away from the usual double-scaling limit. In a BMN-like limit of large traces, this recursion universally goes over to a continuous one, and the correlators asymptote to the volumes of Kontsevich. Finally, we demonstrate that the ETH matrix integral for DSSYK furnishes a discrete, $q$-analog of the Weil--Petersson volumes, thereby proving a conjecture due to K. Okuyama.</description>

      <title>Deriving the Generalised Born Rule from First Principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21355v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A basic postulate of modern compositional approaches to generalised physical theories is the generalised Born rule, in which probabilities are postulated to be computable from the composition of states and effects. In this paper we consider whether this postulate, and the strength of the identification between scalars and probabilities, can be argued from basic principles. To this end, we first consider the most naive possible process- theoretic interpretation of textbook quantum theory, in which physical processes (unitaries) along with states and effects (kets and bras) and a probability function from states and effects satisfying just some basic compatibility axioms are identified. We then show that any process theory equipped with such structure is equivalent to an alternative process theory in which the generalised Born rule holds. We proceed to consider introduction of noise into any such theory, and observe that the result of doing so is a strengthening of the identification between scalars and probabilities; from bare monoid homomorphisms to semiring isomorphisms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07635v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a factorization algebra, via the factorization envelope, starting from a Lie conformal algebra, and prove that the associated vertex algebra is isomorphic to its enveloping vertex algebra. Our construction generalizes the Kac--Moody factorization algebra of Costello--Gwilliam and the Virasoro factorization algebra of Williams. Moreover, by considering the super analogue of this construction, we obtain new factorization algebras corresponding to vertex superalgebras, such as the Neveu--Schwarz vertex superalgebra and the $N=2$ vertex superalgebra.</description>

      <title>The Self-Duality Equations on a Riemann Surface and Four-Dimensional Chern-Simons Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05309v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a Lagrangian formulation of Hitchin's self-duality equations on a Riemann surface $\Sigma$ using potentials for the connection and Higgs field. This two-dimensional action is then obtained from a four-dimensional Chern-Simons theory on $\Sigma\times \mathbb{CP}^1$ with an appropriate choice of meromorphic 1-form on $\mathbb{CP}^1$ and boundary conditions at its poles. We show that the symplectic structure induced by the four-dimensional theory coincides with the canonical symplectic form on the Hitchin moduli space in the complex structure corresponding to the moduli space of Higgs bundles. We further provide a direct construction of Hitchin Hamiltonians in terms of the four-dimensional gauge field. Exploiting the freedom in the choice of the meromorphic one-form, we construct a family of four-dimensional Chern-Simons theories depending on a $\mathbb{CP}^1$-valued parameter. Upon reduction to two dimensions, these descend to a corresponding family of two-dimensional actions on $\Sigma$ whose field equations are again Hitchin's equations. Furthermore, we obtain a family of symplectic structures from our family of four-dimensional theories and show that they agree with the hyperk\"ahler family of symplectic forms on the Hitchin moduli space, thereby identifying the $\mathbb{CP}^1$-valued parameter with the twistor parameter of the Hitchin moduli space. Our results place Hitchin's equations and their integrable structure within the framework of four-dimensional Chern-Simons theory and make the role of the twistor parameter manifest.</description>

      <title>Quantum Zeno-like Paradox for Position Measurements: A Particle Precisely Found in Space is Nowhere to be Found in Hilbert Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19469v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: On a quantum particle in the unit interval $[0,1]$, perform a position measurement with inaccuracy $1/n$ and then a quantum measurement of the projection $|\phi\rangle\langle\phi|$ with some arbitrary but fixed normalized $\phi$. Call the outcomes $X \in[0,1]$ and $Y \in\{0,1\}$. We show that in the limit $n\to\infty$ corresponding to perfect precision for $X$, the probability of $Y=1$ tends to 0 for every $\phi$. Since there is no density matrix, pure or mixed, which upon measurement of any $|\phi\rangle\langle\phi|$ yields outcome 1 with probability 0, our result suggests that a novel type of quantum state beyond Hilbert space is necessary to describe a quantum particle after a perfect position measurement.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Lorentz Mirror Model: Normal Transport and a Universal $2/3$ Mean--Variance Law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07988v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Lorentz mirror model provides a clean setting to study macroscopic transport generated solely by quenched environmental randomness. We introduce a hierarchical version whose distribution of left--right crossings satisfies an exact recursion. In dimensions $d\geq 3$, we prove normal transport: the mean conductance scales as (cross-section)/(length) on all length scales. A Gaussian closure, supported by numerics, predicts that the variance-to-mean ratio of the conductance converges to the universal value $2/3$ for all $d\geq 2$ (the ``$2/3$ law''). We provide numerical evidence for the $2/3$ law in the original (non-hierarchical) Lorentz mirror model in $d=3$, and conjecture that it is a universal signature of normal transport induced by random current matching. In the marginal case $d=2$, our hierarchical recursion reproduces the known scaling of the mean conductance and its variance.

      <title>Topology optimization of type-II superconductors with superconductor-dielectric/vacuum interfaces based on Ginzburg-Landau theory under Weyl gauge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14261v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Geometrical design is a crucial and challenging strategy for improving the performance of type-II superconductors, because the proper placement of intended defects in the current path contribute to flux pinning, a reduction in dissipation, and an increase in achievable current density. Topology optimization is currently one of the most powerful approaches used to determine consistent structural geometries. Therefore, a topology optimization approach is presented to inversely design structural geometries of low- and high-temperature type-II superconductors with superconductor-dielectric/vacuum interfaces. In the presented approach, the magnetic response of type-II superconductors is modeled using the Ginzburg-Landau theory, where the temporal evolution of the order parameter and vector potential is described by the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equations under the Weyl gauge.</description>
