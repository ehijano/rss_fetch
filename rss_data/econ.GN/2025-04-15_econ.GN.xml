      <title>Mensura\c{c}\~ao da Transfer\^encia de Riqueza em Planos de Contribui\c{c}\~ao Definida com a Marca\c{c}\~ao de Ativos na Curva</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The methodology for measuring financial assets in defined contribution (DC) pension plans has significant implications whether wealth transfers will occur among participants. In December 2024, a regulatory act was issued for Closed Pension Entities, allowing the use of the hold-to-maturity (HTM) measurement method of treasury bonds in DC plans. This article quantifies the financial impact on participants of adopting HTM valuation in these plans, using real data from the term structure of the real interest rates to assess the resulting wealth transfers. The analysis highlights how HTM valuation creates asymmetries in financial outcomes, benefiting some participants at the expense of others. Wealth transfers occur both during any withdrawal of funds and at the time of contributions, including portfolio reallocations that involve buying or selling bonds. Partial use of HTM or attempts to immunize outflows do not completely eliminate wealth transfers. The results reinforce that the use of mark-to-market (MTM) valuation of assets in DC plans prevents wealth transfers and, consequently, financial losses for participants.
O m\'etodo de mensura\c{c}\~ao de ativos financeiros em planos de previd\^encia na modalidade de contribui\c{c}\~ao definida (CD, ou contribui\c{c}\~ao vari\'avel CV, na fase de acumula\c{c}\~ao) tem implica\c{c}\~oes significativas se haver\'a transfer\^encia de riqueza entre os participantes. Em Dez/2024 foi publicada norma para as Entidades Fechadas de Previd\^encia Complementar possibilitando o uso da marca\c{c}\~ao na curva de t\'itulos p\'ublicos federais nos planos CD e CV na fase de acumula\c{c}\~ao. Este artigo quantifica o impacto financeiro nos participantes da ado\c{c}\~ao da marca\c{c}\~ao na curva (HTM {\it Hold to Maturity}) nestes planos, utilizando dados reais da estrutura a termo da taxa de juros de cupom de IPCA para avaliar as transfer\^encias de riqueza resultantes dessa ado\c{c}\~ao. A an\'alise evidencia como a marca\c{c}\~ao na curva gera assimetrias nos resultados financeiros, beneficiando alguns participantes em detrimento de outros. As transfer\^encias de riqueza ocorrem tanto em qualquer retirada de recursos quanto tamb\'em na entrada (contribui\c{c}\~oes), inclusive realoca\c{c}\~oes da carteira que impliquem venda ou compra de t\'itulos. O uso do HTM de forma parcial ou a tentativa de imuniza\c{c}\~ao de sa\'idas n\~ao eliminam por completo transfer\^encias de riqueza. Os resultados refor\c{c}am que, para fins de cotiza\c{c}\~ao, o uso da marca\c{c}\~ao a mercado (MTM {\it Mark to Market}) de ativos em planos CD (e CV na fase de diferimento) evita transfer\^encias de riqueza e, por consequ\^encia, preju\'izos financeiros aos seus participantes.</description>

      <title>Structural robustness of the international food supply network under external shocks and its determinants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stability of the global food supply network is critical for ensuring food security. This study constructs an aggregated international food supply network based on the trade data of four staple crops and evaluates its structural robustness through network integrity under accumulating external shocks. Network integrity is typically quantified in network science by the relative size of the largest connected component, and we propose a new robustness metric that incorporates both the broadness p and severity q of external shocks. Our findings reveal that the robustness of the network has gradually increased over the past decades, punctuated by temporary declines that can be explained by major historical events. While the aggregated network remains robust under moderate disruptions, extreme shocks targeting key suppliers such as the United States and India can trigger systemic collapse. When the shock broadness p is less than about 0.3 and the shock severity q is close to 1, the structural robustness curves S(p,q) decrease linearly with respect to the shock broadness p, suggesting that the most critical economies have relatively even influence on network integrity. Comparing the robustness curves of the four individual staple foods, we find that the soybean supply network is the least robust. Furthermore, regression and machine learning analyses show that increaseing food (particularly rice and soybean) production enhances network robustness, while rising food prices significantly weaken it.</description>

      <title>What should the encroaching supplier do in markets with some loyal customers? A Stackelberg Game Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Considering a supply chain with partial vertical integration, we attempt to seek answers to several questions related to the cooperation competition based friction, abundant in such networks. Such an SC can represent a supplier with an inhouse production unit that attempts to control an outhouse production unit via the said friction. The two production units can have different sets of loyal customer bases and the aim of the manufacturer supplier duo would be to get the best out of the two customer bases. Our analysis shows that under certain market conditions, an optimal strategy might be to allow both units to earn positive profits particularly when they hold similar market power and when customer loyalty is high. In cases of weaker customer loyalty, however, the optimal approach may involve pressurizing the outhouse unit to operate at minimal profits. Even more intriguing is the scenario where the outhouse unit has a greater market power and customer loyalty remains strong here, it may be optimal for the inhouse unit to operate at a loss just enough to dismantle the downstream monopoly.</description>

      <title>Agentic Workflows for Economic Research: Design and Implementation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a methodology based on agentic workflows for economic research that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and multimodal AI to enhance research efficiency and reproducibility. Our approach features autonomous and iterative processes covering the entire research lifecycle--from ideation and literature review to economic modeling and data processing, empirical analysis and result interpretation--with strategic human oversight. The workflow architecture comprises specialized agents with clearly defined roles, structured inter-agent communication protocols, systematic error escalation pathways, and adaptive mechanisms that respond to changing research demand. Human-in-the-loop (HITL) checkpoints are strategically integrated to ensure methodological validity and ethical compliance. We demonstrate the practical implementation of our framework using Microsoft's open-source platform, AutoGen, presenting experimental examples that highlight both the current capabilities and future potential of agentic workflows in improving economic research.</description>

      <title>To Buy an Electric Vehicle or Not? A Bayesian Analysis of Consumer Intent in the United States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) is considered critical to achieving climate goals, yet it hinges on consumer interest. This study explores how public intent to purchase EVs relates to four unexamined factors: exposure to EV information, perceptions of EVs' environmental benefits, views on government climate policy, and confidence in future EV infrastructure; while controlling for prior EV ownership, political affiliation, and demographic characteristics (e.g., age, gender, education, and geographic location). We utilize data from three nationally representative opinion polls conducted by the Pew Research Center between 2021 and 2023, and employ Bayesian techniques to estimate the ordinal probit and ordinal quantile models. Results from ordinal probit show that respondents who are well-informed about EVs, perceive them as environmentally beneficial, or are confident in development of charging stations are more likely to express strong interest in buying an EV, with covariate effects--a metric rarely reported in EV research--of 10.2, 15.5, and 19.1 percentage points, respectively. In contrast, those skeptical of government climate initiatives are more likely to express no interest, by more than 10 percentage points. Prior EV ownership exhibits the highest covariate effect (ranging from 19.0 to 23.1 percentage points), and the impact of most demographic variables is consistent with existing studies. The ordinal quantile models demonstrate significant variation in covariate effects across the distribution of EV purchase intent, offering insights beyond the ordinal probit model. This article is the first to use quantile modeling to reveal how covariate effects differ significantly throughout the spectrum of EV purchase intent.</description>

      <title>Predicting Children's Travel Modes for School Journeys in Switzerland: A Machine Learning Approach Using National Census Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Children's travel behavior plays a critical role in shaping long-term mobility habits and public health outcomes. Despite growing global interest, little is known about the factors influencing travel mode choice of children for school journeys in Switzerland. This study addresses this gap by applying a random forest classifier - a machine learning algorithm - to data from the Swiss Mobility and Transport Microcensus, in order to identify key predictors of children's travel mode choice for school journeys. Distance consistently emerges as the most important predictor across all models, for instance when distinguishing between active vs. non-active travel or car vs. non-car usage. The models show relatively high performance, with overall classification accuracy of 87.27% (active vs. non-active) and 78.97% (car vs. non-car), respectively. The study offers empirically grounded insights that can support school mobility policies and demonstrates the potential of machine learning in uncovering behavioral patterns in complex transport datasets.</description>

      <title>Public Health Insurance of Children and Maternal Labor Market Outcomes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper exploits variation resulting from a series of federal and state Medicaid expansions between 1977 and 2017 to estimate the effects of children's increased access to public health insurance on the labor market outcomes of their mothers. The results imply that the extended Medicaid eligibility of children leads to positive labor supply responses at the extensive and intensive margins of single mothers and to negative labor supply responses at the extensive margin of married mothers. The analysis of mechanisms suggests that extended children's Medicaid eligibility positively affects take-up of Medicaid and health of children.</description>

      <title>Position Uncertainty in a Prisoner's Dilemma Game : An Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gallice and Monzon (2019) present a natural environment that sustains full cooperation in one-shot social dilemmas among a finite number of self-interested agents. They demonstrate that in a sequential public goods game, where agents lack knowledge of their position in the sequence but can observe some predecessors' actions, full contribution emerges in equilibrium due to agents' incentive to induce potential successors to follow suit. Furthermore, they show that this principle extends to a number of social dilemmas, with the prominent example that of the prisoner's dilemma. In this study, we experimentally test the theoretical predictions of this model in a multi- player prisoner's dilemma environment, where subjects are not aware of their position in the sequence and receive only partial information on past cooperating actions. We test the predictions of the model, and through rigorous structural econometric analysis, we test the descriptive capacity of the model against alternative behavioural strategies, such as conditional cooperation, altruistic play and free-riding behaviour. We find that the majority resorts to free-riding behaviour, around 30% is classified as Gallice and Monzon (2019) types, followed by those with social preference considerations and the unconditional altruists.</description>

      <title>End-to-End Portfolio Optimization with Quantum Annealing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08843v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With rapid technological progress reshaping the financial industry, quantum technology plays a critical role in advancing risk management, asset allocation, and financial strategies. Realizing its full potential requires overcoming challenges like quantum hardware limits, algorithmic stability, and implementation barriers. This research explores integrating quantum annealing with portfolio optimization, highlighting quantum methods' ability to enhance investment strategy efficiency and speed. Using hybrid quantum-classical models, the study shows combined approaches effectively handle complex optimization better than classical methods. Empirical results demonstrate a portfolio increase of 200,000 Indian Rupees over the benchmark. Additionally, using rebalancing leads to a portfolio that also surpasses the benchmark value.</description>

      <title>EthosGPT: Mapping Human Value Diversity to Advance Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09861v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are transforming global decision-making and societal systems by processing diverse data at unprecedented scales. However, their potential to homogenize human values poses critical risks, similar to biodiversity loss undermining ecological resilience. Rooted in the ancient Greek concept of ethos, meaning both individual character and the shared moral fabric of communities, EthosGPT draws on a tradition that spans from Aristotle's virtue ethics to Adam Smith's moral sentiments as the ethical foundation of economic cooperation. These traditions underscore the vital role of value diversity in fostering social trust, institutional legitimacy, and long-term prosperity. EthosGPT addresses the challenge of value homogenization by introducing an open-source framework for mapping and evaluating LLMs within a global scale of human values. Using international survey data on cultural indices, prompt-based assessments, and comparative statistical analyses, EthosGPT reveals both the adaptability and biases of LLMs across regions and cultures. It offers actionable insights for developing inclusive LLMs, such as diversifying training data and preserving endangered cultural heritage to ensure representation in AI systems. These contributions align with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), especially SDG 10 (Reduced Inequalities), SDG 11.4 (Cultural Heritage Preservation), and SDG 16 (Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions). Through interdisciplinary collaboration, EthosGPT promotes AI systems that are both technically robust and ethically inclusive, advancing value plurality as a cornerstone for sustainable and equitable futures.</description>

      <title>Learning to Maximize Ordinal and Expected Utility, and the Indifference Hypothesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16538v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We ask if participants in a choice experiment with repeated presentation of the same menus and no feedback provision: (i) learn to behave in ways that are closer to the predictions of ordinal and expected utility theory under *strict* preferences; or (ii) exhibit overall behaviour that is consistent with utility theory under *weak* preferences. To answer these questions we designed and implemented a free-choice lab experiment with 15 distinct menus. Each menu contained two, three and four lotteries with three monetary outcomes, and was shown five times. Subjects were not forced to make an active choice at any menu but could avoid/defer doing so at a positive expected cost. Among our 308 subjects from the UK and Germany, significantly more were ordinal- and expected-utility maximizers in their last 15 than in their first 15 identical decision problems. Around a quarter and a fifth of all subjects, respectively, decided in those modes *throughout* the experiment, with nearly half revealing non-trivial indifferences. A considerable overlap is found between those consistently rational individuals and the ones who satisfied core principles of*random* utility theory. Finally, choice consistency is positively correlated with cognitive ability, while subjects who learned to maximize utility were more cognitively able than those who did not. We discuss potential implications of our study's novel set of findings.</description>

      <title>Reference Points, Risk-Taking Behavior, and Competitive Outcomes in Sequential Settings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13333v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding how competitive pressure affects risk-taking is crucial in sequential decision-making under uncertainty. This study examines these effects using bench press competition data, where individuals make risk-based choices under pressure. We estimate the impact of pressure on weight selection and success probability. Pressure from rivals increases attempted weights on average, but responses vary by gender, experience, and rivalry history. Counterfactual simulations show that removing pressure leads many lifters to select lower weights and achieve lower success rates, though some benefit. The results reveal substantial heterogeneity in how competition shapes both risk-taking and performance.</description>
