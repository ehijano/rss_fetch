      <title>Decomposing force fields as flows on graphs reconstructed from stochastic trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Disentangling irreversible and reversible forces from random fluctuations is a challenging problem in the analysis of stochastic trajectories measured from real-world dynamical systems. We present an approach to approximate the dynamics of a stationary Langevin process as a discrete-state Markov process evolving over a graph-representation of phase-space, reconstructed from stochastic trajectories. Next, we utilise the analogy of the Helmholtz-Hodge decomposition of an edge-flow on a contractible simplicial complex with the associated decomposition of a stochastic process into its irreversible and reversible parts. This allows us to decompose our reconstructed flow and to differentiate between the irreversible currents and reversible gradient flows underlying the stochastic trajectories. We validate our approach on a range of solvable and nonlinear systems and apply it to derive insight into the dynamics of flickering red-blood cells and healthy and arrhythmic heartbeats. In particular, we capture the difference in irreversible circulating currents between healthy and passive cells and healthy and arrhythmic heartbeats. Our method breaks new ground at the interface of data-driven approaches to stochastic dynamics and graph signal processing, with the potential for further applications in the analysis of biological experiments and physiological recordings. Finally, it prompts future analysis of the convergence of the Helmholtz-Hodge decomposition in discrete and continuous spaces.</description>

      <title>Dynamical phase transitions in the non-reciprocal Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-reciprocal interactions in many-body systems lead to time-dependent states, commonly observed in biological, chemical, and ecological systems. The stability of these states in the thermodynamic limit, as well as the criticality of the phase transition from static to time-dependent states remains an open question. To tackle these questions, we study a minimalistic system endowed with non-reciprocal interactions: an Ising model with two spin species having opposing goals. The mean-field equation predicts three stable phases: disordered, ordered, and a time-dependent swap phase. Large scale numerical simulations support the following: (i) in 2D, the swap phase is destabilized by defects; (ii) in 3D, the swap phase is stable, and has the properties of a time-crystal; (iii) the transition from disorder to swap in 3D is characterized by the critical exponents of the 3D XY model, in agreement with the emerging continuous symmetry of time translation invariance; (iv) when the two species have fully anti-symmetric couplings, the static-order phase is unstable in any dimension due to droplet growth; (v) in the general case of asymmetric couplings, static order can be restored by a droplet-capture mechanism preventing the droplets from growing indefinitely. We provide details on the full phase diagram which includes first- and second-order-like phase transitions and study the coarsening dynamics of the swap as well as the static-order phases.</description>

      <title>Generalized fluctuation-dissipation relations in confined geometries and concentrated conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: his article extends the fluctuation-dissipation analysis to generic complex fluids in confined geometries and to all the cases the hydromechanic fluid-interaction kernels may depend on the particle position. This represents a completely new way of enforcing fluctuation-dissipation theory just because the primary target is to derive an explicit functional expression for the hydromechanic force (that is unavailable from linear hydrodynamic theory) from fundamental thermodynamic principles at equilibrium (while in the classical Kubo theory the memory kernels are explicitly known, stemming from the mean-field hydromechanics of fluid-particle interactions). In this way, either the representation of hydromechanic interactions and the explicit representation of the thermal forces are derived at the same time from thermodynamic principles. The physical and conceptual implications of these results are addressed. The theory can be extended to concentrated conditions and to suspensions, as well as to active particle in confined geometries accounting for the most general linear fluid-dynamic conditions.</description>

      <title>Bridging Freidlin-Wentzell large deviations theory and stochastic thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For overdamped Langevin systems subjected to weak thermal noise and nonconservative forces, we establish a connection between Freidlin-Wentzell large deviations theory and stochastic thermodynamics. First, we derive a series expansion of the quasipotential around the detailed-balance solution, i.e. the system's free energy, and identify the condition for the linear response regime to hold even far from equilibrium. Second, we prove that the escape rate from dissipative fixed points of the macroscopic dynamics is bounded by the entropy production of trajectories that relax into, and escape from the attractors. These results provide the foundation to study the nonequilibrium thermodynamics of dissipative metastable states.</description>

      <title>Theory of Nonequilibrium Multicomponent Coexistence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multicomponent phase separation is a routine occurrence in both living and synthetic systems. Thermodynamics provides a straightforward path to determine the phase boundaries that characterize these transitions for systems at equilibrium. The prevalence of phase separation in complex systems outside the confines of equilibrium motivates the need for a genuinely nonequilibrium theory of multicomponent phase coexistence. Here, we develop a mechanical theory for coexistence that casts coexistence criteria into the familiar form of equality of state functions. Our theory generalizes traditional equilibrium notions such as the species chemical potential and thermodynamic pressure to systems out of equilibrium. Crucially, while these notions may not be identifiable for all nonequilibrium systems, we numerically verify their existence for a variety of systems by introducing the phenomenological Multicomponent Active Model B+. Our work establishes an initial framework for understanding multicomponent coexistence that we hope can serve as the basis for a comprehensive theory for high-dimensional nonequilibrium phase transitions.</description>

      <title>A numerical study of the zeroes of the grand partition function of hard needles of length $k$ on stripes of width $k$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We numerically study zeroes of the partition function for trimers ($k = 3$) on $3 \times L$ strip. While such results for dimers ($k = 2$) on 2D lattices are well known to always lie on the negative real axis and are unbounded, here we see that the zeroes are bounded on branches in a finite-sized region and with a considerable number of them being complex. We analyze this result further to numerically study the density of zeroes on such branches, estimating the critical power-law exponents, and make interesting observations on density of filled sites in the lattice as a function of activity $z$.</description>

      <title>Fate of Boltzmann's breathers: kinetic theory perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamics of a system composed of elastic hard particles confined by an isotropic harmonic potential are studied. In the low-density limit, the Boltzmann equation provides an excellent description, and the system does not reach equilibrium except for highly specific initial conditions: it generically evolves towards and stays in a breathing mode. This state is periodic in time, with a Gaussian velocity distribution, an oscillating temperature and a density profile that oscillates as well. We characterize this breather in terms of initial conditions, and constants of the motion. For low but finite densities, the analysis requires to take into account the finite size of the particles. Under well-controlle approximations, a closed description is provided, which shows how equilibrium is reached at long times. The (weak) dissipation at work erodes the breather's amplitude, while concomitantly shifting its oscillation frequency. An excellent agreement is found between Molecular Dynamics simulation results and the theoretical predictions for the frequency shift. For the damping time, the agreement is not as accurate as for the frequency and the origin of the discrepancies is discussed.</description>

      <title>Non-universality of aging during phase separation of the two-dimensional long-range Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the aging properties of phase-separation kinetics following quenches from $T=\infty$ to a finite temperature below $T_c$ of the paradigmatic two-dimensional conserved Ising model with power-law decaying long-range interactions $\sim r^{-(2 + \sigma)}$. Physical aging with a power-law decay of the two-time autocorrelation function $C(t,t_w)\sim \left(t/t_w\right)^{-\lambda/z}$ is observed, displaying a complex dependence of the autocorrelation exponent $\lambda$ on $\sigma$. A value of $\lambda=3.500(26)$ for the corresponding nearest-neighbor model (which is recovered as the $\sigma \rightarrow \infty$ limes) is determined. The values of $\lambda$ in the long-range regime ($\sigma &lt; 1$) are all compatible with $\lambda \approx 4$. In between, a continuous crossover is visible for $1 \lesssim \sigma \lesssim 2$ with non-universal, $\sigma$-dependent values of $\lambda$. The performed Metropolis Monte Carlo simulations are primarily enabled by our novel algorithm for long-range interacting systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum thermalization of translation-invariant systems at high temperature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07516v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum thermalization describes how closed quantum systems can effectively reach thermal equilibrium, resolving the apparent incongruity between the reversibility of Schr\"odinger's equation and the irreversible entropy growth dictated by the second law of thermodynamics. Despite its ubiquity and conceptual significance, a complete proof of quantum thermalization has remained elusive for several decades. Here, we prove that quantum thermalization must occur in any qubit system with local interactions satisfying three conditions: (i) high effective temperature, (ii) translation invariance, and (iii) no perfect resonances in the energy spectrum. Specifically, we show that a typical, initially unentangled pure state drawn from any ensemble with maximum entropy becomes locally indistinguishable from a Gibbs state upon unitary evolution. Our proof relies on a recent breakthrough in quantum information theory proving the separability of high-temperature thermal states, as well as on new technical results identifying sufficient conditions for quantum thermalization, whose applicability extends beyond our main result. Our work illustrates that statistical physics can be understood as an emergent phenomenon, explicitly derived from the first principles of quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>Correlated quantum machines beyond the standard second law</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07899v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The laws of thermodynamics strongly restrict the performance of thermal machines. Standard thermodynamics, initially developed for uncorrelated macroscopic systems, does not hold for microscopic systems correlated with their environments. We here derive exact generalized laws of quantum thermodynamics for arbitrary, time-periodic, open systems that account for all possible correlations between all involved parties. We demonstrate the existence of two basic modes of engine operation: the usual thermal case, where heat is converted into work, and a novel athermal regime, where work is extracted from entropic resources, such as system-bath correlations. In the latter regime, the efficiency of a quantum engine is not bounded by the usual Carnot formula. Our results provide a unified formalism to determine the efficiency of correlated microscopic thermal devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.05817v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a liquid-gas coexistence system in a container under gravity with heat flow in the direction opposite to gravity. By molecular dynamics simulation, we find that the liquid buoys up and continues to float steadily. The height at which the liquid floats is determined by a dimensionless parameter related to the ratio of the temperature gradient to gravity. We confirm that supercooled gas remains stable above the liquid. We provide a phenomenological argument for explaining the phenomenon from a simple thermodynamic assumption.</description>

Abstract: A condition for realizability of heat released in nondeterministic processes is derived from a fluctuation theorem, and is demonstrated to be strictly stronger than another condition which is derived from the 2nd law of thermodynamics. With this condition for realizability, the (generalized) Zurek's bound can be straightforwardly obtained and applied to a wider range of systems.</description>

      <title>Yielding is an absorbing phase transition with vanishing critical fluctuations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.11797v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The yielding transition in athermal complex fluids can be interpreted as an absorbing phase transition between an elastic, absorbing state with high mesoscopic degeneracy and a flowing, active state. We characterize quantitatively this phase transition in an elastoplastic model under fixed applied shear stress, using a finite-size scaling analysis. We find vanishing critical fluctuations of the order parameter (i.e., the shear rate), and relate this property to the convex character of the phase transition ($\beta &gt;1$). We show explicitly that the CDP class is recovered when both properties are relaxed. We locate yielding within a family of models akin to fixed-energy sandpile (FES) models, only with long-range redistribution kernels with zero-modes that result from mechanical equilibrium. For redistribution kernels with sufficiently fast decay, this family of models belong to a short-range universality class distinct from the Conserved Directed Percolation class of usual FES, which is induced by zero modes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06296v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-equilibrium fluctuation theorems (NFTs) relate work performed on a system as its Hamiltonian varies with time, to equilibrium data of the initial and final states. In a classical context the system energy can be directly measured, while a quantum implementation requires the incorporation of a work-agent. We demonstrate that the uncertainty principle imposes inherent quantum limitations on the applicability of the NFT for probing non-trivial mesoscopic systems. We work out the NFT validity regime for the simplest quantum-dot toy model, and discuss future applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20266v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that equilibrium systems in $d$ dimension that obey the inequality $d\nu&gt; 2,$ known as Harris criterion, exhibit suppressed energy fluctuation in their critical state. Ashkin-Teller model is an example in $d=2$ where the correlation length exponent $\nu$ varies continuously with the inter-spin interaction strength $\lambda$ and exceeds the value $\frac d2$ set by Harris criterion when $\lambda$ is negative; there, the variance of the subsystem energy across a length scale $l$ varies as $l^{d-\alpha}$ with hyperuniformity exponent $\alpha = 2(1-\nu^{-1}).$ Point configurations constructed by assigning unity to the sites which has coarse-grained energy beyond a threshold value also exhibit suppressed number fluctuation and hyperuniformiyty with same exponent $\alpha.$</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08007v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Through an explicit construction, we assign to any infinite temperature autocorrelation function $C(t)$ a set of functions $\alpha^n(t)$. The construction of $\alpha^n(t)$ from $C(t)$ requires the first $2n$ temporal derivatives of $C(t)$ at times $0$ and $t$. Our focus is on $\alpha^n(t)$ that (almost) monotonously decrease, we call these ``arrows of time functions" (AOTFs). For autocorrelation functions of few body observables we numerically observe the following: An AOTF featuring a low $n$ may always be found unless the the system is in or close to a nonchaotic regime with respect to a variation of some system parameter. All $\alpha^n(t)$ put upper bounds to the respective autocorrelation functions, i.e. $\alpha^n(t) \geq C^2(t)$. Thus the implication of the existence of an AOTF is comparable to that of the H-Theorem, as it indicates a directed approach to equilibrium. We furthermore argue that our numerical finding may to some extent be traced back to the operator growth hypothesis. This argument is laid out in the framework of the so-called recursion method.</description>

      <title>Useful autonomous quantum machines</title>

Abstract: Controlled quantum machines have matured significantly. A natural next step is to increasingly grant them autonomy, freeing them from time-dependent external control. For example, autonomy could pare down the classical control wires that heat and decohere quantum circuits; and an autonomous quantum refrigerator recently reset superconducting qubits to near their ground states, as is necessary before a computation. Which fundamental conditions are necessary for realizing useful autonomous quantum machines? Inspired by recent quantum thermodynamics and chemistry, we posit conditions analogous to DiVincenzo's criteria for quantum computing. Furthermore, we illustrate the criteria with multiple autonomous quantum machines (refrigerators, circuits, clocks, etc.) and multiple candidate platforms (neutral atoms, molecules, superconducting qubits, etc.). Our criteria are intended to foment and guide the development of useful autonomous quantum machines.</description>

      <title>Probing marginal stability in the spherical $p=2$ model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15819v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate the marginally stable nature of the low-temperature trivial spin glass phase in the spherical $p=2$ spin glass, by perturbing the system with three different kinds of non-linear interactions. In particular, we compare the effect of three additional dense four-body interactions: ferromagnetic couplings, purely disordered couplings and couplings with competing disordered and ferromagnetic interactions. Our study, characterized by the effort to present in a clear and pedagogical way the derivation of all the results, shows that the marginal stability property of the spherical spin glass depends in fact on which kind of perturbation is applied to the system: in general, a certain degree of frustration is needed also in the additional terms in order to induce a transition from a trivial to a non-trivial spin-glass phase. On the contrary, the addition of generic non-frustrated interactions does not destabilize the trivial spin-glass phase.</description>

      <title>Multifractality and Hyperuniformity in Quasicrystalline Bose-Hubbard Models with and without Disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05155v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Clarifying similarities and differences in physical properties between crystalline and quasicrystalline systems is one of central issues in studying quasicrystals. To contribute to this, we apply multifractal and hyperuniform analyses to nonuniform spatial patterns in the Bose-Hubbard model on the Penrose and Ammann-Beenker tilings. Based on the mean-field approximation, we obtain real-space distributions of local superfluid amplitude and bosonic condensate. In both Mott insulating and superfluid phases, the distributions are hyperuniform. Analyzing the order metric that quantifies the complexity of nonuniform spatial patterns, we find that both quasicrystals show a significant increase of the order metric at a phase boundary between the Mott insulating and superfluid phases, in stark contrast to the case of a periodic square lattice. Our results suggest that hyperuniformity is a useful concept to differentiate between crystalline and quasicrystalline bosonic systems. The order metric clarifies if the distribution of a physical quantity reflects the point distribution or not, and quantifies how complex the distribution is in comparison with the point distribution. Moreover, we introduce on-site random potentials into these quasicrystalline Bose-Hubbard models, leading to a Bose glass phase. Contrary to the Mott insulating and superfluid phases, we find that the Bose glass phase is multifractal. The same multifractality appears on a Bose glass phase in the periodic square lattice. Therefore, multifractality is common in a Bose glass phase irrespective of the periodicity of systems.</description>

      <title>Non-Unitary Quantum Many-Body Dynamics using the Faber Polynomial Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10135v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Efficient numerical methods are still lacking to probe the unconventional dynamics of quantum many-body systems under non-unitary evolution. In this work, we use Faber polynomials to numerically simulate both the dynamics of non-Hermitian systems and the quantum jumps unravelling of the Lindblad dynamics. We apply the method to the non-interacting and interacting Hatano-Nelson models evolving from two different setups: i) a N\'eel state, and ii) a domain wall. In the first case, we study how interactions preserve the initial magnetic order against the skin effect. In the second example, we present numerical evidence of the existence of an effective hydrodynamic description for the domain-wall melting problem in the non-interacting limit. Additionally, we investigate both the conditional and unconditional dynamics of the quantum jump unravelling in two quantum spin chains, which exhibit either the non-Hermitian or the Liouvillian skin effect. This numerical method inherently generalises the well-established method based on Chebyshev polynomials to accommodate non-Hermitian scenarios.</description>

      <title>Integer Topological Defects Reveal Anti-Symmetric Forces in Active Nematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15431v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cell layers are often categorized as contractile or extensile active nematics but recent experiments on neural progenitor cells with induced $+1$ topological defects challenge this classification. In a bottom-up approach, we first study a relevant particle-level model and then analyze a continuous theory derived from it. We show that both model and theory account qualitatively for the main experimental result, i.e. accumulation of cells at the core of any type of +1 defect. We argue that cell accumulation is essentially due to two generally ignored 'effective active forces'.
  We finally discuss the relevance and consequences of our findings in the context of other cellular active nematics experiments and previously proposed theories.</description>
