      <title>Quantifying the Blockchain Trilemma: A Comparative Analysis of Algorand, Ethereum 2.0, and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14335v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Blockchain technology is essential for the digital economy and metaverse, supporting applications from decentralized finance to virtual assets. However, its potential is constrained by the "Blockchain Trilemma," which necessitates balancing decentralization, security, and scalability. This study evaluates and compares two leading proof-of-stake (PoS) systems, Algorand and Ethereum 2.0, against these critical metrics. Our research interprets existing indices to measure decentralization, evaluates scalability through transactional data, and assesses security by identifying potential vulnerabilities. Utilizing real-world data, we analyze each platform's strategies in a structured manner to understand their effectiveness in addressing trilemma challenges. The findings highlight each platform's strengths and propose general methodologies for evaluating key blockchain characteristics applicable to other systems. This research advances the understanding of blockchain technologies and their implications for the future digital economy. Data and code are available on GitHub as open source.</description>

      <title>Computational synthesis of locomotive soft robots by topology optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.10985v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Locomotive soft robots (SoRos) have gained prominence due to their adaptability. Traditional locomotive SoRo design is based on limb structures inspired by biological organisms and requires human intervention. Evolutionary robotics, designed using evolutionary algorithms (EAs), have shown potential for automatic design. However, EA-based methods face the challenge of high computational cost when considering multiphysics in locomotion, including materials, actuations, and interactions with environments. Here, we present a design approach for pneumatic SoRos that integrates gradient-based topology optimization with multiphysics material point method (MPM) simulations. This approach starts with a simple initial shape (a cube with a central cavity). The topology optimization with MPM then automatically and iteratively designs the SoRo shape. We design two SoRos, one for walking and one for climbing. These SoRos are 3D printed and exhibit the same locomotion features as in the simulations. This study presents an efficient strategy for designing SoRos, demonstrating that a purely mathematical process can produce limb-like structures seen in biological organisms.</description>

      <title>Optimal market-neutral currency trading on the cryptocurrency platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15461v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This research proposes a novel arbitrage approach with respect to multivariate pair trading called Optimal Trading Technique (OTT). We introduce the method to selectively form a "bucket" of fiat currencies anchored to cryptocurrency for simultaneously monitoring and exploiting trading opportunities. To handle the quantitative conflicts that arise when receiving multiple trading signals, a bi-objective convex optimization process is designed to cater to the investor's preference between profitability and risk tolerance. This process includes tunable parameters such as volatility punishment, action thresholds. During our experiments in the cryptocurrency market from 2020 to 2022 when the market was experiencing a vigorous bull-run immediately followed by a bear-run, the OTT realized an annualized profit of 15.49%. We further carried out the experiments in bull, bear, and full-cycle market conditions separately, and found that OTT is capable of achieving stable profit under various market conditions. Apart from the profitability side of the OTT, the arbitrage operation provides a new perspective of trading, which requires no external shorting and never hold intermediate cryptocurrency during the arbitrage period.</description>

      <title>Neural Fractional Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02737v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fractional Differential Equations (FDEs) are essential tools for modelling complex systems in science and engineering. They extend the traditional concepts of differentiation and integration to non-integer orders, enabling a more precise representation of processes characterised by non-local and memory-dependent behaviours.
  This property is useful in systems where variables do not respond to changes instantaneously, but instead exhibit a strong memory of past interactions.
  Having this in mind, and drawing inspiration from Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs), we propose the Neural FDE, a novel deep neural network architecture that adjusts a FDE to the dynamics of data.
  This work provides a comprehensive overview of the numerical method employed in Neural FDEs and the Neural FDE architecture. The numerical outcomes suggest that, despite being more computationally demanding, the Neural FDE may outperform the Neural ODE in modelling systems with memory or dependencies on past states, and it can effectively be applied to learn more intricate dynamical systems.</description>
