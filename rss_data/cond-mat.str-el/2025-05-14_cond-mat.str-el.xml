      <title>A Unifying Framework for Fractional Chern Insulator Stabilization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a theory of fractional Chern insulator stabilization against charge-ordered states. We argue that the phase competition is captured by an effective interaction range, which depends on both the bare interaction range and quantum geometric properties. We argue that short effective interaction ranges stabilize fractional states while longer-range interactions favor charge-ordered states. To confirm our hypothesis, we conduct a numerical study of the generalized Hofstadter model using the density matrix renormalization group. Our theory offers a new interpretation of the geometric stability hypothesis and generalizes it, providing a unifying framework for several approaches to fractional phase stabilization. Finally, we propose a route towards experimental verification of the theory and possible implications for fractional states in bands with higher Chern numbers.</description>

      <title>Universal quench dynamics of lattice $q$ fermion Yukawa Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the quantum quench of the Yukawa Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model and one of its lattice extensions with $q$ fermions and one boson. Several equilibrium properties are computed for general $q$ with different parameter scaling within the large-$N$ dynamical mean field scheme. The non-Fermi liquid quench dynamics are studied by integrating the Kadanoff-Baym equations for switching off the lattice term with constant Yukawa coupling or quenching to different final Yukawa couplings. The post-quench oscillations and relaxation dynamics are insensitive to the quench amplitudes deep inside the non-Fermi liquid phase. With weak lattice coupling quenches, we find universal thermalization dynamics similar to the SYK model; however, with two temperatures and two distinct relaxation rates for bosons and fermions, both signal Planckian relaxations without quasiparticles, as in strange metals.</description>

      <title>Electron-phonon coupling in correlated materials: insights from the Hubbard-Holstein model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamical mean-field theory computations of the electron self energy of the Hubbard-Holstein model as a function of electron-phonon and electron-electron interactions are analyzed to gain insight into the dependence of electron-phonon couplings on correlation strength in quantum materials. We find that the electron-phonon interaction is strongly suppressed by electronic correlations, while electron-electron correlation effects at Fermi liquid scales are only weakly modified by coupling to phonons, with phonon-induced modifications most evident at high frequencies on the order of the electronic bandwidth. Implications for beyond-density functional theories of the electron-phonon interaction are discussed.</description>

      <title>Chiral split magnons in metallic g-wave altermagnets: Insights from many-body perturbation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnets represent a novel class of magnetic materials that bridge the gap between conventional ferromagnets (FMs) and antiferromagnets (AFMs). Similar to FMs, altermagnets exhibit spin splitting in their electronic bands along specific crystal directions. However, like AFMs, they feature a compensated magnetic structure with zero net magnetic moment. A defining characteristic of altermagnets is the non-degeneracy of their magnon (spin-wave) modes along the crystallographic directions where electronic bands display spin splitting. This non-degeneracy imparts chirality and direction-dependent magnon dispersions, governed by the unique symmetry constraints of altermagnetic systems. In this study, we investigate the interplay between electronic band spin splitting and chiral magnon excitations in a series of metallic g-wave altermagnets (\(MZ\), where \(M\)= V, Cr; \(Z\)= As, Sb, Bi) using the density functional theory and many-body perturbation theory. We systematically analyze the impact of pnictogen substitution (As, Sb, Bi) on spin splitting and magnon dispersions. Our findings reveal pronounced anisotropic magnon band splitting that closely mirrors the spin-split electronic bands. Moreover, we find that magnon damping due to Stoner excitations is highly wavevector-dependent, reaching substantial values in specific Brillouin zone regions. These results highlight the potential of altermagnets for next-generation spintronic and magnonic devices, where direction-dependent magnon lifetimes and nonreciprocal magnon transport could enable new functionalities for chiral magnon propagation and directional magnon control.</description>

      <title>Competing Pair Density Wave and Uniform $d$-wave Superconductivity in Phase Separated 214 Cuprates at the 1/8 Anomaly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compelling evidence exists for electronic phase separation in cuprate high-$T_c$ superconductors, emerging near 1/8 hole doping. At these dopings and low temperatures, intertwined charge and spin stripes coexist with more uniformly doped regions in the two-dimensional (2$D$) copper-oxide planes. Each region is capable of developing superconducting pairing, either as a pair density wave (PDW) within the stripes or as a uniform $d$-wave condensate ($d$-SC) in the more homogeneous regions. Using neutron scattering on single crystals of La$_{1.875-y}$Nd$_{y}$Sr$_{0.125}$CuO$_4$, we demonstrate that the onset temperatures for spin stripe order ($T_N$) and superconductivity ($T_c$) merge as the average ordered moment vanishes in LSCO ($y = 0$), whereas Nd doping stabilizes static stripe order and suppresses $T_c$. Because the spin stripes possess the same in-plane periodicity (8$a$) as the PDW and establish the framework in which the PDW resides, the stabilization of spin stripe order enhances PDW correlations. Thus, the competition between $d$-wave pairing in the uniform regions and PDW pairing in the stripe-ordered regions can be controlled by the Nd concentration in La$_{1.875-y}$Nd$_{y}$Sr$_{0.125}$CuO$_4$, allowing the superconducting $T_c$ to vary by nearly an order of magnitude at a fixed 1/8 hole doping.</description>

      <title>Current-induced successive structural phase transitions beyond thermal equilibrium in single-crystal VO2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonequilibrium systems driven by external energy sources host unexplored physics; yet phase transitions beyond thermal equilibrium remain elusive. Here, we demonstrate that electric current induces structural phase transitions in single-crystal VO2, a prototypical strongly correlated material. At room temperature, synchrotron X-ray diffraction shows that a current density of 6.5 A/cm2 disrupts V-V dimers, driving a monoclinic-to-tetragonal insulator-to-metal transition, independent of Joule heating. Increasing the current to 10 A/cm2 triggers a discontinuous isotropic lattice expansion, stabilizing a novel tetragonal structure that does not exist in thermal equilibrium. Optical microscopy and microscopic Raman spectroscopy reveal dynamic domain motion and metastable phases, reminiscent of dissipative structures. These findings establish direct pathways to access hidden phases and symmetry changes beyond thermal equilibrium, broadening the frontiers of nonequilibrium thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Metal-Insulator Transition described by Natural Orbital Functional Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The metal-insulator transition (MIT) is a fundamental phenomenon in condensed matter physics and a hallmark of strong electronic correlations. Hydrogen-based systems offer a simple yet powerful model for investigating the MIT, as their insulating behavior arises purely from electron-electron interactions. In this work, we study finite hydrogen clusters with cubic geometries using Natural Orbital Functional Theory (NOFT), a method capable of accurately describing correlated systems beyond mean-field approaches. We focus on two key signatures of the MIT: the fundamental energy gap and the harmonic average of the atomic one-particle reduced density matrix. Our results show that NOFT captures the transition from insulating to metallic behavior as the interatomic distance decreases. By extrapolating the energy gap to the thermodynamic limit, we estimate a critical distance rc ~ 1.2 Ang, in excellent agreement with quantum Monte Carlo benchmarks. These findings demonstrate the reliability of NOFT for describing strong correlation effects in large-scale models.</description>

      <title>Superconductor-Insulator transition in a two-orbital attractive Hubbard model with Hund's exchange</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a two-orbital attractive Hubbard model with a repulsive Hund's exchange coupling $J$ as an idealized model for a two-band superconductor. This framework is motivated by a system where a large isotropic electron-phonon coupling drives the on-site Hubbard repulsion $U$ negative, while leaving the exchange term unaffected. We focus on the intra-orbital (intra-band) singlet superconducting phase and we solve the model at zero temperature and half-filling using Dynamical Mean-Field Theory. Already at $J=0$, the two-orbital model features a superconductor-insulator transition as $\vert U\vert$ grows, as opposed to the single-orbital case which remains superconducting for any $U &lt; 0$. We find that a finite $J$ strengthens the effect of the attractive $U$, both in the normal state and, more significantly, in the superconducting state. However, this pushes the system towards an effectively stronger coupling, hence to a faster transition to the insulating state.
  Remarkably, the transition from a superconductor to an insulator occurs with a vanishing quasi-particle weight $Z$ and in a scenario that recalls strongly correlated superconductivity close to a Mott transition, even though the present model is dominated by attractive interactions.</description>

      <title>Magnetic-field-induced ordering in a spin-1/2 chiral chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present neutron diffraction, muon spin rotation and pulsed-field magnetometry measurements on the Heisenberg quantum chiral chain [Cu(pym)(H2O)4]SiF6.H2O, which displays a four-fold-periodic rotation of the local environment around the Cu(II) S = 1/2 ions from site to site along the chain. Previous measurements on this material have shown the absence of magnetic order down to surprisingly low temperatures &gt;= 20 mK, as well as the presence of an energy gap for magnetic excitations that grows linearly with magnetic field. Here we find evidence at dilution refrigerator temperatures for a field-induced transition to long-range magnetic order above an applied magnetic field of 3 T. From the polarization of magnetic moments observed in applied fields we can identify the static magnetic structure that best accounts for the data. The proposed model is supported microscopically by the presence of an alternating component of the g tensor, which produces an internal two-fold staggered field that dictates both the direction of the ordered moments and the effective coupling between adjacent chains. The observed magnetic structure is contrary to previous proposals for the departure of the magnitude and field dependence of the energy gap from the predictions of the sine-Gordon model.</description>

      <title>Exotic Carriers from Concentrated Topology: Dirac Trions as the Origin of the Missing Spectral Weight in Twisted Bilayer Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nature of charge carriers in twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) near $\nu = -2$, where superconductivity emerges, remains mysterious. While various symmetry-broken ground states have been proposed, experimental evidence of significant entropy persisting to low temperatures suggests that the disordered thermal state is a more natural starting point for understanding the normal state physics. Our previous work proposed that this thermal state in TBG hosts nearly decoupled nonlocal moments and an exotic Mott semimetal at charge neutrality. This evolves into a spectrally imbalanced Mott state at non-zero integer fillings. Notably, at $\nu = -2$, the quasiparticle residue vanishes at the top of the valence band, precisely where superconductivity develops. The vanishing quasiparticle residue naturally leads to the following question: Which excitation accounts for the missing spectral weight, and how are they related to electrons? In this work, we demonstrate that the missing spectral weight corresponds to a trion excitation, which we explicitly construct and characterize. Remarkably, despite being composed of heavy particles away from the Gamma point, this trion is unexpectedly light. At charge neutrality, the electron and trion hybridize with a momentum-dependent phase that winds around zero, forming a massless Dirac cone. At finite doping $\nu &lt; 0$, the Dirac cone acquires a mass with the valence (conduction) band becoming trion (electron)-like near the $\Gamma$ point. Finally, we show that such trion excitations evolve into the quasiparticles of the intervalley Kekul\'e spiral (IKS) state at finite doping, where they represent electrons dressed by the IKS order parameter. More broadly, our work highlights the unusual spectral properties and excitations that emerge when fermions interact within topological bands with concentrated quantum geometry and topology.</description>

      <title>Observation of Near-Critical Kibble-Zurek Scaling in Rydberg Atom Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Kibble-Zurek scaling reveals the universal dynamics when a system is linearly ramped across a symmetry-breaking phase transition. However, in reality, inevitable finite-size effects or symmetrybreaking perturbations can often smear out the critical point and render the phase transition into a smooth crossover. In this letter, we show experimentally that the precise Kibble-Zurek scaling can be retained in the near-critical crossover regime, not necessarily crossing the critical point strictly. The key ingredient to achieving this near-critical Kibble-Zurek scaling is that the system size and the symmetry-breaking field must be appropriately scaled following the variation of ramping speeds. The experiment is performed in a reconfigurable Rydberg atom array platform, where the Rydberg blockade effect induces a Z2 symmetry-breaking transition. The atom array platform enables precise control of the system size and the zigzag geometry as a symmetry-breaking field. Therefore, we can demonstrate notable differences in the precision of the Kibble-Zurek scaling with or without properly scaling the system size and the zigzag geometry. Our results strengthen the Kibble-Zurek scaling as an increasingly valuable tool for investigating phase transition in quantum simulation platforms.</description>

      <title>Electronic structure of monolayer-CrTe$_2$: an antiferromagnetic 2D van der Waals material</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07942v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic van der Waals materials are an important building block to realize spintronic functionalities in heterostructures of two-dimensional (2D) materials. Yet, establishing their magnetic and electronic properties and the interrelationship between the magnetic ground state and electronic structure is often challenging because only a limited number of techniques can probe magnetism and electronic structure on length scales of tens to hundreds of nanometers. Chromium chalcogenides are a class of 2D magnetic materials for which a rich interplay between structure and magnetism has been predicted. Here, we combine angle-resolved photoemission and quasi-particle interference imaging to establish the electronic structure of a monolayer of CrTe$_2$ on graphite. From a comparison of model calculations with spectroscopic mapping using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and scanning tunnelling microscopy we establish the magnetic ground state and the low energy electronic structure. We demonstrate that the band structure of monolayer CrTe$_2$ is captured well by density functional theory (DFT) in a DFT+U framework when a Coulomb repulsion of $U=2.5\mathrm{eV}$ is accounted for.</description>

      <title>$C^\ast$-categorical prefactorization algebras for superselection sectors and topological order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07960v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a conceptual and efficient geometric framework to encode the algebraic structures on the category of superselection sectors of an algebraic quantum field theory on the $n$-dimensional lattice $\mathbb{Z}^n$. It is shown that, under certain assumptions which are implied by Haag duality, the monoidal $C^\ast$-categories of localized superselection sectors carry the structure of a locally constant prefactorization algebra over the category of cone-shaped subsets of $\mathbb{Z}^n$. Employing techniques from higher algebra, one extracts from this datum an underlying locally constant prefactorization algebra defined on open disks in the cylinder $\mathbb{R}^1\times\mathbb{S}^{n-1}$. While the sphere $\mathbb{S}^{n-1}$ arises geometrically as the angular coordinates of cones, the origin of the line $\mathbb{R}^1$ is analytic and rooted in Haag duality. The usual braided (for $n=2$) or symmetric (for $n\geq 3$) monoidal $C^\ast$-categories of superselection sectors are recovered by removing a point of the sphere $\mathbb{R}^1\times(\mathbb{S}^{n-1}\setminus\mathrm{pt}) \cong\mathbb{R}^n$ and using the equivalence between $\mathbb{E}_n$-algebras and locally constant prefactorization algebras defined on open disks in $\mathbb{R}^n$. The non-trivial homotopy groups of spheres induce additional algebraic structures on these $\mathbb{E}_n$-monoidal $C^\ast$-categories, which in the case of $\mathbb{Z}^2$ is given by a braided monoidal self-equivalence arising geometrically as a kind of `holonomy' around the circle $\mathbb{S}^1$. The locally constant prefactorization algebra structures discovered in this work generalize, under some mild geometric conditions, to other discrete spaces and thereby provide a clear link between the geometry of the localization regions and the algebraic structures on the category of superselection sectors.</description>

Abstract: Recently, fractional quantum anomalous Hall effects have been discovered in two-dimensional moir\'{e} materials when a topologically nontrivial band with Chern number $\mathcal{C}=1$ is partially doped. Remarkably, superlattice Bloch bands can carry higher Chern numbers that defy the Landau-level paradigm and may even host exotic fractionalized states with non-Abelian quasiparticles. Inspired by this exciting possibility, we propose twisted \textit{rhombohedral} trilayer-bilayer graphene at $\theta \sim 1.2^\circ$ as a field-tunable quantum anomalous Chern insulator that features spectrally-isolated, kinetically-quenched, and topologically-nontrivial bands with $\mathcal{C} = 2,3$ favorable for fractional phases once fractionally doped, as characterized by their quantum geometry. Based on extensive self-consistent mean-field calculations, we show that these phases are stabilized by Coulomb interactions and are robust against variations in dielectric environment, tight-binding hopping parameters, and lattice relaxation.</description>

      <title>Multireference error mitigation for quantum computation of chemistry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08291v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum error mitigation (QEM) strategies are essential for improving the precision and reliability of quantum chemistry algorithms on noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. Reference-state error mitigation (REM) is a cost-effective chemistry-inspired QEM method that performs exceptionally well for weakly correlated problems. However, the effectiveness of REM is often limited when applied to strongly correlated systems. Here, we introduce multireference-state error mitigation (MREM), an extension of REM that systematically captures quantum hardware noise in strongly correlated ground states by utilizing multireference states. A pivotal aspect of MREM is using Givens rotations to efficiently construct quantum circuits to generate multireference states. To strike a balance between circuit expressivity and noise sensitivity, we employ compact wavefunctions composed a few dominant Slater determinants. These truncated multireference states, engineered to exhibit substantial overlap with the target ground state, can effectively enhance error mitigation in variational quantum eigensolver experiments. We demonstrate the effectiveness of MREM through comprehensive simulations of molecular systems $\mathrm{H_2O, ~N_2, ~and ~F_2}$, underscoring its ability to realize significant improvements in computational accuracy compared to the original REM method. MREM broadens the scope of error mitigation to encompass a wider variety of molecular systems, including those exhibiting pronounced electron correlation.</description>

      <title>DFT Investigation of Magnetocrystalline Anisotropy in Fe, Co, Pd0.97Co0.03 and Pd0.97Fe0.03 systems: From Bulk to Thin-Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08416v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nature of low-impurity ferromagnetism remains a challenging problem in the solid-state community due to the strong dependence of magnetic properties on composition, concentration, and structural geometry of diluted alloys. To address this, we performed a density functional theory study of magnetocrystalline anisotropy in Fe, Co, Pd0.97Co0.03, and Pd0.97Fe0.03 systems across bulk, monolayer, and thin-film geometries. Non-collinear spin-orbit calculations were employed to evaluate the magnetocrystalline anisotropy energies, supported by analysis of atomic-, spin-, and orbital-resolved densities of states. The results revealed that Fe and Co exhibit opposite easy-axis orientation depending on geometry. At the same time, even 3% Co-doping in Pd is sufficient to induce anisotropy trends resembling those of pure Co. In contrast, Fe-Pd system at the same concentration do not reproduce the anisotropy of pure Fe, showing isotropic behavior in bulk.</description>

      <title>Symmetry Transmutation and Anomaly Matching</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08618v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore a situation where a global symmetry of the ultraviolet (UV) theory does not act faithfully on the local infrared (IR) degrees of freedom, but instead acts effectively as a higher-form symmetry. We refer to this phenomenon as symmetry transmutation, where the UV symmetry is "transmuted" into a higher-form symmetry in the IR. Notably, unlike emergent (accidental) symmetries, which are approximate, these symmetries are exact. We illustrate the ubiquity of this phenomenon in various continuum and lattice systems and provide examples where the 't Hooft anomalies of the UV symmetry are matched by those of the new higher-form symmetry in the IR. We also show that in certain phases and for certain energies, the UV baryon-number symmetry of one-flavor QCD is transmuted into a discrete one-form global symmetry. Finally, we compare our symmetry transmutation to the well-known phenomenon of symmetry fractionalization.</description>

      <title>Augmenting Density Matrix Renormalization Group with Matchgates and Clifford circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08635v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Matchgates and Clifford circuits are two types of quantum circuits which can be efficiently simulated classically, though the underlying reasons are quite different. Matchgates are essentially the single particle basis transformations in the Majorana fermion representation which can be easily handled classically, while the Clifford circuits can be efficiently simulated using the tableau method according to the Gottesman-Knill theorem. In this work, we propose a new wave-function ansatz in which matrix product states are augmented with the combination of Matchgates and Clifford circuits (dubbed MCA-MPS) to take advantage of the representing power of all of them. Moreover, the optimization of MCA-MPS can be efficiently implemented within the Density Matrix Renormalization Group method. Our benchmark results on one-dimensional hydrogen chain show that MCA-MPS can improve the accuracy of the ground-state calculation by several orders of magnitude over MPS with the same bond dimension. This new method provides us a useful approach to study quantum many-body systems. The MCA-MPS ansatz also expands our understanding of classically simulatable quantum many-body states.</description>

      <title>Dominant orbital magnetization in the prototypical altermagnet MnTe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08675v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Altermagnetism is an unconventional form of antiferromagnetism characterized by momentum-dependent spin polarization of electronic states and zero net magnetization, arising from specific crystalline symmetries. In the presence of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and broken time-reversal symmetry, altermagnets can exhibit finite net magnetization and anomalous Hall effect (AHE), phenomena typically associated with ferromagnets. Due to the dependence of AHE on magnetization, understanding the interplay between spin and orbital contributions to magnetization is essential for interpreting experiments and designing altermagnetic devices. In this work, we use density functional theory to investigate the intrinsic spin and orbital magnetization of the magnetic ground state of the prototypical altermagnet {\alpha}-MnTe. We find that SOC induces weak ferromagnetism through spin canting, accompanied by a slight in-plane rotation of the N\'eel vector. Notably, we identify a significant net orbital magnetization of 0.176 {\mu}B per unit cell oriented along the z-axis, while the spin magnetization in the same direction is much smaller at 0.002 {\mu}B. By varying the chemical potential, we show that the spin magnetization is tunable through hole doping, whereas the orbital magnetization remains robust against carrier density changes. These results highlight the important role of orbital magnetization and establish its relevance for orbital-based phenomena in altermagnets.</description>

      <title>Dissipation driven phase transition in the non-Hermitian Kondo model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09510v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian Hamiltonians capture several aspects of open quantum systems, such as dissipation of energy and non-unitary evolution. An example is an optical lattice where the inelastic scattering between the two orbital mobile atoms in their ground state and the atom in a metastable excited state trapped at a particular site and acting as an impurity, results in the two body losses. It was shown in \cite{nakagawa2018non} that this effect is captured by the non-Hermitian Kondo model. which was shown to exhibit two phases depending on the strength of losses. When the losses are weak, the system exhibits the Kondo phase and when the losses are stronger, the system was shown to exhibit the unscreened phase where the Kondo effect ceases to exist, and the impurity is left unscreened. We re-examined this model using the Bethe Ansatz and found that in addition to the above two phases, the system exhibits a novel $\widetilde{YSR}$ phase which is present between the Kondo and the unscreened phases. The model is characterized by two renormalization group invariants, a generalized Kondo temperature $T_K$ and a parameter `$\alpha$' that measures the strength of the loss. The Kondo phase occurs when the losses are weak which corresponds to $0&lt;\alpha&lt;\pi/2$. As $\alpha$ approaches $\pi/2$, the Kondo cloud shrinks resulting in the formation of a single particle bound state which screens the impurity in the ground state between $\pi/2&lt;\alpha&lt;\pi$. As $\alpha$ increases, the impurity is unscreened in the ground state but can be screened by the localized bound state for $\pi&lt;\alpha&lt;3\pi/2$. When $\alpha&gt;3\pi/2$, one enters the unscreened phase where the impurity cannot be screened. We argue that in addition to the energetics, the system displays different time scales associated with the losses across $\alpha=\pi/2$, resulting in a phase transition driven by the dissipation in the system.</description>

      <title>Abnormal planar Hall effect and disentanglement of incoherent and coherent transport in a Kondo lattice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09908v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The nature of localized-itinerant transition in Kondo lattice systems remains a mystery despite intensive investigations in past decades. While it is often identified from the coherent peak in magnetic resistivity, recent angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and ultrafast optical spectroscopy revealed a precursor incoherent region with band bending and hybridization fluctuations. This raises the question of how the coherent heavy-electron state is developed from an incoherent background of fluctuating localized moments and then established at sufficiently low temperatures. Here, on the example of the quasi-one-dimensional Kondo lattice compound CeCo$_2$Ga$_8$, we show that planar Hall effect and planar anisotropic magnetoresistance measurements provide an effective way to disentangle the incoherent Kondo scattering contribution and the coherent heavy-electron contribution, and a multi-stage process is directly visualized with lowering temperature by their distinct angle-dependent patterns in magneto-transport. Our idea may be extended to other measurements and thereby opens up a pathway for systematically investigating the fundamental physics of Kondo lattice coherence.</description>

Abstract: Fractional excitations hold immense promise for both fundamental physics and quantum technologies. However, constructing lattice models for their dynamics under gauge fields remains a formidable challenge due to inherent obstructions. Here, we introduce a novel and systematic framework for deriving low-energy lattice models of fractional orbitals coupled to tight-binding gauge fields. Departing from conventional geometric approaches, our method systematically eliminates the high-energy states via virtual hopping, thereby deriving the gauge potential and quantum metric through a superexchange-like mechanism. We demonstrate the framework by constructing Wannier orbitals for Majorana states and a tight-binding $Z_2$ gauge field across various flux crystalline phases in the Kitaev spin model on a honeycomb lattice. Our study reveals a striking phase transition between two non-trivial topological phases characterized by gapless flat-band with extensive degeneracy. Furthermore, we develop a gauge-invariant mean-field theory for interacting Majorana orbitals, leading to a correlation-induced fractional Chern state. Our work establishes a general framework for gauge-mediated tight-binding models and a gauge-invariant mean-field theory for interacting fractional orbitals that can be readily extended to $U(1)$, $SU(N)$ lattice gauge theories.</description>

      <title>Charge and spin properties of a generalized Wigner crystal realized in the moir\'e WSe$_2$/WS$_2$ heterobilayer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11202v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine the charge and spin properties of an effective single-band model representing a moir\'e superlattice of the WSe$_{2}$/WS$_{2}$ heterobilayer. We focus on the $2/3$ electron filling, which refers to the formation of a generalized Wigner crystal, as evidenced experimentally. Our approach is based on the extended-Hubbard model on a triangular lattice with non-interacting part effectively describing a spin-split band due to Ising-type spin-orbit coupling. We investigate the system in the regime of strong on-site Coulomb repulsion and the ground state of the Hamiltonian is obtained with the use of the Density Matrix Renormalization Group formulated within the Matrix Product State approach. According to our analysis, based on the density-density correlation functions resolved in the momentum space, a transition from the metallic to the insulating state appears with increasing intersite electron-electron interactions. This transition is identified as being concomitant with the emergence of a generalized Wigner crystal that realizes the honeycomb lattice pattern. We investigate the magnetic properties of such a Wigner crystal state and find that the presence of spin-valley polarization and the increased intersite repulsion induce spin canting of the out-of-plane antiferromagnetic ordering.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00194v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of boundary phenomena in a spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ anisotropic Heisenberg chain (XXZ-$\frac{1}{2}$) in the gapped antiferromagnetic phase, with a particular focus on the interplay between fractionalized spin-$\frac{1}{4} $ edge modes and a coupled spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ impurity at the edge. Employing a combination of Bethe Ansatz, exact diagonalization, and density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) methods, we explore the intricate phase diagram that emerges when the impurity is coupled either integrably or non-integrably to the chain. For integrable antiferromagnetic impurity couplings, we identify two distinct phases: the Kondo phase, where the impurity is screened by a multiparticle Kondo effect, and the antiferromagnetic bound mode phase, where an exponentially localized bound state screens the impurity in the ground state. When coupled ferromagnetically while maintaining integrability, the impurity behaves as a free spin-$\frac{1}{2}$, leading to either a ferromagnetic bound mode phase, where the impurity remains free in the ground state but may be screened at higher energy excitations or an unscreened (or local moment) phase where impurity remains unscreened in every eigenstate whereas for non-integrable ferromagnetic coupling, the impurity is not free. In the case of non-integrable antiferromagnetic coupling, a third phase emerges, characterized by mid-gap excitations with two degenerate states below the mass gap on top of the Kondo and antiferromagnetic bound mode phases, further enriching the phase diagram. Our findings highlight the nuanced behavior of boundary impurities in gapped antiferromagnetic systems, offering new insights into Kondo effects and impurity screening in the presence of fractionalized edge modes and bulk antiferromagnetic order.</description>

Abstract: We study the hybridization between plasmons, phonons, and electronic sound in ionic crystals using the Debye model, where the ionic background is modeled as a homogeneous, isotropic, elastic medium. We explicitly obtain the energies and the damping of the hybrid plasmon-sound modes in the hydrodynamic regime and calculate the corresponding dynamic structure factor. We find that with increasing viscosity a plasmon-like mode quickly decays into a broad, incoherent background, while a phonon-like mode with linear dispersion remains rather sharp. The quantitative behavior of the hybridized collective modes depends on the ratio of the electronic and the ionic plasma frequencies. We also show that the direct Coulomb interaction between the ions is essential to obtain a collective sound mode with linear dispersion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13326v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetic rare earth atoms on pyrochlore lattice can produce such exotic magnetic states as spin ice and quantum spin ice. These states are a result of the frustration in the pyrochlore lattice, as well as crystal field degrees of freedom of rare earth atoms, and their interactions with the lattice. Raman scattering spectroscopy, which possess high spectral resolution and can easily access broad energy and temperature ranges, is an optimum tool to study these excitations and their interactions. In this work we follow Raman scattering of zone center phonons and crystal field excitations of Nd$^{3+}$ in Nd$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$ and Nd$_2$Ir$_2$O$_7$ in the temperature range where these materials are paramagnetic. A comparison between an insulating Nd$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$ and semimetallic Nd$_2$Ir$_2$O$_7$ materials allow us to distinguish between scattering of phonons on other phonons, crystal field excitations, and electrons, highlighting interactions between these degrees of freedom.</description>

By a combination of heat capacity, magneto-caloric, and magneto-resistance measurements we map two antiferromagnetic phases: the electronic AFM1 below 70\,mK and electro-nuclear AFM2 below 1.5\,mK. The measurements extend into the microkelvin regime to explore the quantum phase transitions in this system. We demonstrate how the hyperfine interaction significantly modifies the phase diagram and the putative field-tuned quantum critical point. The determination of the rich magnetic properties of YbRh\textsubscript{2}Si\textsubscript{2} is essential to understanding the interplay of the two magnetic orders and superconductivity in this compound.</description>

      <title>Doping lattice non-abelian quantum Hall states</title>

Abstract: We study quantum phases of a fluid of mobile charged non-abelian anyons, which arise upon doping the lattice Moore-Read quantum Hall state at lattice filling $\nu = 1/2$ and its generalizations to the Read-Rezayi ($\mathrm{RR}_k$) sequence at $\nu = k/(k+2)$. In contrast to their abelian counterparts, non-abelian anyons present unique challenges due to their non-invertible fusion rules and non-abelian braiding structures. We address these challenges using a Chern-Simons-Ginzburg-Landau (CSGL) framework that incorporates the crucial effect of energy splitting between different anyon fusion channels at nonzero dopant density. For the Moore-Read state, we show that doping the charge $e/4$ non-abelion naturally leads to a fully gapped charge-$2$ superconductor without any coexisting topological order. The chiral central charge of the superconductor depends on details of the interactions determining the splitting of anyon fusion channels. For general $\mathrm{RR}_k$ states, our analysis of states obtained by doping the basic non-abelion $a_0$ with charge $e/(k+2)$ reveals a striking even/odd pattern in the Read-Rezayi index $k$. We develop a general physical picture for anyon-driven superconductivity based on charge-flux unbinding, and show how it relates to the CSGL description of doped abelian quantum Hall states. Finally, as a bonus, we use the CSGL formalism to describe transitions between the $\mathrm{RR}_k$ state and a trivial period-$(k+2)$ CDW insulator at fixed filling, driven by the gap closure of the fundamental non-abelian anyon $a_0$. Notably, for $k=2$, this predicts a period-4 CDW neighboring the Moore-Read state at half-filling, offering a potential explanation of recent numerical observations in models of twisted MoTe$_2$.</description>

      <title>Generation of magnetic chiral solitons, skyrmions, and hedgehogs with electric fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07210v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electric-field controls of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions (DMIs) have recently been discussed from the microscopic viewpoint. Since the DMI plays a critical role in generating topological spin textures (TSTs) such as the chiral soliton, the magnetic skyrmion, and the magnetic hedgehog, electric-field controls of these TSTs have become an important issue. This paper shows that such electric-field-induced DMI indeed creates and annihilates TSTs by numerically solving the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation for many-body spin systems at finite temperatures. We show that when a strong electric field is applied in a proper way to one- or two-dimensional ferromagnets, the Hamiltonians are changed into the well-known spin models for the chiral soliton or the skyrmion lattice, and the TST states emerge. We utilize a machine-learning method to count the number of generated TSTs. In the three-dimensional (3D) case, we demonstrate the electric-field induction of a magnetic hedgehog structure as follows: Applying a strong enough electric field along a proper direction to a skyrmion-string state (a triple-$\boldsymbol{q}$ state) at low but finite temperatures, we find that the field-induced DMI can drive a quadruple-$\boldsymbol{q}$ state with hedgehog-antihedgehog pairs. This result indicates that we have succeeded in constructing a simple 3D short-range interacting spin model hosting a magnetic hedgehog structure.</description>

      <title>Operator-state correspondence in simple current extended conformal field theories: Toward a general understanding of chiral conformal field theories and topological orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15621v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we revisit the operator-state correspondence in the Majorana conformal field theory (CFT) with emphasis on its semion representation. Whereas the semion representation (or $Z_{2}$ extension of the chiral Ising CFT) gives a concise ``abelian" (or invertible) representation in the level of fusion rule and quantum states, there exists subtlety when considering the chiral multipoint correlation function. In this sense, the operator-state correspondence in the semion sector of the fermionic theory inevitably contains difficulty coming from its anomalous conformal dimension $1/16$ as a $Z_{2}$ symmetry operator. By analyzing the asymptotic behaviors of the existing correlation functions, we propose a nontrivial correspondence between the chiral conformal blocks and bulk correlation functions containing both order and disorder fields. One can generalize this understanding to $Z_{N}$ models or fractional supersymmetric models (in which there exist long-standing open problems). We expect this may improve our understanding of the simple current extension of CFT which can appear commonly in the studies of topologically ordered systems.</description>

      <title>Minimally Entangled Typical Thermal States for Classical and Quantum Simulation of 1+1-Dimensional $\mathbb Z_2$ Lattice Gauge Theory at Finite Temperature and Density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11949v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simulating strongly coupled gauge theories at finite temperature and density is a longstanding challenge in nuclear and high-energy physics that also has fundamental implications for condensed matter physics. In this work, we use minimally entangled typical thermal state (METTS) approaches to facilitate both classical and quantum computational studies of such systems. METTS techniques combine classical random sampling with imaginary time evolution, which can be performed on either a classical or a quantum computer, to estimate thermal averages of observables. We study 1+1-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory coupled to spinless fermionic matter, which maps onto a local quantum spin chain. We benchmark both a classical matrix-product-state implementation of METTS and a recently proposed adaptive variational approach that is a promising candidate for implementation on near-term quantum devices, focusing on the equation of state as well as on various measures of fermion confinement. Of particular importance is the choice of basis for obtaining new METTS samples, which impacts both the classical sampling complexity (a key factor in both classical and quantum simulation applications) and complexity of circuits used in the quantum computing approach. Our work sets the stage for future studies of strongly coupled gauge theories with both classical and quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>Classical Benchmarks for Variational Quantum Eigensolver Simulations of the Hubbard Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00836v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simulating the Hubbard model is of great interest to a wide range of applications within condensed matter physics, however its solution on classical computers remains challenging in dimensions larger than one. The relative simplicity of this model, embodied by the sparseness of the Hamiltonian matrix, allows for its efficient implementation on quantum computers, and for its approximate solution using variational algorithms such as the variational quantum eigensolver. While these algorithms have been shown to reproduce the qualitative features of the Hubbard model, their quantitative accuracy in terms of producing true ground state energies and other properties, and the dependence of this accuracy on the system size and interaction strength, the choice of variational ansatz, and the degree of spatial inhomogeneity in the model, remains unknown. Here we present a rigorous classical benchmarking study, demonstrating the potential impact of these factors on the accuracy of the variational solution of the Hubbard model on quantum hardware, for systems with up to $32$ qubits. We find that even when using the most accurate wavefunction ans\"{a}tze for the Hubbard model, the error in its ground state energy and wavefunction plateaus for larger lattices, while stronger electronic correlations magnify this issue. Concurrently, spatially inhomogeneous parameters and the presence of off-site Coulomb interactions only have a small effect on the accuracy of the computed ground state energies. Our study highlights the capabilities and limitations of current approaches for solving the Hubbard model on quantum hardware, and we discuss potential future avenues of research.</description>

      <title>Interplay of superconductivity and charge-density-wave order in kagome materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17818v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the $\textit{A}$V$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$ ($\textit{A}$ $=$ K, Rb, Cs) kagome materials, superconductivity coexists with a charge density wave (CDW), constituting a new platform to study the interplay of these two orders. Despite extensive research, the symmetry of the superconducting order parameter remains disputed, with experiments seemingly supporting different conclusions. As key aspects of the physics might lie in the intertwining of electronic orders, a better understanding of the impact of the CDW on superconductivity is crucial. In this work, we develop a phenomenological framework to study the interplay of superconductivity and CDW order. In particular, we derive a Ginzburg-Landau free energy for both superconducting and CDW order parameters. Given the unclear nature of the superconducting state, we discuss general pairing symmetries with a focus on $s$-wave, $d$-wave, and pair-density-wave order parameters. Motivated by experiments, we consider the additional breaking of time-reversal or point-group symmetries of the CDW and determine in detail the consequences for the superconducting state. Our results show how the superconducting state mimics the broken symmetries of the CDW and can guide future microscopic calculations, as well as the experimental identification of the superconducting state in the $\textit{A}$V$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$ compounds.</description>

      <title>Controlling particle-hole symmetry of fractional quantum hall states in trilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18910v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a detailed experimental study of the particle-hole symmetry (PHS) of the fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states about half filling in a multiband system. Specifically, we focus on the lowest Landau level of the monolayer-like band of Bernal stacked trilayer graphene (TLG). In pristine TLG, the excitation energy gaps, Land\'e g-factor, effective mass, and disorder broadening of the odd-denominator FQH states are identical to their hole-conjugate counterpart. This precise PH symmetry stems from the lattice mirror symmetry that precludes Landau-level mixing. Introducing a non-zero displacement field \(D\) disrupts this mirror symmetry, facilitating the hybridization between the monolayer-like and bilayer-like Landau levels. This inter-band coupling enhances the Landau level mixing factor $\eta$ and activates three-body interactions -- both of which explicitly break the PHS of FQHs. As a result, conventional FQHs are completely destabilized, offering a route to engineer symmetry breaking of FQHs in a controlled way. We establish that the PHS breaking in TLG is of extrinsic origin and is fundamentally distinct from the intrinsic, interaction-driven symmetry breaking observed in the lowest Landau levels of single-layer and bilayer graphene.</description>

      <title>Fermi-Liquid $T^2$ Resistivity: Dynamical Mean-Field Theory Meets Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16363v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Direct-current resistivity is a key probe for the physical properties of materials. In metals, Fermi-liquid (FL) theory serves as the basis for understanding transport. A $T^2$ behavior of the resistivity is often taken as a signature of FL electron-electron scattering. However, the presence of impurity and phonon scattering as well as material-specific aspects such as Fermi surface geometry can complicate this interpretation. We demonstrate how density-functional theory combined with dynamical mean-field theory can be used to elucidate the FL regime. We take as examples SrVO$_{3}$ and SrMoO$_{3}$, two moderately correlated perovskite oxides, and establish a precise framework to analyze the FL behavior of the self-energy at low energy and temperature. Reviewing published low-temperature resistivity measurements, we find agreement between our calculations and experiments performed on samples with exceptionally low residual resistivity. This comparison emphasizes the need for further theoretical, synthesis, and characterization developments in these and other FL materials.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian Lattice Gauge Theories: emergent properties from Tensor Network methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11115v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This thesis develops advanced Tensor Network (TN) methods to address Hamiltonian Lattice Gauge Theories (LGTs), overcoming limitations in real-time dynamics and finite-density regimes. A novel dressed-site formalism is introduced, enabling efficient truncation of gauge fields while preserving gauge invariance for both Abelian and non-Abelian theories. This formalism is successfully applied to SU(2) Yang-Mills LGTs in two dimensions, providing the first TN simulations of this system and revealing critical aspects of its phase diagram and non-equilibrium behavior, such as a Quantum Many-Body (QMB) scarring dynamics. A generalization of the dressed-site formalism is proposed through a new fermion-to-qubit mapping for general lattice fermion theories, revealing powerful for classical and quantum simulations. Numerical innovations, including the use of optimal space-filling curves such as the Hilbert curve to preserve locality in high-dimensional simulations, further enhance the efficiency of these methods. Together with high-performance computing techniques, these advances open current and future development pathways toward optimized, efficient, and faster simulations on scales comparable to Monte Carlo state-of-the-art.</description>

      <title>Many-Body Vertex Effects: Time-Dependent Interaction Kernel with Correlated Multi-Excitons in the Bethe-Salpeter Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05271v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Building on a beyond-GW many-body framework that incorporates higher-order vertex effects in the self-energy -- giving rise to T-matrix and second-order exchange contributions -- this approach is extended to now include the vertex derived in that work to the kernel in the Bethe-Salpeter Equation (BSE) for the reducible polarization function. This results in a frequency-dependent interaction kernel that naturally captures random phase approximation (RPA) effects, dynamical excitonic interactions, and the correlated propagation of multiple correlated electron-hole pairs that model multi- (including bi- and tri-) excitonic effects, relevant for nonlinear optics and high harmonic generation. These processes emerge from including the functional derivatives of the screening and vertex with respect to the Green's function in the vertex, enabling a fully abinitio, time-dependent treatment of correlation effects. By focusing on the reducible rather than irreducible polarization function, this approach provides a computationally viable framework for capturing complex many-body interactions for calculating the self-energy, optical spectra and EELS. The resulting interaction kernel is relatively straightforward, clearly delineates the physical processes that are included and omitted, and has the same dimensionality as the conventional BSE kernel used in standard many-body theory implementations, but is now itself frequency dependent. The method is expected to facilitate the integration of advanced many-body effects into state-of-the-art software packages, offering a universal and highly accurate framework for the description of sub-atomic correlations. Such advancements are crucial for the development of semiconductor, optoelectronic, superconducting and antimatter technologies, and ensuring that theoretical modeling evolves alongside exascale and accelerated computing.</description>

      <title>Diffusion and instabilities in large-N holographic Fermi liquids: the vector fluctuations of the electron star</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00211v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the hydrodynamic response of the AdS electron star in the vector sector, and compute the correlation functions and the transverse conductivity of the dual field theory. The system exhibits hydrodynamic behavior at low temperatures and near the critical temperature where the electron star undergoes the phase transition to the RN black hole. However, at intermediate temperatures the hydrodynamics does not exist. Remarkably, the system has an instability, i.e. a pole on the positive imaginary frequency axis at finite temperature. This instability is found both from analytical arguments and from numerics. Its physical meaning is so far unclear but it might mean that the ideal fluid limit for the star is a false vacuum.</description>

      <title>Non-linear flow of two-dimensional viscous electron fluid in moderate magnetic fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07767v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In two-dimensional (2D) electron systems, the inter-particle interaction can lead to the formation of a viscous electron fluid and realization of the hydrodynamic regime of electron transport. Here a nonlinear model of the electron hydrodynamic transport is constructed based on the accounting of pair correlations in the electron dynamics. When describing these systems within the framework of classical kinetics, such correlations represent subsequent ``extended'' collisions of the same electrons temporarily joined into pairs. We study their influence on stationary magnetotransport for large-amplitude fluid flows in long samples. Current profiles in the nonlinear regime and the corresponding differential magnetoresistance are calculated. Pair correlations lead to a characteristic nonmonotonic dependence of the differential resistance on magnetic field. We compare our results with experimental data on magnetoresistance of 2D electrons in high-purity GaAs quantum wells; our model can be responsible for a part of the observed features of the differential magnetoresistance.</description>
