      <title>Melting Coulomb clusters through nonreciprocity-enhanced parametric pumping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complex systems out of equilibrium often experience intermittent oscillations between quiescent and highly dynamic states. The type of intermittency depends on how energy is pumped into the system, and how it is dissipated. While intermittency is usually driven by stochastic noise or external forcing, energy can also be sourced from field-mediated interactions between particles, which are often nonreciprocal and effectively violate Newton's 3rd law. Here we demonstrate how nonreciprocal interactions produce intermittency in clusters of charged micron-sized particles confined in a plasma sheath. Through three-dimensional particle tracking, we observe that vertical oscillations, induced by fluctuations of the plasma environment, can be parametrically coupled to the horizontal modes. Experiments and simulations show that nonreciprocal interactions strongly amplify this parametric coupling, creating a positive feedback loop that drives explosive growth of both the horizontal and vertical modes. This mechanism triggers abrupt melting transitions from an ordered cluster to an ergodic gas-like state, and leads to intermittent switching between states over long time scales. Overall, our work identifies nonreciprocal interactions as a key mechanism through which strongly coupled finite systems transform interaction-mediated activity into dynamical nonequilibrium states.</description>

      <title>Non-local physics-informed neural networks for forward and inverse solutions of granular flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dense granular flows exhibit nonlocal effects due to stress transmission in microplastic events, especially in quasi-static or slowly sheared regions. Hence, traditional local rheological models fail to capture spatial cooperativity effects that are prominent in many granular systems. The nonlocal granular fluidity (NGF) model addresses this limitation by introducing a diffusive-like partial differential equation for a fluidity field, governed by a key material-dependent parameter: the nonlocal amplitude A. However, determining A from experiments or simulations is known to be difficult and typically requires extensive calibration across multiple geometries. In this work, we present a data-driven platform based on Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) embedded with the NGF model, capable of solving granular flows in a forward or inverse manner. We show that once trained on transient flow fields, these non-local PINNs can readily infer the material parameters, as well as the pressure and stress fields. These data-driven frameworks allow for accurate recovery of small variations in the nonlocal amplitude, A, which lead to sharp bifurcation-like transitions in the flow field. This approach demonstrates the feasibility of data-driven parameter inference in complex nonlocal models and opens up new possibilities for characterizing granular materials from sparse experimental observations.</description>

      <title>Evaporation-Induced Pattern Formation and Wetting in Active Microtubule-Kinesin Droplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active networks composed of biopolymers and motor proteins provide versatile biomimetic systems that have advanced active matter physics and deepened our understanding of cytoskeletal dynamics and self-organization under diverse stimuli. In these systems, activity arises in aqueous solutions where motor proteins cross-link biopolymers and generate active stress driving the emergent network behavior. Here, we establish the active network in the form of a sessile, multi-component droplet on a substrate and investigate how evaporation influences its dynamics. We focus on how mass loss and compositional changes in the droplet reshape the behavior of the active suspension. We show that capillary and Marangoni flows drive the self-organization of microtubules into a distinctive radial arrangement within the droplet. The cross-linking ability of motor proteins gives rise to a striking non-monotonic wetting behavior, where the extensile stresses generated by the motor proteins strongly affect the characteristic timescale of the contact-line retracting and subsequent expansion. Using a combined experimental and theoretical approach, we demonstrate the crucial role of crosslinking in evaporating microtubule networks, and explain how active stresses together with evaporation-induced flows govern the dynamics of reconstituted microtubule systems and their wetting behavior. Evaporating droplets have recently attracted significant attention in the scientific community, and the findings of the setup presented in this study can have broad implications, ranging from self-organization and mechanical pattern formation in biological systems to questions about the origin of life.</description>

      <title>Three dimensional contractile droplet under confinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We numerically study the dynamics of a three-dimensional contractile fluid droplet in the bulk and under confinement. We show that varying activity leads to a variety of shapes and motile regimes whose motion is driven by an interplay between spontaneous flows and elasticity. In the bulk the droplet self-propels unidirectionally, acquiring either an almost spherical shape at intermediate activity or a peanut-like geometry for larger values. Under confinement, the droplet exhibits a previously unreported oscillating dynamics characterized by periodic hits against opposite walls of a microchannel while moving forward. These results could be of interest for the study of artificial microswimmers and their biological analogs, such as living cells.</description>

      <title>Phase-Field Models for Particle-Stabilised Emulsions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Particle-stabilised emulsions are a cornerstone of soft matter science due to their broad application and fundamental relevance. Computer simulations provide key insights into the formation and behaviour of these emulsions, yet current methods are limited by the spatiotemporal scales accessible for study. The principal issue is that particles are resolved individually. In this work, an alternative strategy is introduced based on phase-field theory, for which we establish the framework. By evolving continuous fields, large-scale dynamics can be simulated in a computationally efficient manner. Our approach is then applied to model the complex formation of a bicontinuous interfacially jammed emulsion gel (bijel) via solvent-transfer induced phase separation (STrIPS). By resolving the coupled dynamics of liquid phase separation and nanoparticle adsorption, the model allows for the characterisation of the influence of nanoparticles on the morphology. Higher concentrations of nanoparticles are found to reduce the average domain size of STrIPS bijels, in line with previous experimental evidence. The presented phase-field model thus represents a promising approach for the morphological investigation of complex particle-stabilised emulsions.</description>

      <title>Design Principles for Fluid Molecular Ferroelectrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fluid molecular ferroelectrics are a new class of organic materials where ferroelectricity is found in conjunction with 3D fluidity whilst still retaining spontaneous polarization values comparable to their traditional solid state counterparts. One of the major challenges for soft condensed matter physics is predicting whether a fluid molecular material will form ferroelectric phase with nematic or smectic order. Through the synthesis of forty five systematically varied molecules, and by analogy to solid molecular ferroelectrics, is it shown that subtle hydrogen fluorine substitution allows for tuneable syn-parallel pairing motifs resulting in either specific pairings leading too geometrically constrained lamellar order or diversified pairings stabilising nematic ordering. Large-scale, fully atomistic molecular dynamics simulations reveal that smectic ferroelectricity emerges from discrete lateral pairing modes, whereas nematic phases arise from a multiplicity of equivalent polar configurations. Together, these findings establish experimentally validated design principles for fluid molecular ferroelectrics and provide a predictive framework for engineering functional polar fluids.</description>

      <title>Hidden universality in dislocation-loops mediated three-dimensional crystal melting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding why and how crystalline solids melt remains a central problem in condensed-matter physics. Dislocation loops are fundamental topological excitations that control the thermodynamic stability of crystals, yet their role in setting universal aspects of melting has remained unclear. Here we show, within dislocation-mediated melting theory, that the free-energy condition for loop proliferation leads to a universal ratio between the energy of a minimal dislocation loop and the thermal energy at melting. For minimal dislocation loops that begin to proliferate at the onset of melting, this ratio takes the purely geometric value $\mathcal{E}_* = E_{\rm loop}/(k_B T_m) \approx 25.1$, independent of elastic moduli and chemistry-dependent details. This result provides a microscopic explanation for recent empirical findings by Lunkenheimer \emph{et al.}, who identified a closely related universal energy scale $\approx 24.6$ from viscosity data. The same framework also rationalizes the empirical $2/3$ rule relating the glass-transition and melting temperatures.</description>

      <title>Evolution of the contact between rough viscoelastic solids after decreasing loads: memory erasure and monotonic increase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19402v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The real area of contact governs, in part, the magnitude of the friction force, yet its time evolution in rough viscoelastic interfaces remains incompletely understood. In experiments of contact between polymethylmethacrylate blocks under decreasing normal loads, Dillavou and Rubinstein have shown that the true contact area exhibits, after unloading, a decreasing phase and long-term memory of the contact state prior to unloading. It is however unclear what modeling ingredients are necessary to reproduce these two features. Here, we investigate these effects using fractional viscoelastic rough contact models. By adapting existing contact theories and numerical simulation methods to fractional viscoelasticity, which induces a wide relaxation spectrum, we reproduce logarithmic aging under constant load, but show that memory of the contact state is erased upon unloading. Indeed, the contact area behaves as if it had always experienced the reduced load, even on short time-scales, contrasting with the response of a standard linear solid. Moreover, none of our results show a decreasing regime of the contact area after unload: we ultimately prove that this is the case for all linear viscoelastic models -- despite capturing logarithmic aging -- leading to the conclusion that additional local internal variables are required to explain both long-term contact memory and contact area reduction after unloading.</description>

      <title>Flexoelectricity-driven softening of bend elasticity leads to spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking in a polar fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15687v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The origin of recently observed spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking in polar fluids is an unsolved problem, and poses fundamental questions as to how heliconical structures emerge in systems composed of achiral molecules. We report on the softening of bend elasticity close to such phase transition, showing that flexoelectric coupling between the electric polarization and the bend deformation is the responsible mechanism, presumably arising from the bent shape of the constituent highly polar molecules.</description>

      <title>A dialog between cell adhesion and topology at the core of morphogenesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09867v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: During the development of an organism, cells must coordinate and organize to generate the correct shape, structure, and spatial patterns of tissues and organs, a process known as morphogenesis. The morphogenesis of embryonic tissues is supported by multiple processes that induce the precise physical deformations required for tissues to ultimately form organs with complex geometries. Among the most active players shaping the morphogenetic path are fine-tuned changes in cell adhesion. We review here recent advances showing that changes of a local, pair-wise property defined at the cell-cell contact level has important global consequences for embryonic tissue topology, being determinant in defining both the geometric and material properties of early embryo tissues.</description>
