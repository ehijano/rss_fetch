      <title>Mechanistic Modeling of Lipid Nanoparticle (LNP) Precipitation via Population Balance Equations (PBEs)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are precisely engineered drug delivery carriers commonly produced through controlled mixing processes, such as nanoprecipitation. Since their delivery efficacy greatly depends on particle size, numerous studies have proposed experimental and theoretical approaches for tuning LNP size. However, the mechanistic model for LNP fabrication has rarely been established alongside experiments, limiting a profound understanding of the kinetic processes governing LNP self-assembly. Thus, we present a population balance equation (PBE)-based model that captures the evolution of the particle size distribution (PSD) during LNP fabrication, to provide mechanistic insight into how kinetic processes control LNP size. The model showed strong agreement with experimentally observed trends in the PSD. In addition to identifying the role of each kinetic process in shaping the PSD, we analyzed the underlying mechanisms of three key operational strategies: manipulation of (1) lipid concentration, (2) flow rate ratio (FRR), and (3) mixing rate. We identified that the key to producing precisely controlled particle size lies in controlling super-saturation and lipid dilution to regulate the balance between nucleation and growth. Our findings provide mechanistic understanding that is essential in further developing strategies for tuning LNP size.</description>

      <title>Molecular Learning Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply the physics-learning duality to molecular systems by complementing the physical description of interacting particles with a dual learning description, where each particle is modeled as an agent minimizing a loss function. In the traditional physics framework, the equations of motion are derived from the Lagrangian function, while in the learning framework, the same equations emerge from learning dynamics driven by the agent loss function. The loss function depends on scalar quantities that describe invariant properties of all other agents or particles. To demonstrate this approach, we first infer the loss functions of oxygen and hydrogen directly from a dataset generated by the CP2K physics-based simulation of water molecules. We then employ the loss functions to develop a learning-based simulation of water molecules, which achieves comparable accuracy while being significantly more computationally efficient than standard physics-based simulations.</description>

      <title>Tracing long-lived atomic coherences generated via molecular conical intersections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accessing coherences is key to fully understand and control ultrafast dynamics of complex quantum systems like molecules. Most photochemical processes are mediated by conical intersections (CIs), which generate coherences between electronic states in molecules. We show with accurate calculations performed on gas-phase methyl iodide that CI-induced electronic coherences of spin-orbit-split states persist in atomic iodine after dissociation. Our simulation predicts a maximum magnitude of vibronic coherence in the molecular regime of 0.75% of the initially photoexcited state population. Upon dissociation, one third of this coherence magnitude is transferred to a long-lived atomic coherence where vibrational decoherence can no longer occur. To trace these dynamics, we propose a table-top experimental approach--heterodyned attosecond four-wave-mixing spectroscopy (Hd-FWM). This technique can temporally resolve small electronic coherence magnitudes and reconstruct the full complex coherence function via phase cycling. Hence, Hd-FWM leads the way to a complete understanding and optimal control of spin-orbit-coupled electronic states in photochemistry.</description>

      <title>Similarity Constrained CC2 for Efficient Coupled Cluster Nonadiabatic Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite their high accuracy, standard coupled cluster models cannot be used for nonadiabatic molecular dynamics simulations because they yield unphysical complex excitation energies at conical intersections between same-symmetry excited states. On the other hand, similarity constrained coupled cluster theory has enabled the application of coupled cluster theory in such dynamics simulations. Here, we present a similarity constrained perturbative doubles (SCC2) model with same-symmetry excited-state conical intersections that exhibit correct topography, topology, and real excitation energies. This is achieved while retaining the favorable computational scaling of the standard CC2 model. We illustrate the model for conical intersections in hypofluorous acid and thymine, and compare its performance with other methods. The results demonstrate that conical intersections between excited states can be described correctly and efficiently at the SCC2 level. We therefore expect that the SCC2 model will enable coupled cluster nonadiabatic dynamics simulations for large molecular systems.</description>

      <title>Restoring the second law to classical-quantum dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: All physical theories should obey the second law of thermodynamics. However, existing proposals to describe the dynamics of hybrid classical-quantum systems either violate the second law or lack a proof of its existence. Here we rectify this by studying classical-quantum dynamics that are (1) linear and completely-positive and (2) preserve the thermal state of the classical-quantum system. We first prove that such dynamics necessarily satisfy the second law. We then show how these dynamics may be constructed, proposing dynamics that generalise the standard Langevin and Fokker-Planck equations for classical systems in thermal environments to include back-reaction from a quantum degree of freedom. Deriving necessary and sufficient conditions for completely-positive, linear and continuous classical-quantum dynamics to satisfy detailed balance, we find this property satisfied by our dynamics. To illustrate the formalism and its applications we introduce two models. The first is an analytically solvable model of an overdamped classical system coupled to a quantum two-level system, which we use to study the total entropy production in both quantum system and classical measurement apparatus during a quantum measurement. The second describes an underdamped classical-quantum oscillator system subject to friction, which we numerically demonstrate exhibits thermalisation in the adiabatic basis, showing the relevance of our dynamics for the mixed classical-quantum simulation of molecules.</description>

      <title>Direct three-body atom recombination: halogen atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recombination of halogen atoms has been a research topic in chemical physics for over a century. All theoretical descriptions of atom recombination depend on a two-step assumption, where two colliding atoms first form an unstable complex before a third colliding body either relaxes or reacts with it to yield a diatomic molecule. These mechanisms have served well in describing some of the dynamics of atom recombination, but have not yet provided a full theoretical understanding. In this work, we consider the role of the direct three-body recombination mechanism in halogen recombination reactions X + X + M $\rightarrow$ X$_2$ + M, where X is a halogen atom, and M is a rare gas atom. Our results agree well with experimental bromide and iodine recombination measurements, demonstrating that direct three-body recombination is essential in halogen recombination reactions.</description>

      <title>Energy shifts in predissociating levels of diatomic molecules: The case of N$_2$ (C$''^5\Pi _u$) and N$_2$(1$^7\Sigma ^+_u$) interacting states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents a perturbative calculation methodology for evaluating the energy shifts and broadening of vibrational energy levels, caused by interactions between bound and unbound dissociative electronic states. The method is validated against previously semiclassical analyzed cases, demonstrating remarkable consistency. We successfully applied this approach to the N$_2$ molecule, which exhibits a strong spin-orbit interaction between the bound C$''^5\Pi_u$ and the repulsive 1$^7\Sigma^+_u$ electronic states, around 36 cm$^{-1}$. This interaction constitutes an major pathway for N($^{2}$D) production, important in both excitation and quenching in plasma afterglows. As a result, the maximum absolute shift of 0.15 cm$^{-1}$ was found for the C$''^5\Pi_u$ ($v$ = 7) and maximum broadening of 0.45 cm$^{-1}$ was calculated for $v$ = 8, demonstrating significant perturbation of the C$''^5\Pi_u$ by the 1$^7\Sigma^+_u$ state. The results obtained were compared with direct calculations of the predissociation rates of the C$''^5\Pi_u$ bound state, showing very good agreement.</description>

      <title>Influence of a Xenon interlayer on dissociative electron attachment to deuterated methane on a platinum substrate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of intercalating a xenon layer between a thin condensed CD4 film of two monolayers (ML) and a platinum surface on the dissociative electron attachment (DEA). The observed desorption results are compared with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, which reveal the binding energies of various anionic and neutral species as a function of the xenon film thickness on the Pt (111) substrate. The theoretical results suggest that 6 ML of xenon are sufficient to diminish the surface effect, enabling physisorbed anionic fragments to desorb from the CD4 film. In contrast, 20 ML (approximately 10 nm) are experimentally necessary to achieve saturation in the desorption of D-. In addition, the presence of xenon layers enables the coupling of resonance states with Xe excited states, thereby inhibiting the electrons from returning to the metal. Aside from reducing surface interactions, the xenon interlayer significantly enhances DEA to CD4.</description>

      <title>Advances in Prebiotic Chemistry: the potential of Analog Computing and Navier-Stokes Nernst-Planck (NPNS) Modeling in Organic Electronics Technologies (OECTs)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we attempt to make a conceptual bridge between the research in biology, pre-biotic chemistry, biomimetics, and the tools used in organic bioelectronics in terms of materials and devices. The goal is discussing how materials and devices of organic bioelectronics can be exploited and used at the interface with biology, but also how, and at what extent, they can be adapted to mimicking nature-inspired properties, herein including unconventional computing strategies. The idea is to provide new hints and solid hypotheses for designing niche experiments that could benefit from a proper interaction, even at a basic communicative level, between materials science and biotechnology. The finale long-term vision goal being the vision of collecting experimental data that may help to made a step forward toward the implementation of the transition from inanimate objects to animated beings. The mathematical model canonically considered in this work is the Navier-Stokes-Nernst-Planck (NPNS) Model which is often used to model a charged continuum system such as the organic electrochemical transistors.</description>

      <title>Accuracy versus Predominance: Reassessing the validity of the quasi-steady-state approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06406v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The application of the standard quasi-steady-state approximation to the Michaelis--Menten reaction mechanism is a textbook example of biochemical model reduction, derived using singular perturbation theory. However, determining the specific biochemical conditions that dictate the validity of the standard quasi-steady-state approximation remains a challenging endeavor. Emerging research suggests that the accuracy of the standard quasi-steady-state approximation improves as the ratio of the initial enzyme concentration, $e_0$, to the Michaelis constant, $K_M$, decreases. In this work, we examine this ratio and its implications for the accuracy and validity of the standard quasi-steady-state approximation as compared to other quasi-steady-state reductions in its proximity. Using standard tools from the analysis of ordinary differential equations, we show that while $e_0/K_M$ provides an indication of the standard quasi-steady-state approximation's asymptotic accuracy, the standard quasi-steady-state approximation's predominance relies on a small ratio of $e_0$ to the Van Slyke-Cullen constant, $K$. Here, we define the predominance of a quasi-steady-state reduction when it offers the highest approximation accuracy among other well-known reductions with overlapping validity conditions. We conclude that the magnitude of $e_0/K$ offers the most accurate measure of the validity of the standard quasi-steady-state approximation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02378v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The uniform electron gas (UEG) is a cornerstone of density-functional theory (DFT) and the foundation of the local-density approximation (LDA), one of the most successful approximations in DFT. In this work, we extend the concept of UEG by introducing excited-state UEGs, systems characterized by a gap at the Fermi surface created by the excitation of electrons near the Fermi level. We report closed-form expressions of the reduced kinetic and exchange energies of these excited-state UEGs as functions of the density and the gap. Additionally, we derive the leading term of the correlation energy in the high-density limit. By incorporating an additional variable representing the degree of excitation into the UEG paradigm, the present work introduces a new framework for constructing local and semi-local state-specific functionals for excited states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05382v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate vibrational spectra are essential for understanding how molecules behave, yet their computation remains challenging and benchmark data to reliably compare different methods are sparse. Here, we present high-accuracy eigenstate computations for the six-atom, 12-dimensional acetonitrile molecule, a prototypical, strongly coupled, anharmonic system. Using a density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) algorithm with a tree-tensor-network-state (TTNS) ansatz, a refinement using TTNSs as basis set, and reliable procedures to estimate energy errors, we compute up to 5,000 vibrational states with error estimates below 0.0007 $\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$. Our analysis reveals that previous works underestimated the energy error by up to two orders of magnitude. Our data serve as a benchmark for future vibrational spectroscopy methods and our new method offers a path toward similarly precise computations of large, complex molecular systems.</description>

      <title>Core-Excited States of Linear and Bent Uranyl Complexes: Insights from High-Energy Resolution X-ray Spectroscopy and Relativistic Quantum Chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05542v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Advanced X-ray spectroscopic techniques are widely recognized as state-of-the-art tools for probing the electronic structure, bonding, and chemical environments of the heaviest elements in the periodic table. In this study, we employ X-ray absorption near-edge structure measurements in high-energy resolution fluorescence detection (HERFD-XANES) mode to investigate the core states arising from excitations out of the U 3d${_{3/2}}$ (M$_4$ edge) levels for molecular complexes in which the uranyl moiety deviates from linearity to varying degrees, and in particular systems containing the UO$_2$Cl$_2$ group such as UO$_2$Cl$_2$.n(H$_2$O) and UO$_2$Cl$_2$(phen)$_2$, which in the latter case exhibits a pronounced O-U-O bending angle. These U M$_4$ edge HERFD-XANES spectra are compared to those of other linear (Cs$_2$UO$_2$Cl$_4$) or pseudo-linear ([UO$_2$(NO$_3$)$_2$.n(H$_2$O)]) uranyl complexes. This evaluation is complemented by ab initio relativistic quantum chemistry simulations using 2-component Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory (TD-DFT) with the CAM-B3LYP functional, employing the Tamm-Dancoff approximation (2c-TDA). Our 2c-TDA simulations show modest deviations from the HERFD-XANES data, with peak splittings differing by less than 1 eV from experimental values. These core-excited states were further characterized by Natural Transition Orbital (NTO) analysis. Overall, our results highlight the influence of equatorial ligands on the spectroscopic signatures, particularly pronounced in UO$_2$Cl$_2$(phen)$_2$, where the U 3d${_{3/2}} \rightarrow$ $5f$ $\sigma{_u}^{*}$ satellite transition appears at lower energies compared to the other systems studied.</description>

      <title>High-dimensional FGM modeling of turbulent spray flames: Effects of evaporation non-adiabaticity and scalar correlation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.01045v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In turbulent spray flames, the evaporation of fuel droplets not only induces heat loss in the gaseous mixture, but also influences flame dynamics by generating substantial local fluctuations of the mixture fraction $\widetilde{Z}$ and progress variable $\widetilde{c}$. These two scalars, conventionally assumed independent in flamelet models, exhibit significant correlations arising from the coupling among evaporation, turbulent mixing and chemical reactions. This study proposes a six-dimensional flamelet-generated manifolds (FGM) method, considering the evaporation non-adiabaticity and scalar correlation. A novel joint presumed probability density function (PDF) method is derived using the copula theory, achieving rapid convergence and good feasibility to copulas in implicit formulas. Large-eddy simulation (LES) is performed on the Sydney ethanol turbulent spray flames (EtF1, EtF4 and EtF7), which feature different ethanol mass flow rates and jet Reynolds numbers. Both gas and liquid phase statistics show good agreement with experimental data across the three flames. The incorporation of heat loss and scalar correlation in FGM modeling improves gas temperature predictions, along with enhanced liquid-phase prediction through refined gas-field resolution. The correlation coefficient of $\widetilde{Z}$ and $\widetilde{c}$ is found to be a complex competing result of local evaporation and combustion, since evaporation elevates mixture fraction and dilutes reaction progress variable, whereas chemical reactions enhance progress variable fluctuations.</description>

Abstract: Far from equilibrium, chemical and biological systems can form complex patterns and waves through reaction-diffusion coupling. Fluid motion often tends to disrupt these self-organized concentration patterns. In this study, we investigate the influence of Marangoni-driven flows inside a thin layer of fluid ascending the outer surfaces of hydrophilic obstacles on the spatio-temporal dynamics of chemical waves in the modified Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction. Our observations reveal that circular waves originate nearly simultaneously at the obstacles and propagate outward. In a covered setup, where evaporation is minimal, the wavefronts maintain their circular shape. However, in an uncovered setup with significant evaporative cooling, the interplay between surface tension-driven Marangoni flows and gravity destabilizes the wavefronts, creating distinctive flower-like patterns around the obstacles. Our experiments further show that the number of petals formed increases linearly with the obstacle's diameter, though a minimum diameter is required for these instabilities to appear. These findings demonstrate the potential to 'engineer' specific wave patterns, offering a method to control and direct reaction dynamics. This capability is especially important for developing microfluidic devices requiring precise control over chemical wave propagation.</description>
