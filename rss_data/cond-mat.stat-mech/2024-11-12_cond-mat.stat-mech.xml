      <title>Thermal lifetime of breathers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we explore the lifetime of localized excitations in nonlinear lattices, called breathers, when a thermalized lattice is perturbed with localized energy delivered to a single site. We develop a method to measure the time it takes for the system to approach equilibrium based on a single scalar quantity, the participation number, and deduce the value corresponding to thermal equilibrium. We observe the time to achieve thermalization as a function of the energy of the excited site. We explore a variety of different physical system models. The result is that the lifetime of breathers increases exponentially with the breather energy for all the systems. These results may provide a method to detect the existence of breathers in real systems.</description>

      <title>Structural Properties of Hyperuniform Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Disordered hyperuniform many-particle systems are recently discovered exotic states of matter, characterized by a complete suppression of normalized infinite-wavelength density fluctuations and lack of conventional long-range order. Here, we begin a program to quantify the structural properties of nonhyperuniform and hyperuniform networks. In particular, large two-dimensional (2D) Voronoi networks (graphs) containing approximately 10,000 nodes are created from a variety of different point configurations, including the antihyperuniform HIP, nonhyperuniform Poisson process, nonhyperuniform RSA saturated packing, and both non-stealthy and stealthy hyperuniform point processes. We carry out an extensive study of the Voronoi-cell area distribution of each of the networks through determining multiple metrics that characterize the distribution, including their higher-cumulants. We show that the HIP distribution is far from Gaussian; the Poisson and non-stealthy hyperuniform distributions are Gaussian-like distributions, the RSA and the highest stealthy hyperuniform distributions are also non-Gaussian, with diametrically opposite non-Gaussian behavior of the HIP. Moreover, we compute the Voronoi-area correlation functions $C_{00}(r)$ for the networks [M. A. Klatt and S. Torquato, Phys. Rev. E {\bf 90}, 052120 (2014)]. We show that the correlation functions $C_{00}(r)$ qualitatively distinguish the antihyperuniform, nonhyperuniform and hyperuniform Voronoi networks. We find strong anticorrelations in $C_{00}(r)$ (i.e., negative values) for the hyperuniform networks.</description>

      <title>Mechanism of the Nonequilibrium Phase Transition in Self-Propelled Particles with Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-propelled particles with alignment, displaying ordered collective motions such as swarming, can be investigated by the well-known Vicsek model. However, challenges still remain regarding the nature of the associated phase transition. Here, we use the landscape-flux approach combined with the coarse-grained mapping method to reveal the underlying mechanism of the continuous or discontinuous order-disorder nonequilibrium phase transition in Vicsek model systems featuring diverse noise characteristics. It is found that the nonequilibrium flux inside the landscape in the density-alignment degree phase space always rotates counterclockwise, and tends to delocalize or destabilize the point attractor states, providing the dynamical driving force for altering the landscape shape and the system state. Furthermore, the variations in the averaged flux and entropy production rate exhibit pronounced differences across various noise types. This not only helps to reveal the dynamical and thermodynamical mechanisms of the order-disorder transition but also offers a useful tool to recognize the continuity of the transition. Our findings present a novel perspective for exploring nonequilibrium phase transition behaviors and other collective motions in various complex systems.</description>

      <title>Monte Carlo Simulation of Anisotropic Ising Model Using Metropolis and Wolff Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ Monte Carlo techniques, utilizing the Metropolis and Wolff algorithms, to investigate phase behavior and phase transitions in anisotropic Ising models. Our study encompasses the thermodynamic properties, evaluating energy, magnetization, specific heat, magnetic susceptibility, magnetic entropy, and the Binder cumulant. Additionally, we examine the impact of external fields on these thermodynamic quantities at different externally applied field values. We accurately determine the critical temperature for various model scenarios by analyzing the Binder cumulant. Our investigations also include an analysis of the hysteresis loop for the model for different an-isotropic cases. In particular, our study presents the magnetocaloric effect, which is the change in temperature of magnetic material when exposed to a changing magnetic field, in the different anisotropic cases of the Ising model.</description>

      <title>Correlation functions and properties of local distributions of frustrated phases in the ground state of a dilute Ising chain in a magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The features of the response of frustrated states to the external field are considered on the example of a diluted Ising chain. In the ferromagnetic case, partial ordering occurs, which leads to a decrease in entropy. In the antiferromagnetic case, the switching on of the field leads to the appearance of a long-range order in the system, although the state remains frustrated. A mapping of a one-dimensional spin model to a Markov chain is proposed, which makes it possible to study in detail the properties of correlation functions and local distributions of the states in the spin chain.</description>

      <title>Detecting time-irreversibility in multiscale systems: correlation and response functions in the Lorenz96 model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to their relevance to geophysical systems, the investigation of multiscale systems through the lens of statistical mechanics has gained popularity in recent years. The aim of our work is the characterization of the nonequilibrium properties of the well-known two-scales Lorenz96 model, a dynamical system much used for testing ideas in geophysics, by studying either higher-order correlation functions or response to external perturbations of the energy. These tools in both equilibrium (inviscid) or non-equilibrium (viscous) systems provide clear evidence of their suitability for detecting time-reversal symmetry breaking and for characterizing transport properties also in this class of models. In particular, we characterize how localized energy perturbations are transported between the different scales, highlighting that perturbations of synoptic variables greatly impact advective variables but perturbations of the latter have a practically negligible effect on synoptic scales. Finally, we show that responses of global observables to finite size perturbations strongly depend on the perturbation protocol. This prevents the physical understanding of the system from observations of the relaxation process alone, a fact often overlooked.</description>

      <title>Deterministic criticality &amp; cluster dynamics hidden in the Game of Life</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conway's Game of Life (GOL) is an epitome showing how complex dynamical behavior emerges from simple local interactions. Although it has often been found that GOL dynamics lies close to critical behavior, this system has never been studied in the context of a deterministic phase transitions and cluster dynamics. In this work, we study the deterministic critical behavior that emerges in the \textit{logistic} GOL: an extension of Conway's GOL with a parameter that alters the dynamics by expanding the binary state space into a Cantor set, but while maintaining the deterministic nature of the system. Upon tuning the parameter, we find that the logistic GOL comprises at least three types of asymptotic behavior, i.e phases, that are separated by two critical points. One critical point defines the boundary between a sparse-static and a sparse-dynamic asymptotic phase, whereas the other point marks a deterministic percolation transition between the sparse-dynamic and a third, dense-dynamic asymptotic phase. Moreover, we identify distinct power-law distributions of cluster sizes near the critical points, and discuss the underlying mechanisms that give rise to such critical behavior. Overall, our work highlights that scale invariance can emerge even when clusters in a system are generated by a purely deterministic process.</description>

      <title>A nonstabilizerness monotone from stabilizerness asymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05766v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a nonstabilizerness monotone which we name basis-minimised stabilizerness asymmetry (BMSA). It is based on the notion of $G$-asymmetry, a measure of how much a certain state deviates from being symmetric with respect to a symmetry group $G$. For pure states, we show that the BMSA is a strong monotone for magic-state resource theory, while it can be extended to mixed states via the convex roof construction. We discuss its relation with other magic monotones, first showing that the BMSA coincides with the recently introduced basis-minimized measurement entropy, thereby establishing the strong monotonicity of the latter. Next, we provide inequalities between the BMSA and other nonstabilizerness measures known in the literature. Finally, we present numerical methods to compute the BMSA, highlighting its advantages and drawbacks compared to other nonstabilizerness measures in the context of pure many-body quantum states. We also discuss the importance of additivity and strong monotonicity for measures of nonstabilizerness in many-body physics, motivating the search for additional computable nonstabilizerness monotones.</description>

      <title>Input-Driven Dynamics for Robust Memory Retrieval in Hopfield Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Hopfield model provides a mathematically idealized yet insightful framework for understanding the mechanisms of memory storage and retrieval in the human brain. This model has inspired four decades of extensive research on learning and retrieval dynamics, capacity estimates, and sequential transitions among memories. Notably, the role and impact of external inputs has been largely underexplored, from their effects on neural dynamics to how they facilitate effective memory retrieval. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel dynamical system framework in which the external input directly influences the neural synapses and shapes the energy landscape of the Hopfield model. This plasticity-based mechanism provides a clear energetic interpretation of the memory retrieval process and proves effective at correctly classifying highly mixed inputs. Furthermore, we integrate this model within the framework of modern Hopfield architectures, using this connection to elucidate how current and past information are combined during the retrieval process. Finally, we embed both the classic and the new model in an environment disrupted by noise and compare their robustness during memory retrieval.</description>

      <title>Long-time divergences in the nonlinear response of gapped one-dimensional many-particle systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider one dimensional many-particle systems that exhibit kinematically protected single-particle excitations over their ground states. We show that momentum and time-resolved 4-point functions of operators that create such excitations diverge linearly in particular time differences. This behaviour can be understood by means of a simple semiclassical analysis based on the kinematics and scattering of wave packets of quasiparticles. We verify that our wave packet analysis correctly predicts the long-time limit of the four-point function in the transverse field Ising model through a form factor expansion. We present evidence in favour of the same behaviour in integrable quantum field theories. In addition, we extend our discussion to experimental protocols where two times of the four-point function coincide, e.g. 2D coherent spectroscopy and pump-probe experiments. Finally, focusing on the Ising model, we discuss subleading corrections that grow as the square root of time differences. We show that the subleading corrections can be correctly accounted for by the same semiclassical analysis, but also taking into account wave packet spreading.</description>

      <title>Entropic magnetic interlayer coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06446v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nanomagnetism concerns the engineering of magnetic interactions in heterostructures that consist of layers of magnetic and non-magnetic materials. Mostly, these interactions are dominated by the minimization of energy. Here, we propose an effective magnetic interlayer coupling that is dominated by the maximization of entropy. As an example, we consider the system that mediates the effective interactions to be square spin ice, in which case we find purely entropic interactions that are long-ranged. We argue that in the thermodynamic limit the entropic interlayer coupling gives rise to entropic torques on the magnetization direction. For small systems, the physical properties are well characterized by the mutual information between the two magnets that are coupled. Because entropic interactions become stronger for higher temperatures, our findings may benefit the development of nanomagnetic devices that require thermal stability.</description>

      <title>Generalized Eigenspaces and Pseudospectra of Nonnormal and Defective Matrix-Valued Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider nonnormal matrix-valued dynamical systems with discrete time. For an eigenvalue of matrix, the number of times it appears as a root of the characteristic polynomial is called the algebraic multiplicity. On the other hand, the geometric multiplicity is the dimension of the linear space of eigenvectors associated with that eigenvalue. If the former exceeds the latter, then the eigenvalue is said to be defective and the matrix becomes nondiagonalizable by any similarity transformation. The discrete-time of our dynamics is identified with the geometric multiplicity of the zero eigenvalue $\lambda_0=0$. Its algebraic multiplicity takes about half of the matrix size at $t=1$ and increases stepwise in time, which keeps excess to the geometric multiplicity until their coincidence at the final time. Our model exhibits relaxation processes from far-from-normal to near-normal matrices, in which the defectivity of $\lambda_0$ is recovering in time. We show that such processes are realized as size reductions of pseudospectrum including $\lambda_0$. Here the pseudospectra are the domains on the complex plane which are not necessarily exact spectra but in which the resolvent of matrix takes extremely large values. The defective eigenvalue $\lambda_0$ is sensitive to perturbation and the eigenvalues of the perturbed systems are distributed densely in the pseudospectrum including $\lambda_0$. By constructing generalized eigenspace for $\lambda_0$, we give the Jordan block decomposition for the resolvent of matrix and characterize the pseudospectrum dynamics. Numerical study of the systems perturbed by Gaussian random matrices supports the validity of the present analysis.</description>

      <title>Driven Critical Dynamics in Measurement-induced Phase Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06648v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Measurement-induced phase transitions (MIPT), characterizing abrupt changes in entanglement properties in quantum many-body systems subjected to unitary evolution with interspersed projective measurements, have garnered increasing interest. In this work, we generalize the Kibble-Zurek (KZ) driven critical dynamics that has achieved great success in traditional quantum and classical phase transitions to MIPT. By linearly changing the measurement probability $p$ to cross the critical point $p_c$ with driving velocity $R$, we identify the dynamic scaling relation of the entanglement entropy $S$ versus $R$ at $p_c$. For decreasing $p$ from the area-law phase, $S$ satisfies $S\propto \ln R$; while for increasing $p$ from the volume-law phase, $S$ satisfies $S\propto R^{1/r}$ in which $r=z+1/\nu$ with $z$ and $\nu$ being the dynamic and correlation length exponents, respectively. Moreover, we find that the driven dynamics from the volume-law phase violates the adiabatic-impulse scenario of the KZ mechanism. In spite of this, a unified finite-time scaling (FTS) form can be developed to describe these scaling behaviors. Besides, the dynamic scaling of the entanglement entropy of an auxiliary qubit $S_Q$ is also investigated to further confirm the universality of the FTS form. By successfully establishing the driven dynamic scaling theory of this newfashioned entanglement transition, we bring a new fundamental perspective into MIPT that can be detected in fast-developing quantum computers.</description>

Abstract: Thermodynamic principles governing energy and information are important tools for a deeper understanding and better control of quantum systems. In this work, we experimentally investigate the interplay of the thermodynamic costs and information flow in a quantum system undergoing iterative quantum measurement and feedback. Our study employs a state stabilization protocol involving repeated measurement and feedback on an electronic spin qubit associated with a Silicon-Vacancy center in diamond, which is strongly coupled to a diamond nanocavity. This setup allows us to verify the fundamental laws of nonequilibrium quantum thermodynamics, including the second law and the fluctuation theorem, both of which incorporate measures of quantum information flow induced by iterative measurement and feedback. We further assess the reducible entropy based on the feedback's causal structure and quantitatively demonstrate the thermodynamic advantages of non-Markovian feedback over Markovian feedback. For that purpose, we extend the theoretical framework of quantum thermodynamics to include the causal structure of the applied feedback protocol. Our work lays the foundation for investigating the entropic and energetic costs of real-time quantum control in various quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Emergence of steady quantum transport in a superconducting processor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-equilibrium quantum transport is crucial to technological advances ranging from nanoelectronics to thermal management. In essence, it deals with the coherent transfer of energy and (quasi-)particles through quantum channels between thermodynamic baths. A complete understanding of quantum transport thus requires the ability to simulate and probe macroscopic and microscopic physics on equal footing. Using a superconducting quantum processor, we demonstrate the emergence of non-equilibrium steady quantum transport by emulating the baths with qubit ladders and realising steady particle currents between the baths. We experimentally show that the currents are independent of the microscopic details of bath initialisation, and their temporal fluctuations decrease rapidly with the size of the baths, emulating those predicted by thermodynamic baths. The above characteristics are experimental evidence of pure-state statistical mechanics and prethermalisation in non-equilibrium many-body quantum systems. Furthermore, by utilising precise controls and measurements with single-site resolution, we demonstrate the capability to tune steady currents by manipulating the macroscopic properties of the baths, including filling and spectral properties. Our investigation paves the way for a new generation of experimental exploration of non-equilibrium quantum transport in strongly correlated quantum matter.</description>

      <title>Exact linearity of the macroscopic Hall current response in infinitely extended gapped fermion systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06967v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider an infinitely extended system of fermions on a $d$-dimensional lattice with (magnetic) translation-invariant short-range interactions. We further assume that the system has a unique gapped ground state. Physically, this is a model for the bulk of a generic topological insulator at zero temperature, and we are interested in the current response of such a system to a constant external electric field. Using the non-equilibrium almost-stationary states (NEASS) approach, we prove that the longitudinal current density induced by a constant electric field of strength $\varepsilon$ is of order $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^\infty)$, i.e. the system is an insulator in the usual sense. For the Hall current density we show instead that it is linear in $\varepsilon$ up to terms of order $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^\infty)$. The proportionality factor $\sigma_\mathrm{H}$ is by definition the Hall conductivity, and we show that it is given by a generalization of the well known double commutator formula to interacting systems. As a by-product of our results, we find that the Hall conductivity is constant within gapped phases, and that for $d=2$ the relevant observable that "measures" the Hall conductivity in experiments, the Hall conductance, not only agrees with $\sigma_H$ in expectation up to $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^\infty)$, but also has vanishing variance.
  A notable difference to several existing results on the current response in interacting fermion systems is that we consider a macroscopic system exposed to a small constant electric field, rather than to a small voltage drop.</description>

      <title>Metadensity functional theory for classical fluids: Extracting the pair potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The excess free energy functional of classical density functional theory depends upon the type of fluid model, specifically on the choice of (pair) potential, is unknown in general, and is approximated reliably only in special cases. We present a machine learning scheme for training a neural network that acts as a generic metadensity functional for truncated but otherwise arbitrary pair potentials. Automatic differentiation and neural functional calculus then yield, for one-dimensional fluids, accurate predictions for inhomogeneous states and immediate access to the pair distribution function. The approach provides a means of addressing a fundamental problem in the physics of liquids, and for soft matter design: How best to invert structural data to obtain the pair potential?</description>

      <title>The orientational structure of a model patchy particle fluid: simulations, integral equations, density functional theory and machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06973v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the orientational properties of a homogeneous and inhomogeneous tetrahedral 4-patch fluid (Kern--Frenkel model). Using integral equations, either (i) HNC or (ii) a modified HNC scheme with simulation input, the full orientational dependence of pair and direct correlation functions is determined. Density functionals for the inhomogeneous problem are constructed via two different methods. The first, molecular density functional theory, utilizes the full direct correlation function and an isotropic hard-sphere bridge functional. The second method, a machine learning approach, uses a decomposition of the functional into an isotropic reference part and a mean-field orientational part, where both parts are improved by machine learning techniques. Comparison to simulation data at hard walls and around hard tracers show a similar performance of the two functionals. Machine learning strategies are discussed to eliminate residual differences, with the goal of obtaining machine-learning enhanced functionals for the general anisotropic fluid.</description>

      <title>Multicomponent Kardar-Parisi-Zhang Universality in Degenerate Coupled Condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the multicomponent Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation describes the low-energy theory for phase fluctuations in a $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ degenerate non-equilibrium driven-dissipative condensate with global $U(1)\times U(1)$ symmetry. Using dynamical renormalisation group in spatial dimension $d=1$, we demonstrate that coupled stochastic complex Ginsburg-Landau equations exhibit an emergent stationary distribution, enforcing KPZ dynamical exponent $z=3/2$ and static roughness exponent $\chi=1/2$ for both components. By tuning intercomponent interactions, the system can access other regimes, including a fragmented condensate regime from a dynamical instability in the phase fluctuations, as well as a spacetime vortex regime driven by the non-linear terms in the coupled KPZ equations. In stable regimes, we show that in specific submanifolds relevant to polaritons, the RG fixed point offers a transformation to decoupled KPZ equations. Our findings have broad implications for understanding multicomponent KPZ systems in the long-wavelength limit.</description>

      <title>Bilayer construction for mixed state phenomena with strong, weak symmetries and symmetry breakings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the bilayer construction, as a specific purification scheme for a general mixed state, where each mixed state has a one-to-one correspondence with a bilayer pure state with two constraints: non-negativity of the bilayer wavefunction; and the presence of an anti-unitary layer-exchange symmetry T. Different from the Choi-Jamio{\l}kowski isomorphism, any mixed state can be realized as the monolayer reduced density matrix of a bilayer pure state, and its physical properties can be experimentally realized and detected in non-magnetic bilayer 2D materials with a layer-exchange mirror symmetry. We study a variety of mixed state phenomena in the bilayer construction: (1) strong and weak symmetries, their explicit and spontaneous breakings in mixed states can be understood as usual Landau-type symmetry breakings in the bilayer pure state, and their criteria can be derived accordingly; (2) decoherence of a pure state by local errors can be mapped to quantum quench dynamics of the bilayer pure states; (3) mixed symmetry protected topological (SPT) states and mixed state topological orders can be classified, characterized and realized as pure state SPTs and topological orders in the bilayer. We further study examples of strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking (SWSSB) and their critical scalings at the SWSSB transition in the bilayer construction.</description>

      <title>Geometric thermodynamics of reaction-diffusion systems: Thermodynamic trade-off relations and optimal transport for pattern formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16569v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish universal relations between pattern formation and dissipation with a geometric approach to nonequilibrium thermodynamics of deterministic reaction-diffusion systems. We first provide a way to systematically decompose the entropy production rate (EPR) based on the orthogonality of thermodynamic forces, in this way identifying the amount of dissipation caused by each factor. This enables us to extract the excess EPR that genuinely contributes to the time evolution of patterns. We also show that a similar geometric method further decomposes the EPR into detailed contributions, e.g., the dissipation from each point in real or wavenumber space. Second, we relate the excess EPR to the details of the change in patterns through two types of thermodynamic trade-off relations for reaction-diffusion systems: thermodynamic speed limits and thermodynamic uncertainty relations. The former relates dissipation and the speed of pattern formation, and the latter bounds the excess EPR with partial information on patterns, such as specific Fourier components of concentration distributions. In connection with the derivation of the thermodynamic speed limits, we also extend optimal transport theory to reaction-diffusion systems, which enables us to measure the speed of the time evolution. This extension of optimal transport also solves the minimization problem of the dissipation associated with the transition between two patterns, and it constructs energetically efficient protocols for pattern formation. We numerically demonstrate our results using chemical traveling waves in the Fisher-Kolmogorov-Petrovsky-Piskunov equation and changes in symmetry in the Brusselator model. Our results apply to general reaction-diffusion systems and contribute to understanding the relations between pattern formation and unavoidable dissipation.</description>

      <title>Second Law of Thermodynamics without Einstein Relation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17142v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Materials that are constantly driven out of thermodynamic equilibrium, such as active and living systems, typically violate the Einstein relation. This may arise from active contributions to particle fluctuations which are unrelated to the dissipative resistance of the surrounding medium. We show that in these cases the widely used relation between informatic entropy production and heat dissipation does not hold. Consequently, fluctuation relations for the mechanical work, such as the Jarzynski and Crooks theorems, are invalid. We relate the breaking of the correspondence between entropy production and heat dissipation to departure from the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. We propose a temperaturelike variable that restores this correspondence and gives rise to a generalized second law of thermodynamics, whereby the dissipated heat is necessarily non-negative and vanishes at equilibrium. The Clausius inequality, Carnot maximum efficiency theorem, and relation between the extractable work and the change of free energy are recovered as well.</description>

      <title>Consensus-based Distributed Optimization for Multi-agent Systems over Multiplex Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.01875v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multilayer networks provide a more comprehensive framework for exploring real-world and engineering systems than traditional single-layer networks, consisting of multiple interacting networks. However, despite significant research in distributed optimization for single-layer networks, similar progress for multilayer systems is lacking. This paper proposes two algorithms for distributed optimization problems in multiplex networks using the supra-Laplacian matrix and its diffusion dynamics. The algorithms include a distributed saddle-point algorithm and its variation as a distributed gradient descent algorithm. By relating consensus and diffusion dynamics, we obtain the multiplex supra-Laplacian matrix. We extend the distributed gradient descent algorithm for multiplex networks using this matrix and analyze the convergence of both algorithms with several theoretical results. Numerical examples validate our proposed algorithms, and we explore the impact of interlayer diffusion on consensus time. We also present a coordinated dispatch for interdependent infrastructure networks (energy-gas) to demonstrate the application of the proposed framework to real engineering problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.03398v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a family of SO($n$)-symmetric spin chains which generalize the transverse-field Ising chain for $n=1$. These spin chains are defined with Gamma matrices and can be exactly solved by mapping to $n$ species of itinerant Majorana fermions coupled to a static $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge field. Their phase diagrams include a critical point described by the $\mathrm{Spin}(n)_{1}$ conformal field theory as well as two distinct gapped phases. We show that one of the gapped phases is a trivial phase and the other realizes a symmetry-protected topological phase when $n \geq 2$. These two gapped phases are proved to be related to each other by a Kramers-Wannier duality. Furthermore, other elegant structures in the transverse-field Ising chain, such as the infinite-dimensional Onsager algebra, also carry over to our models.</description>

Abstract: Cooperative dynamics are central to our understanding of many phenomena in living and complex systems. However, we lack a universal mechanism to explain the emergence of cooperation. We present a novel framework for modelling social dilemma games with an arbitrary number of players by combining reaction networks, methods from quantum mechanics applied to stochastic complex systems, game theory and stochastic simulations of molecular reactions. Using this framework, we propose a novel and robust mechanism for cooperation based on risk aversion that leads to cooperative behaviour in population games. Rather than individuals seeking to maximise payouts in the long run, individuals seek to obtain a minimum set of resources with a given level of confidence and in a limited time span. We show that this mechanism can lead to the emergence of new equilibria in a range of social dilemma games.</description>

      <title>Theory of robust quantum many-body scars in long-range interacting systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.12504v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum many-body scars (QMBS) are exceptional energy eigenstates of quantum many-body systems associated with violations of thermalization for special non-equilibrium initial states. Their various systematic constructions require fine-tuning of local Hamiltonian parameters. In this work we demonstrate that long-range interacting quantum spin systems generically host robust QMBS. We analyze spectral properties upon raising the power-law decay exponent $\alpha$ of spin-spin interactions from the solvable permutationally-symmetric limit $\alpha=0$. First, we numerically establish that despite spectral signatures of chaos appear for infinitesimal $\alpha$, the towers of $\alpha=0$ energy eigenstates with large collective spin are smoothly deformed as $\alpha$ is increased, and exhibit characteristic QMBS features. To elucidate the nature and fate of these states in larger systems, we introduce an analytical approach based on mapping the spin Hamiltonian onto a relativistic quantum rotor non-linearly coupled to an extensive set of bosonic modes. We analitycally solve for the eigenstates of this interacting impurity model by means of a novel polaron-type canonical transformation, and show their self-consistent localization in large-spin sectors of the original Hamiltonian for $0&lt;\alpha&lt;d$ (with $d$ = spatial dimension of the lattice). Our theory unveils the stability mechanism of such QMBS for arbitrary system size and predicts instances of its breakdown, e.g. near dynamical critical points or in presence of semiclassical chaos, which we verify numerically in long-range quantum Ising chains. As a byproduct, we find a predictive criterion for presence or absence of heating under periodic driving for $0&lt;\alpha&lt;d$, beyond existing Floquet-prethermalization theorems.</description>

Abstract: We combine perturbation theory with analytic and numerical bootstrap techniques to study the critical point of the long-range Ising (LRI) model in two and three dimensions. This model interpolates between short-range Ising (SRI) and mean-field behaviour. We use the Lorentzian inversion formula to compute infinitely many three-loop corrections in the two-dimensional LRI near the mean-field end. We further exploit the exact OPE relations that follow from bulk locality of the LRI to compute infinitely many two-loop corrections near the mean-field end, as well as some one-loop corrections near SRI. By including such exact OPE relations in the crossing equations for LRI we set up a very constrained bootstrap problem, which we solve numerically using SDPB. We find a family of sharp kinks for two- and three-dimensional theories which compare favourably to perturbative predictions, as well as some Monte Carlo simulations for the two-dimensional LRI.</description>

      <title>Meta-plasticity and memory in multi-level recurrent feed-forward networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13967v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Network systems can exhibit memory effects in which the interactions between different pairs of nodes adapt in time, leading to the emergence of preferred connections, patterns, and sub-networks. To a first approximation, this memory can be modelled through a ``plastic'' Hebbian or homophily mechanism, in which edges get reinforced proportionally to the amount of information flowing through them. However, recent studies on glia-neuron networks have highlighted how memory can evolve due to more complex dynamics, including multi-level network structures and ``meta-plastic'' effects that modulate reinforcement. Inspired by those systems, here we develop a simple and general model for the dynamics of an adaptive network with an additional meta-plastic mechanism that varies the rate of Hebbian strengthening of its edge connections. The meta-plastic term acts on a second network level in which edges are grouped together, simulating local, longer time-scale effects. Specifically, we consider a biased random walk on a cyclic feed-forward network. The random walk chooses its steps according to the weights of the network edges. The weights evolve through a Hebbian mechanism modulated by a meta-plastic reinforcement, biasing the walker to prefer edges that have been already explored. We study the dynamical emergence (memorisation) of preferred paths and their retrieval and identify three regimes: one dominated by the Hebbian term, one in which the meta-reinforcement drives memory formation, and a balanced one. We show that, in the latter two regimes, meta-reinforcement allows the retrieval of a previously stored path even after the weights have been reset to zero to erase Hebbian memory.</description>

      <title>The Overlap Gap Property limits limit swapping in QAOA</title>

Abstract: The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is a quantum algorithm designed for Combinatorial Optimization Problem (COP). We show that if a local algorithm is limited in performance at logarithmic depth for a spin glass type COP with an underlying Erd\"os--R\'enyi hypergraph, then a random regular hypergraph exhibits it as well. As such, we re-derived the fact that the average-case value obtained by QAOA for the Max-$q$-XORSAT for even $q\ge 4$ is bounded away from optimality even when the algorithm runs indefinitely if optimised using the so-called tree parameters due to the presence of the Overlap Gap Property (OGP). While this result was proven before, the proof is rather technical compared to ours. In addition, we show that the earlier result implicitly also implies limitation at logarithmic depth $p \le \epsilon \log n$ providing an improvement over limitation at superconstant depth. Lastly, the results suggests that even when sub-optimised, the performance of QAOA on spin glass is equal in performance to classical algorithms in solving the mean field spin glass problem providing further evidence that the conjecture of getting the exact solution under limit swapping for the Sherrington--Kirkpatrick model to be true.</description>

      <title>Inertial active matter with Coulomb friction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06615v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Friction is central to the motion of active (self-propelled) objects such as bacteria, animals, and robots. While in a viscous fluid friction is described by Stokes's law, objects in contact with other solid bodies are often governed by more complex empirical friction laws. Here, we study active particles subject to Coulomb friction using a combination of active granular experiments and simulations, supported by theoretical predictions. The interplay of friction and activity forces induces a rich behavior resulting in three distinct dynamical regimes. While for low activity, Brownian motion is recovered, for large activity we observe a dynamical Stop &amp; Go regime that continuously switches from diffusion and accelerated motion. For greater activity, we observe a super-mobile dynamical regime characterized by a fully accelerated motion which is described by an anomalous scaling of the diffusion coefficient with the activity. These findings cannot be observed with Stokes viscous forces typical of active swimmers but are central in dry active objects.</description>

      <title>Annealing-based approach to solving partial differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17364v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Solving partial differential equations (PDEs) using an annealing-based approach involves solving generalized eigenvalue problems. Discretizing a PDE yields a system of linear equations (SLE). Solving an SLE can be formulated as a general eigenvalue problem, which can be transformed into an optimization problem with an objective function given by a generalized Rayleigh quotient. The proposed algorithm requires iterative computations. However, it enables efficient annealing-based computation of eigenvectors to arbitrary precision without increasing the number of variables. Investigations using simulated annealing demonstrate how the number of iterations scales with system size and annealing time. Computational performance depends on system size, annealing time, and problem characteristics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03433v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of the adaptive Kuramoto model with slow adaptation in the continuum limit, $N\to\infty$. This model is distinguished by dense multistability, where multiple states coexist for the same system parameters. The underlying cause of this multistability is that some oscillators can lock at different phases or switch between locking and drifting depending on their initial conditions. We identify new states, such as two-cluster states. To simplify the analysis we introduce an approximate reduction of the model via row-averaging of the coupling matrix. We derive a self-consistency equation for the reduced model and present a stability diagram illustrating the effects of positive and negative adaptation. Our theoretical findings are validated through numerical simulations of a large finite system. Comparisons to previous work highlight the significant influence of adaptation on synchronization behavior.</description>

      <title>Dynamic thermalization on noisy quantum hardware</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04770v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Relaxation after a global quench is a natural way to probe thermalization in closed quantum systems. When a system relaxes after the quench, thermal observables emerge in the absence of constraints, provided long-time averaging or a large system. We demonstrate a thermalization mechanism based on averaging the observables over realizations of a global quench protocol that does not rely on a system's size or long-time evolution. The quench abruptly establishes all-to-all couplings of random strength in a few-body system and initializes the dynamics. Shortly after the quench, the observables averaged over realizations of random couplings become stationary. The average occupation probabilities of many-body energy states equilibrate toward the Gibbs distribution with a finite positive or negative absolute temperature that depends on the initial state's energy, with the negative temperatures occurring due to the confined spectrum of the system. Running an experiment on an IBM Quantum computer (IBMQ) for four qubits, we report the utility of the digital quantum computer for predicting thermal observables and their fluctuations for positive or negative absolute temperatures. Implementing thermalization on IBMQ, this result facilitates probing the dynamical emergence of thermal equilibrium and, consequently, equilibrium properties of matter at finite temperatures on noisy intermediate-scale quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>Numerical methods and analytic results for one-dimensional strongly interacting spinor gases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06060v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of quantum physics' fundamental, but largely unsolved, problems is the computation of the correlation functions in many-body systems. In this paper we address this problem in the case of one-dimensional spinor gases with repulsive contact interactions in the presence of a confining potential. We take advantage of the fact that in the strong coupling limit, the wavefunction factorizes with the charge degrees of freedom expressed as a Slater determinant of spinless fermions and the spin sector described by a spin chain of Sutherland type with exchange coefficients that depend only on the trapping potential. This factorization is also present in the expressions for the correlation functions. Still, analytical and numerical investigations were hindered by the fact that the local exchange coefficients and the charge component of the correlators are expressed as $N-1$ multidimensional integrals, with $N$ the number of particles, which are notoriously hard to compute using conventional methods. We introduce a new approach to calculating these integrals that is extremely simple, scales polynomially with the number of particles, and is several orders of magnitude faster than the previous methods reported in the literature. This allows us to investigate the static and dynamic properties, temperature dependence, and nonequilibrium dynamics for systems with a larger number of particles than previously considered and discover new phenomena. We show that, contrary to natural expectations, the momentum distribution of strongly interacting trapped spinor gases becomes narrower as we increase the temperature and derive simple determinant representations for the correlators in the spin incoherent regime valid for both equilibrium and nonequilibrium situations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09721v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Analytical results on the correlation functions of strongly correlated many-body systems are rare in the literature and their importance cannot be overstated. We present determinant representations for the space-, time-, and temperature-dependent correlation functions of the strongly interacting one-dimensional Hubbard model in the presence of an external trapping potential. These representations are exact and valid in both equilibrium and nonequilibrium scenarios like the ones initiated by a sudden change of the confinement potential. In addition, they can be implemented numerically very easily significantly outperforming other numerical approaches. As applications of our results we investigate the single particle spectral functions of systems with harmonic trapping and show that dynamical quasicondensation occurs for both fermionic and bosonic spin-$1/2$ systems released from a Mott insulator state.</description>

Abstract: Gravity is derived from an entropic action coupling matter fields with geometry. The fundamental idea is to relate the metric of Lorentzian spacetime to a density matrix and to describe the matter fields topologically, according to a Dirac-K\"ahler description, as the direct sum of a zero-form, a one-form and a two-form. While the geometry of spacetime is defined by its metric, the matter fields can be used to define an alternative metric, the metric induced by the matter fields, which geometrically describes the interplay between spacetime and matter. The proposed entropic action is the quantum relative entropy between the metric of spacetime and the metric induced by the matter fields. The modified Einstein equations obtained from this action reduce to the Einstein equations with zero cosmological constant in the regime of low coupling. By introducing the G-field, which acts as a set of Lagrangian multipliers, the proposed entropic action reduces to a dressed Einstein-Hilbert action with an emergent small and positive cosmological constant only dependent on the G-field. The obtained equations of modified gravity remains second order in the metric and in the G-field. A canonical quantization of this field theory could bring new insights into quantum gravity while further research might clarify the role that the G-field could have for dark matter.</description>

Abstract: There is mounting evidence that species interactions often involve long-term memory, with highly-varying waiting times between successive events and long-range temporal correlations. Accounting for memory undermines the common Markovian assumption, and dramatically impacts key ingredients of population dynamics including birth, foraging, predation, and competition processes. Here, we investigate a critical aspect of population dynamics, namely non-Markovian multi-species competition. This is done in the realm of the zero-sum rock-paper-scissors (zRPS) model that is broadly used in the life sciences to metaphorically describe cyclic competition between three interacting species. We develop a general non-Markovian formalism for multi-species dynamics, allowing us to determine the regions of the parameter space where each species dominates. In particular, when the dynamics are Markovian, the waiting times are exponentially distributed and the fate of the zRPS model in large well-mixed populations follows the so-called ``law of the weakest'' (LOW), predicting that the species with the lowest growth rate is the most likely to prevail. We demonstrate that the survival behavior and LOW of the zRPS model are critically affected by non-exponential waiting time distributions, and especially, by their coefficient of variation. Our findings provide key insight into the influence of long waiting times on non-Markovian evolutionary processes.</description>

Abstract: A complex system with many interacting individuals can be represented by a network consisting of nodes and links representing individuals and pairwise interactions, respectively. However, real-world systems grow with time and include many higher-order interactions. Such systems with higher-order interactions can be well described by a simplicial complex (SC), which is a type of hypergraph, consisting of simplexes representing sets of multiple interacting nodes. Here, capturing the properties of growing real-world systems, we propose a growing random SC (GRSC) model where a node is added and a higher dimensional simplex is established among nodes at each time step. We then rigorously derive various percolation properties in the GRSC. Finally, we confirm that the system exhibits an infinite-order phase transition as higher-order interactions accelerate the growth of the system and result in the advanced emergence of a giant cluster. This work can pave the way for interpreting growing complex systems with higher-order interactions such as social, biological, brain, and technological systems.</description>

Abstract: Quantum resources like entanglement and magic are essential for characterizing the complexity of quantum states. However, when the number of copies of quantum states and the computational time are limited by numbers polynomial in the system size $n$, accurate estimation of the amount of these resources becomes difficult. This makes it impossible to distinguish between ensembles of states with relatively small resources and one that has nearly maximal resources. Such ensembles with small resources are referred to as "pseudo-quantum" ensembles. Recent studies have introduced an ensemble known as the random subset phase state ensemble, which is pseudo-entangled, pseudo-magical, and pseudorandom. While the current state-of-the-art implementation of this ensemble is conjectured to be realized by a circuit with $O(nt)$ depth, it is still too deep for near-term quantum devices to execute for small $t$. In addition, the strict linear dependence on $t$ has only been established as a lower bound on the circuit depth. In this work, we present significantly improved implementations that only require $\omega(\log n)\cdot O(t[\log t]^2)$ depth circuits, which almost saturates the theoretical lower bound. This is also the fastest known for generating pseudorandom states to the best of our knowledge. We believe that our findings will facilitate the implementation of pseudo-ensembles on near-term devices, allowing executions of tasks that would otherwise require ensembles with maximal quantum resources, by generating pseudo-ensembles at a super-polynomially fewer number of entangling and non-Clifford gates.</description>
