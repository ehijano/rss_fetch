      <title>Variational Bayesian Inference for Time-Varying Massive MIMO Channels: Estimation and Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) stands as a key technology for advancing performance metrics such as data rate, reliability, and spectrum efficiency in the fifth generation (5G) and beyond of wireless networks. However, its efficiency depends greatly on obtaining accurate channel state information. This task becomes particularly challenging with increasing user mobility. In this paper, we focus on an uplink scenario in which a massive MIMO base station serves multiple high-mobility users. We leverage variational Bayesian(VB) inference for joint channel estimation and data detection(JED), tailored for time-varying channels. In particular, we use the VB framework to provide approximations of the true posterior distributions. To cover more real-world scenarios, we assume the time correlation coefficients associated with the channels are unknown. Our simulations demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed VB-based approach in tracking these unknown time correlation coefficients. We present two processing strategies within the VB framework: online and block processing strategies. The online strategy offers a low-complexity solution for a given time slot, requiring only the knowledge of the parameters/statistics within that time slot. In contrast, the block processing strategy focuses on the entire communication block and processes all received signals together to reduce channel estimation errors. Additionally, we introduce an interleaved structure for the online processing strategy to further enhance its performance. Finally, we conduct a comparative analysis of our VB approach against the linear minimum mean squared error(LMMSE), the Kalman Filter(KF), and the expectation propagation(EP) methods in terms of symbol error rate(SER) and channel normalized mean squared error(NMSE). Our findings reveal that our VB framework surpasses these benchmarks across the performance metrics.</description>

      <title>Bridging BCI and Communications: A MIMO Framework for EEG-to-ECoG Wireless Channel Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a method to connect human brain and external devices, Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are receiving extensive research attention. Recently, the integration of communication theory with BCI has emerged as a popular trend, offering potential to enhance system performance and shape next-generation communications.
  A key challenge in this field is modeling the brain wireless communication channel between intracranial electrocorticography (ECoG) emitting neurons and extracranial electroencephalography (EEG) receiving electrodes. However, the complex physiology of brain challenges the application of traditional channel modeling methods, leaving relevant research in its infancy. To address this gap, we propose a frequency-division multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) estimation framework leveraging simultaneous macaque EEG and ECoG recordings, while employing neurophysiology-informed regularization to suppress noise interference. This approach reveals profound similarities between neural signal propagation and multi-antenna communication systems. Experimental results show improved estimation accuracy over conventional methods while highlighting a trade-off between frequency resolution and temporal stability determined by signal duration. This work establish a conceptual bridge between neural interfacing and communication theory, accelerating synergistic developments in both fields.</description>

      <title>Near field transmission using Hermite-Gaussian modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: RF transmission in line-of-sight near field based on Hermite-Gaussian (HG) modes is developed. Multiple HG modes are transmitted and received using rectangular antenna arrays to form the basic modes and dimensions for MIMO transmission. Beam steering can be achieved by manipulating the antenna arrays with 3D rotation in the desired EM field. The beam parameters are optimized to minimize the size of the antennas. Simulation is performed for a 300GHz system with free space channel model. Spectrum efficiency up to 294.3bps/Hz can be achieved with 36 HG modes and cross-polarization.</description>

      <title>Cross-layer Integrated Sensing and Communication: A Joint Industrial and Academic Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) enables radio systems to simultaneously sense and communicate with their environment. This paper, developed within the Hexa-X-II project funded by the European Union, presents a comprehensive cross-layer vision for ISAC in 6G networks, integrating insights from physical-layer design, hardware architectures, AI-driven intelligence, and protocol-level innovations. We begin by revisiting the foundational principles of ISAC, highlighting synergies and trade-offs between sensing and communication across different integration levels. Enabling technologies, such as multiband operation, massive and distributed MIMO, non-terrestrial networks, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces, and machine learning, are analyzed in conjunction with hardware considerations including waveform design, synchronization, and full-duplex operation. To bridge implementation and system-level evaluation, we introduce a quantitative cross-layer framework linking design parameters to key performance and value indicators. By synthesizing perspectives from both academia and industry, this paper outlines how deeply integrated ISAC can transform 6G into a programmable and context-aware platform supporting applications from reliable wireless access to autonomous mobility and digital twinning.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking CFAR and CNN-based Peak Detection Algorithms in ISAC under Hardware Impairments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Peak detection is a fundamental task in radar and has therefore been studied extensively in radar literature. However, Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) systems for sixth generation (6G) cellular networks need to perform peak detection under hardware impairments and constraints imposed by the underlying system designed for communications. This paper presents a comparative study of classical Constant False Alarm Rate (CFAR)-based algorithms and a recently proposed Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based method for peak detection in ISAC radar images. To impose practical constraints of ISAC systems, we model the impact of hardware impairments, such as power amplifier nonlinearities and quantization noise. We perform extensive simulation campaigns focusing on multi-target detection under varying noise as well as on target separation in resolution-limited scenarios. The results show that CFAR detectors require approximate knowledge of the operating scenario and the use of window functions for reliable performance. The CNN, on the other hand, achieves high performance in all scenarios, but requires a preprocessing step for the input data.</description>

      <title>Covariance Symmetries Classification in Multitemporal/Multipass PolSAR Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) system, which uses multiple images acquired with different polarizations in both transmission and reception, has the potential to improve the description and interpretation of the observed scene. This is typically achieved by exploiting the polarimetric covariance or coherence matrix associated with each pixel, which is processed to meet a specific goal in Earth observation. This paper presents a design framework for selecting the structure of the polarimetric covariance matrix that accurately reflects the symmetry associated with the analyzed pixels. The proposed methodology leverages both polarimetric and temporal information from multipass PolSAR images to enhance the retrieval of information from the acquired data. To accomplish this, it is assumed that the covariance matrix (of the overall acquired data) is given as the Kronecker product of the temporal and polarimetric covariances. An alternating maximization algorithm, known as the flip-flop method, is then developed to estimate both matrices while enforcing the symmetry constraint on the polarimetric covariance. Subsequently, the symmetry structure classification is formulated as a multiple hypothesis testing problem, which is solved using model order selection techniques. The proposed approach is quantitatively assessed on simulated data, showing its advantages over its competitor, which does not exploit temporal correlations. For example, it reaches accuracies of 94.6% and 92.0% for the reflection and azimuth symmetry classes, respectively, while the competitor achieves 72.5% and 72.6% under the same simulation conditions. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed framework is further demonstrated using measured RADARSAT-2 data, corroborating the results obtained from the simulations.</description>

      <title>MmWave-LoRadar Empowered Vehicular Integrated Sensing and Communication Systems: LoRa Meets FMCW</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) technique is regarded as a key component in future vehicular applications. In this paper, we propose an ISAC solution that integrates Long Range (LoRa) modulation with frequency-modulated continuous wave (FMCW) radar in the millimeter-wave (mmWave) band, called mmWave-LoRadar. This design introduces the sensing capabilities to the LoRa communication with a simplified hardware architecture. Particularly, we uncover the dual discontinuity issues in time and phase of the mmWave-LoRadar received signals, rendering conventional signal processing techniques ineffective. As a remedy, we propose a corresponding hardware design and signal processing schemes under the compressed sampling framework. These techniques effectively cope with the dual discontinuity issues and mitigate the demands for high-sampling-rate analog-to-digital converters while achieving good performance. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the mmWave-LoRadar ISAC system in vehicular communication and sensing networks.</description>

      <title>Unfolded Deep Graph Learning for Networked Over-the-Air Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over-the-air computation (AirComp) has emerged as a promising technology that enables simultaneous transmission and computation through wireless channels. In this paper, we investigate the networked AirComp in multiple clusters allowing diversified data computation, which is yet challenged by the transceiver coordination and interference management therein. Particularly, we aim to maximize the multi-cluster weighted-sum AirComp rate, where the transmission scalar as well as receive beamforming are jointly investigated while addressing the interference issue. From an optimization perspective, we decompose the formulated problem and adopt the alternating optimization technique with an iterative process to approximate the solution. Then, we reinterpret the iterations through the principle of algorithm unfolding, where the channel condition and mutual interference in the AirComp network constitute an underlying graph. Accordingly, the proposed unfolding architecture learns the weights parameterized by graph neural networks, which is trained through stochastic gradient descent approach. Simulation results show that our proposals outperform the conventional schemes, and the proposed unfolded graph learning substantially alleviates the interference and achieves superior computation performance, with strong and efficient adaptation to the dynamic and scalable networks.</description>

      <title>Clustering Rooftop PV Systems via Probabilistic Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10699v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As the number of rooftop photovoltaic (PV) installations increases, aggregators and system operators are required to monitor and analyze these systems, raising the challenge of integration and management of large, spatially distributed time-series data that are both high-dimensional and affected by missing values. In this work, a probabilistic entity embedding-based clustering framework is proposed to address these problems. This method encodes each PV system's characteristic power generation patterns and uncertainty as a probability distribution, then groups systems by their statistical distances and agglomerative clustering. Applied to a multi-year residential PV dataset, it produces concise, uncertainty-aware cluster profiles that outperform a physics-based baseline in representativeness and robustness, and support reliable missing-value imputation. A systematic hyperparameter study further offers practical guidance for balancing model performance and robustness.</description>

      <title>From noisy observables to accurate ground state energies: a quantum classical signal subspace approach with denoising</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10735v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for ground state energy (GSE) estimation that remains robust to highly noisy data and exhibits low sensitivity to hyperparameter tuning. Our approach -- Fourier Denoising Observable Dynamic Mode Decomposition (FDODMD) -- combines Fourier-based denoising thresholding to suppress spurious noise modes with observable dynamic mode decomposition (ODMD), a quantum-classical signal subspace method. By applying ODMD to an ensemble of denoised time-domain trajectories, FDODMD reliably estimates the system's eigenfrequencies. We also provide an error analysis of FDODMD. Numerical experiments on molecular systems demonstrate that FDODMD achieves convergence in high-noise regimes inaccessible to baseline methods under a limited quantum computational budget, while accelerating spectral estimation in intermediate-noise regimes. Importantly, this performance gain is entirely classical, requiring no additional quantum overhead and significantly reducing overall quantum resource demands.</description>

      <title>TACO: Rethinking Semantic Communications with Task Adaptation and Context Embedding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10834v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in generative artificial intelligence have introduced groundbreaking approaches to innovating next-generation semantic communication, which prioritizes conveying the meaning of a message rather than merely transmitting raw data. A fundamental challenge in semantic communication lies in accurately identifying and extracting the most critical semantic information while adapting to downstream tasks without degrading performance, particularly when the objective at the receiver may evolve over time. To enable flexible adaptation to multiple tasks at the receiver, this work introduces a novel semantic communication framework, which is capable of jointly capturing task-specific information to enhance downstream task performance and contextual information. Through rigorous experiments on popular image datasets and computer vision tasks, our framework shows promising improvement compared to existing work, including superior performance in downstream tasks, better generalizability, ultra-high bandwidth efficiency, and low reconstruction latency.</description>

      <title>ToDMA: Large Model-Driven Token-Domain Multiple Access for Semantic Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10946v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Token communications (TokCom) is an emerging generative semantic communication concept that reduces transmission rates by using context and multimodal large language model (MLLM)-based token processing, with tokens serving as universal semantic units across modalities. In this paper, we propose a semantic multiple access scheme in the token domain, referred to as token domain multiple access (ToDMA), where a large number of devices share a token codebook and a modulation codebook for source and channel coding, respectively. Specifically, each transmitter first tokenizes its source signal and modulate each token to a codeword. At the receiver, compressed sensing is employed first to detect active tokens and the corresponding channel state information (CSI) from the superposed signals. Then, the source token sequences are reconstructed by clustering the token-associated CSI across multiple time slots. In case of token collisions, some active tokens cannot be assigned and some positions in the reconstructed token sequences are empty. We propose to use pre-trained MLLMs to leverage the context, predict masked tokens, and thus mitigate token collisions. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed ToDMA framework for both text and image transmission tasks, achieving significantly lower latency compared to context-unaware orthogonal communication schemes, while also delivering superior distortion and perceptual quality compared to state-of-the-art context-unaware non-orthogonal communication methods.</description>

      <title>Determining the utility of ultrafast nonlinear contrast enhanced and super resolution ultrasound for imaging microcirculation in the human small intestine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The regulation of intestinal blood flow is critical to gastrointestinal function. Imaging the intestinal mucosal micro-circulation in vivo has the potential to provide new insight into the gut physiology and pathophysiology. We aimed to determine whether ultrafast contrast enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) and super-resolution ultrasound localisation microscopy (SRUS/ULM) could be a useful tool for imaging the small intestine microcirculation in vivo non-invasively and for detecting changes in blood flow in the duodenum. Ultrafast CEUS and SRUS/ULM were used to image the small intestinal microcirculation in a cohort of 20 healthy volunteers (BMI&lt;25). Participants were imaged while conscious and either having been fasted, or following ingestion of a liquid meal or water control, or under acute stress. For the first time we have performed ultrafast CEUS and ULM on the human small intestine, providing unprecedented resolution images of the intestinal microcirculation. We evaluated flow speed inside small vessels in healthy volunteers (2.78 +/- 0.05 mm/s, mean +/- SEM) and quantified changes in the perfusion of this microcirculation in response to nutrient ingestion. Perfusion of the microvasculature of the intestinal mucosa significantly increased post-prandially (36.2% +/- 12.2%, mean +/- SEM, p&lt;0.05). The feasibility of 3D SRUS/ULM was also demonstrated. This study demonstrates the potential utility of ultrafast CEUS for assessing perfusion and detecting changes in blood flow in the duodenum. SRUS/ULM also proved a useful tool to image the microvascular blood flow in vivo non-invasively and to evaluate blood speed inside the microvasculature of the human small intestine.</description>

      <title>Lightweight LIF-only SNN accelerator using differential time encoding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11252v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer a promising solution to the problem of increasing computational and energy requirements for modern Machine Learning (ML) applications. Due to their unique data representation choice of using spikes and spike trains, they mostly rely on additions and thresholding operations to achieve results approaching state-of-the-art (SOTA) Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). This advantage is hindered by the fact that their temporal characteristic does not map well to already existing accelerator hardware like GPUs. Therefore, this work will introduce a hardware accelerator architecture capable of computing feedforward LIF-only SNNs, as well as an accompanying encoding method to efficiently encode already existing data into spike trains. Together, this leads to a design capable of &gt;99% accuracy on the MNIST dataset, with ~0.29ms inference times on a Xilinx Ultrascale+ FPGA, as well as ~0.17ms on a custom ASIC using the open-source predictive 7nm ASAP7 PDK. Furthermore, this work will showcase the advantages of the previously presented differential time encoding for spikes, as well as provide proof that merging spikes from different synapses given in differential time encoding can be done efficiently in hardware.</description>

      <title>Multi-Fidelity Bayesian Optimization for Nash Equilibria with Black-Box Utilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern open and softwarized systems -- such as O-RAN telecom networks and cloud computing platforms -- host independently developed applications with distinct, and potentially conflicting, objectives. Coordinating the behavior of such applications to ensure stable system operation poses significant challenges, especially when each application's utility is accessible only via costly, black-box evaluations. In this paper, we consider a centralized optimization framework in which a system controller suggests joint configurations to multiple strategic players, representing different applications, with the goal of aligning their incentives toward a stable outcome. To model this interaction, we formulate a Stackelberg game in which the central optimizer lacks access to analytical utility functions and instead must learn them through sequential, multi-fidelity evaluations. To address this challenge, we propose MF-UCB-PNE, a novel multi-fidelity Bayesian optimization strategy that leverages a budget-constrained sampling process to approximate pure Nash equilibrium (PNE) solutions. MF-UCB-PNE systematically balances exploration across low-cost approximations with high-fidelity exploitation steps, enabling efficient convergence to incentive-compatible configurations. We provide theoretical and empirical insights into the trade-offs between query cost and equilibrium accuracy, demonstrating the effectiveness of MF-UCB-PNE in identifying effective equilibrium solutions under limited cost budgets.</description>

      <title>Anomaly Detection for Non-stationary Time Series using Recurrent Wavelet Probabilistic Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, an unsupervised Recurrent Wavelet Probabilistic Neural Network (RWPNN) is proposed, which aims at detecting anomalies in non-stationary environments by modelling the temporal features using a nonparametric density estimation network. The novel framework consists of two components, a Stacked Recurrent Encoder-Decoder (SREnc-Dec) module that captures temporal features in a latent space, and a Multi-Receptive-field Wavelet Probabilistic Network (MRWPN) that creates an ensemble probabilistic model to characterise the latent space. This formulation extends the standard wavelet probabilistic networks to wavelet deep probabilistic networks, which can handle higher data dimensionality. The MRWPN module can adapt to different rates of data variation in different datasets without imposing strong distribution assumptions, resulting in a more robust and accurate detection for Time Series Anomaly Detection (TSAD) tasks in the non-stationary environment. We carry out the assessment on 45 real-world time series datasets from various domains, verify the performance of RWPNN in TSAD tasks with several constraints, and show its ability to provide early warnings for anomalous events.</description>

      <title>Anti-aliasing of neural distortion effects via model fine tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural networks have become ubiquitous with guitar distortion effects modelling in recent years. Despite their ability to yield perceptually convincing models, they are susceptible to frequency aliasing when driven by high frequency and high gain inputs. Nonlinear activation functions create both the desired harmonic distortion and unwanted aliasing distortion as the bandwidth of the signal is expanded beyond the Nyquist frequency. Here, we present a method for reducing aliasing in neural models via a teacher-student fine tuning approach, where the teacher is a pre-trained model with its weights frozen, and the student is a copy of this with learnable parameters. The student is fine-tuned against an aliasing-free dataset generated by passing sinusoids through the original model and removing non-harmonic components from the output spectra. Our results show that this method significantly suppresses aliasing for both long-short-term-memory networks (LSTM) and temporal convolutional networks (TCN). In the majority of our case studies, the reduction in aliasing was greater than that achieved by two times oversampling. One side-effect of the proposed method is that harmonic distortion components are also affected. This adverse effect was found to be model-dependent, with the LSTM models giving the best balance between anti-aliasing and preserving the perceived similarity to an analog reference device.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty quantification with approximate variational learning for wearable photoplethysmography prediction tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photoplethysmography (PPG) signals encode information about relative changes in blood volume that can be used to assess various aspects of cardiac health non-invasively, e.g.\ to detect atrial fibrillation (AF) or predict blood pressure (BP). Deep networks are well-equipped to handle the large quantities of data acquired from wearable measurement devices. However, they lack interpretability and are prone to overfitting, leaving considerable risk for poor performance on unseen data and misdiagnosis. Here, we describe the use of two scalable uncertainty quantification techniques: Monte Carlo Dropout and the recently proposed Improved Variational Online Newton. These techniques are used to assess the trustworthiness of models trained to perform AF classification and BP regression from raw PPG time series. We find that the choice of hyperparameters has a considerable effect on the predictive performance of the models and on the quality and composition of predicted uncertainties. E.g. the stochasticity of the model parameter sampling determines the proportion of the total uncertainty that is aleatoric, and has varying effects on predictive performance and calibration quality dependent on the chosen uncertainty quantification technique and the chosen expression of uncertainty. We find significant discrepancy in the quality of uncertainties over the predicted classes, emphasising the need for a thorough evaluation protocol that assesses local and adaptive calibration. This work suggests that the choice of hyperparameters must be carefully tuned to balance predictive performance and calibration quality, and that the optimal parameterisation may vary depending on the chosen expression of uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Wavelet Analysis of Noninvasive EEG Signals Discriminates Complex and Natural Grasp Types</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09447v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This research aims to decode hand grasps from Electroencephalograms (EEGs) for dexterous neuroprosthetic development and Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) applications, especially for patients with motor disorders. Particularly, it focuses on distinguishing two complex natural power and precision grasps in addition to a neutral condition as a no-movement condition using a new EEG-based BCI platform and wavelet signal processing. Wavelet analysis involved generating time-frequency and topographic maps from wavelet power coefficients. Then, by using machine learning techniques with novel wavelet features, we achieved high average accuracies: 85.16% for multiclass, 95.37% for No-Movement vs Power, 95.40% for No-Movement vs Precision, and 88.07% for Power vs Precision, demonstrating the effectiveness of these features in EEG-based grasp differentiation. In contrast to previous studies, a critical part of our study was permutation feature importance analysis, which highlighted key features for grasp classification. It revealed that the most crucial brain activities during grasping occur in the motor cortex, within the alpha and beta frequency bands. These insights demonstrate the potential of wavelet features in real-time neuroprosthetic technology and BCI applications.</description>

      <title>Target Detection for ISAC with TDD Transmission</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19260v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) poses various challenges that arise from the communication-centric design of cellular networks. One of them is target detection with time division duplex (TDD) transmission used in current 5G and future 6G deployments, where the periodic on-off behavior of the transmitter creates impulsive sidelobes in the radar point spread function (PSF). These can be mistaken for actual targets by conventional peak detection techniques, leading to false alarms. In this work, we first analytically describe the range-Doppler PSF due to TDD windowing. We then propose a computationally efficient method that leverages the PSF to distinguish impulsive sidelobes from valid target peaks. Simulation results and outdoor drone measurements with an ISAC proof of concept demonstrate the capability of our algorithm, showing that it can achieve reliable target detection while limiting false alarms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09870v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conformal phased arrays promise shape-changing properties, multiple degrees of freedom to the scan angle, and novel applications in wearables, aerospace, defense, vehicles, and ships. However, they have suffered from two critical limitations. (1) Although most applications require on-the-move communication and sensing, prior conformal arrays have suffered from dynamic deformation-induced beam pointing errors. We introduce a Dynamic Beam-Stabilized (DBS) processor capable of beam adaptation through on-chip real-time control of fundamental gain, phase, and delay for each element. (2) Prior conformal arrays have leveraged additive printing to enhance flexibility, but conventional printable inks based on silver are expensive, and those based on copper suffer from spontaneous metal oxidation that alters trace impedance and degrades beamforming performance. We instead leverage a low-cost Copper Molecular Decomposition (CuMOD) ink with &lt; 0.1% variation per degree C with temperature and strain and correct any residual deformity in real-time using the DBS processor. Demonstrating unified material and physical deformation correction, our CMOS DBS processor is low power, low-area, and easily scalable due to a tile architecture, thereby ideal for on-device implementations.</description>

      <title>Enriched K-Tier Heterogeneous Satellite Networks Model with User Association Policies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09917v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the rapid evolution of the non-terrestrial networks (NTNs), satellite communication has emerged as a focal area of research due to its critical role in enabling seamless global connectivity. In this paper, we investigate two representative user association policies (UAPs) for multi-tier heterogeneous satellite networks (HetSatNets), namely the nearest satellite UAP and the maximum signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio (max-SINR) satellite UAP, where each tier is characterized by a distinct constellation configuration and transmission pattern. Employing stochastic geometric, we analyze various intermediate system aspects, including the probability of a typical user accessing each satellite tier, the aggregated interference power, and their corresponding Laplace transforms (LTs) under both UAPs. Subsequently, we derive explicit expressions for coverage probability (CP), non-handover probability (NHP), and time delay outage probability (DOP) of the typical user. Furthermore, we propose a novel weighted metric (WM) that integrates CP, NHP, and DOP to explore their trade-offs in the system design. The robustness of the theoretical framework is verified is verified through Monte Carlo simulations calibrated with the actual Starlink constellation, affirming the precision of our analytical approach. The empirical findings underscore an optimal UAP in various HetSatNet scenarios regarding CP, NHP, and DOP..</description>

      <title>Analog Self-Interference Cancellation in Full-Duplex Radios: A Fundamental Limit Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10419v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Analog self-interference cancellation (A-SIC) plays a crucial role in the implementation of in-band full-duplex (IBFD) radios, due to the fact that the inherent transmit (Tx) noise can only be addressed in the analog domain. It is thus natural to ask what the performance limit of A-SIC is in practical systems, which is still quite underexplored so far. In this paper, we aim to close this gap by characterizing the fundamental performance of A-SIC which employs the common multi-tap delay (MTD) architecture, by accounting for the following practical issues: 1) Nonstationarity of the Tx signal; 2) Nonlinear distortions on the Tx signal; 3) Multipath channel corresponding to the self-interference (SI); 4) Maximum amplitude constraint on the MTD tap weights. Our findings include: 1) The average approximation error for the cyclostationary Tx signals is equal to that for the stationary white Gaussian process, thus greatly simplifying the performance analysis and the optimization procedure. 2) The approximation error for the multipath SI channel can be decomposed as the sum of the approximation error for the single-path scenario. By leveraging these structural results, the optimization framework and algorithms which characterize the fundamental limit of A-SIC, by taking into account all the aforementioned practical factors, are provided.</description>

      <title>Finding One's Bearings in the Hyperparameter Landscape of a Wide-Kernel Convolutional Fault Detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15191v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: State-of-the-art algorithms are reported to be almost perfect at distinguishing the vibrations arising from healthy and damaged machine bearings, according to benchmark datasets at least. However, what about their application to new data? In this paper, we confirm that neural networks for bearing fault detection can be crippled by incorrect hyperparameterisation, and also that the correct hyperparameter settings can change when transitioning to new data. The paper combines multiple methods to explain the behaviour of the hyperparameters of a wide-kernel convolutional neural network and how to set them. Since guidance already exists for generic hyperparameters like minibatch size, we focus on how to set architecture-specific hyperparameters such as the width of the convolutional kernels, a topic which might otherwise be obscure. We reflect different data properties by fusing information from seven different benchmark datasets, and our results show that the kernel size in the first layer in particular is sensitive to changes in the data. Looking deeper, we use manipulated copies of one dataset in an attempt to spot why the kernel size sometimes needs to change. The relevance of sampling rate is studied by using different levels of resampling, and spectral content is studied by increasingly filtering out high frequencies. We find that, contrary to speculation in earlier work, high-frequency noise is not the main reason why a wide kernel is preferable to a narrow kernel. Finally, we conclude by stating clear guidance on how to set the hyperparameters of our neural network architecture to work effectively on new data.</description>

      <title>Emerging Technologies in Intelligent Metasurfaces: Shaping the Future of Wireless Communications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19754v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Intelligent metasurfaces have demonstrated great promise in revolutionizing wireless communications. One notable example is the two-dimensional (2D) programmable metasurface, which is also known as reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) to manipulate the wireless propagation environment to enhance network coverage. More recently, three-dimensional (3D) stacked intelligent metasurfaces (SIM) have been developed to substantially improve signal processing efficiency by directly processing analog electromagnetic signals in the wave domain. Another exciting breakthrough is the flexible intelligent metasurface (FIM), which possesses the ability to morph its 3D surface shape in response to dynamic wireless channels and thus achieve diversity gain. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive overview of these emerging intelligent metasurface technologies. We commence by examining recent experiments of RIS and exploring its applications from four perspectives. Furthermore, we delve into the fundamental principles underlying SIM, discussing relevant prototypes as well as their applications. Numerical results are also provided to illustrate the potential of SIM for analog signal processing. Finally, we review the state-of-the-art of FIM technology, discussing its impact on wireless communications and identifying the key challenges of integrating FIMs into wireless networks.</description>

      <title>Toward Foundation Model for Multivariate Wearable Sensing of Physiological Signals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09758v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Time-series foundation models excel at tasks like forecasting across diverse data types by leveraging informative waveform representations. Wearable sensing data, however, pose unique challenges due to their variability in patterns and frequency bands, especially for healthcare-related outcomes. The main obstacle lies in crafting generalizable representations that adapt efficiently across heterogeneous sensing configurations and applications. To address this, we propose NormWear, the first multi-modal and ubiquitous foundation model designed to extract generalized and informative representations from wearable sensing data. Specifically, we design a channel-aware attention mechanism with a shared special liaison [CLS] token to detect signal patterns in both intra-sensor and inter-sensors. This helps the model to extract more meaningful information considering both time series themselves and the relationships between input sensors. This helps the model to be widely compatible with various sensors settings. NormWear is pretrained on a diverse set of physiological signals, including PPG, ECG, EEG, GSR, and IMU, from various public datasets. Our model shows exceptional generalizability across 11 public wearable sensing datasets, spanning 18 applications in mental health, body state inference, vital sign estimation, and disease risk evaluation. It consistently outperforms competitive baselines under zero-shot, partial-shot, and full-shot settings, indicating broad applicability in real-world health applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12721v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent deep learning models for Long-term Time Series Forecasting (LTSF) often emphasize complex, handcrafted designs, while simpler architectures like linear models or MLPs have often outperformed these intricate solutions. In this paper, we revisit and organize the core ideas behind several key techniques, such as redundancy reduction and multi-scale modeling, which are frequently employed in advanced LTSF models. Our goal is to streamline these ideas for more efficient deep learning utilization. To this end, we introduce TimeCapsule, a model built around the principle of high-dimensional information compression that unifies these techniques in a generalized yet simplified framework. Specifically, we model time series as a 3D tensor, incorporating temporal, variate, and level dimensions, and leverage mode production to capture multi-mode dependencies while achieving dimensionality compression. We propose an internal forecast within the compressed representation domain, supported by the Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA), to monitor the learning of predictive representations. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks demonstrate the versatility of our method, showing that TimeCapsule can achieve state-of-the-art performance.</description>

Commonly used wearable Photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors, while effective, suffer from motion artifacts and user discomfort. This study explores the feasibility of non-contact PR assessment using facial video recordings captured by a Red, Green, and Blue (RGB) camera in a driving simulation environment. The proposed approach detects subtle skin color variations due to blood flow and compares extracted PR values against reference measurements from a wearable wristband Empatica E4. We evaluate the impact of Eulerian Video Magnification (EVM) on signal quality and assess statistical differences in PR between age groups. Data obtained from 80 recordings from 64 healthy subjects covering a PR range of 45-160 bpm are analyzed, and signal extraction accuracy is quantified using metrics, such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). Results show that EVM slightly improves PR estimation accuracy, reducing MAE from 6.48 bpm to 5.04 bpm and RMSE from 7.84 bpm to 6.38 bpm. A statistically significant difference is found between older and younger groups with both video-based and ground truth evaluation procedures. Additionally, we discuss Empatica E4 bias and its potential impact on the overall assessment of contact measurements. Altogether the findings demonstrate the feasibility of camera-based PR monitoring in dynamic environments and its potential integration into driving simulators for real-time physiological assessment.</description>

      <title>Whitened Score Diffusion: A Structured Prior for Imaging Inverse Problems</title>

Abstract: Conventional score-based diffusion models (DMs) may struggle with anisotropic Gaussian diffusion processes due to the required inversion of covariance matrices in the denoising score matching training objective \cite{vincent_connection_2011}. We propose Whitened Score (WS) diffusion models, a novel SDE-based framework that learns the Whitened Score function instead of the standard score. This approach circumvents covariance inversion, extending score-based DMs by enabling stable training of DMs on arbitrary Gaussian forward noising processes. WS DMs establish equivalence with FM for arbitrary Gaussian noise, allow for tailored spectral inductive biases, and provide strong Bayesian priors for imaging inverse problems with structured noise. We experiment with a variety of computational imaging tasks using the CIFAR and CelebA ($64\times64$) datasets and demonstrate that WS diffusion priors trained on anisotropic Gaussian noising processes consistently outperform conventional diffusion priors based on isotropic Gaussian noise.</description>
