      <title>On Semi-simplicity Results in Residuated Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop the theory of residuated lattices by introducing and studying several new types of filters and related concepts, including semi-simple filters, essential filters, the socle of a filter, and independent families of filters. Our primary goal is to understand the inner structure of residuated lattices by analyzing these new objects. First, we establish the key properties of simple and essential filters. Next, we then provide both algebraic and topological characterizations for identifying when a filter is simple or essential. Furthermore, we use the concepts of the socle and independent families to delve deeper into the structure of filters and the residuated lattice itself. We also provide several characterizations for semi-simple filters and residuated lattices. A central result shows that for finite residuated lattices, being semi-simple is equivalent to being hyperarchimedean, highlighting the natural connection between these concepts. Complementary results deepening on the understanding of the relation between simple filters and maximal filters in residuated lattices are also established.</description>

      <title>A Topological Rewriting of Tarski's Mereogeometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Qualitative spatial models based on Goodman-style mereology and pseudo-topology often pose problems for advanced geometric reasoning, as they lack true Euclidean geometry and fully developed topological spaces. We address this issue by extending an existing formalization grounded in a dependent type theory using the Coq proof assistant, together with a Whitehead-like point-free interpretation of Tarski's geometry. More precisely, we build on a library called lambda-MM to formalize Tarski's geometry of solids by investigating an algebraic formulation of topological relations on top of the mereological framework. Since Tarski's work is rooted in Lesniewski's mereology, and given that lambda-MM currently provides only a partial implementation of Tarski's geometry, the first part of the paper completes this framework by proving that mereological classes correspond to regular open sets. This yields a topology of individual names that can be extended with Tarski's geometric primitives. Unlike classical approaches in qualitative logical theories, we adopt a solution that derives a full topological space from mereology together with a geometric subspace, thereby increasing the expressiveness of the theory. In the second part, we show that Tarski's geometry forms a subspace of this topology in which regions correspond to restricted classes. We also prove three of Tarski's original postulates, reducing his axiomatic system, and extend the theory with the T2 (Hausdorff) property and additional definitions.</description>

      <title>Diamonds on trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generalize the diamond principle and its variants using the notion of stationarity in trees introduced by Brodsky in [Brodsky, A. M., A theory of stationary trees and the balanced Baumgartner--Hajnal--Todorcevic theorem for trees. \emph{The Bulletin of Symbolic Logic}]. In particular, we show that if $T$ is a nonspecial $\omega_1$-tree, then $\diamondsuit_T \implies \diamondsuit$, and if $T$ is a Suslin tree, then $\diamondsuit_T \iff \diamondsuit$. We also prove that $\diamondsuit^*$ implies $\diamondsuit_T$ (yielding the consistency of $\diamondsuit_T$) and establish the consistency of $\neg\diamondsuit^* + (\forall T\text{ nonspecial }\omega_1\text{-tree }(\diamondsuit_T))$. Finally, we demonstrate that it is consistent with $\diamondsuit$ that there exists a nonspecial $\omega_1$-tree with $(\neg\diamondsuit_T)$, introducing two forcing properties -- $\sigma(S)$-closed and strategically closed in models -- which are preserved under countable support iterations.</description>

      <title>Arithmetical Complexity and Absoluteness of Rigidity Phenomena for Ulam Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyse the logical complexity and absoluteness of a range of natural statements about Ulam sequences and Ulam sets, with particular emphasis on the rigidity phenomena introduced by Hinman, Kuca, Schlesinger and Sheydvasser. For each pair of coprime integers $a&lt;b$ we view the associated Ulam sequence $U(a,b)$ as a recursive subset of $\mathbb{N}$ and consider expansions of the form $(\mathbb{N},+,\mathrm{U}_{a,b})$.
  Our first main result is a uniform coding of Ulam sequences and of the ``interval with periodic mask'' patterns appearing in rigidity conjectures into first-order arithmetic. Using this, we show that the strongest natural rigidity statements, regularity statements (eventual periodicity of gaps), and density statements for $U(a,b)$ are all arithmetical and lie at low levels of the arithmetical hierarchy (e.g.\ $\Sigma^0_2$ or $\Pi^0_3$).
  As a consequence, these statements are absolute between transitive models of $\mathrm{ZFC}$ with the same $\omega$, and in particular their truth value is insensitive to forcing extensions and to additional set-theoretic axioms such as $\mathrm{CH}$ or large cardinal hypotheses. We also initiate a model-theoretic study of the expansions $(\mathbb{N},+,\mathrm{U}_{a,b})$, relating combinatorial rigidity of $U(a,b)$ to potential tameness properties (such as the absence of the independence property) and to interpretability of multiplication.</description>

      <title>Elementary properties of free lattices III: Undecidability of the full theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In [6] we proved that the universal theory of infinite free lattices is (algorithmically) decidable, leaving open the problem of decidability of the full theory of an (infinite) free lattice. We solve this problem by proving that, for every cardinal $\kappa \geq 3$, the first-order theory of the free lattice $\mathbf{F}_\kappa$ is undecidable.</description>

      <title>Absorbed Types and Derivations in Exponential o-Minimal Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I analyze $\mathcal{O}$-weakly immediate and $\mathcal{O}$-residual types in an o-minimal expansion of an ordered field $\mathbb{E}$, where $\mathcal{O}$ is a convex valuation ring. The main result is a characterization of those exponential theories $T$ such that for all $(\mathbb{E}, \mathcal{O})\models T_{\mathrm{convex}}$ the image of any $\mathcal{O}$-weakly immediate type is given by some composition of translations, sign changes and exponential, of some \emph{possibly different} $\mathcal{O}$-weakly immediate type. I call these theories \emph{transserial} and they encompass simply exponential theories such as $T_{\exp}$ and $T_{an, \exp}$. A consequence of the analysis is that there are no counterexamples to \emph{Tressl's signature-alternative} (cf [15]) in models of transserial theories admitting an Archimedean prime model.
  The characterization has at its core some arguments that use very few but fundamental properties of the valued differential field of germs at a cut in an o-minimal structure. These are abstracted in some conditions of compatibility between the derivation and the order or the derivation and the valuation, both ultimately stemming from the mean-value-theorem in o-minimal structures. I develop some basic theory around these notions and observe that in the case of few constants (i.e.\ when the valuation ring contains the constants) these notions specialize to notions thoroughly studied in arXiv:1509.02588</description>

      <title>A Logspace Constructive Proof of L=SL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We formalize the proof of Reingold's Theorem that SL=L [Rei05] in the theory of bounded arithmetic VL, which corresponds to ``logspace reasoning''. As a consequence, we get that VL=VSL, where VSL is the theory of bounded arithmetic for ``symmetric-logspace reasoning''. This resolves in the affirmative an old open question from Kolokolova [Kol05] (see also Cook-Nguyen [NC10]).
  Our proof relies on the Rozenman-Vadhan alternative proof of Reingold's Theorem ([RV05]). To formalize this proof in VL, we need to avoid reasoning about eigenvalues and eigenvectors (common in both original proofs of SL=L). We achieve this by using some results from Buss-Kabanets-Kolokolova-Kouck\'y [Bus+20] that allow VL to reason about graph expansion in combinatorial terms.</description>

      <title>A small remark on small-dimensional normed barrelled spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13355v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Combining the methods of Brian and Stuart with the classical Dvoretzky theorem, we show that no infinite-dimensional Banach space contains a barrelled subspace of (algebraic) dimension $&lt;\mbox{cov}(\mathcal{N})$, the covering number of the Lebesgue null ideal $\mathcal{N}$. Consequently, every infinite-dimensional normed barrelled space has dimension $\ge\mbox{cov}(\mathcal{N})$ and it is consistent with ZFC that no Banach space contains a barrelled subspace of dimension equal to the bounding number $\mathfrak{b}$.</description>

      <title>A monoidal category of dependently sorted algebraic theories I: syntax</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This is the first of a pair of papers where we construct and investigate a closed monoidal structure on the category of generalized algebraic theories (in the sense of Cartmell).
  In the present text, as a starting point, we define the tensor product, $A \otimes B$, between two generalized algebraic theories $A$ and $B$. This is done syntactically via an algorithm that uses the axioms of $A$ and $B$ in a recursive manner to produce those of $A \otimes B$. We provide examples of known structures that are recovered by our construction, such as tensor products of Lawvere theories, "cellular" products of dependent type signatures, and theories of diagrams and of displayed structures. It will be verified in the second volume that, as suggested by these special cases, the category of family-valued models $\text{Mod}(A \otimes B,\text{Fam})$ is isomorphic to $\text{Mod}(A,\textbf{Mod}(B))$ and to $\text{Mod}(B,\textbf{Mod}(A))$ for certain contextual categories $\textbf{Mod}(A)$ and $\textbf{Mod}(B)$ whose underlying categories are equivalent to $\text{Mod}(A,\text{Fam})$ and to $\text{Mod}(B,\text{Fam})$, respectively. Moreover, the cellular structure of the tensor product is obtained by combining, via a pushout-product operation, those of the two theories.
  We also construct a functor $\otimes_{A,B}:\mathcal C(A) \times \mathcal C(B) \rightarrow \mathcal C(A \otimes B)$ comparing the associated contextual categories, and describe isomorphisms of the forms $(A \otimes B) \otimes C \cong A \otimes (B \otimes C)$ and $A \otimes B \cong B \otimes A$. In the sequel paper we will describe a universal property of $\otimes_{A,B}$, which will induce functoriality of the tensor product and thus allow us to check the monoidal category conditions.</description>

      <title>On first order amenability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.08306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2004.08306v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of first order amenability, as a property of a first order theory $T$: every complete type over $\emptyset$, in possibly infinitely many variables, extends to an automorphism-invariant global Keisler measure in the same variables. Amenability of $T$ follows from amenability of the (topological) group $Aut(M)$ for all sufficiently large $\aleph_{0}$-homogeneous countable models $M$ of $T$ (assuming $T$ to be countable), but is radically less restrictive.
  First, we study basic properties of amenable theories, giving many equivalent conditions. Then, applying a version of the stabilizer theorem from [Amenability, connected components, and definable actions; E. Hrushovski, K. Krupi\'{n}ski, A. Pillay], we prove that if $T$ is amenable, then $T$ is G-compact, namely Lascar strong types and Kim-Pillay strong types over $\emptyset$ coincide. This extends and essentially generalizes a similar result proved via different methods for $\omega$-categorical theories in [Amenability, definable groups, and automorphism groups; K. Krupi\'{n}ski, A. Pillay] . In the special case when amenability is witnessed by $\emptyset$-definable global Keisler measures (which is for example the case for amenable $\omega$-categorical theories), we also give a different proof, based on stability in continuous logic.
  Parallel (but easier) results hold for the notion of extreme amenability.</description>

      <title>$T$-convexity, Weakly Immediate Types, and $T$-$\lambda$-Spherical Completions of o-minimal Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07646v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well known that ordered exponential fields with a compatible non-trivial valuation cannot be spherically complete, but there are some that are ``complete enough''. This paper gives analogues of Kaplansky's theorem on maximally valued fields that hold for a suitable class of elementary extensions of some ordered exponential fields with a compatible valuation. More precisely it does so for models of any theory $T_{\text{convex}}$ given by the expansion of a fixed complete o-minimal theory of ordered fields $T$, by a predicate $\mathcal{O}$ for a non-trivial $T$-convex valuation ring. For $\lambda$ an uncountable cardinal, say that a unary type $p(x)$ over a model of $T_{\text{convex}}$ is \emph{$\lambda$-bounded weakly immediate} if its cut is defined by an empty intersection of fewer than $\lambda$ many nested valuation balls. Call an elementary extension \emph{$\lambda$-bounded wim-constructible} if it is obtained as a transfinite composition of extensions each generated by one element whose type is $\lambda$-bounded weakly immediate. I show that $\lambda$-bounded wim-constructible extensions do not extend the residue-field sort and that any two wim-constructible extensions can be amalgamated in an extension which is again $\lambda$-bounded wim-constructible over both. A consequence of this is that given an uncountable cardinal $\lambda$, every model of $T_{\text{convex}}$ has a unique-up-to-isomorphism $\lambda$-spherically complete $\lambda$-bounded wim-constructible extension providing an analogue of Kaplansky's theorem. I call this extension the $T$-$\lambda$-spherical completion. Another consequence is that $T_{\mathrm{convex}}$ is \emph{definably spherically complete}. When $T$ is power bounded wim-constructible extensions are just the immediate extensions. I discuss the example of power bounded theories expanded by $\exp$ (\emph{simply exponential} theories).</description>

Abstract: We investigate a quantitative variant of the classic Two Doors logic puzzle, in which the answer space is no longer binary, for example when the goal is to recover a numerical fact (such as one's true weight) rather than choose between two doors. The puzzle retains the original structure: one agent always tells the truth, the other always lies. Our central contribution is to identify a class of self-referential prompts that successfully extract the correct quantitative answer under minimal assumptions. We also explore how well does \texttt{ChatGPT} does in reasoning for this problem which is just a little bit out of distribution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.08934v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Our central observation is that unbounded additive recurrence establishes a homomorphism between $\mathbb{N}$ and Modus Ponens in a constructive sense. By finding sums of nonconsecutive Fibonacci indices, each inference step corresponds to a geometric constraint whose verification requires $O(M(\log n))$ bit-operations. Logical entailment can be interpreted constructively as arc-closures under $\Phi$-scaling, offering a bridge between additive combinatorics, proof theory, and symbolic computation.</description>

      <title>Compactness for small cardinals in mathematics: principles, consequences, and limitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27618v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss some well-known compactness principles for uncountable structures of small regular sizes ($\omega_n$ for $2 \le n&lt;\omega$, $\aleph_{\omega+1}$, $\aleph_{\omega^2+1}$, etc.), consistent from weakly compact (the size-restricted versions) or strongly compact or supercompact cardinals (the unrestricted versions). We divide the principles into logical principles (various tree properties) and mathematical principles, which directly postulate compactness for structures like groups, graphs, or topological spaces (for instance, countable chromatic and color compactness of graphs, compactness of abelian groups, $\Delta$-reflection, Fodor-type reflection principle, and Rado's Conjecture).
  We focus on indestructibility, or preservation, of these principles in forcing extensions. Using the existing preservation results we observe that many traditional problems such as Suslin Hypothesis, Whitehead's Conjecture, Kaplansky's Conjecture, and Baumagartner's Axiom, are independent from some of the strongest forms of compactness at $\omega_2$. Additionally, we observe that Rado's Conjecture plus $2^\omega = \omega_2$ is consistent with the negative solutions of some of these conjectures (as they hold in $V = L$), verifying that they hold in suitable Mitchell models.
  Finally, we comment on whether the compactness principles under discussion are good candidates for axioms. We consider their consequences and the existence or non-existence of convincing unifications (such as Martin's Maximum or Rado's Conjecture). This part is a modest follow-up to the articles by Foreman ``Generic large cardinals: new axioms for mathematics?'' (1998) and Feferman et al. ``Does mathematics need new axioms?''
