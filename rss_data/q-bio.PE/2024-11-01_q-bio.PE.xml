      <title>Basic offspring number and robust feedback design for the biological control of vectors by sterile insect release technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sterile Insect Technique (SIT) is a promising control method against insect pests and insect vectors. It consists in releasing males previously sterilized in laboratory, in order to reduce or eliminate a specific wild population. We study in this paper the implementation by feedback control of SIT-based elimination campaign of Aedes mosquitoes. We provide state-feedback and output-feedback control laws and establish their convergence, as well as their robustness properties. In this design procedure, a pivotal role is played by the average number of secondary female insects produced by a single female insect, called basic offspring number, and by the use of properties of monotone systems. Illustrative simulations are provided.</description>

      <title>The Superstatistics of confined ants: From serenity to panic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.03236</link>
      <description>arXiv:1904.03236v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nonequilibrium systems with strong parameter fluctuations are difficult to describe with ordinary Statistical Mechanics. Superstatistics -- that can be seen as statistics of an statistics -- has emerged as a tool able to describe these complex systems. It has been successfully applied, for example, to hydrodynamic turbulence, internal convection, and even DNA architecture, but not to macroscopic biological systems. Here we present fully controlled laboratory experiments in confined ants both in normal and in "panic" conditions. Using a data-driven superstatistical model, we reproduce key signatures of their motion: from non-Gaussian velocity distributions driven by a Log-normal diffusion coefficient, to clustering away from the source of danger information.</description>

      <title>A stochastic explanation for observed local-to-global foraging states in Caenorhabditis elegans</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.15174v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Abrupt changes in behavior can often be associated with changes in underlying behavioral states. When placed off food, the foraging behavior of C. elegans can be described as a change between an initial local-search behavior characterized by a high rate of reorientations, followed by a global-search behavior characterized by sparse reorientations. This is commonly observed in individual worms, but when numerous worms are characterized, only about half appear to exhibit this behavior. We propose an alternative model that predicts both abrupt and continuous changes to reorientation that does not rely on behavioral states. This model is inspired by molecular dynamics modeling that defines the foraging reorientation rate as a decaying parameter. By stochastically sampling from the probability distribution defined by this rate, both abrupt and gradual changes to reorientation rates can occur, matching experimentally observed results. Crucially, this model does not depend on behavioral states or information accumulation. Even though abrupt behavioral changes do occur, they may not necessarily be indicative of abrupt changes in behavioral states, especially when abrupt changes are not universally observed in the population.</description>
