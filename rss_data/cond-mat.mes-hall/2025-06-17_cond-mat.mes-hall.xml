      <title>Quasiclassical electron transport in topological Weyl semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weyl fermions are powerful yet simple entities that connect geometry, topology, and physics. While their existence as fundamental particles is still uncertain, growing evidence shows they emerge as quasiparticles in special materials called Weyl semimetals (WSMs). These materials possess unique electronic properties and hold promise for future technologies. This thesis investigates how electrons behave in WSMs, focusing on the chiral anomaly (CA). The CA remains central in condensed matter physics, typically observed via longitudinal magnetoconductance (LMC) and the planar Hall effect (PHE). Although finite intervalley scattering can reverse the LMC sign, we identify another mechanism: a smooth cutoff in the linear dispersion, inherent to real Weyl materials, introduces nonlinearity that causes negative LMC even without intervalley scattering. Using a lattice model of tilted Weyl fermions and the Boltzmann approximation, we explore LMC and PHE, mapping phase diagrams in key parameter spaces. We also study the effects of strain, which acts as an axial magnetic field and influences diffusive transport. Our results show that strain-induced gauge fields can cause a strong LMC sign-reversal, unlike external fields which need intervalley scattering. The interplay of strain and external fields produces rich LMC behavior. We further predict distinct PHE responses due to strain. Finally, we extend the study to nonlinear transport, developing a theory for the chiral anomaly-induced nonlinear Hall effect (CNLHE). In Weyl semimetals, the nonlinear Hall conductivity shows nonmonotonic behavior and strong sign-reversal with scattering. In contrast, spin-orbit coupled metals show consistently negative, quadratic responses. We also explore pseudospin-1 fermions, finding enhanced sensitivity to internode scattering, revealing new transport signatures and broadening the scope of chiral anomaly studies.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast dynamics of quantum matter driven by time-energy entangled photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of quantum matter interacting with time-energy entangled photons. We consider the stimulation of a collective mode of a two-dimensional material by means of one of the two partners of a time-energy entangled pair of photons. Using an exactly solvable model, we analyze the out-of-equilibrium properties of both light and matter degrees of freedom, and show how entanglement in the incident photons deeply modifies relevant time scales of the light-matter interaction process. We find that entanglement strongly suppresses the delay between the transmission and absorption events, which become synchronous in the limit of strongly entangled wave packets. By comparing numerical simulations with analytic modeling, we trace back this behavior to the representation of entangled wave packets in terms of a superposition of multiple train pulses containing an increasing number of ultrashort non-entangled packets. As a result, we show that the entangled driving allows the creation of a matter excitation on a time scale shorter than the temporal width of the pulse. Eventually, by analyzing temporal correlations of the excited matter degrees of freedom, we show that driving with entangled photons imprints characteristic temporal correlations of time-energy entangled modes in the matter degree of freedom.</description>

      <title>Distinguishing features of longitudinal magnetoconductivity for a Rarita-Schwinger-Weyl node</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The band-degeneracy points in the Brillouin zones of chiral crystals exist in multiple avatars, with the high-symmetry points being able to host multifold nodes of distinct characters. A class of such crystals, assisted by the spin-orbit coupling, harbours fourfold degeneracy in the form of Rarita-Schwinger-Weyl node (RSWN) at the $\Gamma$-point. Our aim is to explore the nature of longitudinal magnetoconductivity, arising from applying collinear electric and magnetic fields, for such systems. Adjusting the chemical potential to lie near the intrinsic energy-location of the RSWN, the multifold nature of the RSWN is revealed by an interplay of intraband and interband scatterings, which would not arise in twofold degeneracies like the conventional Weyl nodes. The current study fills up the much-needed gap in obtaining the linear response from an exact computation, rather than the insufficient relaxation-time approximation employed earlier.</description>

      <title>N\'eel vector controlled exceptional contours in $p$-wave magnet-ferromagnet junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian systems can host exceptional degeneracies where not only the eigenvalues, but also the corresponding eigenvectors coalesce. Recently, $p$-wave magnets have been introduced, which are characterized by their unusual odd parity. In this work, we propose the emergence of non-Hermitian degeneracies at the interface of $p$-wave magnets and ferromagnets. We demonstrate that this setup offers a remarkable tunability allowing realization of exceptional lines and rings, which can be controlled via the orientation of the $p$-wave N\'eel vector. We present the origin of these exceptional contours based on symmetry, and characterize them using phase rigidity. Our works puts forward a versatile platform to realize controllable non-Hermitian degeneracies at odd parity magnetic interfaces.</description>

      <title>Tunable corner states in topological insulators with long-range hoppings and diverse shapes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we develop a theoretical framework for the control of corner modes in higher-order topological insulators (HOTIs) featuring long-range hoppings and diverse geometries, enabling precise tunability of their spatial positions. First, we demonstrate that the locations of corner states can be finely tuned by varying long-range hoppings in a circular HOTI, as revealed by a detailed edge theory analysis and the condition of vanishing Dirac mass. Moreover, we show that long-range hoppings along different directions (e.g., $x$ and $y$) have distinct effects on the positioning of corner states. Second, we investigate HOTIs with various polygonal geometries and find that the presence and location of corner modes depend sensitively on the shape. In particular, a corner hosts a localized mode if the Dirac masses of its two adjacent edges have opposite signs, while no corner mode emerges if the masses share the same sign. Our findings offer a versatile approach for the controlled manipulation of corner modes in HOTIs, opening new avenues for the design and implementation of higher-order topological materials.</description>

      <title>Half-integer thermal conductance in the absence of Majorana mode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Considering a range of candidate quantum phases of matter, half-integer thermal conductance ($\kappa_{\text{th}}$) is believed to be an unambiguous evidence of non-Abelian states. It has been long known that such half-integer values arise due to the presence of Majorana edge modes, representing a significant step towards topological quantum computing platforms. Here we break this long-standing paradigm, reporting a comprehensive theoretical and experimental study where half-integer two-terminal thermal conductance plateau is realized employing Abelian phases. Our proposed setup features a confined geometry of bilayer graphene, interfacing distinct particle-like and hole-like integer quantum Hall states. Each segment of the device exhibits full charge and thermal equilibration. Our approach is amenable to generalization to other quantum Hall platforms, and may give rise to other values of fractional (electrical and thermal) quantized transport. Our study demonstrates that the observation of robust non-integer values of thermal conductance can arise as a manifestation of mundane equilibration dynamics as opposed to underlying non-trivial topology.</description>

      <title>Information dynamics, natural computing and Maxwell's demon in two skyrmions system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The probabilistic information flow and natural computational capability of a system with two magnetic skyrmions at room temperature have been experimentally evaluated. Based on this evaluation, an all-solid-state built-in Maxwell's demon operating at room temperature is also proposed. Probabilistic behavior has gained attention for its potential to enable unconventional computing paradigms. However, information propagation and computation in such systems are more complex than in conventional computers, making their visualization essential. In this study, a two-skyrmion system confined within a square potential well at thermal equilibrium was analyzed using information thermodynamics. Transfer entropy and the time derivative of mutual information were employed to investigate the information propagation speed, the absence of a Maxwell's demon in thermal equilibrium, and the system's non-Markovian properties. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that the system exhibits a small but finite computational capability for the nonlinear XOR operation, potentially linked to hidden information in the non-Markovian system. Based on these experiments and analyses, an all-solid-state built-in Maxwell's demon utilizing the two-skyrmion system and operating at room temperature is proposed.</description>

      <title>Topological phase transitions in strained Lieb-Kagome lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lieb and Kagome lattices exhibit two-dimensional topological insulator behavior with $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological classification when considering spin-orbit coupling. In this study, we used a general tight-binding Hamiltonian with a morphological control parameter $\theta$ to describe the Lieb ($\theta=\pi/2$), Kagome ($\theta=2\pi/3$), and transition lattices ($\pi/2&lt;\theta&lt;2\pi/3$) while considering intrinsic spin-orbit (ISO) coupling. We systematically investigated the effects of shear and uniaxial strains, applied along different crystallographic directions, on the electronic spectrum of these structures. Our findings reveal that these deformations can induce topological phase transitions by modifying the structural lattice angle associated with the interconversibility process between Lieb and Kagome, the amplitude of the strain, and the magnitude of the ISO coupling. These transitions are confirmed by the evolution of Berry curvature and by changes in the Chern number when the gap closes. Additionally, by analyzing hypothetical strain scenarios in which the hopping and ISO coupling parameters remain intentionally unchanged, our results demonstrated that the strain-induced phase transitions arise from changes in the hopping and ISO coupling parameters.</description>

      <title>Statistical analysis of electron-induced switching of a spin-crossover complex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin-crossover complexes exhibit two stable configurations with distinct spin states. The investigation of these molecules using low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy has opened new perspectives for understanding the associated switching mechanisms at the single-molecule level. While the role of tunneling electrons in driving the spin-state switching has been clearly evidenced, the underlying microscopic mechanism is not completely understood. In this study, we investigate the electron-induced switching of [Fe(H$_2$B(pz)(pypz))$_2$] (pz = pyrazole, pypz = pyridylpyrazole) adsorbed on Ag(111). The current time traces show transitions between two current levels corresponding to the two spin states. We extract switching rates from these traces by analyzing waiting-time distributions. Their sample-voltage dependence can be explained within a simple model in which the switching is triggered by a transient charging of the molecule. The comparison between experimental data and theoretical modeling provides estimates for the energies of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals, which were so far experimentally inaccessible. Overall, our approach offers new insights into the electron-induced switching mechanism and predicts enhanced switching rates upon electronic decoupling of the molecule from the metallic substrate, for example by introducing an ultrathin insulating layer.</description>

      <title>Emergent topology in thin films of nodal line semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate finite-size topological phases in thin films of nodal line semimetals (co-dimension 2) in three dimensions. By analyzing the hybridization of drumhead surface states, we demonstrate that such systems can transition into either a lower-dimensional nodal line state (co-dimension 1) or a fully gapped trivial phase. Additionally, we explore the hybridization of bulk states along the nodal loop when the system is finite in directions parallel to the loop's plane. This generally results in a topologically nontrivial gap. In films finite along a single in-plane direction, a partial gap opens, giving rise to two-dimensional Weyl cones characterized by a one-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}$ invariant. When the system is finite along both in-plane directions, a fully gapped phase appears, distinguished by a $\mathbb{Z}$ invariant whose value increases with film thickness. We further discuss the bulk-boundary correspondence associated with these emergent topological phases.</description>

      <title>Searching for topological semi-complete bandgap in elastic truss lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13601v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gapless topological phases have attracted significant interest across both quantum and classical systems owing to their novel physics and promising applications. However, the search for ideal gapless topological nodes inside a clear bandgap is still lacking in elastic systems. The degenerate points are always hidden in the trivial bulk bands due to the intricate elastic modes involved. Here, we find a topological semi-complete bandgap in a three-dimensional elastic truss lattice by tuning a supporting rod, which exhibits a complete bandgap except for the inevitable topological degenerate points. Furthermore, we experimentally map the topological semi-complete bandgap and the inside nontrivial surface state arcs with a scanning laser vibrometer. The introduced scheme provides a systematic approach for the idealization of semi-complete bandgaps and thus may significantly advance the practical utility of topological phases in mechanical engineering domains.</description>

      <title>Observing the Birth of Rydberg Exciton Fermi Polarons on a Moire Fermi Sea</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The optical spectra of two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors are dominated by tightly bound excitons and trions. In the low doping limit, trions are often described as three-body quasiparticles consisting of two electrons and one hole or vice versa. However, trions are more rigorously understood as quasiparticles arising from the interaction between an exciton and excitation of the Fermi sea - referred to as exciton Fermi polaron. Here we employ pump-probe spectroscopy to directly observe the formation of exciton Fermi polarons in a model system composed of a WSe2 monolayer adjacent to twisted bilayer graphene (tBLG). Following the pump-injection of Rydberg excitons in WSe2, a time-delayed probe pulse tracks the development of Rydberg exciton Fermi polarons as interactions with localized carriers in the tBLG moire superlattice evolve. Both the exciton Fermi polaron relaxation rate and binding energy are found to increase with electron or hole density. Our findings provide insight into the optical response of fundamental excitations in 2D Van der Waals systems and reveal how many-body interactions give rise to emergent quasiparticles.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric Effects Underlying Dynamic Heterogeneity in Miscible Blends of Poly(methyl methacrylate) with Poly(ethylene oxide)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12143v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emergence of spatially variable local dynamics, or dynamic heterogeneity, is common in multicomponent polymer systems. Such heterogeneity is understood to arise from differences between the intrinsic dynamical fluctuations associated with one component versus another. However, the nature of the dynamic coupling between these components and how it depends on composition, temperature, and environmental fluctuations is not fully understood. Here, we use molecular dynamics simulations to characterize nanoscale dynamic heterogeneity in miscible blends of polyethylene oxide (PEO) and polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) as a function of both temperature and blend composition. Probed over timescales of 100~ps, local PMMA segmental dynamics in blends align with neat PMMA when normalized by $T_\text{g}$, whereas PEO exhibits enhanced mobility caused by free-volume effects. The effects of dynamical coupling are found to be asymmetric between the extent of enhancement to PMMA and suppression of PEO dynamics based on analysis of local environment composition within blends. Asymmetric effects in the melt state are also identified over longer timescales according to a Rouse mode analysis over larger sub-chains for each species. These results provide fundamental insights into how dynamic heterogeneity manifests at the nanoscale, across conditions and compositions in miscible polymer blends. They establish a foundation for exploring whether such asymmetries are generalizable and how dynamic heterogeneity can be tuned through temperature, composition, and morphology.</description>

      <title>Thermal state preparation by repeated interactions at and beyond the Lindblad limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12166v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the nature of thermalization dynamics and the associated preparation (simulation) time under the repeated interaction protocol uncovering a generic anomalous, Mpemba-like trend. As a case study, we focus on a three-level system and analyze its dynamics in two complementary regimes, where the system-ancilla interaction strength is either large or small. Focusing on the estimation of the simulation time, we derive closed-form expressions for the minimum number of collisions, or minimal simulation time, required to achieve a thermal state, which is within $\epsilon$ distance to the target thermal state. At zero temperature, we analytically identify a set of points (interaction strength $\times$ their duration) that minimize the simulation time. At nonzero temperature, we observe a Mpemba-like effect: Starting from a maximally mixed state, thermalization to an intermediate-temperature state takes longer than to a lower-temperature one. We provide an accurate analytical approximation for this phenomenon and demonstrate its occurrence in larger systems and under randomized interaction strengths. The prevalence of the Mpemba effect in thermal state preparation presents a significant challenge for preparing states in large systems, an open problem calling for new strategies.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study fractional quantum Hall states in double layer systems that can be interpreted as exciton condensates of composite fermions. An electron in one layer is dressed by two fluxes from the same layer and two fluxes from the other layer to become composite fermions that form effective Landau levels. It is found that two types of composite fermion exciton condensates could occur. In the first type ones, all effective levels are partially occupied and excitonic correlations are present between composite fermions in the same effective level. In the second type ones, composite fermions in the topmost effective levels of the two layers form exciton condensate whereas those in lower effective levels are independent. The electric transport signatures of these states are analyzed. We demonstrate using numerical calculations that some composite fermion exciton condensates can be realized in microscopic models that are relevant for graphene and transition metal dichalcogenides. For a fixed total filling factor, an exciton condensate may only be realized when the electron densities in the two layers belong to a certain range. It is possible that two types of states appear at the same total filling factor in different ranges. These results shed light on recent experimental observations and also suggest some promising future directions.</description>

      <title>Statistical Description of Fermi System over a Surface in a Uniform External Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12608v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A statistical approach to the description of the thermodynamic properties of the Fermi particle system occupying a half-space over a plane of finite size in a uniform external field is proposed. The number of particles per unit area is assumed to be arbitrary, in particular, small. General formulas are obtained for entropy, energy, thermodynamic potential, heat capacities under various conditions and the distribution of the particle number density over the surface. In the continuum limit of a large surface area, the temperature dependences of heat capacities and density distribution are calculated. The cases of gravitational and electric fields are considered.</description>

      <title>Interface-controlled antiferromagnetic tunnel junctions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.12715v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) are the key building blocks of high-performance spintronic devices. While conventional MTJs rely on ferromagnetic (FM) materials, employing antiferromagnetic (AFM) compounds can significantly increase operation speed and packing density. Current prototypes of AFM tunnel junctions (AFMTJs) exploit antiferromagnets either as spin-filter insulating barriers or as metal electrodes supporting bulk spin-dependent currents. Here, we highlight a largely overlooked AFMTJ prototype, where bulk-spin-degenerate electrodes with an A-type AFM stacking form magnetically uncompensated interfaces, enabling spin-polarized tunneling currents and a sizable tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) effect. Using first-principles quantum-transport calculations and the van der Waals (vdW) metal Fe$_{4}$GeTe$_{2}$ as a representative A-type AFM electrode, we demonstrate a large negative TMR arising solely from the alignment of interfacial magnetic moments. This prototype of AFMTJs can also be realized with various non-vdW A-type AFM metals that support roughness-insensitive surface magnetization. Beyond TMR, AFMTJs based on A-type antiferromagnets allow convenient switching of the N\'eel vector, opening a new paradigm for AFM spintronics that leverages spin-dependent properties at AFM interfaces.</description>

      <title>Optimizing optical properties of bilayer PtSe$_2$: the role of twist angle and hydrostatic pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional van der Waals materials offer exceptional tunability in their electronic properties. In this paper, we explore how twisting and hydrostatic pressure can be leveraged to engineer the electronic and optical characteristics of bilayer PtSe$_2$. Using state-of-the-art first-principles density functional methods, we calculate the electronic band structure and the imaginary part of the dielectric function across multiple twist angles and pressure values. We find, that at the twist angle $\theta=13.17^\circ$, bilayer PtSe$_2$, which is intrinsically an indirect semiconductor, transforms into a direct-gap semiconductor. Moreover, we demonstrate that hydrostatic out-of-plane pressure boosts near-infrared optical activity, further expanding the functional potential of PtSe$_2$ bilayers. The demonstrated high tunability of electronic and optical properties by twisting and pressure opens new application directions of PtSe$_2$ in optoelectronics.</description>

      <title>Tunable plasmon modes and topological transitions in single- and bilayer semi-Dirac materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12807v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the plasmonic response of single- and bilayer semi-Dirac materials under the influence of a tunable parameter $\delta$ that governs topological transitions via Dirac cone generation/merging and incorporating band inversion terms. For single-layer systems, we demonstrate that the emergence of Dirac cones leads to an enhanced plasmon frequency range and that the plasmonic spectrum exhibits strong anisotropy, especially for finite $\delta$ and vanishing inversion terms. In the bilayer configurations, we uncover a second plasmon mode whose relative phase, with respect to the first mode, can be actively controlled by rotating the upper layer which impacts the symmetry of the charge oscillations across the layers. This tunability enables switching between in- and out-of-phase plasmonic modes, offering a route toward phase-controlled collective excitations. Our results highlight the potential of semi-Dirac systems for topological plasmonics and interferometric applications in next-generation optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Ion Track Formation via Electric-Field-Enhanced Energy Deposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12884v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-energy ion irradiation deposits extreme energy in a narrow range (1-10 nm) along ion trajectories in solid through electronic energy loss, producing unique irradiation effects such as ion tracks. However, intrinsic velocity effects impose an upper limit on electronic energy loss that cannot be overcome by adjusting irradiation parameters. We introduce a method using electric fields during irradiation to enhance nanoscale energy deposition by accelerating ion-excited electrons within sub-picosecond timescales.Our extended thermal spike model quantitatively describes this enhancement and predicts a significant reduction in the electronic energy loss required for ion track formation in amorphous SiO2, which is in excellent agreement with experimental observations. This work provides a new approach to control energy deposition during irradiation and boosts the wide application of ion tracks in material modification and nanoengineering to much broader extents.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a simple yet powerful framework for solving inverse problems by leveraging automatic differentiation. Our method is broadly applicable whenever a smooth cost function can be defined near the true solution, and a numerical simulator is available. As a concrete example, we demonstrate that our method can accurately reconstruct the spatial profiles in a conductor from magnetotransport measurements. Even if the given data are insufficient to uniquely determine the profiles, the same framework enables effective reverse modeling. This method is general, flexible, and readily adaptable to a broad class of inverse problems across condensed matter physics and beyond.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear bulk photocurrent probe Z2 topological phase transition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detecting topological phase transitions in bulk is challenging due to the limitations of surface sensitive probes like ARPES. Here, we demonstrate that nonlinear bulk photocurrents, specifically shift and injection currents, serve as effective probes of Z_2 topological transitions. These photocurrents show a robust polarity reversal across the Z_2 phase transition, offering a direct optical signature that distinguishes strong topological phases from weak or trivial ones. This effect originates from a reorganization of key band geometric quantities, the Berry curvature and shift vector, on time-reversal-invariant momentum planes. Using a low energy Dirac model, we trace this behaviour to a band inversion in the time-reversal-invariant momentum plane that drives the topological transition. We validate these findings through tight-binding model for Bi_2Te_3 and first-principles calculations for ZrTe_5 and BiTeI, where the topological phase can be tuned by pressure or temperature. Our results establish nonlinear photocurrent as a sensitive and broadly applicable probe of Z_2 topological phase transitions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13675v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The half-Heusler (hH) compounds are currently considered promising thermoelectric (TE) materials due to their favorable thermopower and electrical conductivity. Accurate estimates of these properties are therefore highly desirable and require a detailed understanding of the microscopic mechanisms that govern transport. To enable such estimations, we carry out comprehensive first-principles computations of one of the primary factors limiting carrier transport, namely the electron-phonon ($e-ph$) interaction, in representative hH semiconductors such as LiZnAs and ScAgC. Our study first investigates the $e-ph$ renormalization of electronic dispersion based on the non-adiabatic Allen-Heine-Cardona theory. We then solve the Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) under multiple relaxation-time approximations (RTAs) to evaluate the carrier transport properties. Phonon-limited electron and hole mobilities are comparatively assessed using the linearized self-energy and momentum RTAs (SERTA and MRTA), and the exact or iterative BTE (IBTE) solutions within $e-ph$ coupling. Electrical transport coefficients for TE performance are also comparatively analyzed under the constant RTA (CRTA), SERTA, and MRTA schemes. The lattice thermal conductivity, determined from phonon-phonon interaction, is further reduced through nanostructuring techniques. The bulk LiZnAs (ScAgC) compound achieves the highest figure of merit ($zT$) of 1.05 (0.78) at 900 K with an electron doping concentration of 10$^{18}$ (10$^{19}$) cm$^{-3}$ under the MRTA scheme. This value significantly increases to 1.53 (1.0) for a 20 nm nanostructured sample. The remarkably high $zT$ achieved through inherently present phonon-induced electron scattering and the grain-boundary effect in semiconductors opens a promising path for discovering highly efficient and accurate hH materials for TE technology.</description>

      <title>Shaping Bulk Fermi Arcs in the Momentum Space of Photonic Crystal Slabs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exceptional points (EPs) are special spectral degeneracies of non-Hermitian operators: at the EP, the complex eigenvalues coalesce, i.e., they become degenerate in both their real and imaginary parts. In two-dimensional (2D) photonic crystal lattices, these elements can be tailored through structural engineering. In particular, it is known that a quadratic degeneracy in the photonic band structure can be split into a pair of Dirac points (DPs) by breaking one of the unit cell symmetries, and each DP can be further split into a pair of EPs by introducing losses. Each EP of the pair is then connected by an open isofrequency curve, called the bulk Fermi arc (BFA). In this work, we introduce a simplified effective Hamiltonian model accounting for the main physical properties of these EPs and BFAs. Then, we systematically investigate, through numerical simulations, how EPs as well as the related BFA depend on the type and amount of broken symmetries in the given 2D unit cell of a realistic photonic crystal slab implementation. Our results show that it is possible to tailor the position and distance of the EP pair in reciprocal space, as well as the curvature and orientation of the associated BFA, by deterministically tuning the unit cell structure. Importantly, the symmetry-breaking strategy we propose is general and can be applied to a broad range of photonic crystal designs beyond the specific example studied here. This approach opens new possibilities for exploiting EPs in applications involving photonic crystal lattices in, e.g., light-emitting devices or fundamental physics studies.</description>

      <title>Direct visualization of visible-light hyperbolic plasmon polaritons in real space and time</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hyperbolic materials support exotic polaritons with hyperbolic dispersion that enable subdiffraction focusing and enhanced light-matter interactions. Visible-frequency hyperbolic plasmon polaritons (HPPs) offer significant advantages over hyperbolic phonon polaritons, which operate in the infrared frequency range - namely lower losses and greater technological relevance. However, these HPPs remained experimentally inaccessible until the recent identification of molybdenum(IV) oxychloride (MoOCl$_2$). Here we achieve the first direct real-space and real-time visualization of hyperbolic plasmon polaritons in natural materials using time-resolved photoemission electron microscopy with femtosecond time resolution and nanometer spatial resolution. Our direct imaging enables measurement of HPP propagation velocities and lengths, real-time observation of plasmon-material edge interactions, experimental validation of hyperbolic dispersion through polarization-dependent experiments, and direct visualization of hyperbolic focusing phenomena. This spatiotemporal visualization validates theoretical predictions while establishing an experimental foundation for exploiting these unusual light-matter states in fundamental studies of hyperbolic media and nanophotonics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13760v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Representing real-time data as a sum of complex exponentials provides a compact form that enables both denoising and extrapolation. As a fully data-driven method, the Estimation of Signal Parameters via Rotational Invariance Techniques (ESPRIT) algorithm is agnostic to the underlying physical equations, making it broadly applicable to various observables and experimental or numerical setups. In this work, we consider applications of the ESPRIT algorithm primarily to extend real-time dynamical data from simulations of quantum systems. We evaluate ESPRIT's performance in the presence of noise and compare it to other extrapolation methods. We demonstrate its ability to extract information from short-time dynamics to reliably predict long-time behavior and determine the minimum time interval required for accurate results. We discuss how this insight can be leveraged in numerical methods that propagate quantum systems in time, and show how ESPRIT can predict infinite-time values of dynamical observables, offering a purely data-driven approach to characterizing quantum phases.</description>

Abstract: We study parametric instability in a magnomechanical system, specifically examining magnon tunneling between moving ferromagnetic insulators. Our analysis reveals that quantum fluctuations generate spin currents above a critical velocity threshold, while no spin currents occur below this threshold at low temperatures. The critical velocity depends on magnon stiffness and Zeeman energy. Approaching the threshold, the spin current becomes divergent, linked to the $PT$-symmetry-breaking transition. This enhanced behavior could offer high-sensitivity measurements and efficient spin current generation in magnon-based quantum technology.</description>

      <title>Tuning transport in solid-state Bose-Fermi mixtures by Feshbach resonances</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18176v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) heterostructures have emerged as promising platforms for realizing tunable Bose-Fermi mixtures. Their constituents are fermionic charge carriers resonantly coupled to long-lived bosonic interlayer excitons, allowing them to form trion bound states. Such platforms promise to achieve comparable densities of fermions and bosons at low relative temperatures. Here, we predict the transport properties of Bose-Fermi mixtures close to a narrow solid-state Feshbach resonance. When driving a hole current, the response of doped holes, excitons, and trions are significantly modified by the resonant interactions, leading to deviations from the typical Drude behavior and to a sign change of the exciton drag. Our results on the temperature-dependent resistivities demonstrate that interaction effects dominate over established conventional scattering mechanisms in these solid-state Bose-Fermi mixtures.</description>

      <title>Toroidal Moments in Confined Nanomagnets and their Impact on Magnonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13309v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The nonreciprocity created by dipolar coupling, electric currents, and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions is discussed in cases where the magnon propagation direction has a component parallel to the toroidal moment. A criterion for calculating the toroidal moments is established, addressing the issue of correct origin selection by considering compensated and uncompensated magnetization distributions. This criterion is then applied to various nonreciprocal magnetic systems, with the calculations consistent with those reported in the literature and predicting the existence of nonreciprocity in a more general manner. These results broaden the physical significance of the toroidal moment and facilitate the identification and estimation of nonreciprocity in magnonic systems. This work also clarifies the interrelations between different definitions of the toroidal moment for confined structures, where a surface term arising from surface-bound currents connects these definitions without the need for time-averaging. Comparing these definitions of the toroidal moment applied to different magnetic textures demonstrates that they are always parallel but may differ in magnitude and sign. The discrepancy in the different definitions is deemed irrelevant since its direction, rather than its magnitude, primarily predicts the existence of magnon nonreciprocity.</description>

      <title>Topological junction states in graphene nanoribbons: A route to topological chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17949v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two-dimensional topological insulators with propagating topological edge states are promising for dissipationless transport, while their one-dimensional analogs are capable of hosting localized topological junction states that are mainly envisaged for quantum computing and spintronics. Here, in contrast, we propose to use the localized nature of topological junction states for sensing applications. We report a systematic topological classification of a wide class of graphene nanoribbons represented by already synthesized extended chevron species. Using this classification, we theoretically model a double junction transport that shows an enhanced interaction with the NO$_2$ molecule. Our results show that topological junction states of nanoribbons can open an avenue for topological sensing and junction-assisted chemistry applications.</description>

      <title>Universal Anyon Tunneling in a Chiral Luttinger Liquid</title>

Abstract: The edge modes of fractional quantum Hall liquids are described by chiral Luttinger liquid theory. Despite many years of experimental investigation fractional quantum Hall edge modes remain enigmatic with significant discrepancies between experimental observations and detailed predictions of chiral Luttinger liquid theory. Here we report measurements of tunneling conductance between counterpropagating edge modes at $\nu=1/3$ across a quantum point contact fabricated on an AlGaAs/GaAs heterostructure designed to promote a sharp confinement potential. We present evidence for tunneling of anyons through a $\nu=1/3$ incompressible liquid that exhibits universal scaling behavior with respect to temperature, source-drain bias, and barrier transmission, as originally proposed by Wen [1, 2]. For transmission $t\geq0.800$, we measured the tunneling exponent $\bar{g} = 0.333 \pm 0.005$ averaged over 29 independent data sets, consistent with the scaling dimension $\Delta = g/2 = 1/6$ for a Laughlin quasiparticle at the edge. When combined with measurements of the fractional charge $e^*=e/3$ and the recently observed anyonic statistical angle $\theta_a=\frac{2\pi}{3}$, the measured tunneling exponent fully characterizes the topological order of the primary Laughlin state at $\nu=1/3$.</description>

      <title>Revealing Quantum Geometry in Nonlinear Quantum Materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04943v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Berry curvature-related topological phenomena have been a central topic in condensed matter physics. Yet, until recently other quantum geometric quantities such as the metric and connection received only little attention due to the relatively few effects which have been documented for them. This review gives a modern perspective how quantum geometric quantities naturally enter the nonlinear responses of quantum materials and demonstrate their deep connection with excitation energy, lifetimes, symmetry, and corresponding physical processes. The multitude of nonlinear responses can be subdivided into nonlinear optical effects, subgap responses, and nonlinear transport phenomena. Such a distinction by energy scales facilitates an intuitive understanding of the underlying electronic transitions, giving rise to a unified picture of the electron motion beyond linear order. The well-known injection and shift currents constitute the main resonances in the optical regime. Exploiting their respective lifetime and symmetry dependencies, this review elucidates how these resonances can be distinguished by a corresponding quantum geometric quantity that shares the same symmetry. This is followed by a brief exposition of the role of quasiparticle lifetimes for nonlinear subgap responses, which presents a window into the microscopic short-term dynamics as well as the ground state correlation and localization. We conclude with an account of the anomalous motion due to the Berry curvature dipole and quantum metric dipole in nonlinear transport, clarifying the correspondence between physical observables and the underlying mechanisms. This review highlights the close relationship between quantum geometry and nonlinear response, showing the way towards promising probes of quantum geometry and enabling novel avenues to characterize complex materials.</description>

      <title>A Quantum-Inspired Framework for Subjective Evaluation: Cognitive Polarization and Entropic Measures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01847v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a quantum-inspired framework to model subjective evaluation processes using state vectors in Hilbert space. In this approach, individual preferences are represented as cognitive states polarized between 'like' and 'dislike', enabling a continuous interpretation of evaluative attitudes. The evolution of these states is characterized on the Bloch sphere, and the cognitive coherence is interpreted geometrically. To further analyze the uncertainty and diversity in subjective preferences, we introduce both Shannon entropy (at the individual level) and Von Neumann entropy (at the group level) into the framework. A small-scale simulated dataset is used to conceptually demonstrate how these entropy measures can reveal internal indecisiveness and collective incoherence. The model offers a physically grounded and mathematically expressive tool for quantifying subjectivity.</description>

      <title>Minimal Fractional Topological Insulator in half-filled conjugate moir\'{e} Chern bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07054v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a "minimal" fractional topological insulator (mFTI), motivated by the recent experimental report on the signatures of FTI at total filling factor $\nu_{\rm tot} = 3$ in a transition metal dichalcogenide moir\'{e} system. The observed FTI at $\nu_{\rm tot} = 3$ is likely given by a topological state living in a pair of half-filled conjugate Chern bands with Chern numbers $C=\pm 1$ on top of another pair of fully-filled conjugate Chern bands. We propose the mFTI as a strong candidate topological state in the half-filled conjugate Chern bands. The mFTI is characterized by the following features: (1) It is a fully gapped topological order (TO) with 16 Abelian anyons if the electron is considered trivial (32 including electrons); (2) the minimally-charged anyon carries electric charge $e^\ast = e/2$, together with the fractional quantum spin-Hall conductivity, implying the robustness of the mFTI's gapless edge state whenever time-reversal symmetry and charge conversation are present; (3) the mFTI is "minimal" in the sense that it has the smallest total quantum dimension (a metric for the TO's complexity) within all the TOs that can potentially be realized at the same electron filling and with the same Hall transports; the mFTI is also the unique one that respects time-reversal symmetry. (4) the mFTI is the common descendant of multiple valley-decoupled "product TOs" with larger quantum dimensions. It can also be viewed as the result of gauging multiple symmetry-protected topological states. Similar mFTIs can be constructed for a pair of $1/q$-filled conjugate Chern bands. We classify the mFTIs via the stability of the gapless interfaces between them.</description>

      <title>Nanoscale Domain Wall Dynamics in Micromagnetic Structures with Weak Perpendicular Anisotropy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14172v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Time-resolved pump-probe soft X-ray ptychography and Scanning Transmission X-ray Microscopy (STXM) were employed to study the magnetic domain wall dynamics in microstructures of permalloy (Ni$_{81}$Fe$_{19}$; Py) with a weak growth-induced perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. The X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) images of a micrometer-sized Py square (160 nm thickness) and an elliptical disk (80 nm thickness) show flux-closure patterns with domain walls that fall into alternating out-of-plane (OOP) magnetization states precipitated by the perpendicular anisotropy, which is a precursor of the nucleation of stripe domains at higher thicknesses. An oscillating magnetic field at frequencies from tens of MHz to GHz and up to 4 mT magnitude excited dynamic modes in the domain walls along with the vortex core gyration. The domain wall dynamics include the translation of inversion points of the OOP magnetization and nucleation of one-dimensional spin waves.</description>

      <title>Chiral Phonons in 2D Halide Perovskites</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17225v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Phonons in chiral crystal structures can be circularly polarized, making them chiral. Chiral phonons carry angular momentum, which is observable in heat currents, and, via coupling to electron spin, in spin currents. Two-dimensional (2D) halide perovskites, versatile direct band gap semiconductors, can easily form chiral structures by incorporating chiral organic cations. As a result, they exhibit phenomena such as chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS) and the spin Seebeck effect, although the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Using on-the-fly machine-learning force fields trained against density functional theory calculations, we confirm the presence of chiral phonons, a potential key factor for these effects. Our analysis reveals that low-energy phonons, originating from the inorganic framework, primarily exhibit chirality. Under a temperature gradient, these chiral phonons generate substantial angular momentum, leading to experimentally observable effects. These findings position chiral 2D perovskites as a promising platform for exploring the interplay between phononic, electronic, spintronic, and thermal properties.</description>

      <title>Gauge fields induced by curved spacetime</title>

Abstract: I found an extended duality (triality) between Dirac fermions in periodic spacetime metrics, nonrelativistic fermions in gauge fields (e.g., Harper-Hofstadter model), and in periodic scalar fields on a lattice (e.g., Aubry-Andr\'e model). This indicates an unexpected equivalence between spacetime metrics, gauge fields, and scalar fields on the lattice, which is understood as different physical representations of the same mathematical object, the quantum group $\mathcal{U}_q(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$. This quantum group is generated by the exponentiation of two canonical conjugate operators, namely a linear combination of position and momentum (periodic spacetime metrics), the two components of the gauge invariant momentum (gauge fields), position and momentum (periodic scalar fields). Hence, on a lattice, Dirac fermions in a periodic spacetime metric are equivalent to nonrelativistic fermions in a periodic scalar field after a proper canonical transformation. The three lattice Hamiltonians (periodic spacetime metric, Harper-Hofstadter, and Aubry-Andr\'e) share the same properties, namely fractal phase diagrams, self-similarity, topological invariants, flat bands, and topologically quantized current in the incommensurate regimes. This work unveils an unexpected link between gravity and gauge fields, opens new venues for studying analog gravity, e.g., the Unruh effect and universe expansions/contractions, and hints at novel pathways to quantized gravity theories.</description>

Abstract: The attention mechanism has transformed artificial intelligence research by its ability to learn relations between objects. In this work, we explore how a many-body wavefunction ansatz constructed from a large-parameter self-attention neural network can be used to solve the interacting electron problem in solids. By a systematic neural-network variational Monte Carlo study on a moir\'e quantum material, we demonstrate that the self-attention ansatz provides an accurate and efficient solution without human bias. Moreover, our numerical study finds that the required number of variational parameters scales roughly as $N^2$ with the number of electrons, which opens a path towards efficient large-scale simulations.</description>

      <title>Planar Josephson junction devices with narrow superconducting strips: Topological properties and optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04468v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the low-energy physics of planar Josephson junction structures realized in a quasi-two dimensional semiconductor system proximity-coupled to narrow superconducting films. Using both a recursive Green's function approach and an effective Hamiltonian approximation, we investigate the topological superconducting phase predicted to emerge in this type of system. We first characterize the effects associated with varying the electrostatic potentials applied within the unproximitized semiconductor regions. We then address the problem of optimizing the width of the superconductor films and identifying the optimal regimes characterized by large topological gap values. We find that structures with narrow superconducting films of widths ranging between about $100~$nm and $200~$nm can support topological superconducting phases with gaps up to $40\%$ of the parent superconducting gap, significantly larger than those characterizing the corresponding wide-superconductor structures. This work represents the first component of a proposed comprehensive strategy to address this optimization problem in planar Josephson junction structures and realize robust topological devices.</description>

      <title>Excitonic effects in phonons: reshaping the graphene Kohn anomalies and lifetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13715v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop an ab initio framework that captures the impact of electron-electron and electron-hole interactions on phonon properties. This enables the inclusion of excitonic effects in the optical phonon dispersions and lifetimes of graphene, both near the center ($\Gamma$) and at the border (K) of the Brillouin zone, at phonon momenta relevant for Raman scattering and for the onset of the intrinsic electrical resistivity. Near K, we find a phonon red-shift of ~150 $cm^{-1}$ and a 10x enhancement of the group velocity, together with a 5x increase in linewidths due to a 26x increase of the electron-phonon matrix elements. These effects persist for doping $2E_{F} &lt; {\hbar}{\omega}_{ph}$ and are quenched at higher dopings. Near $\Gamma$, the excitonic effects are minor because of the gauge field nature of the electron-phonon coupling at small phonon momentum.</description>

      <title>Homogeneous Free-Standing Nanostructures from Bulk Diamond over Millimeter Scales for Quantum Technologies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.11198v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum devices based on optically addressable spin qubits in diamond are promising platforms for quantum technologies such as quantum sensing and communication. Nano- and microstructuring of the diamond crystal is essential to enhance device performance, yet fabrication remains challenging and often involves trade-offs in surface quality, aspect ratio, device size, and uniformity. We tackle this hurdle with an approach producing millimeter-scale, thin (down to 70 nm) and highly parallel (&lt; 0.35 nm/$\mathrm{\mu m}$}) membranes from single-crystal diamond. The membranes remain contamination-free and possess atomically smooth surfaces ($\mathrm{R_q}$ &lt; 200 pm) as required by state-of-the-art quantum applications. We demonstrate the benefits and versatility of our method by fabricating large fields of free-standing and homogeneous photonic nano- and microstructures. Leveraging a refined photolithography-based strategy, our method offers enhanced scalability and produces robust structures suitable for direct use, while remaining compatible with heterogeneous integration through pick-and-place transfer techniques.</description>
