      <title>Radon-Nikodym derivative of inhomogeneous Brownian last passage percolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19414v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the Radon-Nikodym derivative of the law of the spatial increments (with endpoints away from the origin) of inhomogeneous Brownian last passage percolation (LPP) with non-decreasing initial data against the Wiener measure $\mu$ on compacts is in $L^{\infty-}(\mu)$; and for any fixed $p&gt;1$, the $L^p$ norm is at most of the order $O_p(\mathrm{e}^{d_pm^2\log m})$ for some $p$-dependent constant $d_p&gt;0$.
  Furthermore, when the initial data is homogeneous, we establish optimal growth on $L^p$ norms ($\asymp O(\exp(dm^2))$) of the Radon-Nikodym derivative of the Brownian LPP (i.e. top line of an $m$-level Dyson Brownian motion) away from the origin, as the number of curves $m$ tends to infinity, for all $p&gt;1$ sufficiently large.
  As an application of our framework, we show that the Radon-Nikodym derivative of certain toy models for the KPZ fixed point lies in $L^{\infty-}(\mu)$, inspired by its variational characterisation in terms of the directed landscape.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Brownian regularity of the KPZ fixed point with meagre initial data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19415v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the spatial increments of the KPZ fixed point starting from initial data that is locally bounded and whose support admits $\epsilon$-coverings with moderate growth, exhibit strong quantitative comparison against rate two Brownian motion on compacts. The above estimates are uniform on the $L^p$ norms, the compact set containing the support of the initial data and the length of the interval considered.</description>

      <title>Convergence of local eigenvector processes of generalized Wigner matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove convergence of eigenvector processes of the form $(\sqrt{N}\langle \mathbf{u}_k,A_t\mathbf{u}_k\rangle)_{t\in[0,1]}$ where $\mathbf{u}_k$ is a bulk eigenvector of generalized Wigner matrices and $(A_t)$ a family of symmetric matrices with bounded norm and H\"{o}lder regularity. We give explicit examples of limiting processes and prove that a large class of Gaussian process with H\"{o}lder-continuous covariance function can be obtained as such a limit using its Karhunen--Lo\`eve expansion. The proof is based on the multi-dimensional convergence proved Benigni and Cipolloni (2024) and a tightness criterion proved using H\"{o}lder regularity of the observables.</description>

      <title>Mean-field limits in interacting particle systems with symmetric superlinear rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive the exchange-driven growth (EDG) equations as the mean-field limit of interacting particle systems on the complete graph. Extending previous work, we consider symmetric exchange kernels $c(k, l) = c(l, k)$ satisfying super-linear bounds of the form $c(k, l) \leq C(k^{\mu}l^{\nu} + k^{\nu}l^{\mu})$, with $0 \leq \mu, \nu \leq 2$ and $\mu + \nu \leq 3$. Under these conditions the EDG equations are known to have global solutions. We establish a law of large numbers for the empirical measures, showing that the solutions of the EDG equation describe the limiting distribution of cluster sizes in the particle system. Furthermore, we analyse the dynamics of tagged particles and prove convergence to a time-inhomogeneous Markov process governed by a nonlinear master equation, derived via a law of large numbers for size-biased empirical processes.</description>

      <title>On The Cutoff Phenomenon For Dyson-Laguerre Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the convergence to equilibrium in high dimensions, focusing on explicit bounds on mixing times and the emergence of the cutoff phenomenon for Dyson-Laguerre processes. These are interacting particle systems with non-constant diffusion coefficients, arising naturally in the context of sample covariance matrices. The infinitesimal generator of the process admits generalized Laguerre orthogonal polynomials as eigenfunctions.  Our analysis relies on several distances and divergences, including an intrinsic Wasserstein distance adapted to the non-Euclidean geometry of the process. Within this framework, we employ tools from Riemannian geometry and functional inequalities. In particular, we establish exponential decay and derive a regularization inequality for the intrinsic Wasserstein distance via comparison with relative entropy.</description>

      <title>Exact Limsup Growth of Rarely Visited Sites for One-Dimensional Simple Random Walk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the minimal local time $f(n)$ of a one-dimensional simple random walk up to time $n$, defined as the smallest number of visits to any site in the range. A conjecture formulated repeatedly by Erd\H{o}s and R\'{e}v\'{e}sz (1987, 1991) stated that $\limsup_{n\to\infty}f(n)=2$ almost surely, which was disproved by T\'{o}th (1996) who showed $\limsup_{n\to\infty}f(n)=\infty$. Subsequently, R\'{e}v\'{e}sz (2013) suggested studying the growth rate and established an upper bound of the order $\log n$.
  In this paper, we determine the precise asymptotic growth rate, proving that with probability one, $$ \limsup_{n\to\infty}\frac{f(n)}{\log\log n}=\frac{1}{\log 2}. $$ This result answers the open question posed in Section 13.2 of R\'{e}v\'{e}sz (2013).</description>

      <title>Dyson Trace Flow and Dynamic Coupled Semicircle Law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work introduces a universal framework for analyzing coupled random matrix models, centered around the newly defined Dyson Trace Flow and the Dynamic Coupled Semicircle Law. We derive stochastic differential equations for eigenvalues under asymmetric coupling, establish well-posedness, and prove a large deviation principle with explicit rate functions. The theory is extended to nonlinear and non-reciprocal interactions, revealing phenomena such as exceptional points, bistability, and novel scaling laws. A holographic correspondence with wormhole geometries is established, connecting to quantum chaos. These results generalize classical random matrix theory to interacting systems, with applications in neural networks and quantum dynamics.</description>

      <title>Tight bounds on Poisson tails with applications to Sz\'asz-Mirakyan operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain tight bounds on Poisson tails which are easy to handle. A short proof based on the median of the gamma distribution is given. Numerical comparisons with other known estimates are made. As an application, we consider the rates of pointwise convergence for $S_nf(x)-f(x)$, as $n\rightarrow \infty$, where $S_n$ is the Sz\'asz-Mirakyan operator and $x$ belongs to an open interval $I$. If the function $f$ is affine on $I$, the rate of convergence is exponential. This property is no longer true at the boundary of $I$</description>

      <title>Central limit theorems for random boundary polytopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The number of faces of the convex hull of $n$ independent and identically distributed random points chosen on the boundary of a smooth convex body in $\mathbb{R}^d$ is investigated. In dimensions two and three the number of $k$-faces is known to be constant almost surely and in dimension four and higher the variance is known to be non-zero if $k\ge 1$. We show that it is of order $n$. This is complemented by a central limit theorem with a Berry-Esseen bound which is of optimal order $n^{-1/2}$. We derive similar results for the Poissonized model, where additionally the number of random points is Poisson distributed. As a main tool, we develop a representation of the number of faces as a sum of exponentially stabilizing score functions.</description>

      <title>The Fourth-Moment Theorem on Hilbert Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a work by Bourguin and Campese [Electron. J. Probab. 25, 1-30 (2020)], a fourth-moment theorem for weak convergence to a Gaussian measure on separable Hilbert spaces was proposed. However, a very recent work by Bassetti, Bourguin, Campese, and Peccati [arXiv:2509.13427 (2025)] showed that the distance employed in the former article does not metrize weak convergence on such spaces; consequently, one of the main results therein does not hold as stated.
  In this paper, we characterize convergence in distribution to a non-degenerate Gaussian measure on a separable Hilbert space for sequences of multiple Wiener-It\^o integrals of fixed order. Assuming convergence of the associated covariance operators in the trace class norm, we prove that weak convergence holds if and only if the fourth weak moments converge to their Gaussian counterparts. A key tool in our approach is a Stein-Malliavin bound for a distance metrizing weak convergence on Hilbert spaces, hence extending the classical real-valued result of Nualart and Peccati [Ann. Probab. 33, 177-193 (2005)].</description>

      <title>Bandwidth of Gamma-Distribution-Shaped Functions via Lambert W Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19307v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The full width at half maximum (FWHM) is a useful quantity for characterizing the bandwidth of unimodal functions. However, a closed-form expression for the FWHM of gamma-shaped functions-i.e. functions that are shaped like the gamma distribution probability density function (PDF)-is not widely available. Here, we derive and present just such an expression. To do so, we use the Lambert W function to compute the inverse of the gamma PDF. We use this inverse to derive an exact analytic expression for the width of a gamma distribution at an arbitrary proportion of the maximum, from which the FWHM follows trivially. (An expression for the octave bandwidth of gamma-shaped functions is also provided.) The FWHM is then compared to the Gaussian approximation of gamma-shaped functions. A few other related issues are discussed.</description>

      <title>Particle Filtering for Non-Deterministic Electrocardiographic Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19404v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electrocardiographic imaging (ECGI) aims to non-invasively reconstruct activation maps of the heart from temporal body surface potentials. While most existing approaches rely on inverse and optimization techniques that may yield satisfactory reconstructions, they typically provide a single deterministic solution, overlooking the inherent uncertainty of the problem stemming from its very ill-posed nature, the poor knowledge of biophysical features and the unavoidable presence of noise in the measurements. The Bayesian framework, which naturally incorporates uncertainty while also accounting for temporal correlations across time steps, can be used to address this limitation. In this work, we propose a low-dimensional representation of the activation sequence that enables the use of particle filtering, a Bayesian filtering method that does not rely on predefined assumptions regarding the shape of the posterior distribution, in contrast to approaches like the Kalman filter. This allows to produce not only activation maps but also probabilistic maps indicating the likelihood of activation at each point on the heart over time, as well as pseudo-probability maps reflecting the likelihood of a point being part of an earliest activation site. Additionally, we introduce a method to estimate the probability of the presence of a conduction lines of block on the heart surface. Combined with classical reconstruction techniques, this could help discriminate artificial from true lines of block in activation maps. We support our approach with a numerical study based on simulated data, demonstrating the potential of our method.</description>

      <title>Anchored Langevin Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19455v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Standard first-order Langevin algorithms such as the unadjusted Langevin algorithm (ULA) are obtained by discretizing the Langevin diffusion and are widely used for sampling in machine learning because they scale to high dimensions and large datasets. However, they face two key limitations: (i) they require differentiable log-densities, excluding targets with non-differentiable components; and (ii) they generally fail to sample heavy-tailed targets. We propose anchored Langevin dynamics, a unified approach that accommodates non-differentiable targets and certain classes of heavy-tailed distributions. The method replaces the original potential with a smooth reference potential and modifies the Langevin diffusion via multiplicative scaling. We establish non-asymptotic guarantees in the 2-Wasserstein distance to the target distribution and provide an equivalent formulation derived via a random time change of the Langevin diffusion. We provide numerical experiments to illustrate the theory and practical performance of our proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Martingale Projections and Quantum Decoherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19491v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce so-called super/sub-martingale projections as a family of endomorphisms defined on unions of Polish spaces. Such projections allow us to identify martingales as collections of transformations that relate path-valued random variables to each other under conditional expectations. In this sense, super/sub-martingale projections are random functionals that (i) are boundedness preserving and (ii) satisfy a conditional expectation criterion similar to that of the classical martingale theory. As an application to the theory of open quantum systems, we prove (a) that any system-environment interaction that manifests a supermartingale projection on the density matrix gives rise to decoherence, and (b) that any system-environment interaction that manifests a submartingale projection gives rise an increase in Shannon-Wiener information. It follows (c) that martingale projections in an open quantum system give rise both to quantum decoherence and to information gain.</description>

      <title>Parameter Estimation for Jump-Diffusion Stochastic Master Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19862v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates parameter estimation for open quantum systems under continuous observation, whose conditional dynamics are governed by jump-diffusion stochastic master equations (SMEs) associated with quantum nondemolition (QND) measurements. Estimation of model parameters such as coupling strengths or measurement efficiencies is essential, yet in practice these parameters are often uncertain. We first establish the existence and well-posedness of a reduced quantum filter: for an N-level system, the conditional evolution can be represented in an O(N)-dimensional real state space rather than the full O(N^2) density-matrix state space. Building on this, we extend the stability theory of quantum filters, showing that exponential convergence persists not only under mismatched initial states but also in the presence of parameter mismatch. Finally, we develop an estimation framework for continuous parameter domains and prove almost sure consistency of the estimator in the long-time limit. These results yield a rigorous treatment of parameter estimation for jump-diffusion SMEs, combining structural reduction with stability and identifiability analysis, and thereby extend the mathematical theory of parameter estimation for open quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Ergodic Properties of Quantum Markov Semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20133v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the ergodic theorem for infinite-dimensional quantum Markov semigroups, originally introduced by Frigerio and Verri in 1982, and its latest version developed by Carbone and Girotti in 2021. We provide a sufficient condition that ensures exponential convergence towards the positive recurrent subspace, a well-known result for irreducible quantum Markov semigroups in finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. Several illustrative examples are presented to demonstrate the application of the ergodic theorem. Moreover, we show that the positive recurrent subspace plays a crucial role in the study of global asymptotic stability.</description>

      <title>Measuring Partial Exchangeability with Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In Bayesian multilevel models, the data are structured in interconnected groups, and their posteriors borrow information from one another due to prior dependence between latent parameters. However, little is known about the behaviour of the dependence a posteriori. In this work, we develop a general framework for measuring partial exchangeability for parametric and nonparametric models, both a priori and a posteriori. We define an index that detects exchangeability for common models, is invariant by reparametrization, can be estimated through samples, and, crucially, is well-suited for posteriors. We achieve these properties through the use of Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces, which map any random probability to a random object on a Hilbert space. This leads to many convenient properties and tractable expressions, especially a priori and under mixing. We apply our general framework to i) investigate the dependence a posteriori for the hierarchical Dirichlet process, retrieving a parametric convergence rate under very mild assumptions on the data; ii) eliciting the dependence structure of a parametric model for a principled comparison with a nonparametric alternative.</description>

      <title>Are Neural Networks Collision Resistant?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When neural networks are trained to classify a dataset, one finds a set of weights from which the network produces a label for each data point. We study the algorithmic complexity of finding a collision in a single-layer neural net, where a collision is defined as two distinct sets of weights that assign the same labels to all data. For binary perceptrons with oscillating activation functions, we establish the emergence of an overlap gap property in the space of collisions. This is a topological property believed to be a barrier to the performance of efficient algorithms. The hardness is supported by numerical experiments using approximate message passing algorithms, for which the algorithms stop working well below the value predicted by our analysis. Neural networks provide a new category of candidate collision resistant functions, which for some parameter setting depart from constructions based on lattices. Beyond relevance to cryptography, our work uncovers new forms of computational hardness emerging in large neural networks which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>On the Absolute-Value Integral of a Brownian Motion with Drift: Exact and Asymptotic Formulae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04172v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The present paper is concerned with the integral of the absolute value of a Brownian motion with drift. By establishing an asymptotic expansion of the space Laplace transform, we obtain series representations for the probability density function and cumulative distribution function of the integral, making use of Meijer's G-function. A functional recursive formula is derived for the moments, which is shown to yield only exponentials and Gauss' error function up to arbitrary orders, permitting exact computations. To obtain sharp asymptotic estimates for small- and large-deviation probabilities, we employ a marginal space-time Laplace transform and apply a newly developed generalization of Laplace's method to exponential Airy integrals. The impact of drift on the complete distribution of the integral is explored in depth. The resultant new formulae complement existing ones in the standard Brownian motion case to great extent in terms of both theoretical generality and modeling capacity and have been presented for easy implementation, which numerical experiments demonstrate.</description>

      <title>Characterization of the asymptotic behavior of $U$-statistics on row-column exchangeable matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07876v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider $U$-statistics on row-column exchangeable matrices, arrays invariant to separate permutations of rows and columns and common in bipartite data. Under the standard dissociation assumption, we develop a graph-indexed analogue of the Hoeffding decomposition tailored to RCE dependence. We present a new decomposition based on orthogonal projections onto probability spaces generated by sets of Aldous-Hoover-Kallenberg variables. These sets are indexed by bipartite graphs, enabling the application of graph-theoretic concepts to describe the decomposition. This framework provides new insights into the characterization of $U$-statistics on row-column exchangeable matrices, particularly their asymptotic behavior, including in degenerate cases. Notably, the limit distribution depends only on specific terms in the decomposition, corresponding to non-zero components indexed by the smallest graphs, namely the principal support graphs. We show that the asymptotic behavior of a $U$-statistic is characterized by the properties of its principal support graphs. The number of nodes in these graphs (the principal degree) dictates the convergence rate to the limit distribution, with degeneracy occurring if and only if this number is strictly greater than 1. Furthermore, when the principal support graphs are connected, the limit distribution is Gaussian, even in degenerate cases. Applications to network analysis illustrate these findings.</description>

      <title>Scaled quadratic variation for controlled rough paths and parameter estimation of fractional diffusions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09299v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the concept of finite $\gamma$-scaled quadratic variation along a sequence of partitions for paths on a given interval. This concept, with historical roots in the study of Gaussian processes by Gladyshev (1961) and Klein \&amp; Gin\'e (1975), includes the fractional Brownian motion (fBM) with Hurst index $H$, which has finite $1-2H$-scaled quadratic variation. We show that a path that is controlled by a path with finite $\gamma$-scaled quadratic variation in the sense of M. Gubinelli inherits this property, and the corresponding scaled quadratic variation satisfies an It\^o-isometry type formula. Moreover, we prove quantitative error bounds that establish a relationship between the convergence rates of the scaled quadratic variation of the controlled path and that of the controlling path. Additionally, we introduce a consistent estimator for the parameter $\gamma$ based on a single sample path, complete with quantitative error bounds. We apply these results to the parameter estimation for fractional diffusions. Our findings specify convergence rates for the estimation of both the Hurst index and the parameters in the noise vector fields. The paper concludes with numerical experiments that substantiate our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Explicit Steady-State Approximations for Parallel Server Systems with Heterogeneous Servers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04203v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the steady-state performance of parallel-server systems under an immediate routing architecture with two sources of heterogeneity: servers and job classes, subject to compatibility constraints. We focus on the weighted-workload-task-allocation (WWTA) policy, a load-balancing scheme known to be throughput-optimal for such systems. Under a relaxed complete-resource-pooling (CRP) condition, we prove a "strong form" of state-space collapse in heavy traffic and that the scaled workload of each server converges in distribution to an exponential random variable, whose parameter is explicitly given by system primitives. Our analysis yields three main insights. First, the conventional heavy-traffic requirement of a unique static allocation plan can be dropped; a relaxed CRP condition suffices. Second, the limiting workload distribution is shown to be independent of local scheduling policy on server side, allowing substantial flexibility. Third, the inefficient (non-basic) activities prescribed by static allocation plan is proved to receive an asymptotically negligible fraction of routing and service, even though WWTA has no prior knowledge of which activities are basic, highlighting its robustness to changing arrival rates.</description>

      <title>A method of solution for the inverse problem for $h$-functions of planar Brownian motion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05764v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a planar domain $D$, the harmonic measure distribution function $h_D(r)$, with base point $z$, is the harmonic measure with pole at $z$ of the parts of the boundary which are within a distance $r$ of $z$. Equivalently it is the probability Brownian motion started from $z$ first strikes the boundary within a distance $r$ from $z$. We call $h_D$ the $h$-function of $D$, this function captures geometrical aspects of the domain, such as connectivity, or curvature of the boundary. This paper is concerned with the inverse problem: given a suitable function $h$, does there exist a domain $D$ such that $h = h_D$? To answer this, we first extend the concept of a $h$-function of a domain to one of a stopping time $\tau$ . By using the conformal invariance of Brownian motion we solve the inverse problem for that of a stopping time. The associated stopping time will be the projection of a hitting time of the real line. If this projection corresponds to the hitting time of a domain $D$, then this technique solves the original inverse problem. We have found a large family of examples such that the associated stopping time is that of a hitting time.</description>

Abstract: A random variable X is strictly stable if a sum of independent copies of X has the same distribution as X up to scaling, and is stable (in the broad sense) if the sum has the same distribution as X up to both scaling and shifting. Steutel and Van Harn studied 'discrete strict stability' for random variables taking values in the non-negative integers, replacing scaling by the thinning operation. We extend this to 'discrete stability' (in the broad sense), where shifting is replaced by the addition of an independent Poisson random variable. The discrete stable distributions are 'Poisson-delayed Sibuya' distributions, which include the Poisson and Hermite distributions. Similar results have been proved independently by Townes (arXiv:2509.05497).</description>

      <title>On certain integral functionals of integer-valued subordinators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.17199v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is known that the exponential functional of a Poisson process admits a probability density function in the form of an infinite series. In this paper, we obtain an explicit expression for the density function of the exponential functional of any integer-valued subordinator, and by extension, limit representations for that of an arbitrary pure-jump subordinator. With an added positive drift, the density function is expressed via piecewise basis functions governed by a functional relation. Closed-form density functions for these cases have been established only for a few special instances of L\'{e}vy processes in the past literature. Our work substantially advances this line of research by providing an analytical perspective on the distribution of a broad class of exponential L\'{e}vy functionals, also suggesting potential methodological extensions to general purely discontinuous L\'{e}vy processes. Moreover, we consider arbitrary decreasing functionals of integer-valued subordinators by deriving sufficient and necessary conditions for their convergence, which are then applied to obtain limit-series representations for the density functions of inverse-power functionals. The numerical performance of the proposed formulae is demonstrated through various examples of well-known distributions.</description>

      <title>A threshold for relative hyperbolicity in random right-angled Coxeter groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12959v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the random right-angled Coxeter group $W_{\Gamma}$ whose presentation graph $\Gamma\sim \mathcal{G}_{n,p}$ is an Erd{\H o}s--R\'enyi random graph on $n$ vertices with edge probability $p=p(n)$. We establish that $p=1/\sqrt{n}$ is a threshold for relative hyperbolicity of the random group $W_{\Gamma}$. As a key step in the proof, we determine the minimal number of pairs of generators that must commute in a right-angled Coxeter group which is not relatively hyperbolic, a result which is of independent interest.
  We also show that there is an interval of edge probabilities of width $\Omega(1/\sqrt{n})$ in which the random right-angled Coxeter group has precisely cubic divergence. This interval is between the thresholds for relative hyperbolicity (whence exponential divergence) and quadratic divergence. Moreover, a simple random walk on any Cayley graph of the random right-angled Coxeter group for $p$ in this interval satisfies a central limit theorem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04165v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A family of $r$ distinct sets $\{A_1,\ldots, A_r\}$ is an $r$-sunflower if for all $1 \leqslant i &lt; j \leqslant r$ and $1 \leqslant i' &lt; j' \leqslant r$, we have $A_i \cap A_j = A_{i'} \cap A_{j'}$. Erd\H{o}s and Rado conjectured in 1960 that every family $\mathcal{H}$ of $\ell$-element sets of size at least $K(r)^\ell$ contains an $r$-sunflower, where $K(r)$ is some function that depends only on $r$. We prove that if $\mathcal{H}$ is a family of $\ell$-element sets of VC-dimension at most $d$ and $|\mathcal{H}| &gt; (C r (\log d+\log^\ast \ell))^\ell$ for some absolute constant $C &gt; 0$, then $\mathcal{H}$ contains an $r$-sunflower. This improves a recent result of Fox, Pach, and Suk. When $d=1$, we obtain a sharp bound, namely that $|\mathcal{H}| &gt; (r-1)^\ell$ is sufficient. Along the way, we establish a strengthening of the Kahn-Kalai conjecture for set families of bounded VC-dimension, which is of independent interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16435v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper considers the asymptotic behaviour of deterministically and stochastically forced linear pantograph equations. The asymptotic behaviour is studied in the case when all solutions of the pantograph equation without forcing tend to a trivial equilibrium. In all cases, we give necessary and sufficient conditions on the forcing terms which enable all solutions to converge to the equilibrium of the unforced equation, and which enable solutions to remain bounded. In the deterministic case, we give sharp conditions on forcing terms which enable the solutions of the forced equations to inherit the power law behaviour of the unforced equation, as well as slower rates of decay or growth not present in the unforced equation. Extensions to equations with general unbounded delay, and to finite--dimensional equations are also presented.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18133v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The molecular motion in heterogeneous media displays anomalous diffusion by the mean-squared displacement $\langle X^2(t) \rangle = 2 D t^\alpha$. Motivated by experiments reporting populations of the anomalous diffusion parameters $\alpha$ and $D$, we aim to disentangle their respective contributions to the observed variability when this last is due to a true population of these parameters and when it arises due to finite-duration recordings. We introduce estimators of the anomalous diffusion parameters on the basis of the time-averaged mean squared displacement and study their statistical properties. By using a copula approach, we derive a formula for the joint density function of their estimations conditioned on their actual values. The methodology introduced is indeed universal, it is valid for any Gaussian process and can be applied to any quadratic time-averaged statistics. We also explain the experimentally reported relation $D\propto\exp(\alpha c_1+c_2)$ for which we provide the exact expression. We finally compare our findings to numerical simulations of the fractional Brownian motion and quantify their accuracy by using the Hellinger distance.</description>

Abstract: Consider a pair of sparse correlated stochastic block models $\mathcal S(n,\tfrac{\lambda}{n},\epsilon;s)$ subsampled from a common parent stochastic block model with two symmetric communities, average degree $\lambda=O(1)$, divergence parameter $\epsilon\in (0,1)$ and subsampling probability $s$. For all $\epsilon\in(0,1)$ and $\Delta&gt;0$, we construct a statistic based on the combination of two low-degree polynomials and show that there exists a sufficiently small constant $\delta=\delta(\epsilon,\lambda,\Delta)&gt;0$ such that if $\epsilon^2 \lambda s&gt;1+\Delta$ and $s&gt;\sqrt{\alpha}-\delta$ where $\alpha\approx 0.338$ is Otter's constant, this statistic can distinguish this model and a pair of independent stochastic block models $\mathcal S(n,\tfrac{\lambda s}{n},\epsilon)$ with probability $1-o(1)$. We also provide an efficient algorithm that approximates this statistic in polynomial time.
  The crux of our statistic's construction lies in a carefully curated family of multigraphs called \emph{decorated trees}, which enables effective aggregation of the community signal and graph correlation by leveraging the counts of the same decorated tree while suppressing the undesirable correlations among counts of different decorated trees. We believe such construction may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Lines in Every Direction with No ee-Random Points</title>

Abstract: We prove that in every direction in the Euclidean plane, there exists a line containing no double exponential time random (ee-random) points. This means each point on these lines has an algorithmically predictable location, to the extent that a gambler in an environment with fair payouts can, using double exponential time computing resources, amass unbounded capital placing bets on increasingly precise estimates of the point's location. Our proof relies on effectivizing the construction of the lineal extension of a Kakeya set. This resolves an open question of Lutz and Lutz (2015).</description>

      <title>Fractional Brownian Motion with Negative Hurst Exponent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05977</link>

Abstract: Fractional Brownian motion (fBm) is an important scale-invariant Gaussian non-Markovian process with stationary increments, which serves as a prototypical example of a system with long-range temporal correlations and anomalous diffusion. The fBm is traditionally defined for the Hurst exponent $H$ in the range $0&lt;H&lt;1$. Here we extend this definition to the regime $-1/2&lt;H&lt;0$. The extended fBm is not a pointwise process, so we regularize it via a local temporal averaging with a narrow filter. The resulting process is both very rough and persistent, that is long-range positively correlated. In addition, this process is stationary. The stationarity implies a complete arrest of diffusion in this region of $H$. We also study another closely related Gaussian process: the stationary fractional Ornstein--Uhlenbeck (fOU) process, extended to the range $-1/2&lt;H&lt;0$ and smoothed in the same way as the fBm. Remarkably, the smoothed fOU process turns out to be insensitive to the strength of the confining potential. Finally, we determine the optimal paths of the conditioned fBm and fOU processes for $-1/2&lt;H&lt;0$. In the marginal case $H=0$, our results match continuously with known results for the traditionally defined fBm and fOU processes.</description>
