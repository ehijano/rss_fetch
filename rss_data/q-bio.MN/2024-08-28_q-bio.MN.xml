      <title>Active learning of digenic functions with boolean matrix logic programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14487v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We apply logic-based machine learning techniques to facilitate cellular engineering and drive biological discovery, based on comprehensive databases of metabolic processes called genome-scale metabolic network models (GEMs). Predicted host behaviours are not always correctly described by GEMs. Learning the intricate genetic interactions within GEMs presents computational and empirical challenges. To address these, we describe a novel approach called Boolean Matrix Logic Programming (BMLP) by leveraging boolean matrices to evaluate large logic programs. We introduce a new system, $BMLP_{active}$, which efficiently explores the genomic hypothesis space by guiding informative experimentation through active learning. In contrast to sub-symbolic methods, $BMLP_{active}$ encodes a state-of-the-art GEM of a widely accepted bacterial host in an interpretable and logical representation using datalog logic programs. Notably, $BMLP_{active}$ can successfully learn the interaction between a gene pair with fewer training examples than random experimentation, overcoming the increase in experimental design space. $BMLP_{active}$ enables rapid optimisation of metabolic models and offers a realistic approach to a self-driving lab for microbial engineering.</description>

      <title>Predicting O-GlcNAcylation Sites in Mammalian Proteins with Transformers and RNNs Trained with a New Loss Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17131v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Glycosylation, a protein modification, has multiple essential functional and structural roles. O-GlcNAcylation, a subtype of glycosylation, has the potential to be an important target for therapeutics, but methods to reliably predict O-GlcNAcylation sites had not been available until 2023; a 2021 review correctly noted that published models were insufficient and failed to generalize. Moreover, many are no longer usable. In 2023, a considerably better RNN model with an F$_1$ score of 36.17% and an MCC of 34.57% on a large dataset was published. This article first sought to improve these metrics using transformer encoders. While transformers displayed high performance on this dataset, their performance was inferior to that of the previously published RNN. We then created a new loss function, which we call the weighted focal differentiable MCC, to improve the performance of classification models. RNN models trained with this new function display superior performance to models trained using the weighted cross-entropy loss; this new function can also be used to fine-tune trained models. A two-cell RNN trained with this loss achieves state-of-the-art performance in O-GlcNAcylation site prediction with an F$_1$ score of 38.88% and an MCC of 38.20% on that large dataset.</description>
