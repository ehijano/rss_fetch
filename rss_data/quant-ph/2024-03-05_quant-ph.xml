      <title>Self-testing of multipartite non-maximal entangled states exhibiting genuine non-locality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-testing enables the characterization of quantum systems with minimal assumptions their internal working. As such it represents the strongest form of certification for quantum systems. In the existing self-testing literature, self-testing states which are not maximally entangled, but exhibit genuine multipartite nonlocality, have remained an open problem. This is particularly important because, for many-body systems, genuine multipartite nonlocality has been recognized as the strongest form of multipartite quantum correlation. In this work, we present a Hardy-like paradox for scenarios involving arbitrary number of parties. This paradox is a tool for detecting genuine multipartite nonlocality, allowing for the specific identification and self-testing of states that defy the paradox's limits the most, which turn out to be non-maximally multipartite entangled states.</description>

      <title>From reasonable postulates to generalised Hamiltonian systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hamiltonian mechanics describes the evolution of a system through its Hamiltonian. The Hamiltonian typically also represents the energy observable, a Noether-conserved quantity associated with the time-invariance of the law of evolution. In both quantum and classical mechanics, Hamiltonian mechanics demands a precise relationship between time evolution and observable energy, albeit using slightly different terminology. We distil basic conditions satisfied in both quantum and classical mechanics, including canonical coordinate symmetries and inner product invariance. We express these conditions in the framework of generalised probabilistic theories, which includes generalizing the definition of energy eigenstates in terms of time-invariant properties of the Hamiltonian system. By postulating these conditions to hold, we derive a unified Hamiltonian system model. This unified framework describes quantum and classical mechanics in a consistent language, facilitating their comparison. We moreover discuss alternative theories: an equation of motion given by a mixture of commutation relations, an information-restricted version of quantum theory, and Spekken's toy theory. The findings give a deeper understanding of the Hamiltonian in quantum and classical theories and point to several potential research topics.</description>

      <title>Zero absorption and large negative refractive index in a left-handed four-level atomic media</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper,we have investigated three external fields interacting with the four-level atomic system described by the density-matrix approach.The atomic system exhibits left-handedness with zero absorption as well as large negative refractive index.Varying the parameters of the three external fields,the properties of zero absorption,large negative refractive index from the atomic system keep unvarying.Our scheme proposes an approach to obtain negative refractive medium with zero absorption. The zero absorption property of atomic system may be used to amplify the evanescent waves that have been lost in the imaging by traditional lenses.And a slab fabricated by the left-handed atomic system may be an ideal candidate for designing perfect lenses.</description>

      <title>On Target Detection by Quantum Radar (Preprint)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Both Noise Radar and Quantum Radar, with some alleged common features, exploit the randomness of the transmitted signal to enhance radar covertness and to reduce mutual interference. While Noise Radar has been prototypically developed and successfully tested in many environments by different organizations, the significant investments on Quantum Radar seem not to be followed by practically operating prototypes or demonstrators. Starting from the trivial fact that radar detection depends on the energy transmitted on the target and backscattered by it, some detailed evaluations in this work show that the detection performance of all the proposed QR types in the literature are orders of magnitude below the ones of a much simpler and cheaper equivalent classica radar set, in particular of the NR type. Moreover, the absence of a, sometimes alleged, Quantum radar cross section different from the radar cross section is explained. Hence, the various Quantum Radar proposals cannot lead to any useful result, especially, but not limited to, the alleged detection of stealth targets.</description>

Abstract: The goal of quantum metrology is to improve measurements' sensitivities by harnessing quantum resources. Metrologists often aim to maximize the quantum Fisher information, which bounds the measurement setup's sensitivity. In studies of fundamental limits on metrology, a paradigmatic setup features a qubit (spin-half system) subject to an unknown rotation. One obtains the maximal quantum Fisher information about the rotation if the spin begins in a state that maximizes the variance of the rotation-inducing operator. If the rotation axis is unknown, however, no optimal single-qubit sensor can be prepared. Inspired by simulations of closed timelike curves, we circumvent this limitation. We obtain the maximum quantum Fisher information about a rotation angle, regardless of the unknown rotation axis. To achieve this result, we initially entangle the probe qubit with an ancilla qubit. Then, we measure the pair in an entangled basis, obtaining more information about the rotation angle than any single-qubit sensor can achieve. We demonstrate this metrological advantage using a two-qubit superconducting quantum processor. Our measurement approach achieves a quantum advantage, outperforming every entanglement-free strategy.</description>

      <title>Examining the quantum signatures of optimal excitation energy transfer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light-harvesting via the transport and trapping of optically-induced electronic excitations is of fundamental interest to the design of new energy efficient quantum technologies. Using a paradigmatic quantum optical model, we study the influence of coherence, entanglement, and cooperative dissipation on the transport and capture of excitation energy. In particular, we demonstrate that the rate of energy extraction is optimized under conditions that minimize the quantum coherence and entanglement of the system. We show that this finding is not limited to disordered or high temperature systems but is instead a fundamental consequence of spontaneous parity time-reversal symmetry breaking associated with the quantum-to-classical transition. We then examine the effects of vibrational fluctuations, revealing a strong dephasing assisted transport enhancement for delocalized excitations in the presence of cooperative interactions. Our results highlight the rich, emergent behavior associated with decoherence and may be relevant to the study of biological photosynthetic antenna complexes or to the design of room-temperature quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Learning interacting fermionic Hamiltonians at the Heisenberg limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficiently learning an unknown Hamiltonian given access to its dynamics is a problem of interest for quantum metrology, many-body physics and machine learning. A fundamental question is whether learning can be performed at the Heisenberg limit, where the Hamiltonian evolution time scales inversely with the error, $\varepsilon$, in the reconstructed parameters. The Heisenberg limit has previously been shown to be achievable for certain classes of qubit and bosonic Hamiltonians. Most recently, a Heisenberg-limited learning algorithm was proposed for a simplified class of fermionic Hubbard Hamiltonians restricted to real hopping amplitudes and zero chemical potential at all sites, along with on-site interactions. In this work, we provide an algorithm to learn a more general class of fermionic Hubbard Hamiltonians at the Heisenberg limit, allowing complex hopping amplitudes and nonzero chemical potentials in addition to the on-site interactions, thereby including several models of physical interest. The required evolution time across all experiments in our protocol is $\mathcal{O}(1/\varepsilon)$ and the number of experiments required to learn all the Hamiltonian parameters is $\mathcal{O}(\text{polylog}(1/\varepsilon))$, independent of system size as long as each fermionic mode interacts with $\mathcal{O}(1)$ other modes. Unlike prior algorithms for bosonic and fermionic Hamiltonians, to obey fermionic parity superselection constraints in our more general setting, our protocol utilizes $\mathcal{O}(N)$ ancillary fermionic modes, where $N$ is the system size. Each experiment involves preparing fermionic Gaussian states, interleaving time evolution with fermionic linear optics unitaries, and performing local occupation number measurements on the fermionic modes. The protocol is robust to a constant amount of state preparation and measurement error.</description>

      <title>High-purity single-photon generation based on cavity QED</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a scheme for generating a high-purity single photon on the basis of cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED). This scheme employs a four-level system including two excited states, two ground states, and two driving lasers; this structure allows the suppression of the re-excitation process due to the atomic decay, which is known to significantly degrade the single-photon purity in state-of-the-art photon sources using a three-level system. Our analysis shows that the re-excitation probability arbitrarily approaches zero without sacrificing the photon generation probability when increasing the power of the driving laser between the excited states. This advantage is achievable by using current cavity-QED technologies. Our scheme can contribute to developing distributed quantum computation or quantum communication with high accuracy.</description>

      <title>An assessment of quantum phase estimation protocols for early fault-tolerant quantum computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compare several quantum phase estimation (QPE) protocols intended for early fault-tolerant quantum computers (EFTQCs) in the context of models of their implementations on a surface code architecture. We estimate the logical and physical resources required to use these protocols to calculate the ground state energy of molecular hydrogen in a minimal basis with error below $10^{-3}$ atomic units in the presence of depolarizing logical errors. Accounting for the overhead of rotation synthesis and magic state distillation, we find that the total $T$-gate counts do not vary significantly among the EFT QPE protocols at fixed state overlap. In addition to reducing the number of ancilla qubits and circuit depth, the noise robustness of the EFT protocols can be leveraged to reduce resource requirements below those of textbook QPE, realizing approximately a 300-fold reduction in computational volume in some cases. Even so, our estimates are well beyond the scale of existing early fault-tolerance demonstrations.</description>

      <title>Quantum Quench Dynamics of Geometrically Frustrated Ising Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Geometric frustration in two-dimensional Ising models allows for a wealth of exotic universal behavior, both Ising and non-Ising, in the presence of quantum fluctuations. In particular, the triangular antiferromagnet and Villain model in a transverse field can be understood through distinct XY pseudospins, but have qualitatively similar phase diagrams including a quantum phase transition in the (2+1)-dimensional XY universality class. While the quantum dynamics of modestly-sized systems can be simulated classically using tensor-based methods, these methods become infeasible for larger lattices. Here we perform both classical and quantum simulations of these dynamics, where our quantum simulator is a superconducting quantum annealer. Our observations on the triangular lattice suggest that the dominant quench dynamics are not described by the quantum Kibble-Zurek scaling of the quantum phase transition, but rather a faster coarsening dynamics in an effective two-dimensional XY model in the ordered phase. Similarly, on the Villain model, the scaling exponent does not match the Kibble-Zurek expectation. These results demonstrate the ability of quantum annealers to simulate coherent quantum dynamics and scale beyond the reach of classical approaches.</description>

      <title>Quantum Hardware Roofline: Evaluating the Impact of Gate Expressivity on Quantum Processor Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The design space of current quantum computers is expansive with no obvious winning solution. This leaves practitioners with a clear question: "What is the optimal system configuration to run an algorithm?". This paper explores hardware design trade-offs across NISQ systems to guide algorithm and hardware design choices. The evaluation is driven by algorithmic workloads and algorithm fidelity models which capture architectural features such as gate expressivity, fidelity, and crosstalk. We also argue that the criteria for gate design and selection should be extended from maximizing average fidelity to a more comprehensive approach that takes into account the gate expressivity with respect to algorithmic structures. We consider native entangling gates (CNOT, ECR, CZ, ZZ, XX, Sycamore, $\sqrt{\text{iSWAP}}$), proposed gates (B Gate, $\sqrt[4]{\text{CNOT}}$, $\sqrt[8]{\text{CNOT}}$), as well as parameterized gates (FSim, XY). Our methodology is driven by a custom synthesis driven circuit compilation workflow, which is able to produce minimal circuit representations for a given system configuration. By providing a method to evaluate the suitability of algorithms for hardware platforms, this work emphasizes the importance of hardware-software co-design for quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Enabling large-depth simulation of noisy quantum circuits with positive tensor networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Matrix product density operators (MPDOs) are tensor network representations of locally purified density matrices where each physical degree of freedom is associated to an environment degree of freedom. MPDOs have interesting properties for mixed state representations: guaranteed positivity by construction, efficient conservation of the trace and computation of local observables. However, they have been challenging to use for noisy quantum circuit simulation, as the application of noise increases the dimension of the environment Hilbert space, leading to an exponential growth of bond dimensions. MPDOs also lack a unique canonical form, due to the freedom in the choice of basis for the environment Hilbert space, which leads to a vast variation of bond dimensions.
  In this work, we present a systematic way to reduce the bond dimensions of MPDOs by disentangling the purified state. We optimize the basis for the environment Hilbert space by performing density matrix renormalization group (DMRG)-like sweeps of local 2-qubit basis optimization. Interestingly, we find that targeting only the disentanglement of the purified state leads to a reduction of the environment dimension. In other words, a compact MPDO representation requires a low-entanglement purified state.
  We apply our compression method to the emulation of noisy random quantum circuits. Our technique allows us to keep bounded bond dimensions, and thus bounded memory, contrary to previous works on MPDOs, while keeping reasonable truncation fidelities.</description>

      <title>Uniformly Decaying Subspaces for Error Mitigated Quantum Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a general condition to obtain subspaces that decay uniformly in a system governed by the Lindblad master equation and use them to perform error mitigated quantum computation. The expectation values of dynamics encoded in such subspaces are unbiased estimators of noise-free expectation values. In analogy to the decoherence free subspaces which are left invariant by the action of Lindblad operators, we show that the uniformly decaying subspaces are left invariant (up to orthogonal terms) by the action of the dissipative part of the Lindblad equation. We apply our theory to a system of qubits and qudits undergoing relaxation with varying decay rates and show that such subspaces can be used to eliminate bias up to first order variations in the decay rates without requiring full knowledge of noise. Since such a bias cannot be corrected through standard symmetry verification, our method can improve error mitigation in dual-rail qubits and given partial knowledge of noise, can perform better than probabilistic error cancellation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Annealers are basically quantum computers that with high probability can optimize certain quadratic functions on Boolean variables in constant time. These functions are basically the Hamiltonian of Ising models that reach the ground energy state, with a high probability, after an annealing process. They have been proposed as a way to solve SAT.
  These Hamiltonians can be seen as Max2XOR problems, i.e. as the problem of finding an assignment that maximizes the number of XOR clauses of at most 2 variables that are satisfied. In this paper, we present several gadgets to reduce SAT to Max2XOR. We show how they can be used to translate SAT instances to initial configurations of a quantum annealer.</description>

      <title>Unifying Collisional Models and the Monte Carlo Metropolis Method: Algorithms for Dynamics of Open Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical systems placed in contact with a thermal bath will inevitably equilibrate to a thermal state at the bath temperature. The same is not generally true for open quantum systems, which place additional conditions on the structure of the bath and system-bath interaction if thermalization is to occur. Collisional models, or repeated interaction schemes, are a category of microscopic open quantum system models that have seen growing use in studying quantum thermalization, in which the bath is modeled as a large ensemble of identical ancilla systems that sequentially interact with the system. We demonstrate that, when each bath ancilla is prepared in a thermal state with a discrete spectrum that matches the energy eigenstate transitions of the system, the system dynamics generated by the collisional model framework are identical to those generated under the Metropolis algorithm. This equivalence holds not just in the steady state regime, but also in the transient regime. As the Metropolis scheme does not require explicitly modeling the system-bath interaction, this allows it to be used as a computationally efficient alternative for simulating collisional model dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Gaussian quantum theory of bosonic modes has been widely used to describe quantum optical systems, including coherent Ising machines (CIMs) that consist of $\chi^{(2)}$ degenerate optical parametric oscillators (DOPOs) as nonlinear elements. However, Gaussian models have been thought to be invalid in the extremely strong-gain-saturation limit. Here, we develop an extended Gaussian model including two third-order fluctuation products, $\langle \delta \hat{X}^3\rangle$ and $\langle \delta \hat{X}\delta \hat{P}^2\rangle$, which we call self-skewness and cross-skewness, respectively. This new model which we call skew-Gaussian model more precisely replicates the success probability predicted by the quantum master equation (QME), relative to Gaussian models. We also discuss the impact of skew variables on the performance of CIMs.</description>

Abstract: Surface ion traps with two-dimensional layouts of trapping regions are natural architectures for storing large numbers of ions and supporting the connectivity needed to implement quantum algorithms. Many of the components and operations needed to fully exploit this architecture have already been demonstrated, including operation at cryogenic temperatures with low heating, low excitation transport, and ion control and detection with integrated photonics. Here we demonstrate a trap that addresses the scaling challenge of increasing power dissipation as the RF electrode increases in size. By raising the RF electrode and removing most of the insulating dielectric layer below it we reduce both ohmic and dielectric power dissipation. We also measure heating rates across a range of motional frequencies and for different voltage sources in a trap with a raised RF electrode but solid dielectric.</description>

      <title>Dissipative stabilization of high-dimensional GHZ states for neutral atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-dimensional quantum entanglement characterizes the entanglement of quantum systems within a larger Hilbert space, introducing more intricate and complex correlations among the entangled particles' states. The high-dimensional Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state, symbolic of this type of entanglement, is of significant importance in various quantum information processing applications. This study proposes integrating a neutral atom platform with quantum reservoir engineering to generate a high-dimensional GHZ state deterministically. Leveraging the advantages of neutral atoms in a modified unconventional Rydberg pumping mechanism, combined with controlled dissipation, we achieve a three-dimensional GHZ state with a fidelity surpassing 99\% through multiple pump and dissipation cycles. This innovative approach paves the way for experimentally feasible, deterministic preparation of high-dimensional GHZ states in Rydberg atom systems, thereby advancing the capabilities of quantum information processing.</description>

Abstract: Higher dimensional entangled states demonstrate significant advantages in quantum information processing tasks. Schmidt number is a quantity on the entanglement dimension of a bipartite state. Here we build families of k-positive maps from the symmetric information complete positive operator-valued measurements and mutually unbiased bases, and we also present the Schmidt number witnesses, correspondingly. At last, based on the witnesses obtained from mutually unbiased bases, we show the distance between a bipartite state and the set of states with Schmidt number less than k.</description>

      <title>Generation and optimization of entanglement between giant atoms chirally coupled to spin cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore a scheme for entanglement generation and optimization in giant atoms by coupling them to finite one-dimensional arrays of spins that behave as cavities. We find that high values for the concurrence can be achieved in small-sized cavities, being the generation time very short. When exciting the system by external means, optimal concurrence is obtained for very weak drivings. We also analyze the effect of disorder in these systems, showing that although the average concurrence decreases with disorder, high concurrences can still be obtained even in scenarios presenting strong disorder. This result leads us to propose an optimization procedure in which by engineering the on-site energies or hoppings in the cavity, concurrences close to 1 can be reached within an extremely short period of time.</description>

      <title>Crosstalk-Robust Quantum Control in Multimode Bosonic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-coherence superconducting cavities offer a hardware-efficient platform for quantum information processing. To achieve universal operations of these bosonic modes, the requisite nonlinearity is realized by coupling them to a transmon ancilla. However, this configuration is susceptible to crosstalk errors in the dispersive regime, where the ancilla frequency is Stark-shifted by the state of each coupled bosonic mode. This leads to a frequency mismatch of the ancilla drive, lowering the gate fidelities. To mitigate such coherent errors, we employ quantum optimal control to engineer ancilla pulses that are robust to the frequency shifts. These optimized pulses are subsequently integrated into a recently developed echoed conditional displacement (ECD) protocol for executing single- and two-mode operations. Through numerical simulations, we examine two representative scenarios: the preparation of single-mode Fock states in the presence of spectator modes and the generation of two-mode entangled Bell-cat states. Our approach markedly suppresses crosstalk errors, outperforming conventional ancilla control methods by orders of magnitude. These results provide guidance for experimentally achieving high-fidelity multimode operations and pave the way for developing high-performance bosonic quantum information processors.</description>

      <title>Signal crosstalk in a flip-chip quantum processor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum processors require a signal-delivery architecture with high addressability (low crosstalk) to ensure high performance already at the scale of dozens of qubits. Signal crosstalk causes inadvertent driving of quantum gates, which will adversely affect quantum-gate fidelities in scaled-up devices. Here, we demonstrate packaged flip-chip superconducting quantum processors with signal-crosstalk performance competitive with those reported in other platforms. For capacitively coupled qubit-drive lines, we find on-resonant crosstalk better than -27 dB (average -37 dB). For inductively coupled magnetic-flux-drive lines, we find less than 0.13 % direct-current flux crosstalk (average 0.05 %). These observed crosstalk levels are adequately small and indicate a decreasing trend with increasing distance, which is promising for further scaling up to larger numbers of qubits. We discuss the implication of our results for the design of a low-crosstalk, on-chip signal delivery architecture, including the influence of a shielding tunnel structure, potential sources of crosstalk, and estimation of crosstalk-induced qubit-gate error in scaled-up quantum processors.</description>

      <title>Niobium coaxial cavities with internal quality factors exceeding 1.5 billion for circuit quantum electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Group-V materials such as niobium and tantalum have become popular choices for extending the performance of circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) platforms allowing for quantum processors and memories with reduced error rates and more modes. The complex surface chemistry of niobium however makes identifying the main modes of decoherence difficult at millikelvin temperatures and single-photon powers. We use niobium coaxial quarter-wave cavities to study the impact of etch chemistry, prolonged atmospheric exposure, and the significance of cavity conditions prior to and during cooldown, in particular niobium hydride evolution, on single-photon coherence. We demonstrate cavities with quality factors of $Q_{\rm int}\gtrsim 1.4\times10^{9}$ in the single-photon regime, a $15$ fold improvement over aluminum cavities of the same geometry. We rigorously quantify the sensitivity of our fabrication process to various loss mechanisms and demonstrate a $2-4\times$ reduction in the two-level system (TLS) loss tangent and a $3-5\times$ improvement in the residual resistivity over traditional BCP etching techniques. Finally, we demonstrate transmon integration and coherent cavity control while maintaining a cavity coherence of \SI{11.3}{ms}. The accessibility of our method, which can easily be replicated in academic-lab settings, and the demonstration of its performance mark an advancement in 3D cQED.</description>

      <title>Hardware-Efficient Bosonic Quantum Computing with Detection Capability of Single Photon Loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bosonic systems, which have large internal degrees of freedom, offer the potential to create quantum bits with error detection and error correction capabilities. This property is particularly advantageous for near-term quantum computers, where the number of qubits is severely constrained. However, there is still room for improvement in terms of hardware efficiency. They still entail the use of ancillary qubits for various state manipulations, including gate operations. Additionally, complex operations are often required to perform a number of operations. Here, we propose a method to use Kerr non-linear resonators for near-term bosonic quantum computation with the capability of detecting single-photon loss, which requires simple pulse operations without ancillary qubits. By adopting the $02$ code, and we can perform the $X$ rotation, $Z$ rotation, and controlled-phase gate for logical qubits. Our results pave the way for practical bosonic quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Multiple Classical Noise Mitigation by Multiobjective Robust Quantum Optimal Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-quality control is a fundamental requirement for quantum computation, but practically it is often hampered by the presence of various types of noises, which can be static or time-dependent. In many realistic scenarios, multiple noise sources coexist, and their resulting noise effects need be corrected to a sufficient order, posing significant challenges for the design of effective robust control methods. Here, we explore the method of robust quantum optimal control to generally tackle the problem of resisting multiple noises from a complicated noise environment. Specifically, we confine our analysis to unitary noises that can be described by classical noise models. This method employs a gradient-based multiobjective optimization algorithm to maximize the control figure of merit, and meanwhile to minimize the perturbative effects of the noises that are allowed for. To verify its effectiveness, we apply this method to a number of examples, including roubust entangling gate in trapped ion system and robust controlled-Z gate in superconducting qubits, under commonly encountered static and time-dependent noises. Our simulation results reveal that robust optimal control can find smooth, robust pulses that can simultaneously resist several noises and thus achieve high-fidelity gates. Therefore, we expect that this method will find wide applications on current noisy quantum computing devices.</description>

      <title>Microwave-to-optics conversion using magnetostatic modes and a tunable optical cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing, quantum communication and quantum networks rely on hybrid quantum systems operating in different frequency ranges. For instance, the superconducting qubits work in the gigahertz range, while the optical photons used in communication are in the range of hundreds of terahertz. Due to the large frequency mismatch, achieving the direct coupling and information exchange between different information carriers is generally difficult. Accordingly, a quantum interface is demanded, which serves as a bridge to establish information linkage between different quantum systems operating at distinct frequencies. Recently, the magnon mode in ferromagnetic spin systems has received significant attention. While the inherent weak optomagnonic coupling strength restricts the microwave-to-optical photon conversion efficiency using magnons, the versatility of the magnon modes, together with their readily achievable strong coupling with other quantum systems, endow them with many distinct advantages. Here, we realize the magnon-based microwave-light interface by adopting an optical cavity with adjustable free spectrum range and different kinds of magnetostatic modes in two microwave cavity configurations. By optimizing the parameters, an internal conversion efficiency of 1.28 x 10^-7 is achieved. We analyze the impact of various parameters on the microwave-to-optics conversion. The study provides useful guidance and insights to further enhancing the microwave-to-optics conversion efficiency using magnons.</description>

Abstract: The variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) is a promising candidate that brings practical benefits from quantum computing. However, the required bandwidth in/out of a cryostat is a limiting factor to scale cryogenic quantum computers. We propose a tailored counter-based module with single flux quantum circuits in 4-K stage which precomputes a part of VQE calculation and reduces the amount of inter-temperature communication. The evaluation shows that our system reduces the required bandwidth by 97%, and with this drastic reduction, total power consumption is reduced by 93% in the case where 277 VQE programs are executed in parallel on a 10000-qubit machine.</description>

      <title>A Novel Quantum Algorithm for Ant Colony Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum ant colony optimization (QACO) has drew much attention since it combines the advantages of quantum computing and ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithms and overcomes some limitations of the traditional ACO algorithm. However, due to the hardware resource limitations of currently available quantum computers, such as the limited number of qubits, lack of high-fidelity gating operation, and low noisy tolerance, the practical application of the QACO is quite challenging. In this paper, we introduce a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm by combining the clustering algorithm with QACO algorithm, so that this extended QACO can handle large-scale optimization problems, which makes the practical application of QACO based on available quantum computation resource possible. To verify the effectiveness and performance of the algorithm, we tested the developed QACO algorithm with the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) as benchmarks. The developed QACO algorithm shows better performance under multiple data set. In addition, the developed QACO algorithm also manifests the robustness to noise of calculation process, which is typically a major barrier for practical application of quantum computers. Our work shows that the combination of the clustering algorithm with QACO has effectively extended the application scenario of QACO in current NISQ era of quantum computing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular docking is a crucial phase in drug discovery, involving the precise determination of the optimal spatial arrangement between two molecules when they bind. The such analysis, the 3D structure of molecules is a fundamental consideration, involving the manipulation of molecular representations based on their degrees of freedom, including rigid roto-translation and fragment rotations along rotatable bonds, to determine the preferred spatial arrangement when molecules bind to each other. In this paper, quantum annealing based solution to solve Molecular unfolding (MU) problem, a specific phase within molecular docking, is explored and compared with a state-of-the-art classical algorithm named "GeoDock". Molecular unfolding focuses on expanding a molecule to an unfolded state to simplify manipulation within the target cavity and optimize its configuration, typically by maximizing molecular area or internal atom distances. Molecular unfolding problem aims to find the torsional configuration that increases the inter-atomic distance within a molecule, which also increases the molecular area. Quantum annealing approach first encodes the problem into a Higher-order Unconstrained Binary Optimization (HUBO) equation which is pruned to an arbitrary percentage to improve the time efficiency and to be able to solve the equation using any quantum annealer. The resultant HUBO is then converted to a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization equation (QUBO), which is easily embedded on a D-wave annealing Quantum processor.</description>

      <title>Microwave Control of the Tin-Vacancy Spin Qubit in Diamond with a Superconducting Waveguide</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Group-IV color centers in diamond are promising candidates for quantum networks due to their dominant zero-phonon line and symmetry-protected optical transitions that connect to coherent spin levels. The negatively charged tin-vacancy (SnV) center possesses long electron spin lifetimes due to its large spin-orbit splitting. However, the magnetic dipole transitions required for microwave spin control are suppressed, and strain is necessary to enable these transitions. Recent work has shown spin control of strained emitters using microwave lines that suffer from Ohmic losses, restricting coherence through heating. We utilize a superconducting coplanar waveguide to measure SnV centers subjected to strain, observing substantial improvement. A detailed analysis of the SnV center electron spin Hamiltonian based on the angle-dependent splitting of the ground and excited states is performed. We demonstrate coherent spin manipulation and obtain a Hahn echo coherence time of up to $T_2 = 430\,\mu$s. With dynamical decoupling, we can prolong coherence to $T_2 = 10\,$ms, about six-fold improved compared to earlier works. We also observe a nearby coupling $^{13}\mathrm{C}$ spin which may serve as a quantum memory. This substantiates the potential of SnV centers in diamond and demonstrates the benefit of superconducting microwave structures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum optimal control is a set of methods for designing time-varying electromagnetic fields to perform operations in quantum technologies. This tutorial paper introduces the basic elements of this theory based on the Pontryagin maximum principle, in a physicist-friendly way. An analogy with classical Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics is proposed to present the main results used in this field. Emphasis is placed on the different numerical algorithms to solve a quantum optimal control problem. Several examples ranging from the control of two-level quantum systems to that of Bose-Einstein Condensates (BEC) in a one-dimensional optical lattice are studied in detail, using both analytical and numerical methods. Codes based on shooting method and gradient-based algorithms are provided. The connection between optimal processes and the quantum speed limit is also discussed in two-level quantum systems. In the case of BEC, the experimental implementation of optimal control protocols is described, both for two-level and many-level cases, with the current constraints and limitations of such platforms. This presentation is illustrated by the corresponding experimental results.</description>

      <title>N-representable one-electron reduced density matrix reconstruction with frozen core electrons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in quantum crystallography have shown that, beyond conventional charge density refinement, a one-electron reduced density matrix (1-RDM) satisfying N-representability conditions can be reconstructed using jointly experimental X-ray structure factors (XSF) and directional Compton profiles (DCP) through semi-definite programming. So far, such reconstruction methods for 1-RDM, not constrained to idempotency, had been tested only on a toy model system (CO$_2$). In this work, a new method is assessed on crystalline urea (CO(NH$_2$)$_2$) using static (0 K) and dynamic (50 K) artificial-experimental data. An improved model, including symmetry constraints and frozen-core electron contribution, is introduced to better handle the increasing system complexity. Reconstructed 1-RDMs, deformation densities and DCP anisotropy are analyzed, and it is demonstrated that the changes in the model significantly improve the reconstruction's quality against insufficient information and data corruption. The robustness of the model and the strategy are thus shown to be well-adapted to address the reconstruction problem from actual experimental scattering data.</description>

Abstract: Semiconductor quantum dots have shown impressive breakthroughs in the last years, with single and two qubit gate fidelities matching other leading platforms and scalability still remaining a relative strength. However, due to qubit wiring considerations, mobile electron architectures have been proposed to facilitate upward scaling. In this work, we examine and demonstrate the possibility of significantly outperforming static EDSR-type single-qubit pulsing by taking advantage of the larger spatial mobility to achieve larger Rabi frequencies and reduce the effect of charge noise. Our theoretical results indicate that fidelities are ultimately bottlenecked by spin-valley physics, which can be suppressed through the use of quantum optimal control, and we demonstrate that, across different potential regimes and competing physical models, shuttling based single-qubit gates retain significant advantage over existing alternatives.</description>

      <title>Gate-set evaluation metrics for closed-loop optimal control on nitrogen-vacancy center ensembles in diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A recurring challenge in quantum science and technology is the precise control of their underlying dynamics that lead to the desired quantum operations, often described by a set of quantum gates. These gates can be subject to application-specific errors, leading to a dependence of their controls on the chosen circuit, the quality measure and the gate-set itself. A natural solution would be to apply quantum optimal control in an application-oriented fashion. In turn, this requires the definition of a meaningful measure of the contextual gate-set performance. Therefore, we explore and compare the applicability of quantum process tomography, linear inversion gate-set tomography, randomized linear gate-set tomography, and randomized benchmarking as measures for closed-loop quantum optimal control experiments, using a macroscopic ensemble of nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond as a test-bed. Our work demonstrates the relative trade-offs between those measures and how to significantly enhance the gate-set performance, leading to an improvement across all investigated methods.</description>

      <title>Otto cycles with a quantum planar rotor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present two realizations of an Otto cycle with a quantum planar rotor as the working medium controlled by means of external fields. By comparing the quantum and the classical description of the working medium, we single out genuine quantum effects with regards to the performance and the engine and refrigerator modes of the Otto cycle. The first example is a rotating electric dipole subjected to a controlled electric field, equivalent to a quantum pendulum. Here we find a systematic disadvantage of the quantum rotor compared to its classical counterpart. In contrast, a genuine quantum advantage can be observed with a charged rotor generating a magnetic moment that is subjected to a controlled magnetic field. Here, we prove that the classical rotor is inoperable as a working medium for any choice of parameters, whereas the quantum rotor supports an engine and a refrigerator mode, exploiting the quantum statistics during the cold strokes of the cycle.</description>

      <title>Reducing the error rate of a superconducting logical qubit using analog readout information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum error correction enables the preservation of logical qubits with a lower logical error rate than the physical error rate, with performance depending on the decoding method. Traditional error decoding approaches, relying on the binarization (`hardening') of readout data, often ignore valuable information embedded in the analog (`soft') readout signal. We present experimental results showcasing the advantages of incorporating soft information into the decoding process of a distance-three ($d=3$) bit-flip surface code with transmons. To this end, we use the $3\times3$ data-qubit array to encode each of the $16$ computational states that make up the logical state $\ket{0_{\mathrm{L}}}$, and protect them against bit-flip errors by performing repeated $Z$-basis stabilizer measurements. To infer the logical fidelity for the $\ket{0_{\mathrm{L}}}$ state, we average across the $16$ computational states and employ two decoding strategies: minimum weight perfect matching and a recurrent neural network. Our results show a reduction of up to $6.8\%$ in the extracted logical error rate with the use of soft information. Decoding with soft information is widely applicable, independent of the physical qubit platform, and could reduce the readout duration, further minimizing logical error rates.</description>

      <title>Characterization of process-related interfacial dielectric loss in aluminum-on-silicon by resonator microwave measurements, materials analysis, and imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We systematically investigate the influence of the fabrication process on dielectric loss in aluminum-on-silicon superconducting coplanar waveguide resonators with internal quality factors ($Q_i$) of about one million at the single-photon level. These devices are essential components in superconducting quantum processors; they also serve as proxies for understanding the energy loss of superconducting qubits. By systematically varying several fabrication steps, we identify the relative importance of reducing loss at the substrate-metal and the substrate-air interfaces. We find that it is essential to clean the silicon substrate in hydrogen fluoride (HF) prior to aluminum deposition. A post-fabrication removal of the oxides on the surface of the silicon substrate and the aluminum film by immersion in HF further improves the $Q_i$. We observe a small, but noticeable, adverse effect on the loss by omitting either standard cleaning (SC1), pre-deposition heating of the substrate to 300$\deg$C, or in-situ post-deposition oxidation of the film's top surface. We find no improvement due to excessive pumping meant to reach a background pressure below $6{\times} 10^{-8}$ mbar. We correlate the measured loss with microscopic properties of the substrate-metal interface through characterization with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectroscopy (ToF-SIMS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), and atomic force microscopy (AFM).</description>

      <title>A Universal Roadmap For Searching Repulsive Casimir Forces Between Magneto-Electric Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Casimir effect, arising from vacuum quantum fluctuations, plays a fundamental role in the development of modern quantum electrodynamics. In parallel, the field of condensed matter has flourished through the discovery of various materials exhibiting broken symmetries, often connected to topology and characterized by magneto-electric coupling. Here, we calculate the Casimir forces between materials with time-reversal symmetry and/or parity symmetry breaking. Remarkably, we obtain a universal phase diagram governing the sign of symmetry-breaking-induced Casimir forces, contributing to a comprehensive understanding on the sign of Casimir force for linear optical materials. The discovered phase diagram serves as a roadmap for searching repulsive Casimir forces, a subject bearing both theoretical interest and practical significance.</description>

      <title>Scalable Multispecies Ion Transport in a Grid Based Surface-Electrode Trap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a scalable method for the control of ion crystals in a grid-based surface electrode Paul trap and characterize it in the context of transport operations that sort and reorder multispecies crystals. By combining co-wiring of control electrodes at translationally symmetric locations in each grid site with the site-wise ability to exchange the voltages applied to two special electrodes gated by a binary input, site-dependent operations are achieved using only a fixed number of analog voltage signals and a single digital input per site. In two separate experimental systems containing nominally identical grid traps, one using $^{171}\mathrm{Yb}^{+}$-$^{138}\mathrm{Ba}^{+}$ crystals and the other $^{137}\mathrm{Ba}^{+}$-$^{88}\mathrm{Sr}^{+}$, we demonstrate this method by characterizing the conditional intra-site crystal reorder and the conditional exchange of ions between adjacent sites on the grid. Averaged across a multi-site region of interest, we measure sub-quanta motional excitation in the axial in-phase and out-of-phase modes of the crystals following these operations at exchange rates of 2.5 kHz. These conditional transport operations display all necessary components for sorting qubits, and could be extended to implement other conditional operations involving control fields such as gates, initialization, and measurement.</description>

      <title>Radical Pair Mechanism and the Role of Chirality-Induced Spin Selectivity during Planaria Regeneration: Effect of Weak Magnetic Field on ROS levels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00003v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Planarian is an intriguing model system wherein the effect of electric and magnetic fields can be studied on various biochemical pathways during cell morphogenesis. Recent experimental observations have demonstrated the non-trivial modulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels by a weak magnetic field during planaria regeneration. However, the underlying biophysical mechanism behind this remains elusive. In this paper, we study the radical pair mechanism to explain the effect of weak magnetic fields on ROS modulation during planaria regeneration to explain the experimental results. We also investigate the effect of chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS) on ROS levels by including it in the framework of the radical pair mechanism. We conclude that the inclusion of CISS explains the experimental results better and allows the radical pair model to have more parametric space to satisfy the experimental constraints. This study explains the crucial process of ROS modulation by the weak magnetic field with and without CISS, thereby paving the way to unraveling the vast domain of ROS modulation for desired outcomes.</description>

      <title>Quantum Readiness in Healthcare and Public Health: Building a Quantum Literate Workforce</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00122v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum technologies, including quantum computing, cryptography, and sensing, among others, are set to revolutionize sectors ranging from materials science to drug discovery. Despite their significant potential, the implications for public health have been largely overlooked, highlighting a critical gap in recognition and preparation. This oversight necessitates immediate action, as public health remains largely unaware of quantum technologies as a tool for advancement. The application of quantum principles to epidemiology and health informatics, termed quantum health epidemiology and quantum health informatics, has the potential to radically transform disease surveillance, prediction, modeling, and analysis of health data. However, there is a notable lack of quantum expertise within the public health workforce and educational pipelines. This gap underscores the urgent need for the development of quantum literacy among public health practitioners, leaders, and students to leverage emerging opportunities while addressing risks and ethical considerations. Innovative teaching methods, such as interactive simulations, games, visual models, and other tailored platforms, offer viable solutions for bridging knowledge gaps without the need for advanced physics or mathematics. However, the opportunity to adapt is fleeting as the quantum era in healthcare looms near. It is imperative that public health urgently focuses on updating its educational approaches, workforce strategies, data governance, and organizational culture to proactively meet the challenges of quantum disruption thereby becoming quantum ready.</description>

      <title>Ab initio modelling of quantum dot qubits: Coupling, gate dynamics and robustness versus charge noise</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electron spins in semiconductor devices are highly promising building blocks for quantum processors (QPs). Commercial semiconductor foundries can create QPs using the same processes employed for conventional chips, once the QP design is suitably specified. There is a vast accessible design space; to identify the most promising options for fabrication, one requires predictive modeling of interacting electrons in real geometries and complex non-ideal environments. In this work we explore a modelling method based on real-space grids, an ab initio approach without assumptions relating to device topology and therefore with wide applicability. Given an electrode geometry, we determine the exchange coupling between quantum dot qubits, and model the full evolution of a $\sqrt{\text{SWAP}}$ gate to predict qubit loss and infidelity rates for various voltage profiles. Moreover we explore the impact of unwanted charge defects (static and dynamic) in the environment, and test robust pulse sequences. As an example we exhibit a sequence correcting both systematic errors and (unknown) charge defects, observing an order of magnitude boost in fidelity. The technique can thus identify the most promising device designs for fabrication, as well as bespoke control sequences for each such device.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study discussed Dirac's bra-ket formalism for the identical particles system to extend the rigged Hilbert space reformulated by R. Madrid [J. Phys. A:Math. Gen. 37, 8129 (2004)]. The bra and ket vectors for a composite system that form the basis of an identical particle system were reconstructed using the tensor product of rigged Hilbert space.They were found to be characterized in the dual spaces of the tensor product of nuclear spaces. The proofs utilized in this paper adopt a format similar to that used in physics, yet they will be mathematically rigorous. This formulation lays the foundation for modern quantum theories based on perturbation theory, such as quantum statistical mechanics and quantum field theory.</description>

      <title>Majorana zero-modes in a dissipative Rashba nanowire</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00419v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Condensed matter systems are continuously subjected to dissipation, which often has adverse effects on quantum phenomena. We focus on the impact of dissipation on a superconducting Rashba nanowire. We reveal that the system can still host Majorana zero-modes (MZMs) with a finite lifetime in the presence of dissipation. Most interestingly, dissipation can also generate two kinds of dissipative boundary states: four robust zero-modes (RZMs) and two MZMs, in the regime where the non-dissipative system is topologically trivial. The MZMs appear via bulk gap closing and are topologically characterized by a winding number. The RZMs are not associated with any bulk states and possess no winding number, but their emergence is instead tied to exceptional points. Further, we confirm the stability of the dissipation-induced RZMs and MZMs in the presence of random disorder. Our study paves the way for both realizing and stabilizing MZMs in an experimental setup, driven by dissipation.</description>

      <title>Monte Carlo based techniques for quantum magnets with long-range interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00421v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Long-range interactions are relevant for a large variety of quantum systems in quantum optics and condensed matter physics. In particular, the control of quantum-optical platforms promises to gain deep insights in quantum-critical properties induced by the long-range nature of interactions. From a theoretical perspective, long-range interactions are notoriously complicated to treat. Here, we give an overview of recent advancements to investigate quantum magnets with long-range interactions focusing on two techniques based on Monte Carlo integration. First, the method of perturbative continuous unitary transformations where classical Monte Carlo integration is applied within the embedding scheme of white graphs. This linked-cluster expansion allows to extract high-order series expansions of energies and observables in the thermodynamic limit. Second, stochastic series expansion quantum Monte Carlo which enables calculations on large finite systems. Finite-size scaling can then be used to determine physical properties of the infinite system. In recent years, both techniques have been applied successfully to one- and two-dimensional quantum magnets involving long-range Ising, XY, and Heisenberg interactions on various bipartite and non-bipartite lattices. Here, we summarise the obtained quantum-critical properties including critical exponents for all these systems in a coherent way. Further, we review how long-range interactions are used to study quantum phase transitions above the upper critical dimension and the scaling techniques to extract these quantum critical properties from the numerical calculations.</description>

      <title>Single vibronic level fluorescence spectra from Hagedorn wavepacket dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00577v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In single vibronic level (SVL) fluorescence experiments, the electronically excited initial state is also excited in one or several vibrational modes. Whereas the time-independent approach of computing all contributing Franck-Condon factors becomes impractical in large systems, a time-dependent formalism has not been applied to simulate emission from arbitrary initial vibrational levels. Here, we apply Hagedorn functions, which are products of a Gaussian and carefully generated polynomials, to represent SVL initial states. Under an at most quadratic potential, the Hagedorn functions are exact solutions to the time-dependent Schr\"{o}dinger equation and can be propagated using the same equations of motion as a simple Gaussian wavepacket. Having developed an efficient recursive algorithm to compute the overlaps between two Hagedorn wavepackets, we can now evaluate emission spectra from arbitrary vibronic levels using a single trajectory. Here, we use two-dimensional global harmonic models to validate the method by comparing it with quantum split-operator calculations and to demonstrate the effects of displacement, distortion (squeezing), and Duschinsky rotation on SVL spectra. Additionally, we show the practicality of the Hagedorn approach in a high-dimensional system on a displaced, distorted, and Duschinsky-rotated harmonic model with 100 degrees of freedom.</description>

Abstract: Single vibronic level (SVL) fluorescence spectroscopy contributes to the understanding of molecular vibrational structures and relaxation processes. Based on Hagedorn wavepackets, we have recently proposed a time-dependent approach to compute SVL spectra from arbitrary initial vibrational levels, i.e., higher excitations in multiple modes, and validated it against exact quantum calculations on model systems. Here, we extend the application of our method to a realistic molecular system, anthracene, employing a harmonic model constructed from ab initio electronic structure data. With the Hagedorn approach, we not only successfully reproduce the previously reported simulation results for singly excited $12^{1}$ and $\overline{11}^{1}$ levels, but are also able to compute SVL spectra from multiply excited levels in good agreement with experiments and from the same Hagedorn wavepacket trajectory without any additional propagation beyond what is required for ground-state emission spectra.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00710v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically study the dephasing of an Andreev spin qubit (ASQ) due to electric and magnetic noise. Using a tight-binding model, we calculate the Andreev states formed in a Josephson junction where the link is a semiconductor with strong spin-orbit interaction. As a result of both the spin-orbit interaction and induced superconductivity, the local charge and spin of these states varies as a function of externally controllable parameters: the phase difference between the superconducting leads, an applied magnetic field, and filling of the underlying semiconductor. Concomitantly, coupling to fluctuations of the electric or magnetic environment will vary, which informs the rate of dephasing. We qualitatively predict the dependence of dephasing on the nature of the environment, magnetic field, phase difference between the junction, and filling of the semiconductor. Comparing the simulated electric- and magnetic-noise-induced dephasing rate to experiment suggests that the dominant source of noise is magnetic. Moreover, by appropriately tuning these external parameters, we find sweet-spots at which we predict an enhancement in ASQ coherence times.</description>

Abstract: Unsharp measurements are widely seen as the key resource for recycling the nonlocality of an entangled state shared between several sequential observers. Contrasting this, we here show that nonlocality can be recycled using only standard projective measurements, without using quantum ancillas. Focusing on the CHSH inequality, we determine the optimal trade-off in the Bell parameters for a maximally entangled two-qubit state in the presence of shared classical randomness. We then find that non-maximally entangled states make possible larger sequential violations, which contrasts the standard CHSH scenario. Furthermore, we show that nonlocality can be recycled even when only using projective measurements and local randomness. We discuss the implications of our results for experimental implementations of sequential nonlocality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.16097v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Subspace diagonalisation methods have appeared recently as promising means to access the ground state and some excited states of molecular Hamiltonians by classically diagonalising small matrices, whose elements can be efficiently obtained by a quantum computer. The recently proposed Variational Quantum Phase Estimation (VQPE) algorithm uses a basis of real time-evolved states, for which the energy eigenvalues can be obtained directly from the unitary matrix U = exp(-iHt), which can be computed with cost linear in the number of states used. In this paper, we report a circuit-based implementation of VQPE for arbitrary molecular systems and assess its performance and costs for the H2, H3+ and H6 molecules. We also propose using Variational Fast Forwarding (VFF) to decrease to quantum depth of time-evolution circuits for use in VQPE. We show that the approximation provides a good basis for Hamiltonian diagonalisation even when its fidelity to the true time evolved states is low. In the high fidelity case, we show that the approximate unitary U can be diagonalised instead, preserving the linear cost of exact VQPE.</description>

Abstract: Non-Markovian effects in open quantum system dynamics usually manifest backflow of information from the environment to the system, indicating complete-positive divisibility breaking of the dynamics. We provide a criterion for witnessing such non-Markovian dynamics exhibiting information backflow, based on the moments of Choi-matrices. The moment condition determined by the positive semi-definiteness of a matrix, does not hold for a Choi-state describing non-Markovian dynamics. We then present some explicit examples in support of our proposed non-Markovianity detection scheme. Finally, a moment based measure of non-Markovianity for unital dynamics is formulated.</description>

      <title>Towards Hamiltonian Simulation with Decision Diagrams</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.02337v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel approach to Hamiltonian simulation using Decision Diagrams (DDs), which are an exact representation based on exploiting redundancies in representations of quantum states and operations. While the simulation of Hamiltonians has been studied extensively, scaling these simulations to larger or more complex systems is often challenging and may require approximations or new simulation methods altogether. DDs offer such an alternative that has not yet been applied to Hamiltonian simulation. In this work, we investigate the behavior of DDs for this task. To this end, we review the basics of DDs such as their construction and present how the relevant operations for Hamiltonian simulation are implemented in this data structure -- leading to the first DD-based Hamiltonian simulation approach. Based on several series of evaluations and comparisons, we then discuss insights about the performance of this complementary approach. Overall, these studies show that DDs indeed may offer a promising new data structure which, for certain examples, can provide orders of magnitudes of improvement compared to the state-of-the-art, yet also comes with its own, fundamentally different, limitations.</description>

      <title>Exploring Quantum Synchronization with a Composite Two-Qubit Oscillator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.04205v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Synchronization has recently been explored deep in the quantum regime with elementary few-level quantum oscillators such as qudits and weakly pumped quantum Van der Pol oscillators. To engineer more complex quantum synchronizing systems, it is practically relevant to study composite oscillators built up from basic quantum units that are commonly available and offer high controllability. Here, we consider a minimal model for a composite oscillator consisting of two interacting qubits coupled to separate baths, and show that this system exhibits a wide variety of synchronizing behaviors. We study the phase response of the constituent qubits as well as the system as a whole, when one of the qubits is weakly driven. We consider the thermal baths to have positive as well as effective negative temperatures, and discover effects that occur only when the temperatures of the baths for the two qubits are of opposite signs. We propose and analyze a circuit quantum electrodynamics implementation of this model, which exploits recent advances in dissipation engineering to realize effective negative temperature baths. Our work demonstrates the potential for assembling complex quantum synchronizing systems from basic building units, which is of pragmatic importance for advancing the field of quantum synchronization.</description>

      <title>VarSaw: Application-tailored Measurement Error Mitigation for Variational Quantum Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.06027v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For potential quantum advantage, Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) need high accuracy beyond the capability of today's NISQ devices, and thus will benefit from error mitigation. In this work we are interested in mitigating measurement errors which occur during qubit measurements after circuit execution and tend to be the most error-prone operations, especially detrimental to VQAs. Prior work, JigSaw, has shown that measuring only small subsets of circuit qubits at a time and collecting results across all such subset circuits can reduce measurement errors. Then, running the entire (global) original circuit and extracting the qubit-qubit measurement correlations can be used in conjunction with the subsets to construct a high-fidelity output distribution of the original circuit. Unfortunately, the execution cost of JigSaw scales polynomially in the number of qubits in the circuit, and when compounded by the number of circuits and iterations in VQAs, the resulting execution cost quickly turns insurmountable.
  To combat this, we propose VarSaw, which improves JigSaw in an application-tailored manner, by identifying considerable redundancy in the JigSaw approach for VQAs: spatial redundancy across subsets from different VQA circuits and temporal redundancy across globals from different VQA iterations. VarSaw then eliminates these forms of redundancy by commuting the subset circuits and selectively executing the global circuits, reducing computational cost (in terms of the number of circuits executed) over naive JigSaw for VQA by 25x on average and up to 1000x, for the same VQA accuracy. Further, it can recover, on average, 45% of the infidelity from measurement errors in the noisy VQA baseline. Finally, it improves fidelity by 55%, on average, over JigSaw for a fixed computational budget. VarSaw can be accessed here: https://github.com/siddharthdangwal/VarSaw.</description>

      <title>Ultimate limits in energy extraction from quantum batteries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.16746v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Energy extraction from quantum batteries by means of completely positive trace-preserving (CPTP) maps is quite well-studied in the literature. It naturally leads to the concept of CPTP-local passive states, which identify bipartite states from which no energy can be squeezed out by applying any CPTP map to a particular subsystem. We prove, for arbitrary dimension, that if a state is CPTP-local passive with respect to a Hamiltonian, then an arbitrary number of copies of the same state - including an asymptotically large one - is also CPTP-local passive. We provide a necessary and sufficient condition for an arbitrary bipartite state to be unable to supply any energy using NCPTP operations on one party with respect to an arbitrary but fixed Hamiltonian. We show further that energy can be extracted efficiently from these CPTP-local passive states employing non-completely positive trace-preserving (NCPTP) but still physically realizable maps on the same part of the shared battery on which operation of CPTP maps were useless. Moreover, we provide the maximum extractable energy using local-CPTP operations, and then, we present an explicit class of states and corresponding Hamiltonians, for which the maximum can be outperformed using physical local NCPTP maps. We build an analogy between the relative status of CPTP and NCPTP operations for energy extraction in quantum batteries, and the association of distillable entanglement with entanglement cost for asymptotic local manipulations of entanglement. The surpassing of the maximum energy extractable by NCPTP maps for CPTP passive as well as for CPTP non-passive battery states can act as detectors of non-CPTPness of quantum maps. Additionally, we provide an independent necessary condition for an arbitrary bipartite state and Hamiltonian to be NCPTP-local passive.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.00898v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum information scrambling is the dynamical process where initially localized quantum information spreads over diverse degrees of freedom. Out-of-time-order correlators and tripartite mutual information have been utilized as key metrics to investigate scrambling, with a specific emphasis on the long-time asymptotic behavior and the early-time spreading. An open question is the comprehensive clarification of the dynamics of scrambling, covering the intermediate-time regime. Here, by extending the idea of quantum reservoir computing, we propose quantum reservoir probing (QRP) to diagnose scrambling in a unified manner for arbitrary degrees of freedom at arbitrary times, through information estimation performance. As a paradigmatic example, we investigate a one-dimensional quantum Ising chain. We show that the QRP successfully distinguishes between quasiparticle-mediated information propagation in a free fermion system and correlation-mediated scrambling in a quantum chaotic system. Furthermore, by systematically scanning the read-out operators, we can identify the system-specific information propagation channels, a distinct advantage over the conventional methods.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of a parity-time symmetry breaking phase transition using superconducting and trapped-ion qutrits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.20432v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scalable quantum computers hold the promise to solve hard computational problems, such as prime factorization, combinatorial optimization, simulation of many-body physics, and quantum chemistry. While being key to understanding many real-world phenomena, simulation of non-conservative quantum dynamics presents a challenge for unitary quantum computation. In this work, we focus on simulating non-unitary parity-time symmetric systems, which exhibit a distinctive symmetry-breaking phase transition as well as other unique features that have no counterpart in closed systems. We show that a qutrit, a three-level quantum system, is capable of realizing this non-equilibrium phase transition. By using two physical platforms -- an array of trapped ions and a superconducting transmon -- and by controlling their three energy levels in a digital manner, we experimentally simulate the parity-time symmetry-breaking phase transition. Our results indicate the potential advantage of multi-level (qudit) processors in simulating physical effects, where additional accessible levels can play the role of a controlled environment.</description>

Abstract: The number of atoms in Bose-Einstein condensate determines the scale of experiments that can be performed, making it crucial for quantum simulations. Optimization of the number of atoms in the condensate is a complex problem which could be efficiently solved using machine learning technique. Nevertheless, this approach usually does not give any insight in the underlying physics. Here we demonstrate possibility to learn physics from the machine learning on an example of condensation of thulium atoms at a 1064-nm dipole trap. Optimization of the number of condensed atoms revealed a saturation, which was explained as limitation imposed by a 3-body recombination process. This limitation was successfully overcome by leveraging Fano-Feshbach resonances.</description>

      <title>Analysis of sum-of-squares relaxations for the quantum rotor model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.09010v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The noncommutative sum-of-squares (ncSoS) hierarchy was introduced by Navascu\'{e}s-Pironio-Ac\'{i}n as a sequence of semidefinite programming relaxations for approximating values of noncommutative polynomial optimization problems, which were originally intended to generalize quantum values of nonlocal games. Recent work has started to analyze the hierarchy for approximating ground energies of local Hamiltonians, initially through rounding algorithms which output product states for degree-2 ncSoS applied to Quantum Max-Cut. Some rounding methods are known which output entangled states, but they use degree-4 ncSoS. Based on this, Hwang-Neeman-Parekh-Thompson-Wright conjectured that degree-2 ncSoS cannot beat product state approximations for Quantum Max-Cut and gave a partial proof relying on a conjectural generalization of Borrell's inequality. In this work we consider a family of Hamiltonians (called the quantum rotor model in condensed matter literature or lattice $O(k)$ vector model in quantum field theory) with infinite-dimensional local Hilbert space $L^{2}(S^{k - 1})$, and show that a degree-2 ncSoS relaxation approximates the ground state energy better than any product state.</description>

      <title>Thermalization rate of polaritons in strongly-coupled molecular systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.09896v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Polariton thermalization is a key process in achieving light-matter Bose--Einstein condensation, spanning from solid-state semiconductor microcavities at cryogenic temperatures to surface plasmon nanocavities with molecules at room temperature. Originated from the matter component of polariton states, the microscopic mechanisms of thermalization are closely tied to specific material properties. In this work, we investigate polariton thermalization in strongly-coupled molecular systems. We develop a microscopic theory addressing polariton thermalization through electron-phonon interactions (known as exciton-vibration coupling) with low-energy molecular vibrations. This theory presents a simple analytical method to calculate the temperature-dependent polariton thermalization rate, utilizing experimentally accessible spectral properties of bare molecules, such as the Stokes shift and temperature-dependent linewidth of photoluminescence, in conjunction with well-known parameters of optical cavities. Our findings demonstrate qualitative agreement with recent experimental reports of nonequilibrium polariton condensation in both ground and excited states, and explain the thermalization bottleneck effect observed at low temperatures. This study showcases the significance of vibrational degrees of freedom in polariton condensation and offers practical guidance for future experiments, including the selection of suitable material systems and cavity designs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.11906v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a highly feasible technique with no experimental overhead to rapidly cool the in-plane degrees of freedom of large two-dimensional ion crystals in Penning traps. Through simulations, we demonstrate that our approach enables the in-plane modes to cool down to a temperature of around 1 mK in less than 10 ms. Our technique relies on near-resonant coupling of the poorly cooled in-plane motions and the efficiently cooled out-of-plane motions, and is achieved without introducing additional potentials. The rapid cooling enabled by our approach is in contrast to typical operating conditions, where our simulations of the laser cooling dynamics suggest that the ion crystal's in-plane motion cools very slowly on a timescale of several hundreds of milliseconds, a rate likely slower than experimental heating rates. Our work sets the stage for sub-Doppler laser cooling of the planar motion, and more robust and versatile quantum simulation and quantum sensing experiments with two-dimensional crystals in Penning traps.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.02637v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we provide a comprehensive overview of the microwave-induced manipulation of electronic spin states in negatively charged group-IV color centers in diamond with a particular emphasis on the influence of strain. Central to our investigation is the consideration of the full vectorial attributes of the magnetic fields involved, which are a dc field for lifting the degeneracy of the spin levels and an ac field for microwave control between two spin levels. We observe an intricate interdependence between their spatial orientations, the externally applied strain, and the resultant efficacy in spin state control. In most work to date the ac and dc magnetic field orientations have been insufficiently addressed, which has led to the conclusion that strain is indispensable for the effective microwave control of heavier group-IV vacancies, such as tin- and lead-vacancy color centers. In contrast, we find that the alignment of the dc magnetic field orthogonal to the symmetry axis and the ac field parallel to it can make the application of strain obsolete for effective spin manipulation. Furthermore, we explore the implications of this field configuration on the spin's optical initialization, readout, and gate fidelities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.10350v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We reveal the continuous phase transition in anyonic-PT symmetric systems, contrasting with the discontinuous phase transition corresponding to the discrete (anti-) PT symmetry. The continuous phase transition originates from the continuity of anyonic-PT symmetry. We find there are three information-dynamics patterns for anyonic-PT symmetric systems: damped oscillations with an overall decrease (increase) and asymptotically stable damped oscillations, which are three-fold degenerate and distorted using the Hermitian quantum R\'enyi entropy or distinguishability. It is the normalization of the non-unitary evolved density matrix causes the degeneracy and distortion. We give a justification for non-Hermitian quantum R\'enyi entropy being negative. By exploring the mathematics and physical meaning of the negative entropy in open quantum systems, we connect the negative non-Hermitian quantum R\'enyi entropy and negative quantum conditional entropy, opening up a new journey to rigorously investigate the negative entropy in open quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Extracting double-quantum coherence in two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy under pump-probe geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01731v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy (2DES) can be implemented with different geometries, e.g., BOXCARS, collinear and pump-probe geometries. The pump-probe geometry has its advantage of overlapping only two beams and reducing phase cycling steps. However, its applications are typically limited to observe the dynamics with single-quantum coherence and population, leaving the challenge to measure the dynamics of the double-quantum (2Q) coherence, which reflects the many-body interactions. We propose an experimental technique in 2DES under pump-probe geometry with a designed pulse sequence and the signal processing method to extract 2Q coherence. In the designed pulse sequence with the probe pulse arriving earlier than pump pulses, our measured signal includes the 2Q signal as well as the zero-quantum (0Q) signal. With phase cycling and the data processing using causality enforcement, we extract the 2Q signal. The proposal is demonstrated with the rubidium atoms. And we observe the collective resonances of two-body dipole-dipole interactions of both $D_{1}$ and $D_{2}$ lines.</description>

      <title>Identifying gap-closings in open non-Hermitian systems by Biorthogonal Polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12213v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate gap-closings in one- and two-dimensional tight-binding models with two bands, containing non-Hermitian hopping terms, and open boundary conditions (OBCs) imposed along one direction. We compare the bulk OBC spectra with the periodic boundary condition (PBC) spectra, pointing out that they do not coincide, which is an intrinsic characteristic of non-Hermitian systems. The non-Hermiticity, thus, results in the failure of the familiar notions of bulk-boundary correspondence found for Hermitian systems. This necessitates the search for topological invariants which can characterize gap-closings in open non-Hermitian systems correctly and unambiguously. We elucidate the behaviour of two possible candidates applicable for one-dimensional slices -- (1) the sum of winding numbers for the two bands defined on a generalized Brillouin zone and (2) the biorthogonal polarization (BP). While the former shows jumps/discontinuities for some of the non-Hermitian systems studied here, at points when an edge mode enters the bulk states and becomes delocalized, it does not maintain quantized values in a given topological phase. On the contrary, BP shows jumps at phase transitions, and takes the quantized value of one or zero, which corresponds to whether an actual edge mode exists or whether that mode is delocalized and absorbed within the bulk (not being an edge mode anymore).</description>

      <title>Nonlinear, non-signaling Schr\"odinger equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08757v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A nonlinear extension of Schr\"odinger's wave equation is proposed that ensures non-signaling by keeping linear the evolution of \textit{coordinate-diagonal} elements of the density matrix. The equation contains a negative kinetic energy term that turns spreading of wave packets into its opposite: collapsing, as some effective mass $M$ grows beyond a universal critical mass, estimated to be about $\mu = 2\cdot10^{-23}~$kg; then linear quantum kinetic energy gets negligible, which marks the quantum-classical border. Interference of large molecules is suggested for an experimental check of the proposed framework.</description>

      <title>Amplified Amplitude Estimation: Exploiting Prior Knowledge to Improve Estimates of Expectation Values</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14791v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a method for estimating the expectation value of an operator that can utilize prior knowledge to accelerate the learning process on a quantum computer. Specifically, suppose we have an operator that can be expressed as a concise sum of projectors whose expectation values we know a priori to be $O(\epsilon)$. In that case, we can estimate the expectation value of the entire operator within error $\epsilon$ using a number of quantum operations that scales as $O(1/\sqrt{\epsilon})$. We then show how this can be used to reduce the cost of learning a potential energy surface in quantum chemistry applications by exploiting information gained from the energy at nearby points. Furthermore, we show, using Newton-Cotes methods, how these ideas can be exploited to learn the energy via integration of derivatives that we can estimate using a priori knowledge. This allows us to reduce the cost of energy estimation if the block-encodings of directional derivative operators have a smaller normalization constant than the Hamiltonian of the system.</description>

      <title>On the existence of unbiased resilient estimators in discrete quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15242v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cram\'er-Rao constitutes a crucial lower bound for the mean squared error of an estimator in frequentist parameter estimation, albeit paradoxically demanding highly accurate prior knowledge of the parameter to be estimated. Indeed, this information is needed to construct the optimal unbiased estimator, which is highly dependent on the parameter. Conversely, Bhattacharyya bounds result in a more resilient estimation about prior accuracy by imposing additional constraints on the estimator. Initially, we conduct a quantitative comparison of the performance between Cram\'er-Rao and Bhattacharyya bounds when faced with less-than-ideal prior knowledge of the parameter. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the $n^{th}$order classical and quantum Bhattacharyya bounds cannot be computed -- given the absence of estimators satisfying the constraints -- under specific conditions tied to the dimension $m$ of the discrete system. Intriguingly, for a system with the same dimension $m$, the maximum non-trivial order $n$ is $m-1$ in the classical case, while in the quantum realm, it extends to $m(m+1)/2-1$. Consequently, for a given system dimension, one can construct estimators in quantum systems that exhibit increased robustness to prior ignorance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18940v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The field of quantum deep learning presents significant opportunities for advancing computational capabilities, yet it faces a major obstacle in the form of the "information loss problem" due to the inherent limitations of the necessary quantum tomography in scaling quantum deep neural networks. This paper introduces an end-to-end Quantum Vision Transformer (QViT), which incorporates an innovative quantum residual connection technique, to overcome these challenges and therefore optimize quantum computing processes in deep learning. Our thorough complexity analysis of the QViT reveals a theoretically exponential and empirically polynomial speedup, showcasing the model's efficiency and potential in quantum computing applications. We conducted extensive numerical tests on modern, large-scale transformers and datasets, establishing the QViT as a pioneering advancement in applying quantum deep neural networks in practical scenarios. Our work provides a comprehensive quantum deep learning paradigm, which not only demonstrates the versatility of current quantum linear algebra algorithms but also promises to enhance future research and development in quantum deep learning.</description>

      <title>Quantum circuits for toric code and X-cube fracton model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.01682v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a systematic and efficient quantum circuit composed solely of Clifford gates for simulating the ground state of the surface code model. This approach yields the ground state of the toric code in $\lceil 2L+2+log_{2}(d)+\frac{L}{2d} \rceil$ time steps, where $L$ refers to the system size and $d$ represents the maximum distance to constrain the application of the CNOT gates. Our algorithm reformulates the problem into a purely geometric one, facilitating its extension to attain the ground state of certain 3D topological phases, such as the 3D toric model in $3L+8$ steps and the X-cube fracton model in $12L+11$ steps. Furthermore, we introduce a gluing method involving measurements, enabling our technique to attain the ground state of the 2D toric code on an arbitrary planar lattice and paving the way to more intricate 3D topological phases.</description>

      <title>Microscopic many-body theory of two-dimensional coherent spectroscopy of exciton-polarons in one-dimensional materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.11998v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have developed a microscopic many-body theory of two-dimensional coherent spectroscopy (2DCS) for a model of polarons in one-dimensional (1D) materials. Our theory accounts for contributions from all three processes: excited-state emission (ESE), ground-state bleaching (GSB), and excited-state absorption (ESA). While the ESE and GSB contributions can be accurately described using a Chevy's ansatz with one particle-hole excitation, the ESA process requires information about the many-body eigenstates involving two impurities. To calculate these double polaron states, we have extended the Chevy's ansatz with one particle-hole excitation. The validity of this ansatz was verified by comparing our results with an exact calculation using Bethe's ansatz. Our numerical results reveal that in the weak interaction limit, the ESA contribution cancels out the total ESE and GSB contributions, resulting in less significant spectral features. However, for strong interactions, the features of the ESA contribution and the combined ESE and GSB contributions remain observable in the 2DCS spectra. These features provide valuable information about the interactions between polarons. Additionally, we have investigated the mixing time dynamics, which characterize the quantum coherences of the polaron resonances. Overall, our theory provides a comprehensive framework for understanding and interpreting the 2DCS spectra of polarons in 1D materials, shedding light on their interactions and coherent dynamics.</description>

      <title>Small-time controllability for the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation on $\mathbb{R}^N$ via bilinear electromagnetic fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.15819v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address the small-time controllability problem for a nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation (NLS) on $\mathbb{R}^N$ in the presence of magnetic and electric external fields. We choose a particular framework where the equation becomes $i\partial_t \psi = [-\Delta+u_0(t)h_{\vec{0}}+\langle u(t), P\rangle +\kappa|\psi|^{2p}]\psi$. Here, the control operators are defined by the zeroth Hermite function $h_{\vec{0}}(x)$ and the momentum operator $P=i\nabla$. In detail, we study when it is possible to control the dynamics of (NLS) as fast as desired via sufficiently large control signals $u_0$ and $u$. We first show the existence of a family of quantum states for which this property is verified. Secondly, by considering some specific states belonging to this family, as a physical consequence we show the capability of controlling arbitrary changes of energy in bounded regions of the quantum system, in time zero. Our results are proved by exploiting the idea that the nonlinear term in (NLS) is only a perturbation of the linear problem when the time is as small as desired. The core of the proof, then, is the controllability of the bilinear equation which is tackled by using specific non-commutativity properties of infinite-dimensional propagators.</description>

      <title>Quantum many-body thermal machines enabled by atom-atom correlations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.05266v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Particle-particle correlations, characterized by the second-order Glauber correlation function, play an important role in the understanding of various phenomena in radio and optical astronomy, quantum and atom optics, particle physics, condensed matter physics, and quantum many-body theory. However, the relevance of such correlations to quantum thermodynamics has so far remained illusive. Here, we propose and investigate a class of quantum many-body thermal machines whose operation is directly enabled by second-order atom-atom correlations in an ultracold atomic gas. More specifically, we study quantum thermal machines that operate in a sudden interaction-quench Otto cycle and utilize a one-dimensional Lieb-Liniger gas of repulsively interacting bosons as the working fluid. The atom-atom correlations in such a gas are different to those of a classical ideal gas, and are a result of the interplay between interparticle interactions, quantum statistics, and thermal fluctuations. We show that operating these thermal machines in the intended regimes, such as a heat engine, refrigerator, thermal accelerator, or heater, would be impossible without such atom-atom correlations. Our results constitute a step forward in the design of conceptually new quantum thermodynamic devices which take advantage of uniquely quantum resources such as quantum coherence, correlations, and entanglement.</description>

      <title>Probing Hilbert space fragmentation and the block inverse participation ratio</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.03632v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a family of quantum many-body Hamiltonians that show exact Hilbert space fragmentation in certain limits. The question arises whether fragmentation has implications for Hamiltonians in the vicinity of the subset defined by these exactly fragmented models, in particular in the thermodynamic limit. We attempt to illuminate this issue by considering distinguishable classes of transitional behavior between fragmented and nonfragmented regimes and employing a set of numerical observables that indicate this transition. As one of these observables we present a modified inverse participation ratio (IPR) that is designed to capture the emergence of fragmented block structures. We compare this block IPR to other definitions of inverse participation ratios, as well as to the more traditional measures of level-spacing statistics and entanglement entropy. In order to resolve subtleties that arise in the numerics, we use perturbation theory around the fragmented limit as a basis for defining an effective block structure. We find that our block IPR predicts a boundary between fragmented and nonfragmented regimes that is compatible with results based on level statistics and bipartite entanglement. A scaling analysis indicates that a finite region around the exactly fragmented limit is dominated by effects of approximate fragmentation, even in the thermodynamic limit, and suggests that fragmentation constitutes a phase. We provide evidence for the universality of our approach by applying it to a different family of Hamiltonians, that features a fragmented limit due to emergent dipole conservation.</description>

Abstract: In the last decade, numerous works have investigated several properties of symplectic eigenvalues. Remarkably, the results on symplectic eigenvalues have been found to be analogous to those of eigenvalues of Hermitian matrices with appropriate interpretations. In particular, symplectic analogs of famous eigenvalue inequalities are known today such as Weyl's inequalities, Lidskii's inequalities, and Schur--Horn majorization inequalities. In this paper, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for equality in the symplectic analogs of the aforementioned inequalities. The equality conditions for the symplectic Weyl's and Lidskii's inequalities turn out to be analogous to the known equality conditions for eigenvalues.</description>

      <title>Effective field theory of particle mixing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.17070v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce an effective field theory to study \emph{indirect} mixing of two fields induced by their couplings to a common decay channel in a medium. The extension of the method of Lee, Oehme and Yang, the cornerstone of analysis of CP violation in flavored mesons, to include mixing of particles with different masses provides a guide to and benchmark for the effective field theory. The analysis reveals subtle caveats in the description of mixing in terms of the widely used non-Hermitian effective Hamiltonian, more acute in the non-degenerate case. The effective field theory describes the dynamics of field mixing where the common intermediate states populate a bath in thermal equilibrium, as an \emph{open quantum system}. We obtain the effective action up to second order in the couplings, where indirect mixing is a consequence of off-diagonal self-energy components. We find that if only one of the mixing fields features an initial expectation value, indirect mixing induces an expectation value of the other field. The equal time two point correlation functions exhibit asymptotic approach to a stationary thermal state, and the emergence of long-lived \emph{bath induced} coherence which display quantum beats as a consequence of interference of quasinormal modes in the medium. The amplitudes of the quantum beats are resonantly enhanced in the nearly degenerate case with potential observational consequences.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.19229v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an efficient approach for preparing ground states in the context of strongly interacting local quantum field theories on quantum computers. The approach produces the vacuum state in a time proportional to the square-root of the volume, which is a square-root improvement in speed compared to traditional approaches. The approach exploits a novel method for traversing the path in parameter space in which the resources scale linearly with a path length suitably defined in parameter space. Errors due to practical limitations are controlled and do not exhibit secular growth along the path. The final accuracy can be arbitrarily improved with an additive cost, which is independent of the volume and grows slower than logarithmically with the overlap between the state produced and the exact ground state. We expect that the method could potentially hold practical value not only within the realm of quantum field theories but also in addressing other challenges involving long path lengths.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.15110v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that inelastic scattering leads to a collapse of the wave function within standard evolution through the Schroedinger equation, whereas elastic scattering will not collapse the wave function. Specifically, we find that the initial width of the emerging wave function in inelastic scattering is primarily determined by the size of the participating scattering center, but not by the width of the incoming wave function. This implies that dynamical collapse of the wave function through inelastic scattering, together with energy quantization in bound quantum systems, can explain the emergence of particle-like signals without the need to invoke the Born rule.</description>

      <title>Linear and Non-Linear Response of Quadratic Lindbladians</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06593v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quadratic Lindbladians encompass a rich class of dissipative electronic and bosonic quantum systems, which have been predicted to host new and exotic physics. In this study, we develop a Lindblad-Keldysh spectroscopic response formalism for open quantum systems that elucidates their steady-state response properties and dissipative phase transitions via finite-frequency linear and non-linear probes. As illustrative examples, we utilize this formalism to calculate the (1) density and dynamic spin susceptibilities of a boundary driven XY model at and near criticality, (2) linear and non-linear optical responses in Bernal bilayer graphene coupled to dissipative leads, and (3) steady state susceptibilities in a bosonic optical lattice. We find that the XY model spin density wavelength diverges with critical exponent 1/2, and there are gapless dispersive modes in the dynamic spin response that originate from the underlying spin density wave order; additionally the dispersing modes of the weak and ultra-strong dissipation limits exhibit a striking correspondence since the boundary dissipators couple only weakly to the bulk in both cases. In the optical response of the Bernal bilayer, we find that the diamagnetic response can decrease with increasing occupation, as opposed to in closed systems where the response increases monotonically with occupation; we study the effect of second harmonic generation and shift current and find that these responses, forbidden in centrosymmetric closed systems, can manifest in these open systems as a result of dissipation. We compare this formalism to its equilibrium counterpart and draw analogies between these non-interacting open systems and strongly interacting closed systems.</description>

      <title>A Classical Luttinger liquid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13283v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a binary nonadditive Asakura-Oosawa-like mixture as an example for the classical limit of a Luttinger liquid. We determine the equation of state and structure of this mixture and discuss the paradoxical situation that one faces when working with a quantum liquid without a ground state. We then propose a new class of one dimensional classical fluids.</description>

      <title>Non-stationary SQM/IST Correspondence and ${\cal CPT}/{\cal PT}$-invariant paired Hamiltonians on the line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.19066v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We fill some of existed gaps in the correspondence between Supersymmetric Quantum Mechanics and the Inverse Scattering Transform by extending the consideration to the case of paired stationary and non-stationary Hamiltonians. We formulate the corresponding to the case Goursat problem and explicitly construct the kernel of the non-local Inverse Scattering Transform, which solves it. As a result, we find the way of constructing non-hermitian Hamiltonians from the initially hermitian ones, that leads, in the case of real-valued spectra of both potentials, to pairing of ${\cal CPT/PT}$-invariant Hamiltonians. The relevance of our proposal to Quantum Optics and optical waveguides technology, as well as to non-linear dynamics and Black Hole Physics is briefly discussed.</description>
