      <title>A sufficient condition for generalized spectral characterization of graphs with loops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sufficient conditions for a simple graph to be characterized up to isomorphism given its spectrum and the spectrum of its complement graph are known due to Wang and Xu. This note establishes a related sufficient condition in the presence of loops: if the walk matrix has square-free determinant, then the graph is characterized by its generalized spectrum. The proof includes a general result about symmetric integral matrices.</description>

      <title>Words with Repeated Letters in a Grid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a word $w$, what is the maximum possible number of appearances of $w$ reading contiguously along any of the directions in $\{-1, 0, 1\}^d \setminus \{\mathbf{0}\}$ in a large $d$-dimensional grid (as in a word search)? Patchell and Spiro first posed a version of this question, which Alon and Kravitz completely answered for a large class of ``well-behaved" words, including those with no repeated letters. We study the general case, which exhibits greater variety and is often more complicated (even for $d=1$). We also discuss some connections to other problems in combinatorics, including the storied $n$-queens problem.</description>

      <title>Extending Andrews and Newman's refinement of the crank-mex theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The crank-mex theorem states that the number of integer partitions of $n$ with nonnegative crank equals the number with odd minimal excludant (mex). Andrews and M. Newman recently refined that result in terms of the number of parts greater than one. Here, we establish and expand a complementary result connecting the partitions with even mex, having fixed points, with negative crank, and with positive crank, all refined in terms of number of parts greater than one. We provide both analytic and combinatorial proofs.</description>

      <title>Average-Rare Order Ideals in Functional Preorders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that for the preorder induced by a function f: V -&gt; V, the family of all order ideals is average-rare, that is, its normalized degree sum (nds) is nonpositive. As a base case in our reduction, we establish the same result for functional partial orders (or rooted forests). We also propose a conjecture related to Frankl's Conjecture. All proofs have been formally verified in the proof assistant Lean 4.</description>

      <title>How to Use Deep Learning to Identify Sufficient Conditions: A Case Study on Stanley's $e$-Positivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a study, published in \emph{Nature}, researchers from DeepMind and mathematicians demonstrated a general framework using machine learning to make conjectures in pure mathematics. Their work uses neural networks and attribution techniques to guide human intuition towards making provable conjectures. Here, we build upon this framework to develop a method for identifying sufficient conditions that imply a given mathematical statement. Our approach trains neural networks with a custom loss function that prioritizes high precision. Then uses attribution techniques and exploratory data analysis to make conjectures. As a demonstration, we apply this process to Stanley's problem of $e$-positivity of graphs--a problem that has been at the center of algebraic combinatorics for the past three decades. Guided by AI, we rediscover that one sufficient condition for a graph to be $e$-positive is that it is co-triangle-free, and that the number of claws is the most important factor for $e$-positivity. Based on the most important factors in Saliency Map analysis of neural networks, we suggest that the classification of $e$-positive graphs is more related to continuous graph invariants rather than the discrete ones. Furthermore, using neural networks and exploratory data analysis, we show that the claw-free and claw-contractible-free graphs with $10$ and $11$ vertices are $e$-positive, resolving a conjecture by Dahlberg, Foley, and van Willigenburg.</description>

      <title>Non-dissective coverings by planks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A plank is the part of space between two parallel planes. The following open problem, posed 45 years ago, can be viwed as the converse of Tarski's plank problem (Bang's theorem): Is it true that if the total width of a collection of planks is sufficiently large, then the planks can be individually translated to cover a unit ball $B$?
  A translative covering of $B$ by planks is said to be non-dissective if the planks can be added one by one, in some order, such that the uncovered part remains connected at each step, and is empty at the end. Improving a classical result of Groemer, we show that every set of $C/\epsilon^{7/4}$ planks of width $\epsilon$ admits a non-dissective translative covering of $B$, provided $C$ is large enough. Our proof yields a low-complexity algorithm. We also establish the first nontrivial lower bound of $c/\epsilon^{4/3}$ for this quantity.</description>

      <title>On the weight distribution of linear sets with complementary weights and related constructions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we continue the study of linear sets with complementary weights. We find criteria to determine the set of points of any fixed weight and use this to present particular linear sets with few points of weight more than one. We also present a product-type construction for linear sets of complementary type arising from any linear set, allowing us to control the weight distribution of the obtained linear set. Finally, we use this construction to create linear sets with many different weights, along with point sets of even type with many distinct intersection numbers.</description>

      <title>Designs on the Tautological bundle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the framework of a generalized design, which represents any linear operator as a finite sum of local linear maps attached to finitely many points, thereby abstracting the core of design theory without employing integration. We then construct such a design on the space of sections of the tautological bundle over the complex projective line. By using the irreducible decomposition of this space as an SU(2)-representation, we show that the projection onto its lowest-dimensional summand can be realized as a finite sum of these local maps. Our construction relies on invariant theory for the binary icosahedral group and an analysis of fixed-point subspaces in symmetric tensor representations.</description>

      <title>Saturation numbers of $K_{2}\vee P_{k}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A graph $G$ is called $H$-saturated if $G$ contains no copy of $H$, but $G+e$ contains a copy of $H$ for any edge $e\in E(\overline{G})$. The saturation number of $H$ is the minimum number of edges in an $H$-saturated graph of order $n$, denoted by $sat(n,H)$. In this paper, we investigate $sat(n,K_{2}\vee P_{k})$, where $k\geq 3$. Let $a_k$ be an integer, defined as follows: $a_k=k$ for $3\leq k\leq 5$; $a_k=3\cdot 2^{t-1}-2$ for $k=2t\geq 6$; and $a_k=2^{t+1}-2$ for $k=2t+1\geq 7$. We show that $sat(n, K_{2}\vee P_{k})=2n-3+sat(n-2,P_{k})$ for $n\geq a_k+2$ and $k\geq 3$, characterize the $K_{2}\vee P_{k}$-saturated graphs with $sat(n,K_{2}\vee P_{k})$ edges, the $K_{1}\vee P_{k}$-saturated graphs with $sat(n,K_{1}\vee P_{k})$ edges for $3\leq k\leq5$ and the $P_{k}$-saturated graphs with $sat(n, P_{k})$ edges for $3\leq k\leq4$. Furthermore, we propose some questions for further research.</description>

      <title>Acyclic dichromatic number of oriented graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dichromatic number $\vec{\chi}(D)$ of a digraph $D=(V,A)$ is the minimum number of sets in a partition $V_1,\ldots{},V_k$ of $V$ into $k$ subsets so that the induced subdigraph $D[V_i]$ is acyclic for each $i\in [k]$. This is a generalization of the chromatic number for undirected graphs as a graph has chromatic number at most $k$ if and only if the complete biorientation of $G$ (replace each edge by a directed 2-cycle) has dichromatic number at most $k$. In this paper we introduce the acyclic dichromatic number $\vec{\chi}_{\rm a}(D)$ of a digraph $D$ as the minimum number of sets in a partition $V_1,\ldots{},V_k$ of $V$ so that the induced subdigraph $D[V_i]$ is acyclic for each $i\in [k]$ and each of the bipartite induced subdigraphs $D[V_i,V_j]$ is acyclic for each $1\leq i&lt;j\leq k$. This parameter, which resembles the definition of acyclic chromatic number for undirected graphs, has apparently not been studied before.
  We derive a number of results which display the difference between the dichromatic number and the acyclic dichromatic number, in particular, there are digraphs $D$ with arbitrarily large $\vec{\chi}_{\rm a}(D)-\vec{\chi}(D)$, even among tournaments with dichromatic number 2 and bipartite tournaments (where the dichromatic number is always 2). We prove several complexity results, including that deciding whether $\vec{\chi}_{\rm a}(D)\leq 2$ is NP-complete already for bipartite digraphs, while it is polynomial for tournaments (contrary to the case for dichromatic number). We also generalize the concept of heroes of a tournament to acyclic heroes of tournaments.</description>

      <title>Off-Diagonal Continuous Rado Numbers $x_1 + x_2 + \dots + x_k = x_0$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2001, Robertson and Schaal found the 2-color off-diagonal generalized Schur numbers: for two positive integers $k$ and $l$, they determined the smallest positive integer $S = S(k, l)$ such that for any coloring of the integers from 1 to $S$ using red and blue, there must be a red solution to the equation $x_1 + x_2 + \dots + x_k = x_0$ or a blue solution to the equation $x_1 + x_2 + \dots + x_l = x_0$. We extend this result to find the continuous version: for two positive integers $k$ and $l$, we find the smallest real number $S = S_\mathbb{R} (k, l)$ such that for any coloring of the real numbers from 1 to $S$ using red and blue, there must be a red solution to the equation $x_1 + x_2 + \dots + x_k = x_0$ or a blue solution to the equation $x_1 + x_2 + \dots + x_l = x_0$.</description>

Abstract: We study the relationship between three combinatorial objects -- a taffy pulling machine, the Calkin-Wilf tree of all fractions, and Conway's rational tangles. After introducing these objects, we develop a taffy analogue for Conway's characterization of rational tangles, and we give a direct geometric connection between rational tangles and taffy pulls.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.19918v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We determine whether each known generating set of arbitrary oriented Reidemeister moves is minimal. We then provide a complete classification of minimal generating sets that include a coherent Reidemeister move of type II. We also classify all minimal generating sets that include a braid-type Reidemeister move of type III. Beyond these two cases, we identify 16 possible candidates for minimal generating sets. Among them, we prove that 12 are indeed minimal, whereas the minimality and even the generating property of the remaining 4 sets remains unsolved (Remark 5.1).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.20007v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a spoke-arc decomposition of non-crossing annular pair partitions $NC_2(p,q)$ that records spoke type and orientation, isolates spoke-level contributions, and factorizes the dependence on the ellipticity parameter $\gamma$ into a spoke factor and arc weights. This yields closed-form descriptions of the limiting covariance of Gaussian elliptic matrices. As a corollary, we show that an independent family of Gaussian elliptic random matrices is asymptotically second-order free.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.20138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A wiring diagram is a labeled directed graph that represents an abstract concept such as a temporal process. In this article, we introduce the notion of a quasi-skeleton wiring diagram graph, and prove that quasi-skeleton wiring diagram graphs correspond to Hasse diagrams. Using this result, we designed algorithms that extract wiring diagrams from sequential data. We used our algorithms in analyzing the behavior of an autonomous agent playing a computer game, and the algorithms correctly identified the winning strategies. We compared the performance of our main algorithm with two other algorithms based on standard clustering techniques (DBSCAN and agglomerative hierarchical), including when some of the data was perturbed. Overall, this article brings together techniques in category theory, graph theory, clustering, reinforcement learning, and data engineering.</description>

      <title>ChemicHull: an online tool for determining extremal chemical graphs of maximum degree at most 3 for any degree-based topological indices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20249v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological indices are graph-theoretic descriptors that play a crucial role in mathematical chemistry, capturing the structural characteristics of molecules and enabling the prediction of their physicochemical properties. A widely studied category of topological indices, known as degree-based topological indices, are calculated as the sum of the weights of a graph's edges, where each edge weight is determined by a formula that depends solely on the degrees of its endpoints.
  This work focuses exclusively on chemical graphs in which no vertex has a degree greater than 3, a model for conjugated systems. Within a polyhedral framework, each chemical graph is mapped to a point in a three-dimensional space, enabling extremal values of any degree-based topological index to be determined through linear optimization over the corresponding polyhedron. Analysis within this framework reveals that extremality is limited to a small subset of chemical graph families, implying that certain chemical graphs can never attain extremality for any degree-based topological index.
  The main objective of this paper is to present ChemicHull, an online tool we have developed to determine and display extremal chemical graphs for arbitrary degree-based topological indices. To illustrate the power of this tool, we easily recover established results, emphasizing its effectiveness for chemically significant graph classes such as chemical trees and unicyclic chemical graphs. This tool also enabled the identification of a counterexample to a previously published extremal result concerning the Randi\'c index.</description>

      <title>3-colorable planar graphs have an intersection segment representation using 3 slopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20368v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In his PhD Thesis, E.R. Scheinerman conjectured that planar graphs are intersection graphs of line segments in the plane. This conjecture was proved with two different approaches by J. Chalopin and the author, and by the author, L. Isenmann, and C. Pennarun. In the case of 3-colorable planar graphs E.R. Scheinerman conjectured that it is possible to restrict the set of slopes used by the segments to only 3 slopes. Here we prove this conjecture by using an approach introduced by S. Felsner to deal with contact representations of planar graphs with homothetic triangles.</description>

      <title>Dimension-counting bounds for equi-isoclinic subspaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20642v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We make four contributions to the theory of optimal subspace packings and equi-isoclinic subspaces: (1) a new lower bound for block coherence, (2) an exact count of equi-isoclinic subspaces of even dimension $r$ in $\mathbb{R}^{2r+1}$ with parameter $\alpha \neq \tfrac{1}{2}$, (3) a new upper bound for the number of $r$-dimensional equi-isoclinic subspaces in $\mathbb{R}^d$ or $\mathbb{C}^d$, and (4) a proof that when $d=2r$, a further refinement of this bound is attained for every $r$ in the complex case and every $r=2^k$ in the real case. For each of these contributions, the proof ultimately relies on a dimension count.</description>

      <title>Sharp Hypercontractivity for Global Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.01356v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a function $f$ on the hypercube $\{0,1\}^n$ with Fourier expansion $f=\sum_{S\subseteq[n]}\hat f(S)\chi_S$, the hypercontractive inequality allows bounding norms of $T_\rho f=\sum_S\rho^{|S|} \hat f(S)\chi_S$ in terms of norms of $f$. If $f$ is Boolean-valued, the level-$d$ inequality allows bounding the norm of $f^{=d}=\sum_{|S|=d}\hat f(S)\chi_S$ in terms of $E[f]$. These inequalities play a central role in analysis of Boolean functions and its applications. While both inequalities hold in a sharp form when the hypercube is endowed with the uniform measure, they do not hold for more general discrete product spaces, and finding a `natural' generalization was a long-standing open problem. In 2024, Keevash et al.~obtained a hypercontractive inequality for general discrete product spaces, that holds for functions which are `global' -- namely, are not significantly affected by a restriction of a small set of coordinates. This hypercontractive inequality is not sharp, which precludes applications to $S_n$ and to other settings where sharpness of the bound is crucial. Also, no sharp level-$d$ inequality for global functions over general discrete product spaces is known. We obtain sharp versions of the hypercontractive inequality and of the level-$d$ inequality for this setting. Our inequalities open the way for diverse applications to extremal set theory, group theory, theoretical computer science, and number theory. We demonstrate this by proving quantitative bounds on the size of intersecting families of sets and vectors under weak symmetry conditions and by describing numerous applications that were obtained using our results -- to the study of functions over $S_n$, including hypercontractivity and level-$d$ inequalities, character bounds, variants of Roth's theorem and of Bogolyubov's lemma and diameter bounds, and an application to the Furstenberg-S{\'{a}}rk{\"{o}}zy problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.14039v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study multiport networks, common in electrical engineering. They have boundary conditions different from electrical networks: the boundary vertices are split into pairs and the sum of the incoming currents is set to be zero in each pair. If one sets the voltage difference for each pair, then the incoming currents are uniquely determined. We generalize Kirchhoff's matrix-tree theorem to this setup. Different forests now contribute with different signs, making the proof subtle. In particular, we use the formula for the response matrix minors by R. Kenyon-D. Wilson, determinantal identities, and combinatorial bijections. We introduce superport networks, generalizing both ordinary networks and multiport ones.</description>

Abstract: For each of the four particle processes given by Dieker and Warren [arXiv:0707.1843], we show the $n$-step transition kernels are given by the (dual) (weak) refined symmetric Grothendieck functions up to a simple overall factor. We do so by encoding the particle dynamics as the basis of free fermions first introduced by the first author, which we translate into deformed Schur operators acting on partitions. We provide a direct combinatorial proof of this relationship in each case, where the defining tableaux naturally describe the particle motions.</description>

      <title>Degeneration in discriminantal arrangements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18835v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Discriminantal arrangements are hyperplane arrangements, which are generalized braid ones. They are constructed from given hyperplane arrangements, but their combinatorics are not invariant under combinatorial equivalence. However, it is known that the combinatorics of the discriminantal arrangement are constant on a Zariski open set of the space of hyperplane arrangements. In the present paper, we introduce non-very generic varieties in the space of hyperplane arrangements to classify discriminantal arrangements and show that the Zariski open set is the complement of non-very generic varieties. We study their basic properties and construction and provide examples, including infinite families of non-very generic varieties. In particular, the construction we call degeneration is a powerful tool for constructing non-very generic varieties. As an application, we provide lists of non-very generic varieties for spaces of small line arrangements.</description>

Abstract: A covering number of a family is the size of the smallest set that intersects all sets from the family. In 1978 Frankl determined for $n\ge n_0(k)$ the largest intersecting family of $k$-element subsets of $[n]$ with covering number $3$. In this paper, we essentially settle this problem, showing that the same family is extremal for any $k\ge 100$ and $n&gt;2k$.</description>

      <title>Inversion Diameter and Treewidth</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15384v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In an oriented graph $\overrightarrow{G}$, the inversion of a subset $X$ of vertices consists in reversing the orientation of all arcs with both end-vertices in $X$. The inversion graph of a graph $G$, denoted by $\mathcal{I}(G)$, is the graph whose vertices are orientations of $G$ in which two orientations $\overrightarrow{G_1}$ and $\overrightarrow{G_2}$ are adjacent if and only if there is an inversion $X$ transforming $\overrightarrow{G_1}$ into $\overrightarrow{G_2}$. The inversion diameter of a graph $G$ is the diameter of its inversion graph $\mathcal{I}(G)$ denoted by $diam(\mathcal{I}(G))$. Havet, H\"orsch, and Rambaud~(2024) first proved that for $G$ of treewidth $k$, $diam(\mathcal{I}(G)) \le 2k$, and there are graphs of treewidth $k$ with inversion diameter $k+2$. In this paper, we construct graphs of treewidth $k$ with inversion diameter $2k$, which implies that the previous upper bound $diam(\mathcal{I}(G)) \le 2k$ is tight. Moreover, for graphs with maximum degree $\Delta$, Havet, H\"orsch, and Rambaud~(2024) proved $diam(\mathcal{I}(G)) \le 2\Delta-1$ and conjectured that $diam(\mathcal{I}(G)) \le \Delta$. We prove the conjecture when $\Delta=3$ with the help of computer calculations.</description>

      <title>Large Induced Subgraphs of Bounded Degree in Outerplanar and Planar Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14784v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the following question. Let $\mathcal G$ be a family of planar graphs and let $k\geq 3$ be an integer. What is the largest value $f_k(n)$ such that every $n$-vertex graph in $\mathcal G$ has an induced subgraph with degree at most $k$ and with $f_k(n)$ vertices? Similar questions, in which one seeks a large induced forest, or a large induced linear forest, or a large induced $d$-degenerate graph, rather than a large induced graph of bounded degree, have been studied for decades and have given rise to some of the most fascinating and elusive conjectures in Graph Theory. We tackle our problem when $\mathcal G$ is the class of the outerplanar graphs or the class of the planar graphs. In both cases, we provide upper and lower bounds on the value of $f_k(n)$. For example, we prove that every $n$-vertex planar graph has an induced subgraph with degree at most $3$ and with $\frac{5n}{13}&gt;0.384n$ vertices, and that there exist $n$-vertex planar graphs whose largest induced subgraph with degree at most $3$ has $\frac{4n}{7}+O(1)&lt;0.572n+O(1)$ vertices.</description>

      <title>Domination Parameters of Graph Covers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14341v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A graph $G$ is a \emph{cover} of a graph $F$ if there exists an onto mapping $\pi : V(G) \to V(F)$, called a (\emph{covering}) \emph{projection}, such that $\pi$ maps the neighbours of any vertex $v$ in $G$ bijectively onto the neighbours of $\pi(v)$ in $F$. This paper is the first attempt to study the connection between domination parameters and graph covers. We focus on the domination number, the total domination number, and the connected domination number. We prove upper and lower bounds for the domination parameters of $G$. Moreover, we propose a conjecture on the lower bound for the domination number of $G$ and provide evidence to support the conjecture.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the notion of strong geometry, a structure composed by both the chirotope of a set of points X in the d-dimensional space and the wedge chirotope which is the specific adjoint chirotope induced by the hyperplanes spanned by X. We present various properties relating these two chirotopes, for instance, by introducing the witness chirotope, we are able to give a formula expressing the wedge chirotope in terms of the usual chirotope. With this on hand, we answer positively a strong geometry version of a question due to M. Las Vergnas about reconstructing polygonal knots via chirotopes. Moreover, we also show that linear spatial graphs are determined by their corresponding strong geometries.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we explore some interesting applications of the matrix tree theorem. In particular, we present a combinatorial interpretation of a distribution of $(n-1)^{n-1}$, in the context of uprooted spanning trees of the complete graph $K_{n}$, which was previously obtained by Chauve--Dulucq--Guibert. Additionally, we establish a combinatorial explanation for the distribution of $m^{n-1}n^{m-1}$, related to spanning trees of the complete bipartite graph $K_{m,n}$, which seems new. Furthermore, we extend this study to the graph $K_{n}\setminus \{e_{1,n}\}$, obtained by deleting an edge from $K_n$, and derive a new identity for the number of its uprooted spanning trees.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.23995v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A partial affine plane of order $n$ is a point-line incidence structure with $n^2$ points and $n$ points on each line, such that every two lines meet in at most one point. In this paper, we show that a partial affine plane of order $n$, $n$ sufficiently large, in which parallelism is an equivalence relation, containing more than $n^2-\sqrt{n}$ lines, can be completed to an affine plane, thus improving the $40$-year old bound of [S. Dow. A completion problem for finite affine planes. Combinatorica, 6:321--325, 1986.] Furthermore, we derive a higher-dimensional result about the completion of $2$-$(n^d,n,1)$-designs, as well as for partial inversive spaces. In particular, we show that a partial $3$-$(n^2+1,n+1,1)$-design for which in every derived structure, parallelism is an equivalence relation, and there are at least $n^2+n-\sqrt{n}$ lines, can be completed to an inversive plane.</description>

      <title>Roman $\{2\}$-domination on Graphs with "few" 4-paths</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.17369v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a graph $G$ with vertex set $V$, $f : V \rightarrow \{0, 1, 2\}$ is a \emph{Roman $\{2\}$-dominating function} (or \emph{italian dominating function}) of $G$ if for every vertex $v\in V$ with $f(v) =0$, either there exists a vertex $u$ adjacent to $v$ with $f(u) = 2$, or two distinct vertices $x,\; y$ both adjacent to $v$ with $f(x)=f(y)=1$. The decision problem associated with Roman $\{2\}$-domination is NP-complete even for bipartite graphs (Chellali et al., 2016).
  In this work we initiate the study of Roman $\{2\}$-domination on graph classes with a limited number of 4-paths. We base our study on a modular decomposition analysis. In particular, we study Roman $\{2\}$-domination under some operations in graphs such as join, union, complementation, addition of pendant vertices and addition of twin vertices. We then obtain the Roman $\{2\}$-domination number of spiders, well-labelled spiders and certain prime split graphs that are crucial in the modular decomposition of partner-limited graphs. In all, we provide linear-time algorithms to compute the Roman $\{2\}$-domination number of cographs, $P_4$-sparse graphs, $P_4$-tidy graphs and partner-limited graphs. Finally, we derive the NP-completeness of Roman $\{2\}$-domination on $P_4$-laden graphs.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we investigate the decoding of the rank metric Reed--Muller codes introduced by Augot, Couvreur, Lavauzelle and Neri in 2021. These codes are defined from Abelian Galois extensions extending the construction of Gabidulin codes over arbitrary cyclic Galois extensions. We propose a polynomial time algorithm that rests on the structure of Dickson matrices, works on any such code and corrects any error of rank up to half the minimum distance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16620v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by a conjecture of Erd\H{o}s on the additive irreducibility of small perturbations of the set of squares, recently Hajdu and S\'{a}rk\"{o}zy studied a multiplicative analogue of the conjecture for shifted $k$-th powers. They conjectured that for each $k\geq 2$, if one changes $o(X^{1/k})$ elements of $M_k'=\{x^k+1: x \in \mathbb{N}\}$ up to $X$, then the resulting set cannot be written as a product set $AB$ nontrivially. In this paper, we confirm a more general version of their conjecture for $k\geq 3$.</description>

      <title>Smallest Suffixient Sets: Effectiveness, Resilience, and Calculation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05638v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A suffixient set is a novel combinatorial object that captures the essential information of repetitive strings in a way that, provided with a random access mechanism, supports various forms of pattern matching. In this paper, we study the size $\chi$ of the smallest suffixient set as a repetitiveness measure: we place it between known measures and study its sensitivity to various string operations. As a corollary of our results, we give simple online algorithms to compute smallest suffixient sets.</description>

      <title>Sheffer Polynomials and the s-ordering of Exponential Boson Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13094v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The s-ordered form of any product of single-mode boson creation and annihilation operators, containing only a single annihilator, is computed explicitly. The s-ordering concept originated in quantum optics, but subsumes normal, symmetric (Weyl), and anti-normal ordering for any two operators satisfying a canonical commutation relation. Because the s-ordering map can be viewed as producing a function of a complex variable, its inverse is a quantization map that takes such "classical" functions to quantum operators. The explicit s-ordered expressions are derived with the aid of a parametric family of Sheffer polynomial sequences (or equivalently a parametric exponential Riordan array of polynomial coefficients), called the Hsu-Shiue family. To yield orderings interpolating between normal and anti-normal, this family must be extended.</description>

      <title>Explicit Universal Bounds for Cumulants via Moments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05739v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish explicit, universal, and distribution-free bounds for the $n$-th cumulant, $\kappa_n(X)$, of a scalar random variable, controlled solely by an $n$-th order absolute moment functional $M_n(X)$. The bounds take the form $\lvert\kappa_n(X)\rvert \le C_n M_n(X)$. Our principal contribution is the derivation of coefficients satisfying $C_n \sim (n-1)!/\rho^{\,n}$, which offers an exponential improvement over classical bounds where the coefficients grow superexponentially (on the order of $n^n$).
  We present a hierarchy of refinements where the rate parameter $\rho$ increases as the functional $M_n(X)$ incorporates more structural information. The most general bound uses the raw moment $M_n(X)=\mathsf{E}[\lvert X\rvert^n]$ with rate $\rho=\ln 2 \approx 0.693$. Using the central moment $M_n(X)=\mathsf{E}[\lvert X-\mathsf{E}[X]\rvert^n]$ improves the rate to $\rho_{\mathrm{cen}} \approx 1.146$, while assuming symmetry yields even higher rates.
  The proof is elementary, combining the moment-cumulant partition formula with a uniform moment-product inequality. We further prove that while these bounds are strict (not attainable by non-degenerate distributions), they are asymptotically efficient given the limited information of a single moment. The utility of the bounds is demonstrated through applications to analyticity of CGFs and concentration inequalities.</description>

      <title>Additivity of Crossing Number via Restricted Reidemeister Moves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18016v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define a set of restricted Reidemeister moves and show that if $K$ is obtained from $K_0\,\#\,K_1$ using those moves, then the crossing number of $K$ is at least $c(K_0)+c(K_1)$. We also explore topological interpretations of this result.</description>
