      <title>Layered CrGe1-xSe3+y with Cr Kagome Lattice and Antiferromagnetic Ordering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the synthesis and properties of a new layered material, CrGe1-xSe3+y. The crystal structure was determined by using single crystal x-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy. CrGe1-xSe3+y crystallizes with a space group R-3m, featuring a double Kagome layer of chromium atoms, sandwiched between disordered Ge-Se layers. This compound displays antiferromagnetic order below 50 K, unlike the ferromagnetic behavior in CrGeTe3. Chromium displays an effective moment of ~3.9 {\mu}B/Cr, consistent with Cr3+ oxidation. The presence of this phase limits the possibility of a ferromagnetic CrGeSe3 analogous to CrGeTe3.</description>

      <title>The effect of normal stress on stacking fault energy in face-centered cubic metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plastic deformation and fracture of FCC metals involve the formation of stable or unstable stacking faults (SFs) on (111) plane. Examples include dislocation cross-slip and dislocation nucleation at interfaces and near crack tips. The stress component normal to (111) plane can strongly affect the SF energy when the stress magnitude reaches several to tens of GPa. We conduct a series of DFT calculations of SF energies in six FCC metals: Al, Ni, Cu, Ag, Au, and Pt. The results show that normal compression significantly increases the stable and unstable SF energies in all six metals, while normal tension decreases them. The SF formation is accompanied by inelastic expansion in the normal direction. The DFT calculations are compared with predictions of several representative classical and machine-learning interatomic potentials. Many potentials fail to capture the correct stress effect on the SF energy, often predicting trends opposite to the DFT calculations. Possible ways to improve the ability of potentials to represent the stress effect on SF energy are discussed.</description>

      <title>Coupled Spin-lattice Dynamics across a Magnetostructural Phase Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: First-order magnetostructural phase transitions underpin giant magnetocaloric effects, yet the microscopic role of lattice dynamics in these transitions remains controversial. Here we use first-principles spin-lattice dynamics simulations to investigate the coupled evolution of magnetization and phonon dispersions across the magnetostructural transition in MnAs. Our simulations quantitatively reproduce the experimentally observed Curie temperature, lattice contraction, and free-energy crossing between hexagonal and orthorhombic phases. We show that below the Curie temperature, magnetic-field-induced hardening of soft phonon modes gives rise to a sizable lattice entropy contribution that enhances the total isothermal entropy change by approximately 23% under a 5 T field. In contrast, the lattice entropy change associated with the structural phase transition itself has an opposite sign and partially compensates the lattice contribution due to field-induced phonon hardening. This competition reconciles long-standing discrepancies in the interpretation of magnetocaloric entropy measurements across first-order transitions. In addition, we demonstrate that the strong magnetic-field dependence of the phonon spectrum near the transition enables large tunability of lattice thermal conductivity, highlighting MnAs as a promising platform for magnetic-field-controlled thermal switching. Our results establish a unified microscopic picture of spin-lattice coupling in first-order magnetocaloric materials and provide design principles for engineering enhanced caloric and thermal transport functionalities.</description>

      <title>Intertwined atomic-nanoscale-microscale structures via intralayer anisotropic Fe-chains in the layered ferromagnet FePd2Te2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controlling mesoscale and nanoscale material structures and properties through self-organized atomic behavior is essential for atomic-scale manufacturing. However, direct and visual studies on the cross-scale effects of such atomic self-organization on mesoscopic structures remain scarce. Here, we report the intertwined atomic-nanoscale-mesoscale structures via the intralayer Fe-chains in the sandwich-like layered FePd2Te2 crystal by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The hierarchical orthogonal corrugated morphologies are directly revealed and attributed to its chain-orientation-determined twinning-domain effect. Both Fe-chains of middle-sublayer and two kinds of Te atoms of top-sublayer are further atomically resolved at the sub-{\AA} level, indicating the critical effects of Pd-atoms/voids on the intra-layer anisotropic Fe-chains and the interlayer structural alignment. The thermal-induced and strain-related structural transitions of surface layer are further investigated and discussed based on the proposed filling model of Pd-voids by the intralayer Pd-atoms. Our work not only provides deep understanding of this exotic layered magnetic material, and will inspire more perspectives for tailoring its anisotropic atomic-to-mesoscale structures and properties.</description>

      <title>Anomalously High Phonon Thermal Conductivity Driven by Weak Electron-Phonon Coupling in Weyl Semimetals TaAs and TaP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In conventional metals, thermal transport is governed by electrons, with phonon contributions often considered negligible. Here, through rigorous first-principles calculations, we uncover a phonon-dominated thermal transport regime in the Weyl semimetals TaAs and TaP. Remarkably, although TaP is metallic, its phonon thermal conductivity ($\kappa_{\text{ph}}$) reaches as high as 171 Wm$^{-1}$K$^{-1}$ at room temperature, surpassing its electronic counterpart by more than a factor of five. This anomalously high $\kappa_{\text{ph}}$ is enabled by the unique electronic and phononic band structures, characterized by the Weyl nodes near the Fermi level, together with acoustic phonon bunching and a wide frequency gap in the phonon spectrum, which collectively suppress phonon-electron and phonon-phonon scattering processes. Due to the substantial phonon contribution, the derived Lorenz number deviates strongly from the conventional Wiedemann-Franz law. We further show that the significance of phonon thermal transport is universal across topological semimetals. Our work provides deeper insight into thermal transport mechanisms in topological semimetals and extends the scope for discovering materials with high thermal conductivity.</description>

      <title>Autonomous Probe Microscopy with Robust Bag-of-Features Multi-Objective Bayesian Optimization: Pareto-Front Mapping of Nanoscale Structure-Property Trade-Offs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Combinatorial materials libraries are an efficient route to generate large families of candidate compositions, but their impact is often limited by the speed and depth of characterization and by the difficulty of extracting actionable structure-property relations from complex characterization data. Here we develop an autonomous scanning probe microscopy (SPM) framework that integrates automated atomic force and magnetic force microscopy (AFM/MFM) to rapidly explore magnetic and structural properties across combinatorial spread libraries. To enable automated exploration of systems without a clear optimization target, we introduce a combination of a static physics-informed bag-of-features (BoF) representation of measured surface morphology and magnetic structure with multi-objective Bayesian optimization (MOBO) to discover the relative significance and robustness of features. The resulting closed-loop workflow selectively samples the compositional gradient and reconstructs feature landscapes consistent with dense grid "ground truth" measurements. The resulting Pareto structure reveals where multiple nanoscale objectives are simultaneously optimized, where trade-offs between roughness, coherence, and magnetic contrast are unavoidable, and how families of compositions cluster into distinct functional regimes, thereby turning multi-feature imaging data into interpretable maps of competing structure-property trends. While demonstrated for Au-Co-Ni and AFM/MFM, the approach is general and can be extended to other combinatorial systems, imaging modalities, and feature sets, illustrating how feature-based MOBO and autonomous SPM can transform microscopy images from static data products into active feedback for real-time, multi-objective materials discovery.</description>

      <title>Cross-hatch strain effects on SiGe quantum dots for qubit variability estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: SiGe heterostructures integrated with Si via virtual substrate (VS) growth are promising hosts for spin qubits. While VS growth targets plastic relaxation, residual cross-hatch strain inhomogeneity propagates into heterostructure overgrowth. To quantify strain inhomogeneity's influence on interface structure and qubit properties, we measure strained-silicon (s-Si)/Si$_{0.7}$Ge$_{0.3}$ heterostructures on 25 wafers processed via standard commercial chemical vapor deposition. Spatially-aligned images of strain (Raman microscopy) and interface structure (atomic force microscopy and cross-sectional scanning transmission electron microscopy) reveal strain-roughness interplay. A strain-driven surface diffusion model predicts the roughness and its temperature dependence. Measured strains suggest spurious double-dot qubit detunings of 0.1 meV over 100 nm distances may result. Modeling shows that interface roughness (atomic steps), when convolved with alloy disorder, only modestly reduces valley splitting (70$\pm$13 vs. 77$\pm$14 $\mu$eV on average). Our findings point to thicker VS buffer layers beneath heterostructures and lower-temperature growth (T $\le$ 700 $^{\circ}$C) to limit roughening.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-Driven Unconventional Magnetoelectric Coupling in Perovskite Altermagnets: From Bulk to the Two-Dimensional Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of altermagnets establishes a new paradigm for multiferroics. Unlike conventional multiferroics relying on direct magnetoelectric coupling, multiferroic altermagnets host a crystal-symmetry-mediated magnetoelectric interaction that is intrinsically more efficient and robust. Among candidate material platforms, layered perovskites are particularly appealing owing to their structural diversity and synthetic versatility. However, magnetoelectric properties at the two-dimensional scale remain largely unexplored, hindering their applicability in miniaturized, highly integrated devices. Here, we systematically investigate the dimensional evolution of ferroelectric polarization and magnetism in perovskite systems through symmetry analysis. We demonstrate that altermagnetism can persist in the two-dimensional limit, yet is strongly constrained by the magnetic configuration-with only C-type antiferromagnetic order supporting it. Based on mode-decomposition calculations, we further reveal that symmetry-restricted multimode couplings simultaneously govern ferroelectric polarization and altermagnetic spin splitting. Finally, combined with first-principles calculations, we propose several strategies to lift the magnetic-configuration constraint, extending the range of viable altermagnetic systems. These results underscore the critical role of dimensionality in symmetry-driven magnetoelectric coupling in perovskite altermagnets and pave the way toward next-generation electrically controlled spintronic and multiferroic devices.</description>

      <title>Precipitate size evolution in an ultrafine-grained magnesium-manganese alloy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precipitate size evolution during room temperature high-pressure torsion (HPT) of a Mg-1.35wt.%Mn alloy was studied using scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and Small-/Wide-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS/WAXS). The volume fraction of the nm-scale $\alpha$-Mn particles increased with applied strain, however small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) indicated that the majority of manganese remained in solution even after 10 HPT rotations, indicating that the reaction progress is still limited by the diffusivity of Mn. Analysis of the precipitate size distribution determined that the mean particle size did not increase over the course of HPT. This, in combination with the precipitate size distribution suggested that precipitate growth was subject to interfacial rather than diffusional control.</description>

      <title>NiTi Single Crystal Growth by Micro-Pulling-Down Method: Experimental Setup and Material Characterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nickel-titanium that has an austenite to martensite phase transition has been studied extensively in the past as a shape memory alloy, but a lot remains to be learned from such phase transitions. However, single crystals are needed for a detailed characterization of the emerging phase transition. In order to produce NiTi single crystals for research purposes, we have set up a micro-pulling-down ($\mu$PD) apparatus. The $\mu$PD process is a fast and flexible method for the fabrication of small single crystals. The apparatus is operated in vacuum. By pulling the crystal down through a hole in the crucible bottom, it is possible to reduce oxygen contamination, since oxides float on top of the melt due to their low density. Here we present a detailed characterization of as-grown NiTi crystals by electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), hot gas extraction method and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The characteristics of the phase transition in NiTi are very sensitive to dopants and alloying. The $\mu$PD method facilitates the introduction of different doping elements into the crystal.</description>

      <title>Exact Theory of Fermi-Energy Response at Metallic Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The response of the Fermi energy to external perturbations governs key physical observables at metallic interfaces. Although this response admits a local formulation in terms of the Fukui function, its evaluation has traditionally been limited by inherent approximations, fundamentally rooted in the difficulty of adding a finite charge in a periodic system. We present an exact resolution to this problem that leverages the screening properties of electronic conductors to compute Fukui functions via a finite electric field. The resulting linear-response theory yields strictly quadratic error scaling of Fermi-level shifts across representative platinum surfaces, achieving sub-meV accuracy up to fields of 0.1 V/\AA. The approach is further validated by reproducing work-function changes under molecular perturbations, and by providing mean-field estimates of electrode potentials that yield capacitance--voltage curves consistent with experiment. Our findings establish a rigorous foundation for a local theory relating electrostatic screening and Fermi-energy variations at metallic interfaces.</description>

      <title>First-principles analysis of in-plane anomalous Hall effect using symmetry-adapted Wannier Hamiltonians and multipole decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The in-plane anomalous Hall effect occurs when magnetization lies within the same plane as the electric field and Hall current, and requires magnetic point groups lacking rotational or mirror symmetries. While it is observed in both Weyl semimetals and elemental ferromagnets, the microscopic role of higher-order multipoles remains unclear. Here, we develop a microscopic framework that combines time-reversal-symmetric Wannier functions with a symmetry-adapted multipole basis to decompose the first-principles Wannier Hamiltonian into electric, magnetic, magnetic toroidal, and electric toroidal multipoles. This approach allows us to rotate the magnetization rank by rank and quantify how each multipole affects the conductivity. Applying this framework to body-centered cubic iron, we find that high-rank magnetic and magnetic toroidal multipoles contribute with magnitudes comparable to magnetic dipoles, while magnetic toroidal 16-poles act with the opposite sign. Furthermore, based on this multipole analysis, we apply uniaxial strain along the [103] direction to control the dominant multipoles contributing to the conductivity. The strain substantially modifies its angular dependence, demonstrating that multipole-resolved Hamiltonian engineering and magnetoelastic control serve as practical routes to predict and tune the in-plane anomalous Hall conductivity in simple ferromagnets.</description>

      <title>Mechanical control of magnetic exchange and response in GdRu$_2$Si$_2$: A computational study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a systematic computational study of the effect of uniaxial strain on the magnetic properties of GdRu$_2$Si$_2$, a centrosymmetric material known to host a field-induced skyrmion lattice (SkL). Using first-principles density functional theory, we first demonstrate the pronounced sensitivity of the exchange and anisotropy to specific structural distortions. These DFT-derived interactions are then integrated into a classical spin model to construct comprehensive magnetic phase diagrams under both compressive and tensile strain. Our key finding is that compressive strain ($\sim 2\%$) acts as an effective tuning parameter, substantially expanding the stability region of the $\vec Q_{100}$-driven topologically nontrivial phases. This results from the shifts in the critical magnetic fields and enhancement of the energy scale of the favored magnetic wave vector. In contrast, tensile strain induces a different magnetic ground-state by promoting a different magnetic ordering vector, $\vec Q_{110}$, leading to entirely distinct phase behavior. This work not only provides a quantitative understanding of the structural-magnetic coupling in GdRu$_2$Si$_2$ but also establishes strain engineering as a powerful approach to control and optimize topologically non-trivial magnetic phases in centrosymmetric magnets.</description>

      <title>Unraveling the effects of anionic vacancies and temperature on mechanical properties of NbC and NbN: Insights from Quantum Mechanical Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transition metal carbides and nitrides (TMCNs), such as niobium carbide (NbC) and niobium nitride (NbN), are of great technological interest due to their exceptional hardness, high melting points, and thermal stability. While previous studies have focused on their groundstate properties (at 0 K), limited information exists on their mechanical behavior under realistic operational conditions involving elevated temperatures and the presence of defects. In this study, we employ ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations to investigate the effects of temperature (300 to 1500 K) and anionic vacancies on the mechanical properties of NbC and NbN in rocksalt (RS), zincblende (ZB), and wurtzite (WZ) structures. The results reveal a nonlinear decrease in elastic constants, bulk, shear, and Youngs moduli with both increasing temperature and defect concentration. Hardness and toughness analyses, based on Pughs ratio and Poisson ratio, show ductility and brittleness transitions that are sensitive to structure, defect level, and thermal effects. Furthermore, vacancy migration energies computed using the nudged elastic band (NEB) method demonstrate strong structural dependence, with RS exhibiting the highest barriers and WZ the lowest. These findings provide new insights into the defect and temperature interplay in NbC and NbN, offering guidelines for their optimization in high-temperature and wear-resistant applications.</description>

      <title>Observation of magnon torques mediated by orbital hybridization at the light metal/antiferromagnetic insulator interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnon torques, which can operate without involving moving electrons, could circumvent the Joule heating issue. In conventional magnon torque systems, the spin source layer with strong spin-orbit coupling is utilized to inject magnons, and the efficiency is limited by the inherent spin Hall conductivity of the spin source layer. In this work, we observe magnon torques in the Cr/NiO/ferromagnet heterostructure with the effective spin Hall conductivity of 2.45x10^5 hbar/(2e{\Omega}m), twice that of the best conventional magnon torque system. We demonstrate the magnon-torque-driven switching of a perpendicularly magnetized CoFeB layer at room temperature, with a switching power consumption density of 0.136 mW/{\mu}m^2. We find that the magnon torque originates from the orbital hybridization and interfacial inversion symmetry breaking at the Cr/NiO interface. Our findings not only significantly enhance the efficiency of magnon torques, but also provide key insights into the fundamental mechanisms of magnon injections.</description>

      <title>Spin dynamics of excitons and carriers in mixed-cation MA$_{x}$FA$_{1-x}$PbI$_{3}$ perovskite crystals: alloy fluctuations probed by optical orientation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical spin orientation measured by time-resolved photoluminescence provides a powerful tool to probe the spin dynamics of excitons and charge carriers in perovskite semiconductors. The impact of alloy fluctuations on the spin dynamics of mixed-cation \MAFAPI{} perovskite single crystals is studied here experimentally. The optical orientation is measured under nonresonant excitation for crystals with $x = 0.1$, $0.4$, and $0.8$ at cryogenic temperatures and compared with data on \MAPI{} crystals. The high degree of exciton optical orientation of $75-80$\% for $x = 0.1$ and $0.8$ reduces to about 60\% for $x = 0.4$. A similar trend is observed for the carrier spin optical orientation. This behavior is attributed to enhanced scattering of free excitons and carriers in the alloys with increased compositional and structural disorder. From the Larmor spin precession measured from spin dynamics in an external magnetic field applied in the Voigt geometry, the electron and hole $g$-factors are evaluated. Their dependence on the band gap energy in \MAFAPI{} crystals follows the universal trend previously established for lead halide perovskites.</description>

      <title>Bio-resorbable magnetic tunnel junctions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.05733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) play a crucial role in spintronic applications, particularly data storage and sensors. Especially as a non-volatile memory, MTJs have received substantial attention due to its CMOS compatibility, low power consumption, fast switching speed, and high endurance. In parallel, bio-resorbable electronics have emerged as a promising solution for systems requiring temporary operation and secure data disposal, especially in military, intelligence, and biomedical systems where devices must safely disintegrate under physiological conditions. In this study, we investigate the bio-resorbability of MTJ by analyzing the dissolution behavior of its nanometer-thick constituent layers in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution at pH 7.4, simulating physiological environments. The MTJ structures, composed of bio-resorbable materials, exhibit well-controlled degradation behaviors. Critically, as one of the ferromagnetic layers dissolves, binary information is irreversibly lost, within 10 hours of immersion. These findings highlight the potential of MTJs not only as high-performance memory elements but also as secure, transient data storage platforms. The ability to modify the dissolution lifetime by materials and thickness selection offers unique advantages for short-lived implantable devices, paving the way for integrating spintronic functionality into next-generation bioresorbable electronics.</description>

      <title>Structural and magnetic properties of co-sputtered epitaxial Fe-Sn kagome thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years the intermetallic alloys of Fe and Sn have gained significant interest due to a rich variety of magnetic properties present in these materials. The crystal Fe3Sn2 is a frustrated ferromagnet, while the crystallographically similar FeSn, which differs only by the stacking sequence of its Fe-containining kagome and stanene layers, is an antiferromagnet. Thin-film growth techniques such as magnetron sputtering allow for these different stoichiometric compositions to be grown through adjustments of the rate of deposition of the individual Fe and Sn sources, while all other conditions remain constant. Here, we report the production of high quality epitaxial thin films of Fe$_3$Sn$_2$ and FeSn on sapphire with a Pt seed layer, as well as a mixed phase containing intergrowths of both crystals, all of which we have characterized using both X-ray and four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) methods. The resulting crystallographic phase content is compared to the results of magnetization measurements, with correspondence between the predicted ferromagnetic phase content and the resulting magnetization. Further magnetic properties of these films can then also be compared, leading to the discovery of a unique behavior in the temperature dependent coercivity within highly mixed phase alloys, a feature that is absent in either pure Fe3Sn2 and FeSn.</description>

      <title>Crystalline-dependent magnon torques in all-sputtered Hf/Cr2O3/ferromagnet heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electron motion in spin-orbit torque devices inevitably leads to the Joule heating issue. Magnon torques can potentially circumvent this issue, as it enables the transport of spin angular momentum in insulating magnetic materials. In this work, we fabricate a sandwich structure composed of Hf/antiferromagnetic Cr2O3/ferromagnet and demonstrate that the magnon torque is strongly dependent on the crystalline structure of Cr2O3. Magnon torques are stronger when the Neel vector of Cr2O3 aligns parallel to the spin polarization generated in Hf, while they are suppressed when the Neel vector is perpendicular to the spin polarization. The magnon torque efficiency is estimated to be -0.134 using in-plane second harmonic Hall measurements. Using magnon torques, we achieve perpendicular magnetization switching of CoFeB, with a critical switching current density of 4.09 x 10^7 A/cm^2. Furthermore, the spin angular momentum loss due to the insertion of Cr2O3 is found to be lower than that of polycrystalline NiO. Our work highlights the role of antiferromagnet crystalline structures in controlling magnon torques, broadening the potential applications of magnon torques.</description>

      <title>Heterogeneous ice nucleation on model substrates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.05758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ice nucleation is greatly important in areas as diverse as climate change, cryobiology, geology or food industry. Predicting the ability of a substrate to induce the nucleation of ice from supercooled water is a difficult problem. Here, we use molecular simulations to analyse how the ice nucleating ability is affected by the substrate lattice structure and orientation. We focus on different model lattices: simple cubic, body centred cubic and face centred cubic, and assess their ability to induce ice nucleation by calculating nucleation rates. Several orientations are studied for the case of the face centred cubic lattice. Curiously, a hexagonal symmetry does not guarantee a better ice nucleating ability. By comparing the body centred cubic and the cubic lattices we determined that there is a significant role of the underlying crystal plane(s) on ice nucleation. The structure of the liquid layer adjacent to the substrate reveals that more efficient nucleants induce a more structured liquid. The most efficient substrates present a strong sensitivity of their ice nucleating ability to the lattice parameters. Introducing a novel methodological approach, we use Classical Nucleation Theory to estimate the contact angle of the ice nucleus on the studied substrates from the calculated nucleation rates. The method also provides the nucleation free energy barrier height, the kinetic pre-factor and the critical cluster size. The latter is in agreement with the nucleus size obtained through a microscopic analysis of the nucleation trajectories, which supports the validity of Classical Nucleation Theory down to small critical clusters.</description>

      <title>Noncollinear spin structure in Dy-doped classical ferrimagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Noncollinear spin structures have attracted tremendous attention because they offer a versatile platform for spin control and manipulation, essential in spintronics. Realizing noncollinearity in ferrimagnetic insulators is of particular interest as they can be potentially utilized in low-damping spintronics with tunable magnetic order. Within the spinel-ferrite family, Zn and Al-substituted nickel ferrite (NiZAF) has emerged as an excellent choice for low-damping spintronics. However, realizing noncollinearity in such systems remains challenging. Here, we present evidence of noncollinear spin structure in the NiZAF thin films induced by the rare earth Dy-doping, utilizing the soft x-ray spectroscopy methods such as magnetic circular dichroism and x-ray resonant magnetic reflectivity (XRMR). In particular, XRMR reveals a spiral-type spin structure, which is attributed to the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, arising due to broken inversion symmetry by the Dy-induced local strain field as confirmed by our theoretical calculations. The realization of noncollinearity in the spinel-ferrite opens pathway to explore the possibility of chiral magnetic domains and topological spin textures exhibiting promise for oxide-based spintronics</description>

      <title>On the Feasibility of Extreme Heating Rates in SEM using MEMS Heater Platforms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.05831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding microstructural evolution under extreme thermal conditions is essential for advancing metal additive manufacturing (AM). This work demonstrates the feasibility of employing micro-electro-mechanical system (MEMS) heating platforms for in-situ scanning electron microscopy (SEM) characterization of bulk-like samples during rapid thermal cycling. Using electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD), we tracked the ferrite-to-austenite phase transformation in a pure iron specimen and confirmed that the sample surface temperature closely follows the MEMS temperature setpoint within device accuracy. Under vacuum conditions, stable heating and cooling rates of up to 1000 C/s were achieved with minimal power input and without compromising EBSD pattern quality. These findings establish MEMS-based heating as a robust approach for in-situ microstructural characterization of AM-relevant thermal processes in the SEM, enabling quantitative studies of thermally activated phenomena such as diffusion, phase transformations, and microstructural evolution under far-from-equilibrium conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.05917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hydrogen embrittlement in metals is strongly governed by hydrogen diffusion and trapping, yet predicting these effects in polycrystalline systems remains challenging. This work introduces a multiscale modeling framework that links atomistic energetics to continuum-scale transport. Migration barriers for bulk and grain-boundary environments, obtained from first-principles calculations, are used in kinetic Monte Carlo simulations to compute anisotropic effective diffusivities. These diffusivities are then incorporated into finite element models of polycrystalline microstructures, explicitly accounting for grain-boundary character and connectivity. The approach captures both fast-path and trapping effects without relying on empirical parameters and reproduces experimental trends for nickel, including the dependence of effective diffusivity on grain size and boundary type. This methodology provides a physically grounded route for predicting hydrogen transport in engineering alloys and can be extended to other materials and defect types.</description>

Abstract: Active learning (AL) plays a critical role in materials science, enabling applications such as the construction of machine-learning interatomic potentials for atomistic simulations and the operation of self-driving laboratories. Despite its widespread use, the reliability and effectiveness of AL workflows depend on implicit design assumptions that are rarely examined systematically. Here, we critically assess AL workflows deployed in materials science and investigate how key design choices, such as surrogate models, sampling strategies, uncertainty quantification and evaluation metrics, relate to their performance. By identifying common pitfalls and discussing practical mitigation strategies, we provide guidance to practitioners for the efficient design, assessment, and interpretation of AL workflows in materials science.</description>

      <title>Thermally Configurable Multi-Order Polar Skyrmions in Multiferroic Oxide Superlattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polar topological textures in low-dimensional ferroelectrics have emerged as a versatile platform for high-density information storage and neuromorphic computing. While low-order topological states, such as vortices and skyrmions, have been extensively studied, high-order polar topological families remain largely unexplored due to their higher energy requirements and limited stabilization methods. Here, using a BiFeO3 (BFO)-based multiferroic superlattice as a model system, we demonstrate a thermal-modulation strategy that stabilizes multi-order polar skyrmions and enables reversible tuning of their topological order through phase-field simulations. It was found that temperature modulation drives the system from polar solitons through 1{\pi}-, 2{\pi}-, 3{\pi}-, and 4{\pi}-skyrmion states, with closed heating-cooling path analyses revealing the widest thermal stability window for 2{\pi}-skyrmions (up to 600 K). Leveraging this robustness, 2% Sm doping in BFO lowers the transition temperatures, enabling room-temperature stabilization of 2{\pi}-skyrmions. These findings enrich the fundamental understanding of multi-order polar topologies and establish a tunable strategy for realizing variable-order topological configurations in practical memory devices.</description>

      <title>Autonomous Sampling and SHAP Interpretation of Deposition-Rates in Bipolar HiPIMS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-power impulse magnetron sputtering (HiPIMS) offers considerable control over ion energy and flux, making it invaluable for tailoring the microstructure and properties of advanced functional coatings. However, compared to conventional sputtering techniques, HiPIMS suffers from reduced deposition rates. Many groups have begun to evaluate complex pulsing schemes to improve upon this, leveraging multi-pulse schemes (e.g. pre-ionization or bipolar pulses). Unfortunately, the increased complexity of these pulsing schemes has led to high-dimensionality parameter spaces that are prohibitive to classic design of experi-ments. In this work we evaluate bipolar HiPIMS pulses for improving deposition rates of Al and Ti sputter tar-gets. Over 3000 process conditions were collected via autonomous Bayesian sampling over a 6-dimensional parameter space. These process conditions were then interpreted using Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP), to deconvolute complex process influences on deposition rates. This allows us to link observed var-iations in deposition rate to physical mechanisms such as back-attraction and plasma ignition. Insights gained from this approach were then used to target specific processes where the positive pulse components were expected to have the highest impact on deposition rates. However, in practice, only minimal improve-ments in deposition rate were achieved. In most cases, the positive pulse appears to be detrimental when placed immediately after the neg. pulse which we hypothesize relates to quenching of the afterglow plasma. The proposed workflow combining autonomous experimentation and interpretable machine learning is broad-ly applicable to the discovery and optimization of complex plasma processes, paving the way for physics-informed, data-driven advancements in coating technologies.</description>

      <title>Oxygen distribution and segregation at grain boundaries in Nb and Ta-encapsulated Nb thin films for superconducting qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05326v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on atomic-scale analyses of oxygen distribution and segregation at grain boundaries (GBs) of Nb and Ta-encapsulated Nb (Ta/Nb) thin films for superconducting qubits using atom-probe tomography (APT) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). We observe oxygen segregation at grain boundaries (GBs) relative to the oxygen concentration within the grains for both Nb and Ta-capped Nb thin films for superconducting qubits and find that higher oxygen concentration in the interior of Nb grains lead to greater oxygen segregation levels at GBs. This finding emphasizes that controlling oxygen impurities in Nb during film deposition and fabrication processing is important to reduce the level of oxygen segregation at GBs in Nb. The enrichment factor (Cgb/Cgrain) for oxygen segregation at GBs in Nb is 2.7 (error bar: 0.3) for Nb films, and Ta-capped Nb thin films exhibit slightly reduced Nb GB enrichment factors of 2.3 (error bar: 0.3) while GBs in the Ta capping layer itself possess higher enrichment factors of 3.0 (error bar: 0.3). We hypothesize that the Ta capping layer can trap oxygen and thereby affect oxygen in-diffusion and segregation at GBs in the underlying Nb thin films. Finally, we find that increases in the oxygen concentration in both Nb grains and GBs correlate with a suppression in the critical temperature for superconductivity (Tc). Together, our comparative chemical and charge transport property analyses provide atomic-scale insights into a potential mechanism contributing to decoherence in superconducting qubits.</description>

Abstract: Modeling acoustic wave fields in microstructured elastic solids is discussed in the context of the Riemann-Cartan geometry. We consider a scenario where microstructural deformations occur much faster than those of the bulk material. This time-scale separation creates apparent geometric incompatibilities at the macroscopic level, even without any permanent inelastic deformation (at micro or macro-scale) or damage. We formalize this phenomenon using the concept of a non-holonomic tetrads to represent the macroscopic elastic deformations and the associated torsion field to characterize the resulting geometric incompatibilities. The spatial components of the torsion tensor quantify the instantaneous geometric incompatibility of the macroscopic elastic deformations, while its time components capture the inertial effects arising from the reversible energy exchange between the micro and macro scales. A key finding is that the model's dispersion relation predicts the existence of a complete frequency band gap. Furthermore, the governing equations exhibit a notable mathematical analogy to Maxwell's equations which can link the modeling of phononic and photonic metamaterials.</description>

      <title>A finite viscoelastic constitutive model for low to high strain rate response of elastomers with application of strain rate-induced glass transition</title>

Abstract: Amorphous elastomers exhibit significant rate-stiffening and unique viscous flow characteristics across a wide range of strain rates, often undergoing glass transition above a strain rate threshold. We have developed a thermodynamically-consistent and micromechanically-inspired constitutive model for soft elastomeric materials to capture the rate-dependent stress-strain behavior and hysteresis when subjected to low to high strain rates. Our proposed constitutive model encapsulates the viscous flow of materials through molecular motion at low strain rates and local rearrangement and alignment at high strain rates, essentially covering the glass transition. We applied our constitutive model to uniaxial compression experiments performed at low and high strain rates for polyborosiloxane (PBS) to identify the material parameters, and subsequently, performed numerical simulations of single and multi-cycle compression, stress relaxation, and small amplitude oscillatory tension-compression. Our analyses indicate that the model predicts higher total energy dissipation with increasing strain rate; however, dissipation associated with molecular relaxation decreases (forming a cusp) because, beyond a crossover strain rate, molecular rearrangement and alignment become dominant, which is consistent with the onset of the glass transition. For cyclic loading-unloading, we observed that dissipation over a cycle remains constant at low strain rate but decreases non-monotonically at high strain rates before becoming constant with peak stress over the cycle becoming higher, which can be interpreted as more loading being carried elastically by the polymer network as the molecular rearrangement process occurs. Additionally, our model was able to predict the qualitative nature of the storage modulus and loss modulus in the limit of small strain over a wide range of frequency sweeps.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-engineered and electrically tunable in-plane anomalous Hall effect in oxide heterostructures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.05462v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The family of Hall effects has long served as a premier probe of how symmetry, magnetic order, and topology intertwine in solids. Recently, the in-plane anomalous Hall effect (IP-AHE), a transverse Hall response driven by in-plane magnetization, has emerged as a distinct member of this family, offering innovative spintronic functionalities and illuminating intricate interplay between mirror-symmetry breaking and in-plane magnetic order. However, practical routes to deterministically and reversibly control IP-AHE remain limited. Here, we establish a symmetry-engineered IP-AHE platform, CaRuO3/La2/3Ca1/3MnO3/CaRuO3 heterostructure on NdGaO3(110), that turns strict mirror-symmetry breaking constraints into effective tuning knobs. IP-AHE in these epitaxial trilayers unambiguously couples to the CaRuO3-buffer-induced mirror-symmetry breaking and faithfully reproduces the ferromagnetic hysteresis. Ionic liquid gating further enables reversible reconfigurations of the symmetry breaking, thereby achieving electrical modulation and ON/OFF switching of IP-AHE. This highly tunable IP-AHE platform opens pathways for exploring nontrivial magnetic order and developing programmable Hall functionalities in planar geometries.</description>

      <title>Observation of Unconventional Ferroelectricity in Non-Moir'\e Graphene on Hexagonal Boron Nitride Boundaries and Interfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.05621v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interfacial interactions in two parallel-stacked hexagonal boron-nitride (hBN) layers facilitate sliding ferroelectricity, enabling novel device functionalities. Additionally, when Bernal or twisted bilayer graphene is aligned with an hBN layer, unconventional ferroelectric behavior was observed, though its precise origin remains unclear. Here, we propose an alternative approach to engineering such an unconventional ferroelectricity in graphene-hBN van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures by creating specific types of hBN boundaries and interfaces. We found that the unconventional ferroelectricity can occur--without the alignments at graphene-hBN or hBN-hBN interfaces--when there are hBN edges or interfaces with line defects. By systematically analyzing the gate dependence of mobile and localized charges, we identified key characteristics of localized states that underlie the observed unconventional ferroelectricity, informing future studies. These findings highlight the complexity of the interfacial interactions in graphene/hBN systems, and demonstrate the potential for defect engineering in vdW heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Quantized heat flow in the Hofstadter butterfly</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.05694v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When subjected to a strong magnetic field, electrons on a two-dimensional lattice acquire a fractal energy spectrum called Hofstadter's butterfly. In addition to its unique recursive structure, the Hofstadter butterfly is intimately linked to non-trivial topological orders, hosting a cascade of ground states characterized by non-zero topological invariants. These states, called Chern insulators, are usually understood as replicas of the ground states of the quantum Hall effect, with electrical and thermal conductances that should be quantized, reflecting their topological order. The Hofstadter butterfly is now commonly observed in van-der-Waals heterostructures-based moir\'e superlattices. However, its thermal properties, particularly the quantized heat flow expected in the Chern insulators, have not been investigated, potentially questioning their similarity with standard quantum Hall states. Here we probe the heat transport properties of the Hofstadter butterfly, obtained in a graphene~/~hexagonal boron nitride moir\'e superlattice. We observe a quantized heat flow, uniquely set by the topological invariant, for all investigated states of the Hofstadter butterfly: quantum Hall states, Chern insulators, and even symmetry-broken Chern insulators emerging from strong electronic interactions. Our work firmly establishes the universality of the quantization of heat transport and its intimate link with topology.</description>

Abstract: Electrospun poly(\epsilon-caprolactone) (PCL)nanofibrous mats are widely considered for blood-contacting wound dressings and small-diameter vascular applications; however, their intrinsic hydrophobicity limits rapid wetting and controlled interaction with blood. In this work, we modulate the interfacial response of PCL nanofibers by incorporating oxide-shelled silicon nanoparticles (SiNPs) synthesized by pulsed laser ablation in liquid, a ligand-free approach that avoids organic stabilizers and preserves surface reactivity. Two composite architectures were designed: SiNPs embedded within the fiber bulk (PAC1,4,16) and SiNPs preferentially exposed at the fiber surface (SPAC1,4,16), with systematically increasing nanoparticle loadings. Structural characterization confirmed the retention of a homogeneous fibrous morphology and the targeted nanoparticle distribution. The dynamic interaction with whole blood was quantified using time-resolved contact-angle measurements, complemented by top-view optical microscopy and three-dimensional profilometry of dried droplets. Pristine PCL remained strongly hydrophobic whereas a hydrophilic PCL functionalized with APTES showed rapid spreading. Incorporation of SiNPs within the fiber volume led to only a moderate enhancement of wettability, and dried droplets retained compact morphologies with limited spreading. In contrast, surface-decorated mats displayed a sharp, concentration-dependent transition toward highly wettable behavior: for SPAC16, the contact angle fell below 20, droplet profiles became markedly flattened, and microscopy revealed extended plasma-rich regions surrounding a red-cell-rich core, indicative of pronounced phase separation within the nanofibrous network.</description>

      <title>Cooperative concurrence of 4f and 3d flat bands in kagome heavy-fermion metal YbCr6Ge6</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.05829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flat-band (FB) systems originating from special lattice geometry like in kagome metals as well as localized orbitals in the materials such as heavy-fermion (HF) compounds have induced intensive interest due to their band topology and strong electron correlation effects, leading to emergent quantum states of matter. However, the question of how these two distinct FBs coexist and interact remains unsettled. Here, we report that YbCr6Ge6 hosting both Cr-kagome lattice and Yb-4f electrons exhibits HF behaviors and a robust antiferromagnetic ground state with transition temperature TN = 3 K, significantly higher than other similar kagome metals with Yb ions. Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements reveal the coexistence of FBs originating from both Cr-kagome lattice and localized Yb-4f electrons near Fermi energy level EF. More importantly, the clear spectroscopic signatures of a hybridization of Yb-4f FB with kagome-lattice-derived conduction bands and the high density of states of Cr-kagome FB near EF provide the underlying microscopic mechanisms of HF behaviors and enhanced antiferromagnetism in YbCr6Ge6. Our findings demonstrate that the novel kagome HF metals can not only host the cooperative coexistence of two different types of FBs, but also provide a paradigm material platform to explore the exotic correlated topological quantum phenomena.</description>

Abstract: Electron beam energies in Transmission Electron Microscopes (TEMs) reach the relativistic realm constituting Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) the appropriate framework for the study of electron matter interaction in TEMs. We focus on the inelastic scattering of relativistic electrons from a generic oriented target. The inelastic differential cross section factorizes to the fast electron part which is calculated analytically, and the dynamic form factor of the target, which encodes the response of the medium to the interaction with the beam. The properties of the dynamic form factor of oriented targets are analyzed. We then derive the scattering cross section of electrons by magnetic targets where spin-flip transitions are induced. We comment on the kinematic regimes where the coefficient of the transverse magnetic interaction is amplified compared to the coulomb matrix element.</description>

      <title>Evolution of the Berry curvature dipole in uniaxially strained bilayer graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.05962v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While in pristine bilayer graphene the Berry curvature dipole (BCD), a necessary ingredient for the nonlinear anomalous Hall effect, is zero, uniaxial strain can give rise to finite BCD. We investigate this by using a tight-binding (TB) approach build on the Slater-Koster parameterization to capture lattice deformation effects often missed by continuum models. We demonstrate that the BCD's evolution with strain and doping is highly sensitive to the choice in parameterization, particularly when including the longer range interlayer skew hoppings. Additionally, out-of-plane compression enhances the response by broadening the Dirac cones. These findings benchmark low-energy continuum models and highlight the necessity of realistic tight-binding models for accurately predicting strain-engineered Hall effects in bilayer graphene.</description>

Abstract: In recent years, there has been increasing interest in the understanding and application of nanoparticle assemblies driven by external fields. Although these systems can exhibit marked transitions in behavior compared to non-interacting counterparts, it has often proven challenging to connect their dynamics with underlying physical mechanisms or even to verifiably establish their structure under realistic experimental conditions. We have studied colloidal iron oxide nanoparticles that assemble into ordered, few-particle linear chains under the influence of oscillating and pulsed magnetic fields. In this work, our goal has been to answer the following question: by what physical mechanisms does the magnetic switching of a linear chain evolve from the switching of its constituent particles? Cryo-TEM has been used to flash freeze and image the structures formed by oscillatory drive fields, and magnetic relaxometry has been used to extract the multiple time constants associated with magnetic switching of the short chains. Armed with the physical structure from microscopy and the field-dependent switching times from magnetic measurements, we have conducted extensive micromagnetic simulations, revealing probable physical mechanisms for each time constant regime spanning ~1 microsecond to 1 s in time. These types of magnetic nanomaterials have great potential for biomedical technologies, particularly magnetic particle imaging and hyperthermia, and rigorous elucidation of their physics will hasten their optimization.</description>

      <title>VacHopPy: A Python package for vacancy hopping analysis based on molecular dynamics simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23467v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multiscale modeling, which integrates material properties from ab initio calculations into continuum-scale simulations, is a promising strategy for optimizing semiconductor devices. However, a key challenge remains: while ab initio methods provide diffusion parameters specific to individual migration paths, continuum equations require a single effective set of parameters that captures the overall diffusion behavior. To address this issue, we present VacHopPy, an open-source Python package for vacancy hopping analysis based on molecular dynamics (MD). VacHopPy extracts an effective set of hopping parameters, including hopping distance, hopping barrier, number of effective paths, correlation factor, and attempt frequency, by statistically integrating energetic, kinetic, and geometric contributions across all paths. It also includes tools for tracking vacancy trajectories and for detecting phase transitions during MD simulations. The applicability of VacHopPy is demonstrated in three representative materials: face-centered cubic Al, rutile TiO2, and monoclinic HfO2. The extracted effective parameters reproduce temperature-dependent diffusion behavior and are in good agreement with previous experimental data. Provided in a simplified form, these parameters are well suited for continuum-scale models and remain valid over a wide temperature range spanning several hundred kelvins. Furthermore, VacHopPy inherently accounts for anisotropy in thermal vibrations, a factor often overlooked, making it suitable for simulating diffusion in complex crystals. Overall, VacHopPy establishes a robust bridge between atomic- and continuum-scale models, enabling more reliable multiscale simulation</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.23064v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The morphology of block copolymers (BCPs) critically influences material properties and applications. This work introduces a machine learning (ML)-enabled, high-throughput framework for analyzing grazing incidence small-angle X-ray scattering (GISAXS) data and atomic force microscopy (AFM) images to characterize BCP thin film morphology. A convolutional neural network was trained to classify AFM images by morphology type, achieving 97% testing accuracy. Classified images were then analyzed to extract 2D grain size measurements from the samples in a high-throughput manner. ML models were developed to predict morphological features based on processing parameters such as solvent ratio, additive type, and additive ratio. GISAXS-based properties were predicted with strong performances ($R^2$ &gt; 0.75), while AFM-based property predictions were less accurate ($R^2$ &lt; 0.60), likely due to the localized nature of AFM measurements compared to the bulk information captured by GISAXS. Beyond model performance, interpretability was addressed using Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). SHAP analysis revealed that the additive ratio had the largest impact on morphological predictions, where additive provides the BCP chains with increased volume to rearrange into thermodynamically favorable morphologies. This interpretability helps validate model predictions and offers insight into parameter importance. Altogether, the presented framework combining high-throughput characterization and interpretable ML offers an approach to exploring and optimizing BCP thin film morphology across a broad processing landscape.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21089v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Band structure unfolding is a key technique for analyzing and simplifying the electronic band structure of large, internally distorted supercells that break the primitive cell's translational symmetry. In this work, we present an efficient band unfolding method for atomic orbital (AO) basis sets that explicitly accounts for both the non-orthogonality of atomic orbitals and their atom-centered nature. Unlike existing approaches that typically rely on a plane-wave representation of the (semi-)valence states, we here derive analytical expressions that recasts the primitive cell translational operator and the associated Bloch-functions in the supercell AO basis. In turn, this enables the accurate and efficient unfolding of conduction, valence, and core states in all-electron codes, as demonstrated by our implementation in the all-electron ab initio simulation package FHI-aims, which employs numeric atom-centered orbitals. We explicitly demonstrate the capability of running large-scale unfolding calculations for systems with thousands of atoms and showcase the importance of this technique for computing temperature-dependent spectral functions in strongly anharmonic materials using CuI as example.</description>

Abstract: Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) chalcogenides are stable, non-toxic candidates for optoelectronic or thermoelectric applications. The structural diversity of RP oxides is already exploited to tune properties or achieve more advanced functionalities like multiferroicity, however, little is known about the structural evolution of RP chalcogenides. In this work, we develop a high-accuracy machine-learned interatomic potential to run large-scale molecular dynamics simulations on $Ba_{n+1}Zr_nS_{3n+1}$ for $n=1$ to $n=6$. We predict new polymorphs for each $n$-value, calculate their corresponding phase transition temperatures, and validate our approach through comparison to published experimental results. We find that the $n=1$ phase exhibits negative thermal expansion, that $n=1$ and $n=3$ undergo unusual ascending symmetry breaking, and that phases with $n\geq4$ form layer-dependent tilt patterns previously unreported for inorganic RP materials. This unique behaviour results from competition between octahedral rotations and rumpling at the rocksalt interface, and suggests new strategies for accessing advanced functionalities.</description>

      <title>Mode-resolved logarithmic quasiballistic heat transport in thin silicon layers: Semianalytic and Boltzmann transport analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05522v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nonequilibrium phonon transport driven by nanoscale hotspot heating in silicon device layers governs heat dissipation in advanced microelectronics and underscores the need for a better microscopic understanding of such processes. Yet the origin of the frequently observed logarithmic (ln) dependence of the apparent thermal response on hotspot size in crystalline silicon, and the role of individual phonon modes in this regime, remain unclear. Here, we develop a semianalytical, mode-resolved framework in the spectral phonon mean free path (MFP) domain and validate it against a full-phonon-dispersion Boltzmann transport model for heat removal from a 10 x 10 nm^2 hotspot in a thin Si layer (thicknesses of 41, 78, and 177 nm) representative of a silicon-on-insulator transistor. We show that ln-type quasiballistic scaling arises only for modes that lie on a log-uniform conductivity plateau and are diffusive-side or quasiballistic with respect to the hotspot size, whereas fully ballistic long-MFP modes contribute a saturated, nonlogarithmic background, leading to extremely slow suppression of their heat-carrying capability. The resulting phonon-modal nonlocal spectrum establishes spectral selection rules for ln-regime transport in confined Si and provides a compact basis for incorporating mode-selective quasiballistic corrections into continuum thermal models and for interpreting phonon-resolved thermometry experiments.</description>

      <title>Competing phases and domain structures of ferroelectric perovskites: the benefit of epitaxial (110) growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02118v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Strain and domain engineering offer powerful routes to control phase and domain stability in ferroelectric thin films. While most studies have focused on (100)-oriented growth, the impact of lower-symmetry orientations remains underexplored. We address this gap in knowledge with first-principles based molecular dynamics simulation for the example of prototypical ferroelectric perovskites under (110) strain. Epitaxial (110) strains may indeed outperform the widely studied (100) orientation, as even modest strain values stabilize a diverse set of metastable nanoscale states with potential high functional tunability. In this regime, the films exhibit multidomain configurations with domain wall normal oriented along the clamped in-plane or the relaxed out-of-plane directions and heterophases in BaTiO$_3$ and KNbO$_3$. Besides, complex superdomain patterns and antiferroelectric-like domains are observed in PbTiO$_3$. These metastable nanoscale configurations may allow for large reversible responses.</description>

      <title>Multiscale Experimental Evidence of a Transitory State in the HDA-LDA Transition in Alumino-sodo-silicate Glasses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.03021v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The structural evolution with temperature of pure silica (SiO2), sodium-silicate (5Na2O-95SiO2, 10Na2O-90SiO2 and 25Na2O-75SiO2) and albite (15Na2O-15Al2O3-75SiO2) glasses previously densified from hot compression is monitored with a combination of small and wide angle x-ray scattering. Transient scattering maxima in the length scales associated with both techniques indicate the presence of a transitory state, suggesting the classification of the initial and final states as distinct glass states in the context of polyamorphism. In all glasses, a transient intensity peak in the small angle scattering is observed, consistent with the nucleation of a new amorphous state. Based on a comparison with the phenomenology observed in supercooled and glassy water, we propose that this structural evolution provide a strong evidence of the glass polyamorphism as the consequence of the existence of an underlying but thermodynamically defined liquid-liquid transition, independent on the polymerization degree of the system.</description>

      <title>Many-body and QED effects in electron-atom inelastic scattering in EELS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12254v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The elemental composition and electronic-structure of materials analyzed by Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy (EELS) are probed by the inner-shell ionization of atoms. We calculate the inelastic differential cross-section perturbatively within the framework of quantum electrodynamics (QED). The interaction between the incoming electron and the atom factorizes into a high-energy electron term and the atomic transition current. The matrix elements of the transition current are computed within the relaxed Dirac-Hartree-Fock method. We analyze the correlation effects arising from the relaxation of the atomic orbitals induced by the creation of a core hole. These effects are particularly relevant in quantum many-body systems and have a significant impact on the shape of the differential cross-section near the ionization threshold in EELS spectra. This is a localized process that can be approximated by the scattering of an electron beam from a free atom. In addition to the continuum, we calculate the discrete excitation spectrum of $\mathrm{DyScO_3}$ using crystal field multiplet theory. The calculated spectrum shows very good agreement with experimental EELS data.</description>

      <title>Machine learning for in-situ composition mapping in a self-driving magnetron sputtering system</title>

Abstract: Self-driving labs (SDLs), employing automation and machine learning (ML) to accelerate experimental procedures, have enormous potential in the discovery of new materials. However, in thin film science, SDLs are mainly restricted to solution-based synthetic methods which are easier to automate but cannot access the broad chemical space of inorganic materials. This work presents an SDL based on magnetron co-sputtering. We are using combinatorial frameworks, obtaining accurate composition maps on multi-element, compositionally graded thin films. This normally requires time-consuming ex-situ analysis prone to systematic errors. We present a rapid and calibration-free in-situ, ML driven approach to produce composition maps for arbitrary source combinations and sputtering conditions. We develop a method to predict the composition distribution in a multi-element combinatorial thin film, using in-situ measurements from quartz-crystal microbalance sensors placed in a sputter chamber. For a given source, the sensor readings are learned as a function of the sputtering pressure and magnetron power, through active learning using Gaussian processes (GPs). The final GPs are combined with a geometric model of the deposition flux distribution in the chamber, which allows interpolation of the deposition rates from each source, at any position across the sample. We investigate several acquisition functions for the ML procedure. A fully Bayesian GP - BALM (Bayesian active learning MacKay) - achieved the best performance, learning the deposition rates for a single source in 10 experiments. Prediction accuracy for co-sputtering composition distributions was verified experimentally. Our framework dramatically increases throughput by avoiding the need for extensive characterisation or calibration, thus demonstrating the potential of ML-guided SDLs to accelerate materials exploration.</description>

      <title>Thickness-dependent magnon spin transport in antiferromagnetic insulators: Crossover from quasi-three-dimensional to quasi-two-dimensional regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03941v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent observation of giant room-temperature magnon spin conductivity in an ultrathin ferromagnetic insulator [X.-Y. Wei et al., Nat. Mater. 21, 1352 (2022)], we investigate thickness-dependent magnon spin transport in thin antiferromagnetic insulators (AFIs). We study the prototypical AFI hematite, known for its exceptionally low magnetic damping and two distinct magnetic phases: a low-temperature uniaxial easy-axis phase and a high-temperature biaxial easy-plane phase. Using stochastic micromagnetic simulations, we investigate thickness-dependent magnon spin transport across both magnetic phases. Our results uncover a crossover from quasi-three-dimensional to quasi-two-dimensional magnon spin transport at a critical thickness, determined by the frequency or energy of the excited magnons. Below this critical thickness, we observe a pronounced enhancement in the magnon diffusion length in both magnetic phases. This rise is attributed to a change in the effective magnon density of states, reflecting the reduced phase space available for scattering in the thinner, quasi-two-dimensional regime. Understanding and controlling long-distance magnon spin transport in AFIs is crucial for developing next-generation spintronic nanodevices, especially as materials approach the two-dimensional limit.</description>

      <title>Emergence of a hidden-order phase well below the charge density wave transition in a topological Weyl semimetal (TaSe$_4$)$_2$I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17433v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The emergence of a charge density wave (CDW) in a Weyl semimetal -- a correlated topological phase, is exceptionally rare in condensed matter systems. In this context, the quasi-one-dimensional type-III Weyl semimetal (TaSe$_4$)$_2$I undergoes a CDW transition at $T_{\mathrm{CDW}} \approx 263$~K, providing an exceptional platform to investigate correlated topological CDW states. Here, we uncover an additional hidden-order phase transition at $T^* \sim 100$ K, well below the CDW onset, using low-frequency resistance noise spectroscopy, electrical transport, and thermoelectric measurements. This transition is characterized by a sharp enhancement in the noise exponent ($\alpha$) and variance of resistance fluctuations. Analysis of higher-order statistics of resistance fluctuations reveals the correlated dynamics underlying the transition. A pronounced anomaly in the Seebeck coefficient near $T^*$ further suggests a Fermi surface reconstruction. First-principles calculations reveal a structural distortion from the high-symmetry $I422$ phase to a low-symmetry $C2$ phase, via an intermediate $I4$ symmetry. This leads to renormalization of the electronic structure near the Fermi level and opening of a bandgap in the hidden-order phase. These findings demonstrate a previously unidentified correlated phase transition in the topological CDW-Weyl semimetal (TaSe$_4$)$_2$I, enriching the phase diagram of this material and establishing it as an ideal platform for studying intertwined electronic and structural orders.</description>

      <title>Effect of hybrid field coupling in nanostructured surfaces on anisotropic signal detection in nanoscale infrared spectroscopic imaging methods</title>

Abstract: Anisotropic intensity distributions on nanostructured surfaces and polarization-sensitive spectra have been observed in a number of nanoscale infrared spectroscopic imaging methods, including nano-FTIR [Bakir et al., Molecules, 2020, 25, 4295], photothermal induced resonance (PTIR) [Waeytens et al., Analyst, 2021, 146], tapping AFM-IR [Hondl et al., ACS Meas. Sci. Au, 2025, 5, 469; Luo et al., APL, 2022, 121, 23330], infrared photoinduced force microscopy (PiF-IR) [Anindo et al., JPCC, 2025, 129, 4517; Shcherbakov et al., Rev Methods Primers, 2025, 5, 1; Ali et al., Anal. Chem., 2025, 97, 23914] and peak force infrared microscopy (PFIR) [Xie et al., JPCC, 2022, 126, 8393; Anindo, JPCC, 2025]. A recent work combining modeling and experiment demonstrated that the hybrid field coupling of the IR illumination E0 with a polymer nanosphere and a metallic AFM probe is nearly as strong as the plasmonic coupling in case of a gold nanosphere [Anindo, JPCC, 2025]. For p-polarized illumination, this results in enhanced IR absorption on the surface perpendicular to the propagation of E0 which can explain the observed anisotropic intensity distribution. An additional anisotropy may be introduced by aligned surface molecules with oriented vibrational transition moments [Bakir et al., Molecules, 2020, 25, 4295; Luo, APL, 2022]. PiF-IR is strongly surface sensitive combining an unprecedented spatial resolution &lt; 5 nm with high spectral resolution [Shcherbakov, Rev Methods Primers, 2025; Ali, Anal. Chem., 2025], which allows, for example, to visualize nanoscale chemical variation on the surface of bacteria cells affected by antimicrobial interaction [Ali, Anal. Chem., 2025]. We compare PiF-IR hyperspectra of aligned perylene Langmuir Blodgett monolayers on nanostructured and planar gold substrates and use quantum chemical calculations of the oriented vibrational oscillators to interpret the observations.</description>
