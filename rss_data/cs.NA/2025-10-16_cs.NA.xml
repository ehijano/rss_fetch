      <title>A finite element method using a bounded auxiliary variable for solving the Richards equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Richards equation, a nonlinear elliptic parabolic equation, is widely used to model infiltration in porous media. We develop a finite element method for solving the Richards equation by introducing a new bounded auxiliary variable to eliminate unbounded terms in the weak formulation of the method. This formulation is discretized using a semi-implicit scheme and the resulting nonlinear system is solved using Newton's method. Our approach eliminates the need of regularization techniques and offers advantages in handling both dry and fully saturated zones. In the proposed techniques, a non-overlapping Schwarz domain decomposition method is used for modeling infiltration in layered soils. We apply the proposed method to solve the Richards equation using the Havercamp and van Genuchten models for the capillary pressure. Numerical experiments are performed to validate the proposed approach, including tests such as modeling flows in fibrous sheets where the initial medium is totally dry, two cases with fully saturated and dry regions, and an infiltration problem in layered soils. The numerical results demonstrate the stability and accuracy of the proposed numerical method. The numerical solutions remain positive in the presence of totally dry zones. The numerical investigations clearly demonstrated the capability of the proposed method to effectively predict the dynamics of flows in unsaturated soils.</description>

      <title>Computation of stresses in jammed packings modeled with Tresca friction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is interested in the computation of stresses within jammed packings of rigid polygonal cells. The cells are considered to follow a Tresca friction law. First, a constrained minimization problem is introduced where the friction energy is minimized while enforcing the non-interpenetration of neighboring cells as inequality constraint. The corresponding dual maximization problem is then deduced and its solution provides normal stresses at the interface between cells. Finally, lowest order Raviart-Thomas finite elements are used to reconstruct a consistent stress field by solving local problems. Numerical results are presented to showcase the consistency and robustness of the proposed methodology.</description>

      <title>Neural Approximate Inverse Preconditioners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a data-driven framework for constructing efficient approximate inverse preconditioners for elliptic partial differential equations (PDEs) by learning the Green's function of the underlying operator with neural networks (NNs). The training process integrates four key components: an adaptive multiscale neural architecture ($\alpha$MSNN) that captures hierarchical features across near-, middle-, and far-field regimes; the use of coarse-grid anchor data to ensure physical identifiability; a multi-$\varepsilon$ staged training protocol that progressively refines the Green's function representation across spatial scales; and an overlapping domain decomposition that enables local adaptation while maintaining global consistency. Once trained, the NN-approximated Green's function is directly compressed into either a hierarchical ($\mathcal{H}$-) matrix or a sparse matrix-using only the mesh geometry and the network output. This geometric construction achieves nearly linear complexity in both setup and application while preserving the spectral properties essential for effective preconditioning. Numerical experiments on challenging elliptic PDEs demonstrate that the resulting preconditioners consistently yield fast convergence and small iteration counts.</description>

      <title>Solving the BGK Model and Boltzmann equation by Fourier Neural Operator with conservative constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The numerical approximation of the Boltzmann collision operator presents significant challenges arising from its high dimensionality, nonlinear structure, and nonlocal integral form. In this work, we propose a Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) based framework to learn the Boltzmann collision operator and its simplified BGK model across different dimensions. The proposed operator learning approach efficiently captures the mapping between the distribution functions in either sequence-to-sequence or point to point manner, without relying on fine grained discretization and large amount of data. To enhance physical consistency, conservation constraints are embedded into the loss functional to enforce improved adherence to the fundamental conservation laws of mass, momentum, and energy compared with the original FNO framework. Several numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate that the modified FNO can efficiently achieve the accurate and physically consistent results, highlighting its potential as a promising framework for physics constrained operator learning in kinetic theory and other nonlinear integro-differential equations.</description>

      <title>An Unconditionally Stable Explicit Robin-Robin Partitioned Scheme for Fluid-Structure Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an explicit partitioned (loosely coupled) scheme for fluid structure interaction (FSI) problems, specifically designed to achieve high computational efficiency in modern engineering simulations. The FSI problem under consideration involves an incompressible viscous fluid, governed by the Navier-Stokes equations, with a thick linear elastic structure. The scheme adopts a Robin-Robin coupling condition, evaluating the right-hand side of the Robin boundary terms at each time step solely from the previous-step solutions. This explicit scheme allows the fluid and structure subproblems to be solved entirely independently within each time step, eliminating the need for staggered coupling or costly sub-iterations, which makes the method highly efficient and scalable for parallel computation. %More importantly, the proposed explicit scheme is inherently free from the added-mass effect guarantees unconditional stability. Various of numerical experiments demonstrate the stability, accuracy, and superior computational efficiency of the proposed approach, highlighting its strong potential for large scale parallel FSI computations in engineering applications.</description>

      <title>A Particle-Field Algorithm with Neural Interpolation for a Parabolic-Hyperbolic Chemotaxis System in 3D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tumor angiogenesis involves a collection of tumor cells moving towards blood vessels for nutrients to grow. Angiogenesis, and in general chemo- taxis, systems have been modeled using partial differential equations (PDEs) and as such require numerical methods to approximate their solutions. Here we study a Parabolic-Hyperbolic Keller-Segel (PHKS) system in three space dimensions. The model arises in the angiogenesis literature. To compute solutions to the PHKS system, we develop a neural stochastic interacting particle-field (NSIPF) method where the density variable is represented as empirical measures of particles and the field variable (concentration of chemoattractant) approximated by a convolutional neural network (CNN). We discuss the performance of NSIPF in computing multi-bump solutions to the system.</description>

      <title>How many integrals should be evaluated at least in two-dimensional hyperinterpolation?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach to approximating continuous functions over high-dimensional hypercubes by integrating matrix CUR decomposition with hyperinterpolation techniques. Traditional Fourier-based hyperinterpolation methods suffer from the curse of dimensionality, as the number of coefficients grows exponentially with the dimension. To address this challenge, we propose two efficient strategies for constructing low-rank matrix CUR decompositions of the coefficient matrix, significantly reducing computational complexity while preserving accuracy.
  The first method employs structured index selection to form a compressed representation of the tensor, while the second utilizes adaptive sampling to further optimize storage and computation. Theoretical error bounds are derived for both approaches, ensuring rigorous control over approximation quality. Additionally, practical algorithms -- including randomized and adaptive decomposition techniques -- are developed to efficiently compute the CUR decomposition. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods in drastically reducing the number of required coefficients without compromising precision.
  Our results bridge matrix/tensor decomposition and function approximation, offering a scalable solution for high-dimensional problems. This work advances the field of numerical analysis by providing a computationally efficient framework for hyperinterpolation, with potential applications in scientific computing, machine learning, and data-driven modeling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.13228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The secant method, as an important approach for solving nonlinear equations, is introduced in nearly all numerical analysis textbooks. However, most textbooks only briefly address the Q-order of convergence of this method, with few providing rigorous mathematical proofs. This paper establishes a rigorous proof for the Q-order of convergence of the secant method and theoretically compares its computational efficiency with that of Newton's method.</description>

      <title>Functional tensor train neural network for solving high-dimensional PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Discrete tensor train decomposition is widely employed to mitigate the curse of dimensionality in solving high-dimensional PDEs through traditional methods. However, the direct application of the tensor train method typically requires uniform grids of regular domains, which limits its application on non-uniform grids or irregular domains. To address the limitation, we develop a functional tensor train neural network (FTTNN) for solving high-dimensional PDEs, which can represent PDE solutions on non-uniform grids or irregular domains. An essential ingredient of our approach is to represent the PDE solutions by the functional tensor train format whose TT-core functions are approximated by neural networks. To give the functional tensor train representation, we propose and study functional tensor train rank and employ it into a physics-informed loss function for training. Because of tensor train representation, the resulting high-dimensional integral in the loss function can be computed via one-dimensional integrals by Gauss quadrature rules. Numerical examples including high-dimensional PDEs on regular or irregular domains are presented to demonstrate that the performance of the proposed FTTNN is better than that of Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINN).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.13409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a novel approach to compute the eigenvalues of non-Hermitian matrices using an enhanced shifted QR algorithm. The existing QR algorithms fail to converge early in the case of non-hermitian matrices, and our approach shows significant improvement in convergence rate while maintaining accuracy for all test cases. In this work, though our prior focus will be to address the results for a class mid- large sized non-Hermitian matrices, our algorithm has also produced significant improvements in the case of comparatively larger matrices such as 50 x 50 non-Hermitian matrices</description>

Abstract: We describe a machine-checked correctness proof of a C program that converts a coordinate-form (COO) sparse matrix to a compressed-sparse-row (CSR) matrix. The classic algorithm (sort the COO entries in lexicographic order by row,column; fill in the CSR arrays left to right) is concise but has rather intricate invariants. We illustrate a bottom-up methodology for deriving the invariants from the program.</description>

      <title>Mechanizing Olver's Error Arithmetic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We mechanize the fundamental properties of a rounding error model for floating-point arithmetic based on relative precision, a measure of error proposed as a substitute for relative error in rounding error analysis. A key property of relative precision is that it forms a true metric, providing a well-defined measure of distance between exact results and their floating-point approximations while offering a structured approach to propagating error bounds through sequences of computations. Our mechanization formalizes this property, establishes rules for converting between relative precision and relative error, and shows that the rounding error model based on relative precision slightly overapproximates the standard rounding error model. Finally, we demonstrate, with a simple example of the inner product of two vectors, that this alternative model facilitates a tractable approach to developing certified rounding error bounds.</description>

      <title>A domain decomposition approach to pore-network modeling of porous media flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a domain-decomposition pore-network method (DD-PNM) for modeling single-phase Stokes flow in porous media. The method combines the accuracy of finite-element discretizations on body-fitted meshes within pore subdomains with a sparse global coupling enforced through interface unknowns. Local Dirichlet-to-Neumann operators are precomputed from finite-element solutions for each pore subdomain, enabling a global Schur-complement system defined solely on internal interfaces. Rigorous mathematical analysis establishes solvability and discrete mass conservation of the global system. Moreover, we constructively recover classical pore-network models by fitting half-throat conductivities to local Dirichlet-to-Neumann maps, providing a principled bridge between mesh-based and network-based frameworks. Numerical results are presented to demonstrate the validity and effectiveness of the overall methodology.</description>

      <title>Data-intrinsic approximation in metric spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analysis and processing of data is a vital part of our modern society and requires vast amounts of computational resources. To reduce the computational burden, compressing and approximating data has become a central topic. We consider the approximation of labeled data samples, mathematically described as site-to-value maps between finite metric spaces. Within this setting, we identify the discrete modulus of continuity as an effective data-intrinsic quantity to measure regularity of site-to-value maps without imposing further structural assumptions. We investigate the consistency of the discrete modulus of continuity in the infinite data limit and propose an algorithm for its efficient computation. Building on these results, we present a sample based approximation theory for labeled data. For data subject to statistical uncertainty we consider multilevel approximation spaces and a variant of the multilevel Monte Carlo method to compute statistical quantities of interest. Our considerations connect approximation theory for labeled data in metric spaces to the covering problem for (random) balls on the one hand and the efficient evaluation of the discrete modulus of continuity to combinatorial optimization on the other hand. We provide extensive numerical studies to illustrate the feasibility of the approach and to validate our theoretical results.</description>

      <title>On the prospects of interpolatory spline bases for accurate mass lumping strategies in isogeometric analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While interpolatory bases such as the Lagrange basis form the cornerstone of classical finite element methods, they have been replaced in the more general finite element setting of isogeometric analysis in favor of other desirable properties. Yet, interpolation is a key property for devising accurate mass lumping strategies that are ubiquitous in explicit dynamic analyses of structures. In this article, we explore the possibility of restoring interpolation for spline bases within isogeometric analysis for the purpose of mass lumping. Although reminiscent of the spectral element method, this technique comes with its lot of surprises and challenges, which are critically assessed.</description>

      <title>On preconditioned Riemannian gradient methods for minimizing the Gross-Pitaevskii energy functional: algorithms, global convergence and optimal local convergence rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we propose a unified framework for preconditioned Riemannian gradient (P-RG) methods to minimize Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) energy functionals with rotation on a Riemannian manifold. This framework enables comprehensive analysis of existing projected Sobolev gradient methods and facilitates the construction of highly efficient P-RG algorithms. Under mild assumptions on the preconditioner, we prove energy dissipation and global convergence. Local convergence is more challenging due to phase and rotational invariances. Assuming the GP functional is Morse-Bott, we derive a sharp Polyak-\L ojasiewicz (PL) inequality near minimizers. This allows precise characterization of the local convergence rate via the condition number $\mu/L$, where $\mu$ and $L$ are the lower and upper bounds of the spectrum of a combined operator (preconditioner and Hessian) on a closed subspace. By combining spectral analysis with the PL inequality, we identify an optimal preconditioner achieving the best possible local convergence rate: $(L-\mu)/(L+\mu)+\varepsilon$ ($\varepsilon&gt;0$ small). To our knowledge, this is the first rigorous derivation of the local convergence rate for P-RG methods applied to GP functionals with two symmetry structures. Numerical experiments on rapidly rotating Bose-Einstein condensates validate the theoretical results and compare the performance of different preconditioners.</description>

      <title>High order regularization of nearly singular surface integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solutions of partial differential equations can often be written as surface integrals having a kernel related to a singular fundamental solution. Special methods are needed to evaluate the integral accurately at points on or near the surface. Here we derive formulas to regularize the integrals with high accuracy, using analysis from Beale and Tlupova (Adv. Comput. Math., 2024), so that a standard quadrature can be used without special care near the singularity. We treat single or double layer integrals for harmonic functions or for Stokes flow. The nearly singular case, evaluation at points close to the surface, can be needed when surfaces are close to each other, or to find values at grid points near a surface. We derive formulas for regularized kernels with error $O(\delta^p)$ where $\delta$ is the smoothing radius and $p = 3$, $5$, $7$. With spacing $h$ in the quadrature, we choose $\delta = \kappa h^q$ with $q&lt;1$ so that the discretization error is controlled as $h \to 0$. We see the predicted order of convergence $O(h^{pq})$ in various examples. Values at all grid points can be obtained from those near the surface in an efficient manner suggested in A. Mayo (SIAM J. Statist. Comput., 1985). With this technique we obtain high order accurate grid values for a harmonic function determined by interfacial conditions and for the pressure and velocity in Stokes flow around a translating spheroid.</description>

      <title>Average-case thresholds for exact regularization of linear programs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.13083v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Small regularizers can preserve linear programming solutions exactly. This paper provides the first average-case analysis of exact regularization: with a standard Gaussian cost vector and fixed constraint set, bounds are established for the probability that exact regularization succeeds as a function of regularization strength. Failure is characterized via the Gaussian measure of inner cones, controlled by novel two-sided bounds on the measure of shifted cones. Results reveal dimension-dependent scaling laws and connect exact regularization of linear programs to their polyhedral geometry via the normal fan and the Gaussian (solid-angle) measure of its cones. Computable bounds are obtained in several canonical settings, including regularized optimal transport. Numerical experiments corroborate the predicted scalings and thresholds.</description>

      <title>Performance Comparison of Gate-Based and Adiabatic Quantum Computing for Power Flow Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present the first direct comparison between gate-based quantum computing (GQC) and adiabatic quantum computing (AQC) for solving the AC power flow (PF) equations. Building on the Adiabatic Quantum Power Flow (AQPF) algorithm originally designed for annealing platforms, we adapt it to the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA). The PF equations are reformulated as a combinatorial optimization problem. Numerical experiments on a 4-bus test system assess solution accuracy and computational time. Results from QAOA are benchmarked against those obtained using D-Wave's Advantage system and Fujitsu's latest generation Digital Annealer, i.e., Quantum-Inspired Integrated Optimization software (QIIO). The findings provide quantitative insights into the performance trade-offs, scalability, and practical viability of GQC versus AQC paradigms for PF analysis, highlighting the potential of quantum algorithms to address the computational challenges associated with modern electricity networks in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ).</description>

      <title>An efficient approach with theoretical guarantees to simultaneously reconstruct activity and attenuation sinogram for TOF-PET</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13562v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In positron emission tomography (PET), it is indispensable to perform attenuation correction in order to obtain the quantitatively accurate activity map (tracer distribution) in the body. Generally, this is carried out based on the estimated attenuation map obtained from computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. However, except for errors in the attenuation correction factors obtained, the additional scan not only brings in new radiation doses and/or increases the scanning time but also leads to severe misalignment induced by various motions during and between the two sequential scans. To address these issues, based on maximum likelihood estimation, we propose a new mathematical model for simultaneously reconstructing the activity and attenuation sinogram from the time-of-flight (TOF)-PET emission data only. Particularly, we make full use of the exclusively exponential form for the attenuation correction factors, and consider the constraint of a total amount of the activity in some mask region in the proposed model. Furthermore, we prove its well-posedness, including the existence, uniqueness and stability of the solution. We propose an alternating update algorithm to solve the model, and also analyze its convergence. Finally, numerical experiments with various TOF-PET emission data demonstrate that the proposed method is of numerical convergence and robust to noise, and outperforms some state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and efficiency, and has the capability of autonomous attenuation correction.</description>

      <title>A Convergent Finite Element Scheme for the Q-Tensor Model of Liquid Crystals Subjected to an Electric Field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.11229v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the Landau-de Gennes Q-tensor model of liquid crystals subjected to an electric field and develop a fully discrete numerical scheme for its solution. The scheme uses a convex splitting of the bulk potential, and we introduce a truncation operator for the Q-tensors to ensure well-posedness of the problem. We prove the stability and well-posedness of the scheme. Finally, making a restriction on the admissible parameters of the scheme, we show that up to a subsequence, solutions to the fully discrete scheme converge to weak solutions of the Q-tensor model as the time step and mesh are refined. We then present numerical results computed by the numerical scheme, among which we show that it is possible to simulate the Fr\'eedericksz transition with this scheme.</description>

      <title>A Bijective Image Retargeting Algorithm Based on Conformal Energy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18074v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Image retargeting, which resizes images to one with a prescribed aspect ratio by determining an optimal warping map, has gained substantial interest in imaging science. Despite significant advances, existing methods often fail to ensure bijective warping maps essential for preserving visual information. This paper introduces a novel bijective image retargeting model through conformal energy minimization of the deformation field. The proposed model establishes mathematical rigor by proving the well-posedness for the optimal warping map in both continuous and discrete settings and showing that the discrete solutions converge to their continuous counterpart under mesh refinement. Numerical experiments corroborate the model's efficacy and the convergence of discrete solutions during progressive mesh subdivision processes, validating both theoretical guarantees and practical performance.</description>

      <title>Parallelisation of partial differential equations via representation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07365v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Incorporating symmetries into the numerical solution of differential equations has been a mainstay of research over the last 40 years, however, one aspect is less known and under-utilised: discretisations of partial differential equations that commute with symmetry actions (like rotations, reflections or permutations) can be decoupled into independent systems solvable in parallel by incorporating knowledge from representation theory. We introduce this beautiful subject via a crash course in representation theory focussed on hands-on examples for the symmetry groups of the square and cube, and its utilisation in the construction of so-called symmetry-adapted bases. Schur's lemma, which is not well-known in applied mathematics, plays a powerful role in proving sparsity of resulting discretisations and thereby showing that partial differential equations do indeed decouple. Using Schr\"odinger equations as a motivating example, we demonstrate that a symmetry-adapted basis leads to a significant increase in the number of independent linear systems. Counterintuitively, the effectiveness of this approach is in fact greater for partial differential equations with less symmetries, for example a Schr\"odinger equation where the potential is only invariant under permutations, but not under rotations or reflections. We also explore this phenomenon as the dimension of the partial differential equation becomes large, hinting at the potential for significant savings in high-dimensions.</description>

Abstract: We prove that $\alpha$-dissipative solutions to the Cauchy problem of the Hunter-Saxton equation, where $\alpha \in W^{1, \infty}(\mathbb{R}, [0, 1))$, can be computed numerically with order $\mathcal{O}(\Delta x^{{1}/{8}}+\Delta x^{{\beta}/{4}})$ in $L^{\infty}(\mathbb{R})$, provided there exist constants $C &gt; 0$ and $\beta \in (0, 1]$ such that the initial spatial derivative $\bar{u}_{x}$ satisfies $\|\bar{u}_x(\cdot + h) - \bar{u}_x(\cdot)\|_2 \leq Ch^{\beta}$ for all $h \in (0, 2]$. The derived convergence rate is exemplified by a number of numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Inexact subspace projection methods for low-rank tensor eigenvalue problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19578v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose inexact subspace iteration for solving high-dimensional eigenvalue problems with low-rank structure. Inexactness stems from low-rank compression, enabling efficient representation of high-dimensional vectors in a low-rank tensor format. A primary challenge in these methods is that standard operations, such as matrix-vector products and linear combinations, increase tensor rank, necessitating rank truncation and hence approximation. We compare the proposed methods with an existing inexact Lanczos method with low-rank compression. This method constructs an approximate orthonormal Krylov basis, which is often difficult to represent accurately in low-rank tensor formats, even when the eigenvectors themselves exhibit low-rank structure. In contrast, inexact subspace iteration uses approximate eigenvectors (Ritz vectors) directly as a subspace basis, bypassing the need for an orthonormal Krylov basis. Our analysis and numerical experiments demonstrate that inexact subspace iteration is much more robust to rank-truncation errors compared to the inexact Lanczos method. We also demonstrate that rank-truncated subspace iteration can converge for problems where the DMRG method stagnates. Furthermore, the proposed subspace iteration methods do not require a Hermitian matrix, in contrast to Lanczos and DMRG, which are designed specifically for Hermitian matrices.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Natural Gradient Descent for PINNs with Randomized Nystr\"om Preconditioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11638v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Natural Gradient Descent (NGD) has emerged as a promising optimization algorithm for training neural network-based solvers for partial differential equations (PDEs), such as Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). However, its practical use is often limited by the high computational cost of solving linear systems involving the Gramian matrix. While matrix-free NGD methods based on the conjugate gradient (CG) method avoid explicit matrix inversion, the ill-conditioning of the Gramian significantly slows the convergence of CG. In this work, we extend matrix-free NGD to broader classes of problems than previously considered and propose the use of Randomized Nystr\"om preconditioning to accelerate convergence of the inner CG solver. The resulting algorithm demonstrates substantial performance improvements over existing NGD-based methods and other state-of-the-art optimizers on a range of PDE problems discretized using neural networks.</description>

It has several advantages, including constraint-preserving approximations and mesh independence.

      <description>arXiv:2508.02358v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fully implicit timestepping methods have several potential advantages for atmosphere/ocean simulation. First, being unconditionally stable, they degrade more gracefully as the Courant number increases, typically requiring more solver iterations rather than suddenly blowing up. Second, particular choices of implicit timestepping methods can extend energy conservation properties of spatial discretisations to the fully discrete method. Third, these methods avoid issues related to splitting errors that can occur in some situations, and avoid the complexities of splitting methods. Fully implicit timestepping methods have had limited application in geophysical fluid dynamics due to challenges of finding suitable iterative solvers, since the coupled treatment of advection prevents the standard elimination techniques. However, overlapping Additive Schwarz methods, provide a robust, scalable iterative approach for solving the monolithic coupled system for all fields and Runge-Kutta stages. In this study we investigate this approach applied to the rotating shallow water equations, facilitated by the Irksome package which provides automated code generation for implicit Runge-Kutta methods. We compare various schemes in terms of accuracy and efficiency using an implicit/explicit splitting method, namely the ARK2 scheme of Giraldo et al (2013), as a benchmark. This provides an initial look at whether implicit Runge-Kutta methods can be viable for atmosphere and ocean simulation.</description>

Abstract: Topology optimization is a valuable tool in engineering, facilitating the design of optimized structures. However, topological changes often require a remeshing step, which can become challenging. In this work, we propose an isogeometric approach to topology optimization driven by topological derivatives. The combination of a level-set method together with an immersed isogeometric framework allows seamless geometry updates without the necessity of remeshing. At the same time, topological derivatives provide topological modifications without the need to define initial holes [7]. We investigate the influence of higher-degree basis functions in both the level-set representation and the approximation of the solution. Two numerical examples demonstrate the proposed approach, showing that employing higher-degree basis functions for approximating the solution improves accuracy, while linear basis functions remain sufficient for the level-set function representation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.13260v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Wasserstein gradient flows have become a central tool for optimization problems over probability measures. A natural numerical approach is forward-Euler time discretization. We show, however, that even in the simple case where the energy functional is the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence against a smooth target density, forward-Euler can fail dramatically: the scheme does not converge to the gradient flow, despite the fact that the first variation $\nabla\frac{\delta F}{\delta\rho}$ remains formally well defined at every step. We identify the root cause as a loss of regularity induced by the discretization, and prove that a suitable regularization of the functional restores the necessary smoothness, making forward-Euler a viable solver that converges in discrete time to the global minimizer.</description>

Abstract: Many algorithms in scientific computing and data science take advantage of low-rank approximation of matrices and kernels, and understanding why nearly-low-rank structure occurs is essential for their analysis and further development. This paper provides a framework for bounding the best low-rank approximation error of matrices arising from samples of a kernel that is analytically continuable in one of its variables to an open region of the complex plane. Elegantly, the low-rank approximations used in the proof are computable by rational interpolation using the roots and poles of Zolotarev rational functions, leading to a fast algorithm for their construction.</description>

Abstract: The Lie--Trotter product formula is a foundational approximation for the quantum partition function, yet obtaining rigorous error bounds for the unbounded Hamiltonians common in physics remains a significant challenge. This paper provides a quantitative error analysis for this approximation across two key systems. For a particle in a smooth, periodic potential, we establish an optimal convergence rate of $\mathcal O(1/N^2)$ for both the partition function and thermal averages, where $N$ is the number of imaginary time steps. We then extend this analysis to the more challenging case of a confining potential on $\mathbb R$, proving a nearly optimal rate of $\mathcal O((\log N+1)^{\frac32}/N^2)$. The derived error bounds provide a firm mathematical foundation for the high-order accuracy of path integral simulations in quantum statistical mechanics.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of periodic fractional discrete NLS in the continuum limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13152v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The fractional discrete nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation (fDNLS) is studied on a periodic lattice from the analytic and dynamic perspective by varying the mesh size $h&gt;0$ and the nonlocal L\'evy index $\alpha \in (0,2]$. We show that the discrete system converges to the fractional NLS as $h \rightarrow 0$ below the energy space by directly estimating the difference between the discrete and continuum solutions in $L^2(\mathbb{T})$ using the discrete periodic Strichartz estimates. The sharp convergence rate via the finite difference method (FDM) is shown to be $O(h^{\frac{\alpha}{2+\alpha}})$ in the energy space. To further illustrate the convergent behavior of fDNLS, we survey various dynamical behaviors of the continuous wave (CW) solutions in the context of modulational instability, emphasizing the interplay between linear dispersion (or lattice diffraction), characterized by the nonlocal lattice coupling, and nonlinearity. In particular, the transition as $h \rightarrow 0$ from the linear dependence of maximum gain $\Omega_m$ on the amplitude $A$ of CW solutions to the quadratic dependence is shown analytically and numerically.</description>

      <title>Nesterov's Accelerated Jacobi-Type Methods for Large-scale Symmetric Positive Semidefinite Linear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03272v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Solving symmetric positive semidefinite linear systems is an essential task in many scientific computing problems. While Jacobi-type methods, including the classical Jacobi method and the weighted Jacobi method, exhibit simplicity in their forms and friendliness to parallelization, they are not attractive either because of the potential convergence failure or their slow convergence rate. This paper aims to showcase the possibility of improving classical Jacobi-type methods by employing Nesterov's acceleration technique that results in an accelerated Jacobi-type method with improved convergence properties. Simultaneously, it preserves the appealing features for parallel implementation. In particular, we show that the proposed method has an $O\left(t^{-2}\right)$ convergence rate in terms of objective function values of the associated convex quadratic optimization problem, where $t\geq 1$ denotes the iteration counter. To further improve the practical performance of the proposed method, we also develop and analyze a restarted variant of the method, which is shown to have an $O\left((\log_2(t))^2t^{-2}\right)$ convergence rate when the coefficient matrix is positive definite. Furthermore, we conduct appropriate numerical experiments to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed method. Our numerical results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the classical Jacobi-type methods and the conjugate gradient method, and shows a comparable performance as the preconditioned conjugate gradient method with a diagonal preconditioner. Finally, we develop a parallel implementation and conduct speed-up tests on some large-scale systems. Our results indicate that the proposed framework is highly scalable.</description>

      <title>Sharp decay estimates and numerical analysis for weakly coupled systems of two subdiffusion equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18295v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the initial-boundary value problem for weakly coupled systems of time-fractional subdiffusion equations with spatially and temporally varying coupling coefficients. By combining the energy method with the coercivity of fractional derivatives, we convert the original partial differential equations into a coupled ordinary differential system. Through Laplace transform and maximum principle arguments, we reveal a dichotomy in decay behavior: When the highest fractional order is less than one, solutions exhibit sublinear decay, whereas systems with the highest order equal to one demonstrate a distinct superlinear decay pattern. This phenomenon fundamentally distinguishes coupled systems from single fractional diffusion equations, where such accelerated superlinear decay never occurs. Numerical experiments employing finite difference methods and implicit discretization schemes validate the theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>HYLU: Hybrid Parallel Sparse LU Factorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07690v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article introduces HYLU, a hybrid parallel LU factorization-based general-purpose solver designed for efficiently solving sparse linear systems (Ax=b) on multi-core shared-memory architectures. The key technical feature of HYLU is the integration of hybrid numerical kernels so that it can adapt to various sparsity patterns of coefficient matrices. Tests on 34 sparse matrices from SuiteSparse Matrix Collection reveal that HYLU outperforms Intel MKL PARDISO in the numerical factorization phase by geometric means of 1.95X (for one-time solving) and 2.40X (for repeated solving). HYLU can be downloaded from https://github.com/chenxm1986/hylu.</description>
