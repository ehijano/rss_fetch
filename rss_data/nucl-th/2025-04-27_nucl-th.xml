      <title>Study of Gamow-Teller strength and associated weak-rates on odd-A nuclei in stellar matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a recent study by Cole et al., it was concluded that QRPA calculations show larger deviations and overestimate the total experimental Gamow-Teller (GT) strength. It was also concluded that QRPA calculated electron capture rates exhibit larger deviation than those derived from the measured GT strength distributions. The main purpose of this study is to probe the findings of the Cole et al. paper. This study gives useful information on the performance of QRPA-based nuclear models. As per simulation results, the capturing of electrons that occur on medium heavy isotopes have a significant role in decreasing the ratio of electron-to-baryon content of the stellar interior during the late stages of core evolution. We report the calculation of allowed charge-changing transitions strength for odd-A fp-shell nuclei (45Sc and 55Mn) by employing the deformed pn-QRPA approach. The computed GT transition strength is compared with previous theoretical calculations and measured data. For stellar applications the corresponding electron capture rates are computed and compared with rates using previously calculated and measured Gamow-Teller values. Our finding show that our calculated results are in decent accordance with measured data. At higher stellar temperature our calculated electron capture rates are larger than those calculated by Independent Particle Model (IPM) and shell model. It was further concluded that at low temperature and high density regions the positron emission weak-rates from 45Sc and 55Mn may be neglected in simulation codes.</description>

      <title>Continuum quasiparticle random-phase approximation for $(n,\gamma)$ reactions on neutron-rich nuclei: collectivity and resonances in low-energy cross section</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formulate a microscopic theory to calculate cross section of the radiative neutron capture on neutron-rich nuclei using the continuum quasiparticle random-phase approximation. This formulation is designed to be applied to neutron-rich nuclei around the $r$-process path, for which the compound nuclear model may not be appropriate. It takes into account effects of various excitation modes such as the soft dipole excitation, the giant resonances, and the quasiparticle resonance in addition to the surface vibrations such as quadrupole and octupole modes. We perform numerical calculations to demonstrate new features of the present theory, employing reactions $^{89}{\rm Ge}(n,\gamma)^{90}{\rm Ge}$ and $^{91}{\rm Zn}(n,\gamma)^{92}{\rm Zn}$ with $E1$ transitions populating the ground state, collective $2^{+}_{1}$ and $3^{-}_{1}$ states in $ ^{90}{\rm Ge}$ and $^{92}{\rm Zn}$. With these examples, we discuss enhanced resonance contributions in the $(n,\gamma)$ reaction at low energy, which originate from the quasiparticle resonance and the pygmy quadrupole resonance located just above the one neutron separation energy, and from combination with the low-lying octupole vibrational state.</description>

      <title>Equation of state and Fermi liquid properties of dense matter based on chiral EFT interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present results for the equation of state of symmetric nuclear matter and pure neutron matter obtained in many-body-perturbation theory (MBPT) up to third order, based on various chiral nucleon-nucleon and three-nucleon interactions used in ab initio calculations of nuclei. We extract equation of state properties, such as the incompressibility and the symmetry energy, and discuss estimates of the theoretical uncertainties due to neglected higher-order contributions in the MBPT expansion as well as the chiral effective field theory expansion. In addition, we discuss the Fermi liquid approach to nuclear matter and present results for the Landau parameters, effective mass, and speed of sound for pure neutron matter.</description>

      <title>Investigation of Gamow Teller Transition Properties in 56-64Ni Isotopes Using QRPA Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weak rates in nickel isotopes play an integral role in the dynamics of supernovae. Electron capture and $\beta$-decay of nickel isotopes, dictated by Gamow-Teller transitions, significantly alter the lepton fraction of the stellar matter. In this paper we calculate Gamow-Teller (GT) transitions for isotopes of nickel, $^{56-64}$Ni, using QRPA methods. The GT strength distributions were calculated using four different QRPA models. Our results are also compared with previous theoretical calculations and measured strength distributions wherever available. Our investigation concluded that amongst all RPA models, the pn-QRPA(C) model best described the measured GT distributions (including total GT strength and centroid placement). It is hoped that the current investigation of GT properties would prove handy and may lead to a better understanding of the presupernova evolution of massive stars.</description>

      <title>Charm-hadron reconstruction through three body decay in hadronic collisions using Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Studies of heavy-quark (charm and beauty) production in hadronic and nuclear collisions provide excellent testing grounds for the theory of strong interaction, quantum chromodynamics. Heavy-quarks are produced predominantly in the initial hard partonic interactions, allowing them to witness the entire evolution process. The charm hadrons are produced in two ways. Firstly, the prompt charm hadrons which are formed from the charm quark hadronization which are produced directly from the initial hard-scatterings or the decay of other excited charm states. Secondly, the nonprompt charm hadrons which are produced from the decay of beauty hadrons. The produced charm hadrons then usually decay to light-flavor hadrons or leptons via two or three body decay. The reconstruction of charm hadrons is challenging due to the large combinatorial background as well as the difficulty of distinguishing between prompt and non-prompt charm hadrons. In this work, we use machine learning models--XGboost and Deep Neural Network--to reconstruct $\Lambda_c^{+} (udc)$ hadrons via its three body final state decay channel, $\Lambda_c^{+} \rightarrow pK^0_s$ and $K^0_s \rightarrow \pi^{+}\pi^{-}$. Using several experimentally available features of the decay daughters, these models can separate signal from background and identify prompt and nonprompt candidates with nearly 99\% accuracy. This method performs an unbinned track-level reconstruction since the $\Lambda_c$ candidates are tagged directly from their decay daughters. The necessary data for this study are simulated in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13.6$~TeV using PYTHIA8 (Monash) model.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning-Based b-Jet Tagging in pp Collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18291v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Studying heavy-flavor jets in pp collision is important since they can test pQCD calculations and be used as a reference for heavy-ion collisions. Jets in this analysis are reconstructed from charged particles using the anti-$k_{\mathrm{T}}$ algorithm with a resolution parameter $R=$ 0.4 and with pseudorapidity $|\eta|&lt;$ 0.5. Beauty jets are tagged using a machine learning model that uses a convolutional neural network trained on information extracted from the jet, tracks, and secondary vertices. The results show that this model is superior compared to other traditional tagging methods.</description>

      <title>Probing Quantum Phenomena through Photoproduction in Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18342v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photoproduction in ultra-peripheral relativistic heavy-ion collisions displays many unique features, often involving quantum mechanical coherence and two-source interference between photon emission from the two ions. We review the recent experimental results from RHIC and the LHC and theoretical studies of coherent vector meson photoproduction, emphasizing the quantum mechanical aspects of the interactions and the entanglement between the final state particles. These studies enrich our understanding of non-local realism, underscore the critical role of the polarization of the photon source, quantum interference and nuclear effect on the gluon distribution. It paves a way for quantitatively probing the quantum nature of these high-energy nuclear collisions.</description>

      <title>Virial theorem for rigidly rotating matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The scaling property of the thermodynamic free energy ($\Phi$) of a system at global equilibrium has been examined using a real-time method known as the virial theorem. We demonstrate these scaling properties through a derived relation based on the general structure of equal-time commutators among Poincare charges and their densities. This relation is applicable to any renormalizable fields with spin $\leq 1$, excluding gauge fields. In this particular study, we investigate a rigidly rotating solution ($\Omega = \text{const}$) at global equilibrium for massless fermionic matter. It has been shown that the applicability of a hydrodynamic description requires a hierarchy $\Omega R \gg \Omega \beta_{0}$, where $R$ is the radius of the cylindrical-shaped rotating matter and $\beta_{0} = 1/T_{0}$ is the inverse temperature on the rotation axis. Consequently, the thermodynamic free energy $\Phi$ depends on the angular velocity through the product $\Omega R$, a dependency that extends to other thermodynamic variables as well. These findings are consistent with recent lattice QCD simulation results. Furthermore, we compute the moment of inertia for massless fermions and estimate the light quark contribution to the total moment of inertia of the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) produced in heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>KDAR neutrino scattering for $^{12}$C target via charged current and muon angular distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01169v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We calculate muon-neutrino ($\nu_{\mu}$) scattering off $^{12}$C via charged current (CC) by exploiting the 236 MeV ${\nu_{\mu}}$ from the kaon-decay-at-rest (KDAR). In this energy region, since both inelastic scattering below the quasielastic (QE) region and the QE scattering contribute simultaneously, we combine the inelastic scattering obtained by the QRPA and the QE scattering obtained by distorted wave born approximation (DWBA) based on the relativistic mean field (RMF) theory. We compare the results to the data from MiniBooNE. Further, since the KDR $\nu_{\mu}$ CC scattering may have angle dependence of outgoing muon, we investigate the differential angular dependent cross section in the ${\nu_{\mu}}$-$^{12}$C scattering and compare to the results by $\nu_e$-$^{12}$C scattering. These results could be useful for the calibration of the forthcoming KDAR neutrino cross section experiments.</description>

      <title>Assessment of effect of local approximation on single folding potential at low and intermediate incident energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05664v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To the single folding potentials (SFPs)
  for the nucleon-nucleus ($N$-$A$) elastic scatterings,
  local approximations (LAs) have customarily been applied.
  The LA discussed by Brieva and Rook has been well-known,
  which only needs the density profile as the structure information
  of the target nucleus.
  By applying the M3Y-P6 interaction
  both to the target wave functions and the real part of SFP,
  supplemented with the Koning-Delaroche phenomenological imaginary potential,
  the precision of the Brieva-Rook LA on the SFP is investigated
  for the proton-nucleus elastic scatterings
  at $\epsilon_p=16\,-\,80\,\mathrm{MeV}$ incident energies.
  The analyzing powers as well as the differential cross sections
  are in reasonable agreement with the available data.
  The precision of the LA for the central and LS channels
  is distinctly examined.
  Although the LA works well at small angles
  ($\theta_\mathrm{c.m.}\lesssim 30^\circ$),
  it gives rise to sizable deviation from the results of the non-local SFP
  (\textit{i.e.}, without the LA) at larger angles.
  The results of the non-local SFP are always in better agreement with the data.
  The LA for the LS channel influences the differential cross-sections,
  and the LA for the central channel does the spin observables.
  It is found that the precision of the LA well correlates
  to the momentum transfer $q$,
  and the discrepancy becomes sizable at $q\gtrsim 1.5\,\mathrm{fm}^{-1}$.
  The LA is also examined for a halo nucleus,
  by taking $^{86}$Ni as an example.
  The precision is slightly worse than in stable nuclei.
  Difference from the prediction of the empirical potential
  in the observables of the $p$-$^{86}$Ni scattering is discussed.</description>

      <title>Locating Critical Points Using Ratios of Lee-Yang Zeros</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19345v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a method to numerically determine the location of a critical point in general systems using the finite-size scaling of Lee-Yang zeros. This method makes use of the fact that the ratios of Lee-Yang zeros on various spatial volumes intersect at the critical point. While the method is similar to the Binder-cumulant analysis, it is advantageous in suppressing the finite-volume effects arising from the mixing of variables in general systems. We show that the method works successfully for numerically locating the CP in the three-dimensional three-state Potts model with a nonzero external field.</description>

      <title>Transverse-momentum-dependent pion structures from lattice QCD: Collins-Soper kernel, soft factor, TMDWF, and TMDPDF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04625v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first lattice quantum chromodynamics (QCD) calculation of the pion valence-quark transverse-momentum-dependent parton distribution function (TMDPDF) within the framework of large-momentum effective theory (LaMET). Using correlators fixed in the Coulomb gauge (CG), we computed the quasi-TMD beam function for a pion with a mass of 300 MeV, a fine lattice spacing of $a = 0.06$ fm and multiple large momenta up to 3 GeV. The intrinsic soft functions in the CG approach are extracted from form factors with large momentum transfer, and as a byproduct, we also obtain the corresponding Collins-Soper (CS) kernel. Our determinations of both the soft function and the CS kernel agree with perturbation theory at small transverse separations ($b_\perp$) between the quarks. At larger $b_\perp$, the CS kernel remains consistent with recent results obtained using both CG and gauge-invariant TMD correlators in the literature. By combining next-to-leading logarithmic (NLL) factorization of the quasi-TMD beam function and the soft function, we obtain $x$-dependent pion valence-quark TMDPDF for transverse separations $b_\perp \gtrsim 1$ fm. Interestingly, we find that the $b_\perp$ dependence of the phenomenological parameterizations of TMDPDF for moderate values of $x$ are in reasonable agreement with our QCD determinations. In addition, we present results for the transverse-momentum-dependent wave function (TMDWF) for a heavier pion with 670 MeV mass.</description>

      <title>The impact of new ($\alpha$, n) reaction rates on the weak s-process in metal-poor massive stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13766v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Massive stars are significant sites for the weak s-process (ws-process). $^{22}$Ne and $^{16}$O are, respectively, the main neutron source and poison for the ws-process. In the metal-poor stars, the abundance of $^{22}$Ne is limited by the metallicity, so that the contribution of $^{22}$Ne($\alpha$, n)$^{25}$Mg reaction on the s-process is weaker. Conversely, the $^{17}$O($\alpha$, n)$^{20}$Ne reaction is more evident in more metal-poor stars due to the most abundant $^{16}$O in all metallicities. In this work, we calculate the evolution of four metal-poor models ($Z=10^{-3}$) for the Zero-Age Main-Sequence (ZAMS) masses of $M ({\rm ZAMS})=$ 15, 20, 25, and 30 M$_{\odot}$ to investigate the effect of reaction rates on the ws-process. We adopt the new $^{17}$O($\alpha$, n)$^{20}$Ne and $^{17}$O($\alpha, \gamma$)$^{21}$Ne reaction rates suggested by Wiescher et al. (2023) and $^{22}$Ne($\alpha$, n)$^{25}$Mg and $^{22}$Ne($\alpha, \gamma$)$^{26}$Mg from Best et al. (2013). The yields of the s-process isotope with updated reaction rates are compared with the results using default reaction rates from JINA REACLIB. We find that the new $^{17}$O+$\alpha$ reaction rates increase the ws-process mainly in all the stages, while the new $^{22}$Ne+$\alpha$ reaction rates only increase the ws-process in C and Ne burning stages. Updating these new reaction rates would increase the production of ws-process isotopes by tens of times. We also note that for more massive stars, the enhancement by new $^{17}$O+$\alpha$ reaction rates become more significant.</description>
