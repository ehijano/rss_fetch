      <title>Eta-pairing state in flatband lattice: Interband coupling effect on entanglement entropy logarithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The eta-pairing state is the eigenstate of the hypercubic Hubbard model, which exhibits anomalous logarithmic scaling of entanglement entropy. In multi-band systems, eta-pairing can be exact eigenstate when the band is flat without interband coupling. However, typical flatband systems such as Lieb and Kagome lattices often feature band touchings, where interband coupling effects are non-negligible. Using the Creutz ladder, we investigate the deformation of eta-pairing states under the interband coupling effect. Our results show corrections to entanglement entropy scaling, with modified eta-pairing states displaying broadened doublons, nonuniform energy spacing, and deviations from exact behavior for configurations with more than one eta-pair, even in the large band gap limit, except at t = 0. Through a Schrieffer-Wolff transformation, we quantify corrections to the spectrum generating algebra, offering insights into the interplay between interaction-driven phenomena and band structure effects. These findings illuminate the robustness and limitations of eta-pairing in realistic flatband systems.</description>

      <title>Evidence of electronic states driving current-induced insulator-to-metal transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On demand current-driven insulator-to-metal transition (IMT) is pivotal for the next generation of energy-efficient and scalable microelectronics. IMT is a key phenomenon observed in various quantum materials, and it is enabled by the complex interplay of spin, lattice, charge, and orbital degrees of freedom (DOF). Despite significant prior work, the underlying mechanism of the current-driven IMT remains elusive, primarily due to the difficulty in simultaneously obtaining bulk fingerprints of all the electronic DOF. Here, we employ in-operando resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) on Ca$_2$RuO$_4$, a prototypical strongly correlated material, to track the evolution of the electronic DOF encoded in the RIXS spectra during the current-driven IMT. Upon entering the conductive state, we observe an energy-selective suppression of the RIXS intensity, proportional to the current. Using complementary RIXS cross-section calculations, we demonstrate that the non-equilibrium conductive state emerges from the formation of correlated electronic states with a persistent Mott gap.</description>

      <title>Role of On-site and Inter-site Coulomb Interactions in KV$_3$Sb$_5$: A first-principles DFT+$U$+$V$ study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlocal Coulomb interactions play a crucial role in stabilizing distinct electronic phases in kagome materials. In this work, we systematically investigate the effects of on-site ($U$) and inter-site ($V$) Coulomb interactions on the electronic structure and stability of charge-density-wave (CDW) phases in the kagome metal KV$_3$Sb$_5$ using density functional theory (DFT+$U$+$V$) calculations. We demonstrate that $V$ promotes the formation and stability of CDW phases, whereas $U$ suppresses these phases, highlighting a fundamental competition between local and nonlocal electronic correlations. By directly comparing our theoretical results with angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) data, we identify realistic values of $U$ and $V$ that accurately describe the electronic band structure of KV$_3$Sb$_5$. Our findings establish a detailed $U$-$V$ phase diagram for KV$_3$Sb$_5$, offering valuable insights into the correlated electronic states in kagome metals and serving as a foundation for future explorations of correlation-driven phenomena in related materials.</description>

      <title>Finite-$q$ antiferro and ferri magnetic toroidal order in a distorted kagome structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A highly geometrically frustrated lattice structure such as a distorted kagome (or quasikagome) structure enriches physical phenomena through coupling with the electronic structure, topology, and magnetism. Recently, it has been reported that an intermetallic HoAgGe exhibits two distinct magnetic structures with the finite magnetic vector $q=(1/3,1/3,0)$: One is the partially ordered state in the intermediate-temperature region, and the other is the kagome spin ice state in the lowest-temperature region. We theoretically elucidate that the former is characterized by antiferro magnetic toroidal (MT) ordering, while the latter is characterized by ferri MT ordering based on the multipole representation theory, which provides an opposite interpretation to previous studies. We also show how antiferro MT and ferri MT orderings are microscopically formed by quantifying the magnetic toroidal moment activated in a multiorbital system. As a result, we find that the degree of distortion for the kagome structure plays a significant role in determining the nature of antiferro MT and ferri MT orderings, which brings about the crossover between the antiferro MT and ferri MT orders. We confirm such a tendency by evaluating the linear magnetoelectric effect. Our analysis can be applied irrespective of lattice structures and magnetic vectors without annoying the cluster origin.</description>

      <title>Topological phases of coupled Su-Schrieffer-Heeger wires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The phase diagrams of arbitrary number $N_{\text{w}}$ of diagonally and perpendicularly coupled Su-Schrieffer-Heeger wires have been identified. The diagonally coupled wires have rich topological phase diagrams exhibiting insulating phases with winding numbers $0\leq w \leq N_{\text{w}}$ and topological critical lines restricted by the reflection mirror symmetry. Even number of perpendicularly coupled wires exhibit either gapless or trivial topological phases. Odd number of perpendicularly coupled wires additionally exhibit nontrivial topological phases with winding number $w=1$. Due to the mirror reflection symmetry, their gapless regions can be topologically nontrivial. Odd number of perpendicularly coupled wires reveal coherent confined correlations in the odd indexed wires away from the gapless regions.</description>

      <title>Coupled-wire Construction of a Non-crystalline Fractional Quantum Hall Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fractional quantum Hall effect, a paradigmatic topologically ordered state, has been realised in two-dimensional strongly correlated quantum gases and Chern bands of crystals. Here we construct a non-crystalline analogue by coupling quantum wires that are not periodically placed in real-space. Remarkably, the model remains solvable using bosonisation techniques. Due to the non-uniform couplings between the wires, the ground state has different degeneracy compared to the crystalline case. It displays a rich phenomenology of excitations, which can either behave like anyons confined to move in one dimension (lineons), anyons confined to hop between two wires (s-lineons), and anyonic excitations that are free to travel across the system. Both the ground state degeneracy and mutual statistics are directly determined by the real-space positions of the wires. By providing an analytically solvable model of a non-crystalline fractional quantum Hall effect, our work showcases that topological order can display richer phenomenology beyond crystals. More broadly, the non-uniform wire construction we develop can serve as a tool to explore richer many-body phenomenology in non-crystalline systems.</description>

      <title>Nature of the 1/3 Magnetization Plateau in Spin-1/2 Kagome Antiferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the origin of the 1/3 magnetization plateau in the $S=1/2$ kagome antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model using the variational Monte Carlo and exact diagonalization methods, to account for the recent experimental observations in YCu$_3$(OH)$_{6+x}$Br$_{3-x}$ and YCu$_3$(OD)$_{6+x}$Br$_{3-x}$. We identify three degenerate valence-bond-solid (VBS) states forming a $\sqrt{3} \times \sqrt{3}$ unit cell. These states exhibit David-star patterns in the spin moment distribution with only two fractional values $-1/3$ and $2/3$, and are related through translational transformations. While the spin correlations in these VBS states are found to be short-range, resembling a quantum spin liquid, we show that they have a vanishing topological entanglement entropy and thus are topologically trivial many-body states. Our theoretical results provide strong evidence that the 1/3 magnetization plateau observed in recent experiments arises from these $\sqrt{3} \times \sqrt{3}$ VBS states with fractional spin moments.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the physics of the spatially random coupling between a Fermi surface and a vector bosonic field in the presence of the magnetic field. We evaluated the propagators of the fermion and vector as well as the self energy and polarization and their dependence on the magnetic field. We also evaluated the temperature dependence of the Hall angle, no strange-metal behaviour is obtained, but the linear-$T$ resistivity is preserved under the magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Correlated insulating states in slow Dirac fermions on a honeycomb moir{\'e} superlattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strong Coulomb repulsion is predicted to open a many-body charge gap at the Dirac point of graphene, transforming the semimetal into a Mott insulator. However, this correlated insulating phase has remained inaccessible in pristine graphene, where a large Fermi velocity dominates the interaction effects. To overcome this limitation, we realize a honeycomb moir{\'e} superlattice in a twisted MoSe$_2$ homobilayer, where a graphene-like band structure forms with a Fermi velocity reduced by nearly two orders of magnitude. These slow moir{\'e} bands are folded from the valence band maximum at the $\Gamma$ valley of the extended Brillouin zone with negligible spin-orbital coupling, and can therefore simulate massless Dirac fermions in the strongly correlated regime with full SU(2) symmetry. By correlating Rydberg exciton sensing with moir{\'e} trions of different spatial characters, we detect a Mott gap at the Dirac point that persists up to 110 K. We further identify correlated insulating states at $\nu=-1$ with a weak ferromagnetic coupling as well as at several fractional fillings. Our results highlight the potential of studying a wide range of quantum many-body phenomena in twisted two-dimensional materials.</description>

      <title>Preparing the Gutzwiller wave function for attractive SU(3) fermions on a quantum computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We implement the Gutzwiller wave function for attractive SU(3) fermion systems on a quantum computer using a quantum-classical hybrid scheme based on the discrete Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation. In this approach, the nonunitary Gutzwiller operator is decomposed into a linear combination of unitaries constructed from two-qubit fermionic Givens rotation gates, whose rotation angles are dictated by the auxiliary fields. We develop and reformulate two complementary methods to perform the sum over these auxiliary fields. In the first method, the Gutzwiller wave function is probabilistically prepared on the register qubits by projectively postselecting the desired state via measurements of ancilla qubits. We analyze the success rate both analytically and numerically as a function of the Gutzwiller variational parameter $g$ for the Fermi-sea and BCS-like trial states at half filling. The success rate is found to decay exponentially for small $|g|$, but remains finite in the $|g|\to\infty$ limit, with increasing $|g|$. In the second method, we employ importance sampling to address the Gutzwiller variational problem, where the central objective is to estimate the expectation values of observables. We demonstrate the proposed scheme by calculating the energy and triple occupancy of the attractive SU(3) Hubbard model in the framework of digital quantum simulation. Moreover, we present experimental results obtained on a trapped-ion quantum computer for the two-site attractive SU(3) Hubbard model, showing good agreement with exact values within statistical errors.</description>

      <title>Terahertz time-domain spectroscopy of materials under high pressure in a diamond anvil cell</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the combination of a broadband terahertz time-domain spectroscopy system (0.1 - 8 THz), a diamond anvil cell capable of generating high pressure conditions of up to 10 GPa and a cryostat reaching temperatures as low as 10 K. This combination allows us to perform equilibrium and time-resolved THz spectroscopy measurements of a sample while continuously tuning its temperature and pressure conditions. In this work, the procedures and characterizations necessary to carry out such experiments in a tabletop setup are presented. Due to the large modifications of the terahertz beam as it goes through the diamond anvil cell (DAC), standard terahertz time-domain spectroscopy analysis procedures are no longer applicable. New methods to extract the pressure dependent material parameters are presented, both for samples homogeneously filling the DAC sample chamber as well as for bulk samples embedded in pressure media. Different pressure media are tested and evaluated using these new methods, and the obtained material parameters are compared to literature values. Time resolved measurements under pressure are demonstrated using an optical pump - THz probe scheme.</description>

      <title>Comment on "Superconductivity and Mott Physics in Organic Charge Transfer Materials"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Menke et al. recently claimed that superconductivity (SC) in the $\kappa$-phase organic charge-transfer solids (CTS) can be understood within the two-dimensional half-filled anisotropic triangular-lattice Hubbard model. Experimentally, $\kappa$-CTS are mostly but not always antiferromagnetic (AFM) at ambient pressure and SC appears under pressure. In apparent agreement with this observation, Menke et al. found AFM ground states for small $t/U$ and SC over a small region at the interface of AFM and Fermi liquid ground states with increasing $t/U$ at fixed $t'/t$, where $U$ is the Hubbard repulsion. Menke et al's computational results directly contradict those obtained using exact diagonalization and Path Integral Renormalization Group approaches. It is clearly of interest to determine the origin of this discrepancy, especially in view of the facts that (a) related arguments continue to persist in the context of cuprate SC superconductivity (which however involves doping), and (b) there exist CTS in which SC is not proximate to AFM, but is separated by an intermediate charge-disproportionated phase. Here we show that Menke et al's conclusion regarding SC is incorrect and originates from a flawed assumption.</description>

      <title>Disorder Enhanced Thermalization in Interacting Many-Particle System</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13876v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce an extension of the non-equilibrium dynamical mean field theory to incorporate the effects of static random disorder in the dynamics of a many-particle system by integrating out different disorder configurations resulting in an effective time-dependent density-density interaction. We use this method to study the non-equilibrium transient dynamics of a system described by the Fermi Anderson-Hubbard model following an interaction and disorder quench. The method recovers the solution of the disorder-free case for which the system exhibits qualitatively distinct dynamical behaviors in the weak-coupling (prethermalization) and strong-coupling regimes (collapse-and-revival oscillations). However, we find that weak random disorder promotes thermalization. In the weak coupling regime, the jump in the quasiparticle weight in the prethermal regime is suppressed by random disorder while in the strong-coupling regime, random disorder reduces the amplitude of the quasiparticle weight oscillations. These results highlight the importance of disorder in the dynamics of realistic many-particle systems.</description>

      <title>Emergent inductors in non-helical magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09253v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The emergent inductor, which is a concept of inductor employing quantum mechanics on helical magnets, has been studied actively from both theoretical and experimental aspects. Interestingly, finite inductance has been observed not only in spiral magnetic phases but also across various other magnetic phases although the underlying mechanism behind emergent inductance in non-helical magnets remains unresolved. In this study, we broaden the concept of emergent inductance to encompass non-helical magnets and establish a comprehensive formalism of the emergent inductance generated by magnetization dynamics. Using a diagrammatic approach, we derive the linear response of current density mediated by magnetization dynamics and formulate impedance and inductance for general magnetic materials. We reveal that the emergent inductance is composed of two distinct components, each contributing positively or negatively. Notably, the positive inductance arises from Ohmic dissipation including the effect of the emergent electric field (Berry phase in real space) while the negative inductance arises from the polarization of itinerant electrons (Berry curvature in $k$-$t$ space). We also apply the present method to quasi 1D models and show the numerical results of the inductance, the spin dynamics, the impedance, and the Q-value.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the interplay of generalized global symmetries in 2+1 dimensions in a lattice model that couples a $\mathbb{Z}_N$ clock model to a $\mathbb{Z}_N$ gauge theory via a topological interaction. This coupling binds the charges of one symmetry to the disorder operators of the other, and when these composite objects condense, they give rise to emergent generalized symmetries with mixed 't Hooft anomalies. These anomalies result in phases with ordinary symmetry breaking, topological order, and symmetry-protected topological (SPT) order, where the different types of order are not independent but intimately related. We further explore the gapped boundary states of these exotic phases and develop theories for phase transitions between them. Additionally, we extend this lattice model to incorporate a non-invertible global symmetry, which can be spontaneously broken, leading to domain walls with non-trivial fusion rules.</description>

      <title>Real-space chirality from crystalline topological defects in the Kitaev spin liquid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05272v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that certain crystalline topological defects in the gapless Kitaev honeycomb spin liquid model generate a chirality and Majorana fermion orbital magnetization that depends in a universal manner on their emergent flux. Focusing on 5-7 dislocations as building blocks, consisting of pentagon and heptagon disclinations, we identify the Kitaev bond label configurations that preserve solvability. By computing two formulations of local markers $M(r)$ we find that the 5 and 7 lattice defects generate a real-space contribution to Chern number and an associated Majorana fermion orbital magnetization proportional to $M(r)$. The sign of the $M(r)$ contribution from each 5/7 defect, i.e. its $q_M=\pm 1$ chirality, is determined by the defect Frank angle sign $F$ and emergent gauge field flux $W = \pm i$ through the expression $q_M = - i F W$. Remarkably, though lattice curvature and torsion can interplay with the surrounding gapless background to modify the profile of $M(r)$, its sign $q_M$ is determined locally, implying that crystalline defects in the Kitaev spin liquid can generate a robust and observable chirality.</description>

      <title>Double perovskite Ba2NaOsO6: Magnetic structure, Kramers doublet and x-ray magnetic dichroic signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04414v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Of all the oxides of osmium, Ba2NaOsO6 is the only one with a substantial ferromagnetic moment. A fresh theoretical study of bulk magnetic properties of the double perovskite is accomplished with an appropriate space group, and an atomic model of a Kramers doublet formed by the single osmium d-electron. It possesses symmetry demanded by the Wyckoff position assigned to Os in a canted ferromagnet. Whereupon, magnetic moments in the paramagnetic and magnetically ordered states of Ba2NaOsO6 are unified. Analytic x-ray magnetic dichroic signals (XMCD) at osmium L2 and L3 absorption edges are presented, and shown to agree with hitherto unexplained recent measurements.</description>

      <title>Incommensurate and commensurate antiferromagnetic orders in the kagome compound UV$_{6}$Sn$_{6}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12922v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on the synthesis of single crystals of a new kagome compound, UV$_6$Sn$_6$, and present the results of magnetization, electrical resistivity, heat capacity, X-ray and neutron diffraction experiments to characterize the structure and magnetic properties. UV$_6$Sn$_6$ crystallizes in a large supercell of the HfFe$_6$Ge$_6$ parent structure with an hexagonal symmetry in which some of the U atoms are shifted by $c/2$ in an ordered fashion. Below $T_{N1}\approx29$\,K, an incommensurate magnetic structure with a temperature-dependent wavevector $(0,0,k_z)$ is observed. Below $T_{N2}=23.5$\,K, the wavevector locks in to $(0,0,0.5)$ forming an antiferromagnetic ground state. The U moments align along the $c$ axis retaining a large magnetic anisotropy. These findings highlight the role of the $5f$ orbitals from uranium in this structural family in driving both magnetic ordering and structural modulation and distinguish UV$_6$Sn$_6$ from its lanthanide-based analogs.</description>

      <title>Design of altermagnetic models from spin clusters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09254v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Altermagnetism, a new class of collinear compensated magnetic phase, has garnered tremendous interest because of its rich physics and promising applications. Physical models and verified material candidates for altermagnetism remain limited. Here, we propose a general scheme to construct altermagnetic models, which explicitly exhibits the blend of ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic correlations in real space via the design of spin clusters, echoing the observation that properties of altermagnets resemble a mixture of ferromagnets and antiferromagnets. We show that in some of our models, the desired altermagnetic order can be spontaneously realized by electron-electron interaction in a broad range of the phase diagram. This development facilitates the study of fascinating physics of altermagnetism and sheds light on the discovery of new altermagnetic materials.</description>

      <title>Fluctuated lattice-driven charge density wave far above the condensation temperature in kagome superconductor KV$_3$Sb$_5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16620v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The kagome material AV$_3$Sb$_5$ exhibits multiple exotic orders, including an unconventional charge density wave (CDW). Elucidating the underlying mechanism behind the CDW transition is crucial for unraveling the complex interactions among these phases. However, the driving force of the CDW remains a topic of debate due to the intertwined interactions among the system's various excitations. Here we investigated the CDW transition in KV$_3$Sb$_5$ by isolating the ultrafast electronic phase transition using time- and angleresolved photoemission spectroscopy. An ultrafast electronic phase transition was observed at a critical photoexcitation fluence, F$_c$, without reduction in CDW lattice-distortion-induced band folding. This folded band persisted up to 150 K under equilibrium heating, well above the CDW condensation temperature of T$_c$ = 78 K. Notably, the pump-induced band shifts at F$_c$ were comparable to those caused by thermal effects at T$_c$. These findings suggest that in KV$_3$Sb$_5$, a fluctuating lattice-driven in-plane CDW emerges above 150 K, with out-of-plane electronic correlations leading to the $2\times2 \times 2$ CDW near T$_c$, offering key insights into the interplay between the electronic and structural dynamics in AV$_3$Sb$_5$.</description>

      <title>Fusion rule in conformal field theories and topological orders: A unified view of correspondence and (fractional) supersymmetry and their relation to topological holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05178v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The algebraic or ring structure of anyons called the fusion rule, is one of the most fundamental research interests in contemporary studies on topological orders (TOs) and the corresponding conformal field theories (CFTs). Recently, the algebraic structure realized as generalized symmetry, including non-invertible and categorical symmetry, captured attention in the fields. Such non-abelian anyonic objects appear in a bulk CFT or chiral CFT (CCFT), but it has been known that the construction of a CCFT contains theoretical difficulties in general. In this work, we study the structure of the fusion rule in $Z_{N}$ symmetric chiral and bulk conformal field theories and the corresponding TOs. We propose a nontrivial expression of subalgebra structure in the fusion rule of a bulk CFT. We name this subalgebra ``bulk semion". This corresponds to the fusion rule of the CCFTs and categorical symmetry of the TOs or symmetry topological field theory (SymTFT). This gives a bulk-edge correspondence based on the symmetry analysis and corresponds to an anyon algebraic expression of topological holography in the recent literature. The recent topological holography is expected to apply to systems in general space-time dimensions. Moreover, we give a concise way of unifying duality (or fractional supersymmetry), generalized or categorical symmetry, and Lagrangian subalgebra. Our method is potentially useful to formulate and study general TOs, fundamentally only from the data of bulk CFTs or vice versa, and gives a clue in understanding CCFT (or ancillary CFT more generally).</description>

      <title>How to accurately measure the mobility and viscosity of two-dimensional carriers?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07872v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two different methods of \emph{metrological} accuracy are proposed to determine the mobility and viscosity of ultra clean two-dimensional electron liquids. The experimental data analysis is based on the Gurzhi hydrodynamic model under no-slip boundary conditions without preliminary assumptions about carrier scattering times. The applicability of no-slip boundary conditions has been proven. A Hall bar with several conducting channels of different widths in a zero magnetic field and a sample with a single channel in a perpendicular field are considered. In both cases, it was possible to accurately isolate the ohmic part of the total measured resistance and, then find the exact mobility and viscosity of the charge liquid. The extracted e-e scattering time is extremely close to that obtained by other experimental group for transport measurements of superballistic point contact. At low temperatures the e-e scattering time demonstrates a stronger dependence compare to $1/T^{2}$ behavior predicted by Fermi liquid theory. We propose both methods as powerful tools for viscometry and finding the mobility of two-dimensional systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12377v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The transfer of quantum information between many-qubit states is a subject of fundamental importance in quantum science and technology. We consider entanglement swapping in critical quantum spin chains, where the entanglement between the two chains is induced solely by the Bell-state measurements. We employ a boundary conformal field theory (CFT) approach and describe the measurements as conformal boundary conditions in the replicated field theory. We show that the swapped entanglement exhibits a logarithmic scaling, whose coefficient takes a universal value determined by the scaling dimension of the boundary condition changing operator. We apply our framework to the critical spin-1/2 XXZ chain and determine the universal coefficient by the boundary CFT analysis. We also numerically verify these results by the tensor-network calculations. Possible experimental relevance to Rydberg atom arrays is briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Full distribution and large deviations of local observables in an exactly solvable current carrying steady state of a strongly driven XXZ chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10458v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current carrying steady states of interacting spin chains exhibit rich structures generated through an interplay of constraints from the Hamiltonian dynamics and those induced by the current. The \textit{XXZ} spin chain when coupled to maximally polarizing Lindblad terms (with opposite signs on either end) admits an exact solution for the steady state in a matrix product state (MPS) form. We use this exact solution to study the correlations and distributions of local spin observables in the nonequilibrium steady state. We present exact expressions for spin correlators, entropy per site and scaled cumulant generating functions (SCGF) for distributions of local observables in the \textit{XX} limit (Ising anisotropy $\Delta=0$). Further, we use the exact MPS solution in the $\Delta&gt;0$ regime, to calculate numerically exact entropy, correlations, as well as full distributions of spin observables in large systems. In systems where $\Delta$ is a cosine of rational multiple of $\pi$, we can numerically exactly estimate the large system limit of the SCGF and the large deviation/rate functions of local-$z$ magnetization. For these, we show that the deviations of the SCGF, calculated in finite systems, from the asymptotic large system size limit decay exponentially with system size; however, the decay rate is a discontinuous function of $\Delta$. The $x$ magnetization density shows a double peak structure at $\Delta\lesssim 1$, suggesting short-range ferromagnetic ordering in the $x$ direction similar to what was reported for the ground state of the XXZ chain.</description>

      <title>Bipartite Fluctuations and Charge Fractionalization in Quantum Wires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14410v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a quantum information method for measuring fractional charges in ballistic quantum wires generalizing bipartite fluctuations to the chiral quasiparticles in Luttinger liquids. This is equivalent to add charge and current fluctuations in a region of the wire. This reveals from an equilibrium approach the entangled nature of the two counter-propagating fractional charges associated to the same electron in the system. Bipartite fluctuations at equilibrium are characterized through a logarithmic scaling with distance encoding the entangled nature of these fractional charges in one-dimensional (1D) fluids. This approach also clarifies the physical meaning of the dephasing factor of electronic interferences in a ring geometry at zero temperature from a space-time correspondence in 1D. We formulate an analogy towards ground-state energetics. We show how bipartite current fluctuations represent a useful tool to locate quantum phase transitions associated to Mott physics. We address a spin chain equivalence and verify the fractional charges through an algorithm such as Density Matrix Renormalization Group. Adding a potential difference between the two sides (parties) of the wire, also we show how bipartite fluctuations can detect the presence of a bound state localized at the interface through the Jackiw-Rebbi model coexisting with fractional charges.</description>
