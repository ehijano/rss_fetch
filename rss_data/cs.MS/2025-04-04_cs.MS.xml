      <title>A Truncated Newton Method for Optimal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Developing a contemporary optimal transport (OT) solver requires navigating trade-offs among several critical requirements: GPU parallelization, scalability to high-dimensional problems, theoretical convergence guarantees, empirical performance in terms of precision versus runtime, and numerical stability in practice. With these challenges in mind, we introduce a specialized truncated Newton algorithm for entropic-regularized OT. In addition to proving that locally quadratic convergence is possible without assuming a Lipschitz Hessian, we provide strategies to maximally exploit the high rate of local convergence in practice. Our GPU-parallel algorithm exhibits exceptionally favorable runtime performance, achieving high precision orders of magnitude faster than many existing alternatives. This is evidenced by wall-clock time experiments on 24 problem sets (12 datasets $\times$ 2 cost functions). The scalability of the algorithm is showcased on an extremely large OT problem with $n \approx 10^6$, solved approximately under weak entopric regularization.</description>

      <title>Vectorised Parallel in Time methods for low-order discretizations with application to Porous Media problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High order methods have shown great potential to overcome performance issues of simulations of partial differential equations (PDEs) on modern hardware, still many users stick to low-order, matrixbased simulations, in particular in porous media applications. Heterogeneous coefficients and low regularity of the solution are reasons not to employ high order discretizations. We present a new approach for the simulation of instationary PDEs that allows to partially mitigate the performance problems. By reformulating the original problem we derive a parallel in time time integrator that increases the arithmetic intensity and introduces additional structure into the problem. By this it helps accelerate matrix-based simulations on modern hardware architectures. Based on a system for multiple time steps we will formulate a matrix equation that can be solved using vectorised solvers like Block Krylov methods. The structure of this approach makes it applicable for a wide range of linear and nonlinear problems. In our numerical experiments we present some first results for three different PDEs, a linear convection-diffusion equation, a nonlinear diffusion-reaction equation and a realistic example based on the Richards' equation.</description>
