      <title>Density-Functionalized QM/MM Delivers Chemical Accuracy For Solvated Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a reformulation of QM/MM as a fully quantum mechanical theory of interacting subsystems, all treated at the level of density functional theory (DFT). For the MM subsystem, which lacks orbitals, we assign an ad hoc electron density and apply orbital-free DFT functionals to describe its quantum properties. The interaction between the QM and MM subsystems is also treated using orbital-free density functionals, accounting for Coulomb interactions, exchange, correlation, and Pauli repulsion. Consistency across QM and MM subsystems is ensured by employing data-driven, many-body MM force fields that faithfully represent DFT functionals. Applications to water-solvated systems demonstrate that this approach achieves unprecedented, very rapid convergence to chemical accuracy as the size of the QM subsystem increases. We validate the method with several pilot studies, including water bulk, water clusters (prism hexamer and pentamers), solvated glucose, a palladium aqua ion, and a wet monolayer of MoS$_2$.</description>

      <title>SPARC-X-API: Versatile Python Interface for Real-space Density Functional Theory Calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Density Functional Theory (DFT) is the de facto workhorse for large-scale electronic structure calculations in chemistry and materials science. While plane-wave DFT implementations remain the most widely used, real-space DFT provides advantages in handling complex boundary conditions and scaling to very large systems by allowing for the efficient use of large-scale supercomputers and linear-scaling methods that circumvent the cubic scaling bottleneck. The SPARC-X project (https://github.com/SPARC-X) provides highly efficient and portable real-space DFT codes for a wide range of first principle applications, available in both Matlab (M-SPARC) and C/C++ (SPARC). The rapid growth of SPARC's feature set has created the need for a fully functional interface to drive SPARC in high-throughput calculations. Here we introduce SPARC-X-API, a Python package designed to bridge the SPARC-X project with broader computational frameworks. Built on the atomic simulation environment (ASE) standard, the SPARC-X-API allows users to handle SPARC file formats and run SPARC calculations through the same interface as with other ASE-compatible DFT packages. Beyond standard ASE capabilities, SPARC-X-API provides additional features including 1) support of SPARC-specific setups, including complex boundary conditions and unit conversion, 2) a JSON schema parsed from SPARC's documentation for parameter validation and compatibility checks, and 3) a comprehensive socket communication layer derived from the i-PI protocol facilitating message passing between low-level C code and the Python interface. The goal of the SPARC-X-API is to provide an easy-to-use interface for users with diverse needs and levels of expertise, allowing for minimal effort in adapting SPARC to existing computational workflows, while also supporting developers of advanced real-space methods.</description>

      <title>The Bigger the Better? Accurate Molecular Potential Energy Surfaces from Minimalist Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atomistic simulations are a powerful tool for studying the dynamics of molecules, proteins, and materials on wide time and length scales. Their reliability and predictiveness, however, depend directly on the accuracy of the underlying potential energy surface (PES). Guided by the principle of parsimony this work introduces KerNN, a combined kernel/neural network-based approach to represent molecular PESs. Compared to state-of-the-art neural network PESs the number of learnable parameters of KerNN is significantly reduced. This speeds up training and evaluation times by several orders of magnitude while retaining high prediction accuracy. Importantly, using kernels as the features also improves the extrapolation capabilities of KerNN far beyond the coverage provided by the training data which solves a general problem of NN-based PESs. KerNN applied to spectroscopy and reaction dynamics shows excellent performance on test set statistics and observables including vibrational bands computed from classical and quantum simulations.</description>

      <title>Integrating Machine Learning and Quantum Circuits for Proton Affinity Predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17856v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A key step in interpreting gas-phase ion mobility coupled with mass spectrometry (IM-MS) data for unknown structure prediction involves identifying the most favorable protonated structure. In the gas phase, the site of protonation is determined using proton affinity (PA) measurements. Currently, mass spectrometry and ab initio computation methods are widely used to evaluate PA; however, both methods are resource-intensive and time-consuming. Therefore, there is a critical need for efficient methods to estimate PA, enabling the rapid identification of the most favorable protonation site in complex organic molecules with multiple proton binding sites. In this work, we developed a fast and accurate method for PA prediction by using multiple descriptors in combination with machine learning (ML) models. Using a comprehensive set of 186 descriptors, our model demonstrated strong predictive performance, with an R2 of 0.96 and a MAE of 2.47kcal/mol, comparable to experimental uncertainty. Furthermore, we designed quantum circuits as feature encoders for a classical neural network. To evaluate the effectiveness of this hybrid quantum-classical model, we compared its performance with traditional ML models using a reduced feature set derived from the full set. The result showed that this hybrid model achieved consistent performance comparable to traditional ML models with the same reduced feature set on both a noiseless simulator and real quantum hardware, highlighting the potential of quantum machine learning for accurate and efficient PA predictions.</description>

      <title>A Size-Dependent Ideal Solution Model for Liquid-Solid Phase Equilibria Prediction in Aqueous Organic Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17968v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predictive synthesis of aqueous organic solutions with desired liquid-solid phase equilibria could drive progress in industrial chemistry, cryopreservation, and beyond, but is limited by the predictive power of current solution thermodynamics models. In particular, few analytical models enable accurate liquidus and eutectic prediction based only on bulk thermodynamic properties of the pure components, requiring instead either direct measurement or costly simulation of solution properties. In this work, we demonstrate that a simple modification to the canonical ideal solution theory accounting for the entopic effects of dissimilar molecule sizes can transform its predictive power, while offering new insight into the thermodynamic nature of aqueous organic solutions. Incorporating a Flory-style entropy of mixing term that includes both the mole and volume fractions of each component, we derive size-dependent equations for the ideal chemical potential and liquidus temperature, and use them to predict the binary phase diagrams of water and 10 organic solutes of varying sizes. We show that size-dependent prediction outperforms the ideal model in all cases, reducing average error in the predicted liquidus temperature by 59\%, eutectic temperature by 45\%, and eutectic composition by 43\%, as compared to experimental data. Furthermore, by retaining the ideal assumption that the enthalpy of mixing is zero, we demonstrate that for aqueous organic solutions, much of the deviation from ideality that is typically attributed to molecular interactions may in fact be explained by simple entropic size effects. These results suggest an underappreciated dominance of mixing entropy in these solutions, and provide a simple approach to predicting their phase equilibria.</description>

      <title>Disentangling morphology and conductance in amorphous graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18041v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Amorphous graphene or amorphous monolayer carbon (AMC) is a family of carbon films that exhibit a surprising sensitivity of electronic conductance to morphology. We combine deep learning-enhanced simulation techniques with percolation theory to analyze three morphologically distinct mesoscale AMCs. Our approach avoids the pitfalls of applying periodic boundary conditions to these fundamentally aperiodic systems or equating crystalline inclusions with conducting sites. We reproduce the previously reported dependence of charge conductance on morphology and explore the limitations of partial morphology descriptors in witnessing conductance properties. Finally, we perform crystallinity analysis of conductance networks along the electronic energy spectrum and show that they metamorphose from being localized on crystallites at band edges to localized on defects around the Fermi energy opening the possibility of control through gate voltage.</description>

      <title>Open-shell TADF: Quartet-derived luminescence with dark radicals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-spin states in organic molecules offer promising tuneability for quantum technologies. Photogenerated quartet excitons are an extensively studied platform, but their applications are limited by the absence of optical read-out via luminescence. Here we demonstrate a new class of synthetically accessible molecules with quartet-derived luminescence, formed by appending a non-luminescent TEMPO radical to Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence (TADF) chromophores previously used in OLEDs. The low singlet-triplet energy gap of the chromophore opens a luminescence channel from radical-triplet coupled states. We establish a set of design rules by tuning the energetics in a series of compounds based on a naphthalimide (NAI) core. We observe generation of quartet states and measure the strength of radical-triplet exchange (0.7 GHz). In DMAC-TEMPO, up to 72% of detected photons emerge after reverse intersystem crossing from the quartet state repopulates the state with singlet character. This design strategy does not rely on a luminescent radical to provide an emission pathway from the high-spin state. The large library of TADF chromophores promises a greater pallet of achievable emission colours.</description>

      <title>Highly-stable, eco-friendly and selective Cs2AgBiBr6 perovskite-based ozone sensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18228v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lead halide perovskites have attracted considerable attention as potential gas sensing elements due to their unique ability to detect and respond to an external stimulus with measurable electrical or optical signals. The distinctive characteristics of these materials lie in their ability to operate upon gas exposure at room temperature. However, the presence of lead (Pb) poses a serious challenge for their widespread application and commercialization, owing to its toxicity. To address this issue, lead-free Cs2AgBiBr6 double perovskite is explored as a promising alternative sensing element for room temperature gas detection. This sensor can be regarded as eco-friendly for the following reasons: it does not contain Pb; it is synthesized at room temperature without using strong organic solvents; and it operates and recovers at room temperature without heating or UV irradiation and with a very low input voltage (0.1V), thus reducing overall energy consumption. The influence of the perovskite morphology on the ozone (O3) sensing performance is investigated, as well as the sensing stability under varying conditions of time, humidity, and temperature. Notably, the sensors' exceptional selectivity for O3 over other gases and the interaction between the gases and the perovskite surface is confirmed through experimental and first-principles calculations.</description>

      <title>Advancing Natural Orbital Functional Calculations Through Deep Learning-Inspired Techniques for Large-Scale Strongly Correlated Electron Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Natural orbital functional (NOF) theory offers a promising approach for studying strongly correlated systems at an affordable computational cost, with an accuracy comparable to highly demanding wavefunction-based methods. However, its widespread adoption in cases involving a large number of correlated electrons has been limited by the extensive iterations required for convergence. In this work, we present a disruptive approach that embeds the techniques used for optimization in deep learning within the NOF calculation, representing a substantial advance in the scale of accessible systems. The revamped procedure is based on the adaptive momentum technique for orbital optimization, alternated with the optimization of the occupation numbers, significantly improving the computational feasibility of challenging calculations. We demonstrate this with three examples that involve a large number of electrons: (i) the symmetric dissociation of a large hydrogen cluster, (ii) an analysis of occupancies distribution in fullerenes, and (iii) a study of the singlet-triplet energy gap in linear acenes. Notably, the first example serves as an ideal model for a strongly correlated Mott insulator, featuring 1000 electrons and illustrating a metal-to-insulator transition, surpassing the largest calculations of strongly correlated electrons reported to date. We anticipate that this work will enable the practical application of NOFs to increasingly complex and intriguing systems, leveraging the method's inherent scalability and accuracy.</description>

Abstract: Molecular chirality has traditionally been viewed as a binary property where a molecule is classified as either chiral or achiral, yet in the recent decades mathematical methods for quantifying chirality have been explored. Here we use toy molecular systems to systematically compare the performance of two state of the art chirality measures (1) the Continuous Chirality Measure (CCM) and (2) the Chirality Characteristic ($\chi$). We find that both methods exhibit qualitatively similar behavior when applied to simple molecular systems such as a four-site molecule or the polymer double-helix, but we show that the CCM may be more suitable for evaluating the chirality of arbitrary molecules or abstract structures such as normal vibrational modes. We discuss a range of considerations for applying these methods to molecular systems in general, and we provide links to user-friendly codes for both methods. We aim this paper to serve as a concise resource for scientists attempting to familiarize themselves with these chirality measures or attempting to implement chirality measures in their own work.</description>

      <title>Investigating the hyperparameter space of deep neural network models for reaction coordinates: Revisiting the solvent coordinate in alanine dipeptide isomerization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02132v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Identifying reaction coordinates (RCs) from many collective variable candidates have been of great challenge in understanding reaction mechanisms in complex systems. Machine learning approaches, especially the deep neural network (DNN), have become a powerful tool in this field, and have actively been applied. On the other hand, the structure of the DNN model is highly flexible, and the hyperparameters that determine the structure is often selected intuitively or in a highly non-trivial and tedious manner. Furthermore, how the choice of hyperparameter affects the quality of the DNN model remains obscure. In this work, we explore the hyperparameter space by developing the hyperparameter tuning approach for the DNN model in RC optimization, and investigate how the choice of parameter sets affect the quality of the RC. The DNN model is constructed from a large number of collective variables to predict the changes of committor along the RC by minimizing the cross-entropy function, and the hyperparameters are determined in an automatic manner using the Bayesian optimization method. The approach is applied to study the isomerization of alanine dipeptide in vacuum and in water, and the features that characterize the RC are extracted using the explainable AI (XAI) tools. The results show that the DNN models with notably different structures can describe the RC with similar accuracy. Furthermore, despite the difference in the hyperparameters, the features analyzed by XAI are highly similar, indicating that the hyperparameter space is multimodal. By studying the reaction in water, it is found that the electrostatic potential from the solvent to the hydrogen (H${}_{18}$), in addition to the dihedral angles $\phi$ and $\theta$, plays an important role in characterizing the RC. The DNN model thus effectively accounts for the torque character suggested previously.</description>

      <title>Self-consistent approach to the dynamics of excitation energy transfer in multichromophoric systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02496v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Computationally tractable and reliable, albeit approximate, methods for studying exciton transport in molecular aggregates immersed in structured bosonic environments have been actively developed. Going beyond the lowest-order (Born) approximation for the memory kernel of the quantum master equation typically results in complicated and possibly divergent expressions. Starting from the memory kernel in the Born approximation, and recognizing the quantum master equation as the Dyson equation of Green's functions theory, we formulate the self-consistent Born approximation to resum the memory-kernel perturbation series in powers of the exciton--environment interaction. Our formulation is in the Liouville space and frequency domain and handles arbitrary exciton--environment spectral densities. In a molecular dimer coupled to an overdamped oscillator environment, we conclude that the self-consistent cycle significantly improves the Born-approximation energy-transfer dynamics. The dynamics in the self-consistent Born approximation agree well with the solutions of hierarchical equations of motion over a wide range of parameters, including the most challenging regimes of strong exciton--environment interactions, slow environments, and low temperatures. This is rationalized by the analytical considerations of coherence-dephasing dynamics in the pure-dephasing model. We find that the self-consistent Born approximation is good (poor) at describing energy transfer modulated by an underdamped vibration resonant (off-resonant) with the exciton energy gap. Nevertheless, it reasonably describes exciton dynamics in the seven-site model of the Fenna--Matthews--Olson complex in a realistic environment comprising both an overdamped continuum and underdamped vibrations.</description>

      <title>Nonadiabatic Quantum Dynamics of Molecules Scattering from Metal Surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05142v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nonadiabatic coupling between electrons and molecular motion at metal surfaces leads to energy dissipation and dynamical steering effects during chemical surface dynamics. We present a theoretical approach to the scattering of molecules from metal surfaces that incorporates all nonadiabatic and quantum nuclear effects due to the coupling of the molecular degrees of freedom to the electrons in the metal. This is achieved with the hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM) approach combined with a matrix product state representation in twin space. The method is applied to the scattering of nitric oxide from Au(111), for which strongly nonadiabatic energy loss during scattering has been experimentally observed, thus presenting a significant theoretical challenge. Since the HEOM approach treats the molecule-surface coupling exactly, it captures the interplay between nonadiabatic and quantum nuclear effects. Finally, the data obtained by the HEOM approach is used as a rigorous benchmark to assess various mixed quantum-classical methods, from which we derive insights into the mechanisms of energy dissipation and the suitable working regimes of each method.</description>

      <title>Molecular-Resolution Imaging of Ice Crystallized from Liquid Water</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00915v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite the ubiquity of ice, a molecular-resolution image of ice crystallized from liquid water or the resulting defect structure has never been obtained. Here, we report the stabilization and angstrom-resolution electron imaging of ice Ih crystallized from liquid water by developing cryogenic liquid-cell transmission electron microscopy (CRYOLIC-TEM). We combine lattice mapping with molecular dynamics simulations to reveal that ice formation is highly tolerant to nanoscale defects such as misoriented subdomains and trapped gas bubbles, which are stabilized by molecular-scale structural motifs. Importantly, bubble surfaces adopt low-energy nanofacets and create negligible strain fields in the surrounding crystal. These bubbles can dynamically nucleate, grow, migrate, dissolve, and coalesce under electron irradiation and be monitored in situ near a steady state. This work opens the door to understanding water crystallization behaviors at an unprecedented spatial resolution.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Green-Kubo relation for friction in nanofluidics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07134v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A central aim of statistical mechanics is to establish connections between a system's microscopic fluctuations and its macroscopic response to a perturbation. For non-equilibrium transport properties, this amounts to establishing Green-Kubo (GK) relationships. In hydrodynamics, relating such GK expressions for liquid-solid friction to macroscopic slip boundary conditions has remained a long-standing problem due to two challenges: (i) The GK running integral of the force autocorrelation function decays to zero rather than reaching a well-defined plateau value; and (ii) debates persist on whether such a transport coefficient measures an intrinsic interfacial friction or an effective friction in the system. Inspired by ideas from the coarse-graining community, we derive a GK relation for liquid-solid friction where the force autocorrelation is sampled with a constraint of momentum conservation in the liquid. Our expression does not suffer from the "plateau problem" and unambiguously measures an effective friction coefficient, in an analogous manner to Stokes' law. We further establish a link between the derived friction coefficient and the hydrodynamic slip length, enabling a straightforward assessment of continuum hydrodynamics across length scales. We find that continuum hydrodynamics describes the simulation results quantitatively for confinement length scales all the way down to 1 nm. Our approach amounts to a straightforward modification to the present standard method of quantifying interfacial friction from molecular simulations, making possible a sensible comparison between surfaces of vastly different slippage.</description>

      <title>Ground state energy is not always convex in the number of electrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08632v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide the first counterexample showing that the ground state energy of electrons in an external Coulomb potential is not always a convex function of the number of electrons. This convexity has been conjectured for decades and plays an important role in quantum chemistry. Our counterexample involves six nuclei with small fractional charges placed far apart. The ground state energy of 3 electrons is shown to be higher than the average of the energies for 2 and 4 electrons. We also show that the nuclei can bind 2 or 4 electrons, but not 3. This article raises the question of whether the energy convexity really holds for all possible molecules (with nuclei of integer charge).</description>

      <title>GPU-Accelerated Solution of the Bethe-Salpeter Equation for Large and Heterogeneous Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15116v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a massively parallel, GPU-accelerated implementation of the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) for the calculation of the vertical excitation energies (VEEs) and optical absorption spectra of condensed and molecular systems, starting from single-particle eigenvalues and eigenvectors obtained with density functional theory. The algorithms adopted here circumvent the slowly converging sums over empty and occupied states and the inversion of large dielectric matrices, through a density matrix perturbation theory approach and a low-rank decomposition of the screened Coulomb interaction, respectively. Further computational savings are achieved by exploiting the nearsightedness of the density matrix of semiconductors and insulators to reduce the number of screened Coulomb integrals. We scale our calculations to thousands of GPUs with a hierarchical loop and data distribution strategy. The efficacy of our method is demonstrated by computing the VEEs of several spin defects in wide-band-gap materials, showing that supercells with up to 1000 atoms are necessary to obtain converged results. We discuss the validity of the common approximation that solves the BSE with truncated sums over empty and occupied states. We then apply our GW-BSE implementation to a diamond lattice with 1727 atoms to study the symmetry breaking of triplet states caused by the interaction of a point defect with an extended line defect.</description>

      <title>Unconventional and Powerful Ion Sources for Solid-State Ion Exchange, Cu2SO4 and Cu3PO4: Exemplified by Synthesis of Metastable \beta-CuGaO2 from Stable \beta-LiGaO2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05310v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study introduces a new method for synthesizing Cu+-containing metastable phases through ion exchange. Traditionally, CuCl has been used as a Cu+ ion source for solid-state ion exchanges; however, its thermodynamic driving force is often insufficient for complete ion exchange with Li+-containing precursors. First-principles calculations have identified Cu2SO4 and Cu3PO4 as more powerful alternatives, providing a higher driving force than CuCl. It has been experimentally demon-strated that these ion sources can open up new reaction pathways through experimental ion exchanges, such as from \beta-LiGaO2 to \beta-CuGaO2, which were previously unattainable. An important perspective provided by this study is that the poten-tial of such basic compounds to act as powerful ion sources has been overlooked, and that they were identified through straightforward first-principles calculations. This work presents the initial strategic design of an ion exchange reaction by exploring suitable ion sources, thereby expanding the potential for synthesizing metastable materials.</description>

      <title>Quantum dynamics of photophysical aggregates in conjugated polymers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14675v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Photophysical aggregates are ubiquitous in many solid-state microstructures adopted by conjugated polymers, in which $\pi$ electrons interact with those in other polymer chains or those in other chromophores along the chain. These interactions fundamentally define the electronic and optical properties of the polymer film. While valuable insight can be gained from linear excitation and photoluminescence spectra, nonlinear coherent excitation spectral lineshapes provide intricate understanding on the electronic couplings that define the aggregate and their fluctuations. Here, we discuss the coherent two-dimensional excitation lineshape of a model hairy-rod conjugated polymer. At zero population waiting time, we find a $\pi/2$ phase shift between the 0-0 and 0-1 vibronic peaks in the real and imaginary components of the complex coherent spectrum, as well as a dynamic phase rotation with population waiting time over timescales that are longer than the optical dephasing time. We conjecture that these are markers of relaxation of the photophysical aggregate down the tight manifold of the exciton band. These results highlight the potential for coherent spectroscopy via analysis of the complex spectral lineshape to become a key tool to develop structure-property relationships in complex functional materials.</description>
