      <title>On Enforcing Satisfiable, Coherent, and Minimal Sets of Dyadic Relation Constraints in MatBase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper rigorously and concisely defines, in the context of our (Elementary) Mathematical Data Model ((E)MDM), the mathematical concepts of dyadic relation, reflexivity, irreflexivity, symmetry, asymmetry, transitivity, intransitivity, Euclideanity, inEuclideanity, equivalence, acyclicity, connectivity, the properties that relate them, and the corresponding corollaries on the coherence and minimality of sets made of such dyadic relation properties viewed as database constraints. Its main contribution is the pseudocode algorithm used by MatBase, our intelligent database management system prototype based on both (E)MDM, the relational, and the entity-relationship data models, for enforcing dyadic relation constraint sets. We proved that this algorithm guarantees the satisfiability, coherence, and minimality of such sets, while being very fast, solid, complete, and minimal. In the sequel, we also presented the relevant MatBase user interface as well as the tables of its metacatalog used by this algorithm.</description>

      <title>Case ID detection based on time series data -- the mining use case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Process mining gains increasing popularity in business process analysis, also in heavy industry. It requires a specific data format called an event log, with the basic structure including a case identifier (case ID), activity (event) name, and timestamp. In the case of industrial processes, data is very often provided by a monitoring system as time series of low level sensor readings. This data cannot be directly used for process mining since there is no explicit marking of activities in the event log, and sometimes, case ID is not provided. We propose a novel rule-based algorithm for identification patterns, based on the identification of significant changes in short-term mean values of selected variable to detect case ID. We present our solution on the mining use case. We compare computed results (identified patterns) with expert labels of the same dataset. Experiments show that the developed algorithm in the most of the cases correctly detects IDs in datasets with and without outliers reaching F1 score values: 96.8% and 97% respectively. We also evaluate our algorithm on dataset from manufacturing domain reaching value 92.6% for F1 score.</description>

      <title>Aleph Filter: To Infinity in Constant Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04703v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Filter data structures are widely used in various areas of computer science to answer approximate set-membership queries. In many applications, the data grows dynamically, requiring their filters to expand along with the data. However, existing methods for expanding filters cannot maintain stable performance, memory footprint, and false positive rate (FPR) simultaneously. We address this problem with Aleph Filter, which makes the following contributions. (1) It supports all operations (insertions, queries, deletes, etc.) in constant time, no matter how much the data grows. (2) Given an estimate of how much the data will ultimately grow, Aleph Filter provides a memory vs. FPR trade-offs on par with static filters.</description>

      <title>H-STAR: LLM-driven Hybrid SQL-Text Adaptive Reasoning on Tables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05952v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tabular reasoning involves interpreting natural language queries about tabular data, which presents a unique challenge of combining language understanding with structured data analysis. Existing methods employ either textual reasoning, which excels in semantic interpretation but struggles with mathematical operations, or symbolic reasoning, which handles computations well but lacks semantic understanding. This paper introduces a novel algorithm H-STAR that integrates both symbolic and semantic (textual) approaches in a two-stage process to address these limitations. H-STAR employs: (1) step-wise table extraction using `multi-view' column retrieval followed by row extraction, and (2) adaptive reasoning that adapts reasoning strategies based on question types, utilizing semantic reasoning for direct lookup and complex lexical queries while augmenting textual reasoning with symbolic reasoning support for quantitative and logical tasks. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that H-STAR significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods across three tabular question-answering (QA) and fact-verification datasets, underscoring its effectiveness and efficiency.</description>

      <title>ThreatKG: An AI-Powered System for Automated Open-Source Cyber Threat Intelligence Gathering and Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.10388v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Open-source cyber threat intelligence (OSCTI) has become essential for keeping up with the rapidly changing threat landscape. However, current OSCTI gathering and management solutions mainly focus on structured Indicators of Compromise (IOC) feeds, which are low-level and isolated, providing only a narrow view of potential threats. Meanwhile, the extensive and interconnected knowledge found in the unstructured text of numerous OSCTI reports (e.g., security articles, threat reports) available publicly is still largely underexplored.
  To bridge the gap, we propose ThreatKG, an automated system for OSCTI gathering and management. ThreatKG efficiently collects a large number of OSCTI reports from multiple sources, leverages specialized AI-based techniques to extract high-quality knowledge about various threat entities and their relationships, and constructs and continuously updates a threat knowledge graph by integrating new OSCTI data. ThreatKG features a modular and extensible design, allowing for the addition of components to accommodate diverse OSCTI report structures and knowledge types. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate ThreatKG's practical effectiveness in enhancing threat knowledge gathering and management.</description>
