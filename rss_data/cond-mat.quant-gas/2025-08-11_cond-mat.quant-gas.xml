      <title>Quantum criticality and nonequilibrium dynamics on a Lieb lattice of Rydberg atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutral-atom quantum simulators offer a promising approach to the exploration of strongly interacting many-body systems, with applications spanning condensed matter, statistical mechanics, and high-energy physics. Through a combination of quantum experiments, numerical calculations, and analytical methods, we demonstrate a rich set of phenomena accessible on such quantum simulators by studying an array of Rydberg atoms placed on the Lieb lattice. First, we map out the ground states and phase diagram of the system, identifying a range of density-wave-ordered phases,and find excellent agreement between theory and experiment. Allowing for local control of the detuning field thereafter, we discover a quantum analog of the classical liquid--vapor transition and probe its underlying hysteretic dynamics. Furthermore, we study out-of-equilibrium quantum quenches and observe anomalously slow relaxation dynamics arising from kinetic constraints. These results highlight how geometric control offered by neutral-atom simulators can extend the frontiers of programmable quantum matter, enabling access to complex phases, metastability, and thermalization dynamics in many-body quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Bogoliubov analysis of Higgs mode in trapped Fermi superfluids with spatial inhomogeneity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Higgs mode is a key component in the spontaneous breaking of a continuous symmetry along with the Nambu-Goldstone mode, and has been studied extensively for homogeneous systems. We consider it for inhomogeneous systems, using the superfluid of harmonically trapped ultracold Fermi atomic gas. The Fermionic field operators are expanded in a complete set of wave functions corresponding to inhomogeneous situation. Within the Hatree-Fock approximation, we derive integral equations from the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations, which lead to the frequencies of the collective modes, including the Higgs and Nambu-Goldstone modes. The results show that the frequency of the Higgs mode equals twice the absolute value of the order parameter at the center of trap. This feature is robust against variations in the interaction strength, trap potential, and temperature. These results are consistent with previous theoretical and experimental studies.</description>

      <title>Topological bound states in a lattice of rings with nearest-neighbour interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study interaction-induced bound states in a system of ultracold bosons loaded into the states with orbital angular momentum in a one-dimensional staggered lattice of rings. We consider the hard-core limit and strong nearest-neighbour interactions such that two particles in next neighbouring sites are bound. Focusing on the manifold of such bound states, we have derived the corresponding effective model for doublons. With orbital angular momentum $l=1$, the original physical system is described as a Creutz ladder by using the circulations as a synthetic dimension, and the effective model obtained consists of two Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) chains and two Bose-Hubbard chains. Therefore, the system can exhibit topologically protected edge states. In a structure that alternates $l=1$ and $l=0$ states, the original system can be mapped to a diamond chain. In this case, the effective doublon model corresponds to a Creutz ladder with extra vertical hoppings between legs and can be mapped to two SSH chains if all the couplings in the original system are equal. Tuning spatially the amplitude of the couplings destroys the inversion symmetry of these SSH chains, but enables the appearance of multiple flat bands.</description>

      <title>Magnetization-induced reordering of ground states phase diagram in a two-component Bose-Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the influence of non-zero magnetization on the ground-state phase diagram of the two-component Bose-Hubbard model. Employing a mean-field theoretical framework, both analytically and numerically, we demonstrate that positions and sizes of specific phases on the diagram are magnetization dependent. In particular, non-zero magnetization introduces different Mott insulator phase boundaries for each of the two components. This effect leads to the emergence of a hybrid phase characterized by the coexistence of superfluid in one of the components and Mott insulator in the another one. Our findings highlight the important role of a conserved quantities, which is magnetization here, in reshaping the phase landscape, significantly influencing the stability and emergence of distinct quantum phases.</description>

      <title>Fate of an impurity strongly interacting with a thermal Bose gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We spectroscopically study mobile impurities immersed in a homogeneous bosonic bath (a box-trapped Bose gas), varying the bath temperature and the strength of impurity-bath interactions. We compare our results to those for a quasipure Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), and find that for strong impurity-bath interactions, the spectra narrow with increasing temperature, while the impurity energy shift is suppressed. Near the critical temperature for condensation, many-body effects still play an important role, and only for a nondegenerate bath, the system approaches the classical Boltzmann-gas behavior. The key spectral features are reproduced within the theory of an ideal Bose polaron.</description>

      <title>Role of Plaquette Term in Genuine $2+1$D String Dynamics on Quantum Simulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the advent of quantum simulators of $2+1$D lattice gauge theories (LGTs), a fundamental open question is under what circumstances the observed physics is genuinely $2+1$D rather than effectively $1+1$D. Here, we address this question in the ongoing strong effort to quantum-simulate string dynamics in $2+1$D LGTs on state-of-the-art quantum hardware. Through tensor network simulations and analytic derivations, we show that the plaquette term, which represents a magnetic field and only emerges in $d&gt;1$ spatial dimensions, plays a crucial role in \textit{genuine} $2+1$D string dynamics deep in the confined regime. In its absence and for minimal-length (Manhattan-distance) strings, we demonstrate how string breaking, although on a lattice in $d=2$ spatial dimensions, can be effectively mapped to a $1+1$D dynamical process independently of lattice geometry. Our findings not only answer the question of what qualifies as genuine $2+1$D string dynamics, but also serve as a clear guide for future quantum simulation experiments of $2+1$D LGTs.</description>

      <title>Generalized Holstein-Primakoff mapping and $1/N$ expansion of collective spin systems undergoing single particle dissipation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05751v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a generalization of the Schwinger boson and Holstein-Primakoff transformations that is applicable to ensembles of $N$ spin $1/2$'s with weak permutational symmetry. These generalized mappings are constructed by introducing two independent bosonic variables that describe fluctuations parallel and transverse to the collective Bloch vector built out of the original spin $1/2$'s. Using this representation, we develop a systematic $1/N$ expansion and write down explicitly leading and next-to-leading order terms. We then illustrate how to apply these techniques using four example systems: (i) an ensemble of atoms undergoing spontaneous emission, incoherent pumping and single particle dephasing; (ii) a superradiant laser above and in the vicinity of the upper lasing transition; (iii) the all-to-all transverse field Ising model subject to incoherent pumping in the vicinity of its ordering phase transition; and (iv) the Dicke model at finite temperature both away and in the vicinity of its thermal phase transition. Thus, these mappings provide a common, Bloch-sphere based, geometrical description of all-to-all systems subject to single particle dissipation or at finite temperature, including their phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Shortcuts to adiabaticity with a quantum control field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06304v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum adiabatic dynamics is the crucial element of adiabatic quantum computing and quantum annealing. Shortcuts to adiabaticity enable acceleration of the computational time by suppressing unwanted non-adiabatic processes with designed classical fields. Here, we consider quantum state transfer in the Landau-Zener model, which exemplifies the key elements of quantum adiabatic dynamics. We argue that non-adiabatic transitions can be suppressed by autonomous quantum dynamics, which involves coupling the Landau-Zener qubit to a second quantum system. By tuning the coupling strength, the composite quantum dynamics can reduce the probability of unwanted processes by more than two orders of magnitude. This is a prime example of control where the quantum properties of the control fields are key for implementing shortcuts to adiabaticity.</description>

      <title>Nonreciprocal and Geometric Frustration in Dissipative Quantum Spins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonreciprocal interactions often create conflicting dynamical objectives that cannot be simultaneously satisfied, leading to nonreciprocal frustration. On the other hand, geometric frustration arises when conflicting static objectives in energy minimization cannot be satisfied. In this work, we show that nonreciprocal interaction among three collective quantum spins, mediated by a damped cavity, induces not only nonreciprocal frustration, intrinsic to nonreciprocity, but also geometric frustration with a remarkable robustness against disorder. It therefore ensures that the accidental degeneracy for steady states remains intact even when the system is perturbed away from a fine-tuned point of enhanced symmetry, in sharp contrast to the equilibrium case. Leveraging this finding, we identify a nonreciprocal phase transition driven by both geometric and nonreciprocal frustration. It gives rise to a time-dependent state, which shows a chiral dynamics along a geometry shaped by the geometric frustration and dynamically restores the broken discrete symmetries. Moreover, it constitutes a time-crystalline order, with multiple harmonics set by an emergent time scale that exhibits critical slowing down. Our predictions have important physical implications for a three-component spinor BEC-cavity system, which manifest as a geometric frustration in the structural phase transition and chiral dynamics of the frustrated self-organized BECs. We demonstrate the feasibility of experimental observation despite the presence of disorder in the spin-cavity coupling strengths.</description>

      <title>Simulating Floquet non-Abelian topological insulator with photonic quantum walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Floquet non-Abelian topological phases emerge in periodically driven systems and exhibit properties that are absent in their Abelian or static counterparts. Dubbed the Floquet non-Abelian topological insulators (FNATIs), they are characterized by non-Abelian topological charges and feature multifold bulk-boundary correspondence, making their experimental observation challenging. Here we simulate the FNATI using a higher-dimensional photonic quantum walk and develop dynamic measurement schemes to demonstrate key signatures of the FNATI. Importantly, combining a direct bulk-dynamic detection for the underlying quaternion topological charge, and a spatially-resolved injection spectroscopy for the edge states, we experimentally establish the multifold bulk-boundary correspondence, and, in particular, identify the anomalous non-Abelian phase where edge states appear in all band gaps, despite the presence of a trivial topological charge. Our experiment marks the first experimental characterization of the FNATI, providing general insight into the non-Abelian topological phases.</description>
