      <title>Computational strategies for cross-species knowledge transfer and translational biomedicine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Research organisms provide invaluable insights into human biology and diseases, serving as essential tools for functional experiments, disease modeling, and drug testing. However, evolutionary divergence between humans and research organisms hinders effective knowledge transfer across species. Here, we review state-of-the-art methods for computationally transferring knowledge across species, primarily focusing on methods that utilize transcriptome data and/or molecular networks. We introduce the term "agnology" to describe the functional equivalence of molecular components regardless of evolutionary origin, as this concept is becoming pervasive in integrative data-driven models where the role of evolutionary origin can become unclear. Our review addresses four key areas of information and knowledge transfer across species: (1) transferring disease and gene annotation knowledge, (2) identifying agnologous molecular components, (3) inferring equivalent perturbed genes or gene sets, and (4) identifying agnologous cell types. We conclude with an outlook on future directions and several key challenges that remain in cross-species knowledge transfer.</description>

      <title>Quantum Annealing for Enhanced Feature Selection in Single-Cell RNA Sequencing Data Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Feature selection is vital for identifying relevant variables in classification and regression models, especially in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data analysis. Traditional methods like LASSO often struggle with the nonlinearities and multicollinearities in scRNA-seq data due to complex gene expression and extensive gene interactions. Quantum annealing, a form of quantum computing, offers a promising solution. In this study, we apply quantum annealing-empowered quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) for feature selection in scRNA-seq data. Using data from a human cell differentiation system, we show that QUBO identifies genes with nonlinear expression patterns related to differentiation time, many of which play roles in the differentiation process. In contrast, LASSO tends to select genes with more linear expression changes. Our findings suggest that the QUBO method, powered by quantum annealing, can reveal complex gene expression patterns that traditional methods might overlook, enhancing scRNA-seq data analysis and interpretation.</description>

      <title>Predicting the genetic component of gene expression using gene regulatory networks</title>

Abstract: Gene expression prediction plays a vital role in transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS), which seek to establish associations between tissue gene expression and complex traits. Traditional models rely on genetic variants in close genomic proximity to the gene of interest to predict the genetic component of gene expression. In this study, we propose a novel approach incorporating distal genetic variants acting through gene regulatory networks (GRNs) into gene expression prediction models, in line with the omnigenic model of complex trait inheritance. Using causal and coexpression GRNs reconstructed from genomic and transcriptomic data and modeling the data as a Bayesian network jointly over genetic variants and genes, inference of gene expression from observed genotypic data is achieved through a two-step process. Initially, the expression level of each gene in the network is predicted using its local genetic variants. The residuals, calculated as the differences between the observed and predicted expression levels, are then modeled using the genotype information of parent and/or grandparent nodes in the GRN. The final predicted expression level of the gene is obtained by summing the predictions from the local variants model and the residual model, effectively incorporating both local and distal genetic influences. Using various regularized regression techniques for parameter estimation, we found that GRN-based gene expression prediction outperformed the traditional local-variant approach on simulated data from the DREAM5 Systems Genetics Challenge and real data from the Geuvadis study and an eQTL mapping study in yeast. This study provides important insights into the challenge of gene expression prediction for TWAS. It reaffirms the importance of GRNs for understanding the genetic effects on gene expression and complex traits more generally.</description>

      <title>Personalized graph feature-based multi-omics data integration for cancer subtype identification</title>

Abstract: Cancer is a highly heterogeneous disease with significant variability in molecular features and clinical outcomes, making diagnosis and treatment challenging. In recent years, high-throughput omic technologies have facilitated the discovery of mechanisms underlying various cancer subtypes by providing diverse omics data, such as gene expression, DNA methylation, and miRNA expression. However, the complexity and heterogeneity of multi-omics data present significant challenges for their integration in exploring cancer subtypes. Various methods have been proposed to address these challenges. In this paper, we propose a novel and straightforward approach for identifying cancer subtypes by integrating patient-specific subnetworks features from different omics data. We construct patient-specific induced subnetwork using a random walk with restart algorithm from patient similarity networks (PSNs) and compute nine structural properties that capture essential network topology. These features are integrated across the three omic datasets to form comprehensive patient profiles. K-means clustering is then applied for cancer subtype identification. We evaluate our approach on five cancer datasets, including breast invasive carcinoma, colon adenocarcinoma, glioblastoma multiforme, kidney renal clear cell carcinoma, and lung squamous cell carcinoma, for three different omic data types. The evaluation shows that our method produces promising and effective results, demonstrating competitive or superior performance compared to existing methods and underscoring its potential for advancing personalized cancer diagnosis and treatment.</description>
