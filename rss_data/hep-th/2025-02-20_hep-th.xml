      <title>Wormholes in finite cutoff JT gravity: A study of baby universes and (Krylov) complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, as an application of the `Complexity = Volume' proposal, we calculate the growth of the interior of a black hole at late times for finite cutoff JT gravity. Due to this integrable, irrelevant deformation, the spectral properties are modified non-trivially. The Einstein-Rosen Bridge (ERB) length saturates faster than pure JT gravity. We comment on the possible connection between Krylov Complexity and ERB length for deformed theory. Apart from this, we calculate the emission probability of baby universes for the deformed theory and make remarks on its implications for the ramp of the Spectral Form Factor. Finally, we compute the correction to the volume of the moduli space due to the non-perturbative change of the spectral curve because of the finite cutoff at the boundary.</description>

      <title>Poisson Vertex Algebras and Three-Dimensional Gauge Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a mixed holomorphic-topological gauge theory in three dimensions associated to a (freely generated) Poisson vertex algebra. The $\lambda$-bracket of the PVA plays the role of the structure constants of the gauge algebra and the gauge invariance of the theory holds if and only if the $\lambda$-bracket Jacobi identity is satisfied. We show that the holomorphic-topological symmetry of the theory enhances to full topological symmetry if the Poisson vertex algebra contains a Virasoro element. We outline examples associated to PVAs of $\mathcal{W}$-type and demonstrate their connections to various versions of $3d$ gravity. We expect the three-dimensional Poisson sigma model to play an important role in the deformation quantization of Poisson vertex algebras.</description>

      <title>Superstring scattering on the real projective plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superstring scattering from orientifold planes requires considering string amplitudes on world-sheets with crosscaps with the lowest order case (in string coupling constant) having the topology of the real projective plane. While amplitudes on the latter have been formulated for the trivial one- and two-point cases in this work we go beyond these cases thereby solving various technicalities. The latter include reducing the complex world-sheet integration of closed string insertions over the real projective plane to pure real open string integrals. As a result we find that scattering of $n$ closed strings on the real projective plane can be expressed in terms of disk amplitudes involving $2n$ open strings. In this work we explicitly work out in pure spinor formalism the case $n=3$ which can be written as a linear combination of two (gauge-invariant) six open string amplitudes. We also present the low-energy expansion of this result necessary to construct closed string couplings on orientifold planes.</description>

      <title>Yang-Mills theories at finite temperature quantized in linear covariant gauges: gauge copies and semi-non-perturbative effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider four-dimensional Euclidean Yang-Mills theories quantized in the maximal Abelian and linear covariant gauges at finite temperature. Non-perturbatively, the Faddeev-Popov procedure must be improved to take into account the existence of the so-called Gribov copies. Tapping on previous results about the elimination of infinitesimal Gribov copies in maximal Abelian and linear covariant gauges at zero temperature, we explore the interplay between finite temperature effects and the removal of gauge copies. We focus in a hybrid approach where the thermal masses are derived through perturbative propagators as a stepping stone for a self-consistent treatment. The resulting action collects the effects of the elimination of infinitesimal Gribov copies as well as the thermal masses. We verify the existence of three different phases for the gluonic degrees of freedom; one of complete confinement at low temperatures, an intermediate one of partial confinement, and one of complete deconfinement at high temperatures.</description>

      <title>On dimensions of (2+1)D abelian bosonic topological systems on unoriented manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a framework to describe abelian bosonic topological systems with parity symmetry on a torus in terms of the representation of $GL(2,\bZ)$. However, this information alone does not guarantee that we can assign Hilbert spaces to unoriented surfaces in a way compatible with the gluing axiom of topological quantum field theory. Here, we show that we can assign Hilbert spaces with integer dimensions to unoriented surfaces in the case of abelian bosonic topological systems with time-reversal symmetry.</description>

      <title>Codimension-Two Defects and SYM on Orbifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study $U(N)$ SYM theories on spaces with orbifold singularities via an equivalent description in terms of gauge theories on smooth manifolds with insertions of Gukov-Witten and twist defects. The combined effect of the defects is to render the fields multivalued with respect to rotations around the support of the defects. This motivates an equivalence with theories on branched covers, for which the multivaluedness has a geometric interpretation. We compute the partition function of the theory with defects on a patch and use it as a building block to compute partition functions on several closed spaces with conical singularities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute B-type Weyl anomaly coefficients for the two non-supersymmetric codimension-1 domain wall versions of N = 4 super Yang-Mills theory which are holographically dual to the D3-D7 probe-brane system. We compute the two-point function of the (improved) energy-momentum tensor in the presence of the domain wall, to leading order in perturbation theory. From it we determine the two-point function of the corresponding displacement operator and the b2 anomaly coefficient for both domain wall systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the full partition function, including flux and instanton contributions, for an $\mathcal{N}=1$ theory of vector multiplets and hypermultiplets on five-dimensional toric Sasakian manifolds $Y^{p,q}$. Dimensionally reducing, we obtain the partition function on a class of manifolds whose topology is $S^2\times S^2$, for equivariant Donaldson-Witten and Pestun-like theories. Generalizing the procedure to branched covers of $Y^{p,q}$, and exploiting an equivalence with spaces containing orbifold singularities, we compute, for instance, the partition function of an $\mathcal{N}=2$ theory on the product of two spindles.</description>

      <title>Variant dilaton Weyl Multiplet for N=3 conformal supergravity in four dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a new dilaton Weyl multiplet for $\mathcal{N}=3$ conformal supergravity in four dimensions. The R-symmetry realized on this dilaton Weyl multiplet is $SU(2) \times U(1) \times U(1)$. The construction follows a two-step procedure. Firstly, two on-shell vector multiplets are coupled to the standard Weyl multiplet. Secondly, using the field equations of the vector multiplets, some of the auxiliary fields of the standard Weyl multiplet are solved in terms of the fields belonging to the vector multiplets and some dual gauge fields. The remaining fields of the standard Weyl multiplet combine with the vector multiplet fields and the dual gauge fields to constitute the new dilaton Weyl multiplet.</description>

      <title>Astrophysical signals from the neighboring brane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the two-brane model and show that any field is settled on both neighboring branes, thus forming two independent effective fields with different masses. The hierarchy of the energy scales and the subsequent fine-tuning can be achieved for a brane populated by observers. The neighboring brane is thus populated by extremely massive fields. The electromagnetic field is uniformly distributed over the extra dimensions, preserving charge universality in 4D physics.
  It is shown that the particles on different branes interact by exchanging photons and gravitons, which could explain the phenomena such as ultra-high-energy cosmic rays and dark matter. The latter consists of heavy electrons that are located on a brane free of the observers.</description>

      <title>Nonabelian fluids and helicities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In analogy with the non-Abelian gauge helicities conserved in time for ``null fields", that we have defined previously, in this paper we first define non-Abelian fluid helicities and then total non-Abelian helicities for combined non-Abelian fluid and gauge fields. For a U(N) group the helicities considered are for both gluonic-type fluids, composed of particles in the adjoint representation, and quark-type fluids, in the $N$-dimensional Cartan subalgebra. We write down various Lagrangian formulations for the uncoupled and coupled systems. In each case we determine the equations of motion, symmetries, and a Hamiltonian formulation. Taking the velocity of the fluid in the adjoint representation, we find that in the case of the gluonic fluid, we can write a non-Abelian gluonic fluid Euler-Yang-Mills equation that conserves the defined helicities, and comes from a Lagrangian.</description>

      <title>Holographic central charge for double scaled SYK</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we calculate the holographic central charge ($c_{sDG}$) associated with sine dilaton gravity in the semiclassical limit. Following the standard holographic folklore, this should correspond to the central charge associated with a $q$ Schwarzian quantum mechanical model in the double scaling limit. In the low energy limit, the gravity description flows into the ordinary JT gravity which is a conjectured dual of ordinary Schwarzian quantum mechanics at strong coupling. We compute the associated central charge ($c_{JT}$), which reveals $c_{sDG}&gt;c_{JT}$. We identify this as an artifact of the UV completion of JT gravity in terms of sine dilaton gravity.</description>

      <title>The Starobinsky model of inflation and Renormalizability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Starobinsky model was born in a cosmological scenario where conformally coupled matter quantum field fluctuations on the vacuum drive a non trivial semiclassical energy momentum tensor quadratic in curvature. The presence of an unstable de Sitter solution of the semiclassical Einstein equations contributed to spread the idea that the early universe could have experienced an inflationary epoch. Effective "$R + R^2$" models of gravity have later gained much attention since their predictions are in very good agreement with the measurements of CMB data and tensor to scalar ratio bounds. In this paper we observe how the Starobinsky model can be well approximated by the asymptotically free quadratic gravity on a part of a renormalization group trajectory (below some high UV scale) which is free from tachyonic instabilities, if a definition of ``physical'' running is employed.</description>

      <title>New gravitational wave probe of vector dark matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13116v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The longitudinal components of massive vector fields generated during inflation constitute a well-motivated dark matter candidate, with interesting phenomenological implications. During the epoch of radiation domination following inflation, their spectrum exhibits a peak at small scales, whose amplitude and position are governed by the parameters of the dark matter model. We calculate the stochastic gravitational wave spectrum induced at second order in fluctuations by such a longitudinal vector peak. We demonstrate that the amplitude of the gravitational wave spectrum can, in principle, reach significant values at nano-Hertz frequencies or lower. This result suggests a novel gravitational wave probe to test inflationary vector dark matter scenarios, independent from assumptions on the coupling of dark vectors to the Standard Model. Additionally, we derive new analytical formulas for the longitudinal vector transfer functions during radiation domination, offering a valuable tool for characterising the convolution integrals that govern the properties of the induced gravitational waves.</description>

Abstract: The Lagrangian formulation of Gravitoelectromagnetism (GEM) theory is considered. GEM is a gravitational theory constructed based on the similarities between gravity and electromagnetism. In this framework, we investigate gravitational Compton scattering by calculating its cross section at both zero and finite temperatures. Thermal effects are introduced via the Thermo Field Dynamics formalism. Some comparisons between GEM theory and QED have been developed. The limits of high temperature have been analyzed.</description>

      <title>Positive-Energy Warp Drive in a De Sitter Universe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13153v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generalizing the result of H. Ellis who embedded a warp bubble in the background of a black hole, we introduce a warp bubble in a de Sitter universe. We show that under certain conditions (namely, that the bubble is moving in the radial direction at a velocity equal to the speed of the expansion of the universe), it is possible for the bubble to have strictly non--negative Eulerian energy density and satisfy the averaged weak and null energy conditions (though they are violated locally). We also prove a more generic theorem that if perturbations of vacuum energy produce at least some underdense regions in all reference frames, they always result in local violations of NEC and WEC. We discuss the implications of these results and their possible applications to models of dark energy like "dark fluid" and quintessence, as well as to physical systems like Casimir cavities and analog gravity setups.</description>

      <title>Charge-changing weak interactions for right-handed particles in the Standard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Experiments have shown that the charge-changing weak interaction is purely left-handed, which is taken into account in the Standard Model by the inclusion of a left-handed projection operator in the Lagrangian. Nevertheless, it will be shown here that the Standard Model predicts charge-changing weak interactions for right-handed fermions that can be larger than those for left-handed fermions if the mass is sufficiently large, as is the case for the top quark. Here we are using the conventional terminology in which a massive fermion with its spin parallel to its momentum is referred to as being right-handed in the relativistic limit, where it is in an approximate eigenstate of the chirality operator. These effects are due to the way in which the field of the W boson is quantized, which gives a divergent tensor product in the Feynman propagator in the unitary gauge. It will be shown that the off-diagonal terms in the propagator can convert a left-handed projection operator into a right-handed projection operator, which allows an interaction with right-handed fermions even though the Lagrangian is left-handed. Experiments to date have only demonstrated charge-changing weak interactions for left-handed particles, and an alternative quantization approach that eliminates the divergent off-diagonal terms in the W boson propagator and avoids these difficulties will be considered. The alternative approach appears to be in agreement with existing experiments, but additional high-energy experiments may be required in order to distinguish its predictions from those of the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>Dyonic black bounce solutions in General Relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work explores dyonic black bounce (BB) solutions within the framework of General Relativity (GR), coupled with nonlinear electrodynamics (NLED) and scalar fields (SFs). Previous research has employed NLED and SFs to obtain BB solutions in GR; however, these solutions typically assume the presence of either magnetic monopoles or electric charges exclusively as components of the Maxwell-Faraday tensor. In this study, we examine static and spherically symmetric BB solutions that incorporate both magnetic and electric components, forming what are known as dyon solutions. A dyon is a particle characterized by the coexistence of both magnetic and electric charges. We determine the NLED Lagrangian density and the scalar field potential that produce these solutions and analyze the associated gravitational configurations, focusing on horizons, the behavior of the metric function, and spacetime regularity as described by the Kretschmann scalar. Notably, we present the first BB solution derived from the coupling of a linear electromagnetic Lagrangian and a scalar field with an associated potential as the matter source. This work broadens the class of non-singular geometries in the literature and opens new avenues for investigating dyonic BB solutions within the context of other modified gravity theories.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic analysis and shadow bound of black holes surrounded by a dark matter halo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform the thermodynamic analysis of a black hole (BH) immersed in a dark matter halo (DMH), showing that the BH could not be in thermal equilibrium with the DMH in any regions outside the event horizon. This means that the thermodynamic influence of the environment (DMH) is relatively small on the BH and it does not alter the nature of BH with negative heat capacity. The Newtonian ($1/a_0$) approximation gives us a correct thermodynamic description for the BH surrounded by DMH because the first law of thermodynamics and Smarr formula are satisfied. We use the Newtonian Helmholtz free energy to show that there is no phase transition to other BH with positive heat capacity surrounded by a DMH. We investigate the shadow bound of favored region for the BH immersed in the DMH by introducing three critical impact parameters.</description>

      <title>Violation of non-Abelian Bianchi identity and QCD topology -- Numerical analyses on lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When Abelian monopoles due to violation of the non-Abelian Bianchi identity J{\mu}(x) condense in the vacuum, color confinement of QCD is realized by the Abelian dual Meissner effect. Recently VNABI affects also topological features of QCD drastically. Firstly, self-dual instantons can not be a classical solution of QCD. Secondly, the topological charge density is not expressed by a total derivative of the Chern-Simons density K{\mu}(x), but has an additional term L(x)=2Tr(J{\mu}(x)A{\mu}(x)). Thirdly, the axial U(1) anomaly is similarly modified, while keeping the Atiyah-Singer index theorem unchanged. These suggest that the Abelian mechanism based on the Abelian monopoles from VNABI play an important role in these topological quantities instead of instantons. The additional term L(x) is evaluated in the framework of Monte-Carlo simulations on SU(2) lattices in details with partial gauge fixings such as the Maximal Center gauge (MCG) and the Maximal Abelian +U(1) gauge (MAU1) in addition to the gradient flow. The additional term tends to vanish after small gradient flow time ({\tau}) when infrared monopoles responsible for color confinement are also suppressed. The topological charge Qt and its Abelian counterpart Qa are discussed also on lattice. Theoretically Qa(A)=3Qt(A) is expected, but a simple lattice definition of Qa(A) is fluctuating between -2 and -3 in MCG and around -2 in MAU1 in a typical configuration where Qt(A) is stabilized around -1 after the flow time {\tau} is larger than 2.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13557v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose novel non-relativistic fluid analogue models, that is dumb hole models, for extremal and near-extremal black holes. Further we study the back-reaction effects of analogue Hawking radiation emitted from these dumb holes. We discuss and quantify the reduction in the background fluid velocity caused by radiation of Hawking phonons. In doing so, we speculate on the existence of an emergent Hawking force which leads to the reduction in the background fluid velocity and which is produced as a consequence of phonon emission. In addition to the analogue gravity literature, our results might be of relevance to black hole pedagogy.</description>

      <title>Algebraic and Positive Geometry of the Universe: from Particles to Galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the intersection of algebra, geometry, and combinatorics with particle physics and cosmology has led to significant advances. Central to this progress is the twofold formulation of the study of particle interactions and observables in the universe: on the one hand, Feynman's approach reduces to the study of intricate integrals; on the other hand, one encounters the study of positive geometries. This article introduces key developments, mathematical tools, and the connections that drive progress at the frontier between algebraic geometry, the theory of $D$-modules, combinatorics, and physics. All these threads contribute to shaping the flourishing field of positive geometry, which aims to establish a unifying mathematical language for describing phenomena in cosmology and particle physics.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we extend the results obtained in a previous work and investigate the most interesting decay processes involving axions, photons and the lightest pseudoscalar mesons in the more general case in which the quarks (and, therefore, the mesons) may be charged under the $U(1)$ Peccei-Quinn symmetry, making use of a chiral effective Lagrangian model with $N_f=3$ light quark flavors, which also includes the flavor-singlet pseudoscalar meson and implements the $U(1)$ axial anomaly of the fundamental theory. In particular, we compute the axion mass, the electromagnetic coupling of the axion to photons, and the amplitudes and widths of the decay processes $\eta/\eta'\rightarrow \pi\pi a$.</description>

      <title>Bound states of quasiparticles with quartic dispersion in an external potential: WKB approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin semiclassical method is formulated for quasiparticles with quartic-in-momentum dispersion which presents the simplest case of a soft energy-momentum dispersion. It is shown that matching wave functions in the classically forbidden and allowed regions requires the consideration of higher-order Airy-type functions. The asymptotics of these functions are found by using the method of steepest descents and contain additional exponentially suppressed contributions known as hyperasymptotics. These hyperasymptotics are crucially important for the correct matching of wave functions in vicinity of turning points for higher-order differential equations. A quantization condition for bound state energies is obtained, which generalizes the standard Bohr-Sommerfeld condition for particles with quadratic energy-momentum dispersion and contains nonperturbative in $\hbar$ correction. The quantization condition is used to find bound state energies in the case of quadratic and quartic potentials.</description>

Abstract: We study regular Schwarzschild black holes in General Relativity as an alternative to the singular counterpart. We analyze two types of solutions which are completely parameterised by the ADM mass alone. We find that both families of regular solutions contain a de Sitter condensate at the core and admit (quasi) extremal black hole configurations in which the two horizons are arbitrarily close. Cosmological models based on these regular configurations are also analyzed, finding that they describe non-trivial Kantowski-Sachs universes free of singularities.</description>

      <title>Production of Dark Photons through Higher Electromagnetic Moments at LDMX: Simulations and Model Discrimination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13635v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the projected sensitivity of LDMX for sub-GeV dark matter (DM) to the case of dark photons produced through higher order electromagnetic moments. These moments arise from loop diagrams involving portal matter fields, along with the gauge fields of new symmetry groups. Due to the Lorentz structures, in particular the momentum dependence, of these additional interactions, the kinematic distributions expected at missing momentum/energy experiments vary with model in addition to dark photon mass. By considering four additional types of interactions -- magnetic and electric dipole, charge radius, and anapole moment -- we show that LDMX Phase-II is expected to probe the relic target of these additional dark photon models. We compare the analytic with the numerical methods for calculating the dark bremsstrahlung cross section, and compute the kinematic distributions for each model. The potential for model discrimination in the scenario of non-zero signal events at LDMX is discussed. We find that there is a degeneracy between the dark photon mass and model, which can be partially broken by considering both the energy and the transverse momentum of the recoil electron.</description>

      <title>Diagnosing chaos with projected ensembles of process tensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The process tensor provides a general representation of a quantum system evolving under repeated interventions and is fundamental for numerical simulations of local many-body dynamics. In this work, we introduce the projected process ensemble, an ensemble of pure output states of a process tensor in a given basis of local interventions, and use it to define increasingly more fine-grained probes of quantum chaos. The first moment of this ensemble encapsulates numerous previously studied chaos quantifiers, including the Alicki-Fannes quantum dynamical entropy, butterfly flutter fidelity, and spatiotemporal entanglement. We discover characteristic entanglement structures within the ensemble's higher moments that can sharply distinguish chaotic from integrable dynamics, overcoming deficiencies of the quantum dynamical and spatiotemporal entropies. These conclusions are supported by extensive numerical simulations of many-body dynamics for a range of spin-chain models, including non-interacting, interacting-integrable, chaotic, and many-body localized regimes. Our work elucidates the fingerprints of chaos on spatiotemporal correlations in quantum stochastic processes, and provides a unified framework for analyzing the complexity of unitary and monitored many-body dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the quasimap vertex functions of type $D$ Nakajima quiver varieties. When the quiver varieties have isolated torus fixed points, we compute the coefficients of the vertex functions in the $K$-theoretic fixed point basis. We also give an explicit combinatorial description of zero-dimensional type $D$ quiver varieties and their vertex functions using the combinatorics of minuscule posets. Using Macdonald polynomials, we prove that these vertex functions can be expressed as products of $q$-binomial functions, which proves a degeneration of the conjectured 3d mirror symmetry of vertex functions. We provide an interpretation of type $D$ spin vertex functions as the partition functions of the half-space Macdonald processes of Barraquand, Borodin, and Corwin. This hints that the geometry of quiver varieties may provide new examples of integrable probabilistic models.</description>

      <title>Dynamical String Tension Theories with target space scale invariance SSB and restoration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2104.08875v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The string and brane tensions do not have to be put in by hand, they can be dynamically generated, as in the case when we formulate string and brane theories in the modified measure formalism. Then string and brane tensions appears, but as an additional dynamical degree of freedom . It can be seen however that these string or brane tensions are not universal, but rather each string and each brane generates its own tension, which can have a different value for each string or brane. There should be also a considerable effect for the effective gravity theories derived from these theories. We consider new background fields that can couple to these new types of extended objects, one of them, the tension scalar is capable of changing locally along the world sheet the value of the tension of the extended object. When many strings probing the same region of space are considered this tension scalar is constrained by the requirement of quantum conformal invariance. For the case of two strings probing the same region of space with different dynamically generated tensions, there are two different metrics, associated to the different strings, that have to satisfy vacuum Einsteins equations and the consistency of these two Einsteins equation determines the tension scalar. We also find that the construction of brane world scenarios in the context of these dynamical tension string theories, we discuss avoidance of the Hagedorn temperature possible relaxation of string swampland constraints in dynamical tension string theories, and that the dynamical string theories can bridge between the low and high energy quantum gravity effects, The dynamical modified string theory has target space scale invariance and this target space scale invariance can be restored at the points where the string tension approaches infinity. These models suggest the swampland constraints could be avoided.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.03225v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss the imaginary-time formalism for field theories in thermal equilibrium in uniformly accelerating frames. We show that under a Wick rotation of Minkowski spacetime, the Rindler event horizon shrinks to a point in a two-dimensional subspace tangential to the acceleration direction and the imaginary time. We demonstrate that the accelerated version of the Kubo-Martin-Schwinger (KMS) condition implies an identification of all spacetime points related by integer-multiple rotations in the tangential subspace about this Euclidean Rindler event-horizon point, with the rotational quanta defined by the thermal acceleration, $\alpha = a/T$. In the Wick-rotated Rindler hyperbolic coordinates, the KMS relations reduce to standard (anti-)periodic boundary conditions in terms of the imaginary proper time (rapidity) coordinate. Our findings pave the way to study, using first-principle lattice simulations, the Hawking-Unruh radiation in geometries with event horizons, phase transitions in accelerating Early Universe and early stages of quark-gluon plasma created in relativistic heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14627v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is known that the $U(2)$ Wess-Zumino-Witten model is dual to the free fermion theory in two dimensions via non-Abelian bosonization. While it is decomposed into the $SU(2)$ Wess-Zumino-Witten model and a free compact boson, the former is believed to be equivalent to the $O(3)$ nonlinear sigma model with the theta term at $\theta=\pi$. In this work, we reexamine this duality through the lens of non-perturbative renormalization group (RG) flow. We analyze the RG flow structure of the $O(3)$ nonlinear sigma model with the theta term in two dimensions using the functional renormalization group. Our results reveal a nontrivial fixed point with a nonzero value of the topological coupling. The scaling dimensions (critical exponents) at this fixed point suggest the realization of a duality between the $O(3)$ nonlinear sigma model with the theta term and the free fermion theory, indicating that these models belong to the same universality class.</description>

Abstract: Infra-Red scaling property of inflationary universe is in the same universality class of random walk. The two point correlators of the curvature perturbations are enhanced by the e-folding number N. The distribution function of the curvature perturbation $\rho_t (\zeta)$ satisfies the Fokker Planck equation. The de Sitter universes are dual to the random walk: They belong to the Universality class of dimension two fractal. These boundary and bulk duality are at the heart of holography of quantum gravity. Historically the correspondence of thermodynamics and Einstein's equation are recognized as the first evidence for de Sitter duality .Our de Sitter duality relates the stochastic and geometric point of view. We study two types of the solutions of FP equation in quasi de Sitter space: (1) UV complete spacetime and (2) inflationary spacetime with concave potentials. The maximum entropy principle favors the following scenario: The universe is (a) born with small epsilon and (b) grows by inflation in the concave potential. We predict n_s &lt;0.975(0.97) and r &lt; 0.04(0.03) for N=50(60) at the pivot angle 0.002Mpc^{-1}. We have lowered the upper bound of $r$ by taking account of random walk effect at the boundary. Our predictions are highly consistent with recent observations.</description>

      <title>Holographic image features of an AdS black hole in Einstein-power-Yang-Mills gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03083v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By utilizing the AdS/CFT correspondence, we investigate the holographic image of an AdS black hole in Einstein-power-Yang-Mills gravity. The AdS boundary hosts a Gaussian oscillation source, which induces a lensed response on the opposite side of the boundary during propagation through bulk spacetime. The optical system assists observers at the north pole to continuously capture holographic images that show an axisymmetric bright ring known as the Einstein ring. As the observation position shifted, the bright ring gradually transformed into a luminous arc and eventually transitioned into a light point. Simultaneously, we examine the impact of variations in relevant physical quantity on the ring, and present the corresponding brightness curve. The results indicate that as the temperature $T$ and nonlinear Yang Mills charge parameter $q$ increase, the ring radius also increases, while an increase in the chemical potential $u$ leads to a decrease. However, the peak brightness curve of the ring invariably decreases as the values of $T$, $u$, and $q$ increase, albeit to varying degrees. Upon comparing the outcomes of geometric optics, it can be observed that the position of the ring in holography images is consistent with that of the photon ring.</description>

      <title>Ocneanu Algebra of Seams: Critical Unitary $E_6$ RSOS Lattice Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06236v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the $A$ series and exceptional $E_6$ Restricted Solid-On-Solid lattice models as prototypical examples of the critical Yang-Baxter integrable two-dimensional $A$-$D$-$E$ lattice models. We focus on type I theories which are characterized by the existence of an extended chiral symmetry in the continuum scaling limit. Starting with the commuting family of column transfer matrices on the torus, we build matrix representations of the Ocneanu graph fusion algebra as integrable seams for arbitrary finite-size lattices with the structure constants specified by Petkova and Zuber. This commutative seam algebra contains the Verlinde, fused adjacency and graph fusion algebras as subalgebras. Our matrix representation of the Ocneanu algebra encapsulates the quantum symmetry of the commuting family of transfer matrices. In the continuum scaling limit, the integrable seams realize the topological defects of the associated conformal field theory and the known toric matrices encode the twisted conformal partition functions.</description>

      <title>The full electroweak interaction: an autonomous account</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10668v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The precise renormalizable interactions in the bosonic sector of electroweak theory are intrinsically determined in the autonomous approach to perturbation theory. This proceeds directly on the Hilbert-Fock space built on the Wigner unirreps of the physical particles, with their given masses: those of three massive vector bosons, a photon, and a massive scalar (the "higgs"). Neither "gauge choices" nor an unobservable "mechanism of spontaneous symmetry breaking" is invoked. Instead, to proceed on Hilbert space requires using string-localized fields to describe the vector bosons. In such a framework, the condition of string independence of the S-matrix yields consistency constraints on the coupling coefficients, the essentially unique outcome being the experimentally known one. The analysis can be largely carried out for other configurations of massive and massless vector bosons, paving the way towards consideration of consistent mass patterns beyond those of the electroweak theory.</description>

      <title>Systematic exploration of the non-geometric flux landscape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22444v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given the huge size of the generic four-dimensional scalar potentials arising from the type II supergravities based on toroidal orientifolds, it is even hard to analytically solve the extremization conditions, and therefore the previous studies have been mainly focused on taking some numerical approaches. In this work, using the so-called {\it axionic flux polynomials} we demonstrate that the scalar potential and the extremization conditions can be simplified to a great extent, leading to the possibility of performing an analytic exploration of the flux landscape. In this regard, we consider the isotropic case of a type IIB model based on the standard ${\mathbb T}^6/({\mathbb Z}_2 \times {\mathbb Z}_2)$ orientifold having the three-form fluxes $F_3/H_3$ and the non-geometric $Q$-flux. This model results in around 300 terms in the scalar potential which depend on 6 moduli/axionic fields and 14 flux parameters. Considering that the axionic flux polynomials can take either zero or non-zero values results in the need of analyzing $2^{14}=16384$ candidate configurations, and we find that more than 16200 of those result in No-Go scenarios for Minkowskian/de-Sitter vacua. Based on our systematic exploration of non-tachyonic flux vacua, we present a detailed classification of such No-Go scenarios as well as the leftover ``undecided" configurations for which we could not conclude about the presence/absence of the stable Minkowskian/de-Sitter vacua.</description>

Abstract: We study mathematical aspects concerning two site tree-level cosmological correlators with massive internal and external states in a de Sitter universe. We employ integration by parts identities, (relative) twisted cohomology and the method of differential equations. We explicitly express the internally massive, externally conformally coupled correlator as a power series with respect to a small mass parameter, where the various terms in the series are given by multiple polylogarithms.</description>

Abstract: We study the physics of 2 and 3 mutually intersecting conformal defects forming wedges and corners in general dimension. For 2 defects we derive the beta function of the edge interactions for infinite and semi-infinite wedges and study them in the tricritical model in $d=3-\epsilon$ as an example. We discuss the dependency of the edge anomalous dimension on the intersection angle, connecting to an old issue known in the literature. Additionally, we study trihedral corners formed by 3 planes and compute the corner anomalous dimension, which can be considered as a higher-dimensional analog of the cusp anomalous dimension. We also study 3-line corners related to the three-body potential of point-like impurities.</description>

Abstract: We consider N Dirac fermions on a 4-dimensional Euclidean space with a quadratic interaction given by arbitrary external Clifford-valued fields. The divergence of the axial current satisfies on the classical level a relation that is violated after quantization. Using the Pauli-Villars method to regularize the fields, we find the conditions that guarantee the finiteness of the anomaly. We also find this anomaly. Our result generalizes the well-known computation of axial anomaly of Dirac fermions interacting with an external Yang-Mills field.</description>

      <title>Fortuity in SYK Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06902v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the fortuity phenomenon in supersymmetric Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) models. For generic choices of couplings, all the BPS states in the $\mathcal{N}=2$ SUSY SYK model are fortuitous. The SYK models reveal an intimate connection between fortuity and the Schwarzian description of supersymmetric black holes, reflected in a sharp feature of $R$-charge concentration - microscopically, all the fortuitous states are concentrated in particular charge sectors. We propose that both $R$-charge concentration and the random matrix behavior near the BPS states are key properties of a generic $q$-local supercharge and formulate these as a supercharge chaos conjecture. We expect supercharge chaos to hold universally for supercharges in holographic CFTs near their fortuitous states, potentially providing a microscopic interpretation for the charge constraints of supersymmetric black holes.
  We also construct SYK models that contain both fortuitous states and monotonous states and contrast their properties, providing further evidence that monotonous states are less chaotic than fortuitous states.</description>

      <title>Non-local positivity bounds: islands in Terra Incognita</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08634v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The requirements of unitarity and causality lead to significant constraints on the Wilson coefficients of an EFT expansion, known as positivity bounds. Their standard derivation relies on the crucial assumption of polynomial boundedness on the growth of scattering amplitudes in the complex energy plane, which is a property satisfied by local QFTs, and by weakly coupled string theory in the Regge regime. The scope of this work is to clarify the role of locality by deriving generalized positivity bounds under the assumption of exponential boundedness, typical of non-local QFTs where the Froissart-Martin bound is usually not satisfied. Using appropriately modified dispersion relations, we derive new constraints and find regions in the EFT parameter space that do not admit a local UV completion. Furthermore, we show that there exist EFTs that satisfy IR causality and at the same time can admit a non-local UV completion, provided that the energy scale of non-locality is of the same order or larger than the EFT cutoff. Finally, we provide an explicit example of an exponentially bounded amplitude that satisfies partial-wave unitarity and asymptotic causality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13932v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a systematic classification of Narain conformal field theories based on finite dimensional ADE Lie algebras $\mathbf{g}$ and representations $\mathcal{R}_{\mathbf{g}}$. First, we describe our proposal for the su(2) conformal theory termed as NCFT$_{2}^{\mathbf{su}_{2}}$ with central charge $(\mathrm{c}_{L},\mathrm{c}_{R})=(\mathrm{1},\mathrm{1})$ and modular invariant partition function Z$_{\mathbf{su}_{2}}^{(1,1)}$. Then, we extend this model to encompass the NCFT$_{2}^{\mathbf{g}}$ families with higher rank ADE algebras $\mathbf{g}_{\mathrm{r}} $ having central charges $\mathrm{c}_{L/R}=\mathrm{r}$ and partition function Z$_{\mathbf{g}}^{(r,r)}.$ In this newly established framework, we construct a realisation of the Zamolodchikov metric $ds_{\mathbf{g}}^{2}$ of the moduli space $(\mathcal{M}_{\mathbf{g}}^{(r,r)},ds_{\mathbf{g}}^{2})$ in terms of Lie algebraic data namely the Cartan matrix K$_{\mathbf{g}}$ and its inverse K$_{\mathbf{g}}^{-1}$. Properties regarding the ensemble averaging of these CFTs and their holographic dual are also derived. Additionally, we discuss possible generalisations to NCFTs having dis-symmetric central charges $(\mathrm{c}_{L},\mathrm{c}_{R})=(\mathrm{s}, \mathrm{r})$ with $s&gt;r$ and highlight further features of the partition function Z$_{\mathbf{g}}^{(r,r)}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03365v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct statistical mechanical models of crystal melting describing the flavoured Witten indices of $\mathcal{N}\ge 2$ supersymmetric quiver gauge theories. Our results can be derived from the Jeffrey-Kirwan (JK) residue formulas, and generalize the previous results for quivers corresponding to toric Calabi-Yau threefolds and fourfolds to a large class of quivers satisfying the no-overlap condition, including those corresponding to some non-toric Calabi-Yau manifolds. We construct new quiver algebras which we call the double quiver Yangians/algebras, as well as their representations in terms of the aforementioned crystals. For theories with four supercharges, we compare the double quiver algebras with the existing quiver Yangians/BPS algebras, which we show can also be constructed from the JK residues. For theories with two supercharges, the double quiver algebras provide an algebraic description of the BPS states, including the information of the fixed points and their relative coefficients in the full partition functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02031v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we address the issue regarding the asymptotic behavior of power-expansion/OPE-expansion in supper-renormalizable theory. Using an $O(N)$-model with $N$-components scalars coupled through quartic interaction at the next-to-leading $\frac{1}{N}$ order in the large-$N$ expansion, we show that the IR subtractions cause addition factorial enhancements for high order/power terms in the coefficient functions. Moreover, there are also factorial enhancements for the operator condensates, and the factorial enhancements cancel between coefficient functions and operators only off-diagonally across different powers. The factorial enhancements can be both alternating and non-alternating. The former are similar to ``UV renormalon'' of coefficient functions and cancel with factorial enhancements of operators at lower powers in diagrams with negative degrees of UV divergences. The latter are similar to ``IR renormalon'' and cancel with factorial enhancements of higher dimensional renormalized operators in diagrams with positive degrees of UV divergences. The factorial enhancement itself will render the momentum-space power expansion divergent.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we continue our investigation of the triple Hodge integrals satisfying the Calabi-Yau condition. For the tau-functions, which generate these integrals, we derive the complete families of the Heisenberg-Virasoro constraints. We also construct several equivalent versions of the cut-and-join operators. These operators describe the algebraic version of topological recursion. For the specific values of parameters associated with the KdV reduction, we prove that these tau-functions are equal to the generating functions of intersection numbers of $\psi$ and $\kappa$ classes. We interpret this relation as a symplectic invariance of the Chekhov--Eynard--Orantin topological recursion and prove this recursion for the general $\Theta$-case.</description>

Abstract: It is pointed out that every renormalizable field theory has a symmetry which is hidden in plain sight. In all practical cases, it is also broken softly, either explicitly or spontaneously. The soft explicit breaking mass terms may be assumed naturally small compared to the scalar mass-squared terms. Implications for extensions of the standard model are discussed. New left-right model of two-loop radiative Dirac neutrino mass is proposed.</description>

      <title>Bratteli networks and the Spectral Action on quivers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.03705v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the context of noncommutative geometry, we consider quiver representations -- not on vector spaces, as traditional, but on finite-dimensional prespectral triples (`discrete topological noncommutative spaces'). A similar idea appeared in the original work of Marcolli-van Suijlekom on quiver representations in spectral triples (`discrete noncommutative geometries'), which paved the way for some of our results in independent directions. We introduce Bratteli networks, a structure that yields a neat combinatorial characterisation of the space $\mathrm{Rep}~Q$ of prespectral-triple-representations of a quiver $\mathrm{Rep}~Q$, as well as of the gauge group and of their quotient. Not only these claims that make it possible to `integrate over $\mathrm{Rep}~Q$' are, as we now argue, in line with the spirit of random noncommutative geometry -- formulating path integrals over Dirac operators -- but they also contain a physically relevant case. Namely, the equivalence between quiver representations and path algebra modules, established here for the new category, inspired the following construction: Only from representation theory data, we build a spectral triple for the quiver and evaluate the spectral action functional from a general formula over closed paths. When we apply this construction to lattice-quivers, we obtain not only Wilsonian Yang-Mills lattice gauge theory, but also the Weisz-Wohlert-cells in the context of Symanzik's improved gauge theory. We show that a hermitian (`Higgs') matrix field emerges from the self-loops of the quiver and derive the Yang-Mills--Higgs theory on flat space as a smooth limit.</description>

      <title>Algebraic geometry of bubbling Kahler metrics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14518v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give an algebro-geometric or non-archimedean framework to study bubbling phenomena of Kahler metrics with Euclidean volume growth, after [DS17, Sun23, dBS23]. In particular, for any degenerating family to log terminal singularity, we algebraically construct a finite sequence of birational modifications of the family with milder degenerations, and compare with analytic bubbling constructions in loc.cit. We also provide approaches in terms of coordinates and valuations. Our discussion partially depends on the general framework of stability theory in our [Od24b] (arXiv:2406.02489) after [HL14, AHLH23].</description>

      <title>Graph Reinforcement Learning for Exploring BSM Model Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07203v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a methodology for performing scans of BSM parameter spaces with reinforcement learning (RL). We identify a novel procedure using graph neural networks that is capable of exploring spaces of models without the user specifying a fixed particle content, allowing broad classes of BSM models to be explored. In theory, the technique is applicable to nearly any model space with a pre-specified gauge group. We provide a generic procedure by which a suitable graph grammar can be developed for any BSM model which features user-specified symmetry groups and a finite number of different possible particle species. As a proof of concept, we construct the graph grammar for theories with vector-like leptons that may or may not be charged under a dark U(1) group, inspired by portal matter extensions of the sub-GeV vector portal/kinetic mixing simplified dark matter models. We then use this graph grammar to create a RL environment tasked with creating models with these vector-like leptons that are consistent with a list of a variety of precision observables. The RL agent succeeds in developing models that can address the observed muon anomalous magnetic moment discrepancy while remaining consistent with flavor violation and electroweak precision observables, including both constructions that have previously been studied as well as new models which have not, to our knowledge, previously been identified. By inspecting the resulting ensembles of models that the agent produces and experimenting with different configurations for our RL environment and graph grammar, we also infer various lessons about the development of these environments that can be transferable to RL scans of more complicated model spaces, and comment on future directions for the development of this technique into a more mature tool.</description>

      <title>Discriminating among cosmological models by data-driven methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01563v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explores the Pantheon+SH0ES dataset to identify patterns that can discriminate between different cosmological models. We focus on determining whether the behaviour of dark energy is consistent with the standard $\Lambda$CDM model or suggests novel cosmological features. The central goal is to evaluate the robustness of the $\Lambda$CDM model compared with other dark energy models, and to investigate whether there are deviations that might indicate new cosmological insights. The study takes into account a data-driven approach, using both traditional statistical methods and machine learning techniques. Initially, we evaluate six different dark energy models using traditional statistical methods like Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), Static and Dynamic Nested Sampling to infer the cosmological parameters. Subsequently, we adopt a machine learning approach, developing a regression model to compute the distance modulus of each supernova, expanding the feature set to 74 statistical features. Traditional statistical analysis confirms that the $\Lambda$CDM model is robust, yielding expected parameter values. Other models show deviations, with the Generalised and Modified Chaplygin Gas models performing poorly. In the machine learning analysis, feature selection techniques, particularly Boruta, significantly improve model performance. In particular, models initially considered weak (Generalised/Modified Chaplygin Gas) show significant improvement after feature selection. The study demonstrates the effectiveness of a data-driven approach to cosmological model evaluation. The $\Lambda$CDM model remains robust, while machine learning techniques, in particular feature selection, reveal potential improvements in alternative models which could be relevant for new observational campaigns like the recent DESI survey.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06972v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present analytic results on physical kinematics for four integral families that are relevant to the production of two off-shell vector bosons with different masses. Our study consists of a ladder-box, a tennis-court, and two reducible ladder-box-like families. The results for the master integrals of these families are expressed up to order six in the dimensional regulator in terms of real-valued multiple polylogarithms. Furthermore, a semi-numeric solution is provided, employing generalized power series expansions using the package DiffExp.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07757v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We obtain generally covariant operator-valued geodesic equations on a pseudo-Riemannian manifold $M$ as an application of quantum geodesics on the algebra $D(M)$ of differential operators. Geodesic motion arises here as an associativity condition for a certain form of first order differential calculus on this algebra in the presence of curvature. The corresponding Schr\"odinger picture has wavefunctions on spacetime and proper time evolution by the Klein-Gordon operator, with stationary modes precisely solutions of the Klein-Gordon equation. As an application, we describe gravatom solutions of the Klein-Gordon equations around a Schwarzschild black hole, i.e. gravitationally bound states which far from the event horizon resemble atomic states with the black hole in the role of the nucleus. The spatial eigenfunctions exhibit probability density banding as for higher orbital modes of an ordinary atom, but of a fractal nature approaching the horizon.</description>

      <title>Categorical Symmetries in Spin Models with Atom Arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15024v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Categorical symmetries have recently been shown to generalize the classification of phases of matter, significantly broadening the traditional Landau paradigm. To test these predictions, we propose a simple spin chain model that encompasses all gapped phases and second-order phase transitions governed by the categorical symmetry $\mathsf{Rep}(D_8)$. This model not only captures the essential features of non-invertible phases but is also straightforward enough to enable practical realization. Specifically, we outline an implementation using neutral atoms trapped in optical tweezer arrays. Employing a dual-species setup and Rydberg blockade, we propose a digital simulation approach that can efficiently implement the many-body evolution in several nontrivial quantum phases.</description>

      <title>Cosmological quantum mechanics on FLRW spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18295v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study general relativistic quantum mechanics in the case of an FLRW cosmological background. For positive spatial curvature we find a discrete series of solutions of the Klein-Gordon equation that can reasonably be called gravitationally bound `cosmological atom' states. For all cases of curvature, these modes, as well as more conventional atomic spatial modes bound by an external potential, extend to solutions of the Klein-Gordon equations viewed as stationary modes of Klein-Gordon quantum mechanics where wavefunctions are over spacetime and evolution is with respect to an external `geodesic time' parameter $s$. For general nonstationary states with fixed spatial eigenvector, the theory reduces to a novel 1-dimensional quantum system on the time $t$ axis with potential $1/a(t)^2$, where $a(t)$ is the Friedmann expansion factor. Its behaviour, and hence the evolution of spatial states, changes critically when the Hubble constant exceeds $2/3$ of the particle mass, as typically occurs during inflation. We also find washout of the evolution of spatial observables at late times and a backward-traveling reflected mode generated when the value of $H$ transitions to a larger value.</description>

      <title>Bridging Entanglement and Magic Resources through Operator Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18679v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Local operator entanglement (LOE) dictates the complexity of simulating Heisenberg evolution using tensor network methods, and serves as strong dynamical signature of quantum chaos. We show that LOE is also sensitive to how non-Clifford a unitary is: its magic resources. In particular, we prove that LOE is always upper-bound by three distinct magic monotones: $T$-count, unitary nullity, and operator stabilizer R\'enyi entropy. Moreover, in the average case for large, random circuits, LOE and magic monotones approximately coincide. Our results imply that an operator evolution that is expensive to simulate using tensor network methods must also be inefficient using both stabilizer and Pauli truncation methods. A direct corollary of our bounds is that any quantum chaotic dynamics cannot be simulated classically. Entanglement in operator space therefore measures a unified picture of non-classical resources, in stark contrast to the Schr\"odinger picture.</description>

      <title>Numerical evidence for a CP broken deconfined phase at $\theta =\pi$ in 4D SU(2) Yang-Mills theory through simulations at imaginary $\theta$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09115v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the possibility of the spontaneous breaking of CP symmetry in 4D SU(2) Yang-Mills at $\theta=\pi$, which has recently attracted much attention in the context of the higher-form symmetry and the 't Hooft anomaly matching condition. Here we provide a numerical evidence that the CP symmetry is indeed spontaneously broken at low temperature and it gets restored above the deconfining temperature at $\theta=\pi$, which is consistent with the anomaly matching condition and yet differs from the situation predicted in the large-$N$ limit. We avoid the severe sign problem by performing simulations at imaginary $\theta$. We obtain the critical temperature of the CP restoration and that of deconfinement at $\theta=\pi$ by analytic continuation, which leads to the above conclusion.</description>

      <title>Quantum entanglement of final particle states in the resonant trident pair production in a strong electromagnetic wave</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12619v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The resonant trident pair production process in the collision of ultrarelativistic electrons with a strong electromagnetic wave is theoretically studied. Under resonant conditions, the intermediate virtual gamma-quantum becomes real. As a result, the original resonant trident pair production process effectively splits into two first-order processes by the fine structure constant: the electromagnetic field-stimulated Compton-effect and the electromagnetic field-stimulated Breit-Wheeler process. The kinematics of the resonant trident pair production process are studied in detail. It is shown that there are two different cases for the energies and outgoing angles of final particles (an electron and an electron-positron pair) in which their quantum entanglement is realized. In the first case, the energy and outgoing angles of final ultrarelativistic particles are uniquely determined by the parameters of the electromagnetic field-stimulated Compton-effect (the outgoing angle of the final electron and the quantum parameter of the Compton effect). In the second case, the energy and outgoing angles of final particles are uniquely determined by the electromagnetic field-stimulated Breit-Wheeler process (the electron-positron pair outgoing angle and the Breit-Wheeler quantum parameter). It is shown that in a sufficiently wide range of frequencies and intensities of a strong electromagnetic wave, and in the case of ultrarelativistic initial electrons, the differential probability of the resonant trident pair production process with simultaneous registration of the outgoing angles of final particles can significantly (by several orders of magnitude) exceed the total probability of the electromagnetic field-stimulated Compton-effect.</description>
