      <title>A mapping-free NLP-based technique for sequence search in Nanopore long-reads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In unforeseen situations, such as nuclear power plant's or civilian radiation accidents, there is a need for effective and computationally inexpensive methods to determine the expression level of a selected gene panel, allowing for rough dose estimates in thousands of donors. The new generation in-situ mapper, fast and of low energy consumption, working at the level of single nanopore output, is in demand. We aim to create a sequence identification tool that utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and ensures a high level of negative predictive value (NPV) compared to the classical approach. The training dataset consisted of RNASeq data from 6 samples. Having tested multiple NLP models, the best configuration analyses the entire sequence and uses a word length of 3 base pairs with one-word neighbor on each side. For the considered FDXR gene, the achieved mean balanced accuracy (BACC) was 98.29% and NPV 99.25%, compared to minimap2's performance in a cross-validation scenario. Reducing the dictionary from 1024 to 145 changed BACC to 96.49% and the NPV to 98.15%. Obtained NLP model, validated on an external independent genome sequencing dataset, gave NPV of 99.64% for complete and 95.87% for reduced dictionary. The salmon-estimated read counts differed from the classical approach on average by 3.48% for the complete dictionary and by 5.82% for the reduced one. We conclude that for long Oxford Nanopore reads, an NLP-based approach can successfully replace classical mapping in case of emergency. The developed NLP model can be easily retrained to identify selected transcripts and/or work with various long-read sequencing techniques. Our results of the study clearly demonstrate the potential of applying techniques known from classical text processing to nucleotide sequences and represent a significant advancement in this field of science.</description>

      <title>QuST-LLM: Integrating Large Language Models for Comprehensive Spatial Transcriptomics Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce QuST-LLM, an innovative extension of QuPath that utilizes the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to analyze and interpret spatial transcriptomics (ST) data. This tool effectively simplifies the intricate and high-dimensional nature of ST data by offering a comprehensive workflow that includes data loading, region selection, gene expression analysis, and functional annotation. QuST-LLM employs LLMs to transform complex ST data into understandable and detailed biological narratives based on gene ontology annotations, thereby significantly improving the interpretability of ST data. Consequently, users can interact with their own ST data using natural language. Hence, QuST-LLM provides researchers with a potent functionality to unravel the spatial and functional complexities of tissues, fostering novel insights and advancements in biomedical research.</description>

      <title>PathoLM: Identifying pathogenicity from the DNA sequence through the Genome Foundation Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13133v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pathogen identification is pivotal in diagnosing, treating, and preventing diseases, crucial for controlling infections and safeguarding public health. Traditional alignment-based methods, though widely used, are computationally intense and reliant on extensive reference databases, often failing to detect novel pathogens due to their low sensitivity and specificity. Similarly, conventional machine learning techniques, while promising, require large annotated datasets and extensive feature engineering and are prone to overfitting. Addressing these challenges, we introduce PathoLM, a cutting-edge pathogen language model optimized for the identification of pathogenicity in bacterial and viral sequences. Leveraging the strengths of pre-trained DNA models such as the Nucleotide Transformer, PathoLM requires minimal data for fine-tuning, thereby enhancing pathogen detection capabilities. It effectively captures a broader genomic context, significantly improving the identification of novel and divergent pathogens. We developed a comprehensive data set comprising approximately 30 species of viruses and bacteria, including ESKAPEE pathogens, seven notably virulent bacterial strains resistant to antibiotics. Additionally, we curated a species classification dataset centered specifically on the ESKAPEE group. In comparative assessments, PathoLM dramatically outperforms existing models like DciPatho, demonstrating robust zero-shot and few-shot capabilities. Furthermore, we expanded PathoLM-Sp for ESKAPEE species classification, where it showed superior performance compared to other advanced deep learning methods, despite the complexities of the task.</description>

      <title>RNA-FrameFlow: Flow Matching for de novo 3D RNA Backbone Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13839v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce RNA-FrameFlow, the first generative model for 3D RNA backbone design. We build upon SE(3) flow matching for protein backbone generation and establish protocols for data preparation and evaluation to address unique challenges posed by RNA modeling. We formulate RNA structures as a set of rigid-body frames and associated loss functions which account for larger, more conformationally flexible RNA backbones (13 atoms per nucleotide) vs. proteins (4 atoms per residue). Toward tackling the lack of diversity in 3D RNA datasets, we explore training with structural clustering and cropping augmentations. Additionally, we define a suite of evaluation metrics to measure whether the generated RNA structures are globally self-consistent (via inverse folding followed by forward folding) and locally recover RNA-specific structural descriptors. The most performant version of RNA-FrameFlow generates locally realistic RNA backbones of 40-150 nucleotides, over 40% of which pass our validity criteria as measured by a self-consistency TM-score &gt;= 0.45, at which two RNAs have the same global fold.

      <title>Inverse population genetic problems with noise: inferring extent and structure of haplotype blocks from point allele frequencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14432v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A haplotype block, or simply a block, is a chromosomal segment, DNA base sequence or string that occurs in only a few variants or types in the genomes of a population of interest, and that has an encapsulated or 'private' frequency distribution of the string types that is not shared by neighbouring blocks or regions on the same chromosome. We consider two inverse problems of genetic interest: from just the frequencies of the symbol types (4 base types, possible single-base alleles) at each position (point, base/nucleotide) along the string, infer the location of the left and right boundaries of the block (block extent), and the number and relative frequencies of the string types occurring in the block (block structure). The large majority of variable positions in human and also other (e.g., fungal) genomes appear to be biallelic, i.e., the position allows only a choice between two possible symbols. The symbols can then be encoded as 0 (major) and 1 (minor), or as $\uparrow$ and $\downarrow$ as in Ising models, so the scenario reduces to problems on Boolean strings/bitstrings and Boolean matrices. The specifying of major allele frequencies (MAF) as used in genetics fits naturally into this framework. A simple example from human chromosome 9 is presented.</description>

      <title>Compressed representation of brain genetic transcription</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.16113v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The architecture of the brain is too complex to be intuitively surveyable without the use of compressed representations that project its variation into a compact, navigable space. The task is especially challenging with high-dimensional data, such as gene expression, where the joint complexity of anatomical and transcriptional patterns demands maximum compression. Established practice is to use standard principal component analysis (PCA), whose computational felicity is offset by limited expressivity, especially at great compression ratios. Employing whole-brain, voxel-wise Allen Brain Atlas transcription data, here we systematically compare compressed representations based on the most widely supported linear and non-linear methods-PCA, kernel PCA, non-negative matrix factorization (NMF), t-stochastic neighbour embedding (t-SNE), uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP), and deep auto-encoding-quantifying reconstruction fidelity, anatomical coherence, and predictive utility with respect to signalling, microstructural, and metabolic targets. We show that deep auto-encoders yield superior representations across all metrics of performance and target domains, supporting their use as the reference standard for representing transcription patterns in the human brain.</description>

      <title>STimage-1K4M: A histopathology image-gene expression dataset for spatial transcriptomics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06393v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in multi-modal algorithms have driven and been driven by the increasing availability of large image-text datasets, leading to significant strides in various fields, including computational pathology. However, in most existing medical image-text datasets, the text typically provides high-level summaries that may not sufficiently describe sub-tile regions within a large pathology image. For example, an image might cover an extensive tissue area containing cancerous and healthy regions, but the accompanying text might only specify that this image is a cancer slide, lacking the nuanced details needed for in-depth analysis. In this study, we introduce STimage-1K4M, a novel dataset designed to bridge this gap by providing genomic features for sub-tile images. STimage-1K4M contains 1,149 images derived from spatial transcriptomics data, which captures gene expression information at the level of individual spatial spots within a pathology image. Specifically, each image in the dataset is broken down into smaller sub-image tiles, with each tile paired with 15,000-30,000 dimensional gene expressions. With 4,293,195 pairs of sub-tile images and gene expressions, STimage-1K4M offers unprecedented granularity, paving the way for a wide range of advanced research in multi-modal data analysis an innovative applications in computational pathology, and beyond.</description>
