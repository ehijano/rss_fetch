      <title>Consistent Conjectures in Dynamic Matching Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a framework to study stability notions for two-sided dynamic matching markets in which matching is one-to-one and irreversible. The framework gives centerstage to the set of matchings an agent anticipates would ensue should they remain unmatched, which we refer to as the agent's conjectures. A collection of conjectures, together with a pairwise stability and individual rationality requirement given the conjectures, defines a solution concept for the economy. We identify a sufficient condition--consistency--for a family of conjectures to lead to a nonempty solution (cf. Hafalir, 2008). As an application, we introduce two families of consistent conjectures and their corresponding solution concepts: continuation-value-respecting dynamic stability, and the extension to dynamic markets of the solution concept in Hafalir (2008), sophisticated dynamic stability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We design mechanisms for maintaining public goods which require periodic non-monetary contributions. Utilitarian welfare is maximized by concentrating contributions among low-cost group members, but such policies generally induce some members to leave the group or misreport their preferences. To forestall exit, contributions must be shifted from members with intermediate costs to some high-cost members. To deter misreporting, members must be screened using up to two membership tiers, which reward larger contributions with increased access to the good. We apply our results to the design of platforms such as Netflix and TikTok hosting crowd-sourced recommendation engines, which function as public goods supported by user feedback about new content.</description>

      <title>Pattern formation by advection-diffusion in new economic geography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new economic geography model is proposed in which the migration of mobile workers is proximate and perturbed by non-economic factors. The model consists of a tractable core-periphery model assuming a quasi-linear log utility function of consumers and an advection-diffusion equation governing the time evolution of a population distribution. The stability of a spatially homogeneous stationary solution and the large time behavior of solutions to the model on a one-dimensional periodic space are investigated. When the spatially homogeneous stationary solution is unstable, solutions starting around it are found to eventually form spatial patterns with several urban areas in which mobile workers agglomerate.</description>

      <title>Fair Money -- Public Good Value Pricing With Karma Economies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: City road infrastructure is a public good, and over-consumption by self-interested, rational individuals leads to traffic jams. Congestion pricing is effective in reducing demand to sustainable levels, but also controversial, as it introduces equity issues and systematically discriminates lower-income groups. Karma is a non-monetary, fair, and efficient resource allocation mechanism, that employs an artificial currency different from money, that incentivizes cooperation amongst selfish individuals, and achieves a balance between giving and taking. Where money does not do its job, Karma achieves socially more desirable resource allocations by being aligned with consumers' needs rather than their financial power. This work highlights the value proposition of Karma, gives guidance on important Karma mechanism design elements, and equips the reader with a useful software framework to model Karma economies and predict consumers' behaviour. A case study demonstrates the potential of this feasible alternative to money, without the burden of additional fees.</description>

      <title>Basins of Attraction in Two-Player Random Ordinal Potential Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05460v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the class of two-person ordinal potential games where each player has the same number of actions $K$. Each game in this class admits at least one pure Nash equilibrium and the best-response dynamics converges to one of these pure Nash equilibria; which one depends on the starting point. So, each pure Nash equilibrium has a basin of attraction.
  We pick uniformly at random one game from this class and we study the joint distribution of the sizes of the basins of attraction. We provide an asymptotic exact value for the expected basin of attraction of each pure Nash equilibrium, when the number of actions $K$ goes to infinity.</description>

      <title>Specifying a Game-Theoretic Extensive Form as an Abstract 5-ary Relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.10801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2107.10801v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper specifies an extensive form as a 5-ary relation (that is, as a set of quintuples) which satisfies eight abstract axioms. Each quintuple is understood to list a player, a situation (that is, a name for an information set), a decision node, an action, and a successor node. Accordingly, the axioms are understood to specify abstract relationships between players, situations, nodes, and actions. Such an extensive form is called a "pentaform". Finally, a "pentaform game" is defined to be a pentaform together with utility functions.
  To ground this new specification in the literature, the paper defines the concept of a "traditional game" to represent the literature's many specifications of finite-horizon and infinite-horizon games. The paper's main result is to construct an intuitive bijection between pentaform games and traditional games. Secondary results concern disaggregating pentaforms by subsets, constructing pentaforms by unions, and initial pentaform applications to Selten subgames and perfect-recall (an extensive application to dynamic programming is in Streufert 2023, arXiv:2302.03855).</description>

      <title>Risk Aversion and Insurance Propensity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.09173v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a new foundation of risk aversion by showing that the propension to exploit insurance opportunities fully describes this attitude. Our foundation, which applies to any probabilistically sophisticated preference, well accords with the commonly held prudential interpretation of risk aversion that dates back to the seminal works of Arrow (1963) and Pratt (1964).
  In our main results, we first characterize the Arrow-Pratt risk aversion in terms of propension to full insurance and the stronger notion of risk aversion of Rothschild and Stiglitz (1970) in terms of propension to partial insurance. We then extend the analysis to comparative risk aversion by showing that the notion of Yaari (1969) corresponds to comparative propension to full insurance, while the stronger notion of Ross (1981) corresponds to comparative propension to partial insurance.</description>

      <title>An extension of May's Theorem to three alternatives: axiomatizing Minimax voting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14256v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: May's Theorem [K. O. May, Econometrica 20 (1952) 680-684] characterizes majority voting on two alternatives as the unique preferential voting method satisfying several simple axioms. Here we show that by adding some desirable axioms to May's axioms, we can uniquely determine how to vote on three alternatives (setting aside tiebreaking). In particular, we add two axioms stating that the voting method should mitigate spoiler effects and avoid the so-called strong no show paradox. We prove a theorem stating that any preferential voting method satisfying our enlarged set of axioms, which includes some weak homogeneity and preservation axioms, must choose from among the Minimax winners in all three-alternative elections. When applied to more than three alternatives, our axioms also distinguish Minimax from other known voting methods that coincide with or refine Minimax for three alternatives.</description>

      <title>Fuzzy Classification Aggregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17620v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem where a set of individuals has to classify $m$ objects into $p$ categories and does so by aggregating the individual classifications. We show that if $m\geq 3$, $m\geq p\geq 2$, and classifications are fuzzy, that is, objects belong to a category to a certain degree, then an optimal and independent aggregator rule that satisfies a weak unanimity condition belongs to the family of Weighted Arithmetic Means. We also obtain characterization results for $m= p= 2$.</description>

      <title>Data Trade and Consumer Privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12457v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies optimal mechanisms for collecting and trading data. Consumers benefit from revealing information about their tastes to a service provider because this improves the service. However, the information is also valuable to a third party as it may extract more revenue from the consumer in another market called the product market. The paper characterizes the constrained optimal mechanism for the service provider subject to incentive feasibility. It is shown that the service provider sometimes sells no information or only partial information in order to preserve profits in the service market. In a general setup, the service provision distortion and no-price discrimination in the product market are exclusive. Moreover, a ban on data trade may reduce social welfare because it makes it harder to price discriminate in the product market.</description>

      <title>On Connected Strongly-Proportional Cake-Cutting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15326v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the problem of fairly dividing a divisible heterogeneous resource, also known as a cake, among a set of agents who may have different entitlements. We characterize the existence of a connected strongly-proportional allocation -- one in which every agent receives a contiguous piece worth strictly more than their proportional share. The characterization is supplemented with an algorithm that determines its existence using O(n * 2^n) queries. We devise a simpler characterization for agents with strictly positive valuations and with equal entitlements, and present an algorithm to determine the existence of such an allocation using O(n^2) queries. We provide matching lower bounds in the number of queries for both algorithms. When a connected strongly-proportional allocation exists, we show that it can also be computed using a similar number of queries. We also consider the problem of deciding the existence of a connected allocation of a cake in which each agent receives a piece worth a small fixed value more than their proportional share, and the problem of deciding the existence of a connected strongly-proportional allocation of a pie.</description>

      <title>Incentive-Compatible Vertiport Reservation in Advanced Air Mobility: An Auction-Based Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18166v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rise of advanced air mobility (AAM) is expected to become a multibillion-dollar industry in the near future. Market-based mechanisms are touted to be an integral part of AAM operations, which comprise heterogeneous operators with private valuations. In this work, we study the problem of designing a mechanism to coordinate the movement of electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft, operated by multiple operators each having heterogeneous valuations associated with their fleet, between vertiports, while enforcing the arrival, departure, and parking constraints at vertiports. Particularly, we propose an incentive-compatible and individually rational vertiport reservation mechanism that maximizes a social welfare metric, which encapsulates the objective of maximizing the overall valuations of all operators while minimizing the congestion at vertiports. Additionally, we improve the computational tractability of designing the reservation mechanism by proposing a mixed binary linear programming approach that is based on constructing network flow graph corresponding to the underlying problem.</description>
