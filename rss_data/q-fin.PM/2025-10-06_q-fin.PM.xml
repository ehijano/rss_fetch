      <title>Do Mutual Funds Make Active and Skilled Liquidity Choices in Portfolio Management? Evidence from India</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines active liquidity management by Indian open-ended equity mutual funds. We find that fund managers respond to inflows by increasing cash holdings, which are later used to purchase less-liquid stocks at favourable valuations. Funds with less liquid portfolios tend to maintain larger cash reserves to manage flows. Funds that make active liquidity choices yield statistically and economically significant gross and net returns. The performance differences between funds with varying activeness in altering liquidity highlight the importance of active liquidity management in markets with substantial cross-sectional liquidity differences such as India.</description>

      <title>Signature-Informed Transformer for Asset Allocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robust asset allocation is a key challenge in quantitative finance, where deep-learning forecasters often fail due to objective mismatch and error amplification. We introduce the Signature-Informed Transformer (SIT), a novel framework that learns end-to-end allocation policies by directly optimizing a risk-aware financial objective. SIT's core innovations include path signatures for a rich geometric representation of asset dynamics and a signature-augmented attention mechanism embedding financial inductive biases, like lead-lag effects, into the model. Evaluated on daily S\&amp;P 100 equity data, SIT decisively outperforms traditional and deep-learning baselines, especially when compared to predict-then-optimize models. These results indicate that portfolio-aware objectives and geometry-aware inductive biases are essential for risk-aware capital allocation in machine-learning systems.

      <title>MarketSenseAI 2.0: Enhancing Stock Analysis through LLM Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00415v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: MarketSenseAI is a novel framework for holistic stock analysis which leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to process financial news, historical prices, company fundamentals and the macroeconomic environment to support decision making in stock analysis and selection. In this paper, we present the latest advancements on MarketSenseAI, driven by rapid technological expansion in LLMs. Through a novel architecture combining Retrieval-Augmented Generation and LLM agents, the framework processes SEC filings and earnings calls, while enriching macroeconomic analysis through systematic processing of diverse institutional reports. We demonstrate a significant improvement in fundamental analysis accuracy over the previous version. Empirical evaluation on S\&amp;P 100 stocks over two years (2023-2024) shows MarketSenseAI achieving cumulative returns of 125.9% compared to the index return of 73.5%, while maintaining comparable risk profiles. Further validation on S\&amp;P 500 stocks during 2024 demonstrates the framework's scalability, delivering a 33.8% higher Sortino ratio than the market. This work marks a significant advancement in applying LLM technology to financial analysis, offering insights into the robustness of LLM-driven investment strategies.</description>
