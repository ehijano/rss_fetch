      <title>Paraplume: A fast and accurate paratope prediction method provides insights into repertoire-scale binding dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The specific region of an antibody responsible for binding to an antigen, known as the paratope, is essential for immune recognition. Accurate identification of this small yet critical region can accelerate the development of therapeutic antibodies. Determining paratope locations typically relies on modeling the antibody structure, which is computationally intensive and difficult to scale across large antibody repertoires. We introduce Paraplume, a sequence-based paratope prediction method that leverages embeddings from protein language models (PLMs), without the need for structural input and achieves superior performance across multiple benchmarks compared to current methods. In addition, reweighting PLM embeddings using Paraplume predictions yields more informative sequence representations, improving downstream tasks such as affinity prediction, binder classification, and epitope binning. Applied to large antibody repertoires, Paraplume reveals that antigen-specific somatic hypermutations are associated with larger paratopes, suggesting a potential mechanism for affinity enhancement. Our findings position PLM-based paratope prediction as a powerful, scalable alternative to structure-dependent approaches, opening new avenues for understanding antibody evolution.</description>

      <title>Physicochemically Informed Dual-Conditioned Generative Model of T-Cell Receptor Variable Regions for Cellular Therapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05747v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physicochemically informed biological sequence generation has the potential to accelerate computer-aided cellular therapy, yet current models fail to \emph{jointly} ensure novelty, diversity, and biophysical plausibility when designing variable regions of T-cell receptors (TCRs). We present \textbf{PhysicoGPTCR}, a large generative protein Transformer that is \emph{dual-conditioned} on peptide and HLA context and trained to autoregressively synthesise TCR sequences while embedding residue-level physicochemical descriptors. The model is optimised on curated TCR--peptide--HLA triples with a maximum-likelihood objective and compared against ANN, GPTCR, LSTM, and VAE baselines. Across multiple neoantigen benchmarks, PhysicoGPTCR substantially improves edit-distance, similarity, and longest-common-subsequence scores, while populating a broader region of sequence space. Blind in-silico docking and structural modelling further reveal a higher proportion of binding-competent clones than the strongest baseline, validating the benefit of explicit context conditioning and physicochemical awareness. Experimental results demonstrate that dual-conditioned, physics-grounded generative modelling enables end-to-end design of functional TCR candidates, reducing the discovery timeline from months to minutes without sacrificing wet-lab verifiability.</description>
