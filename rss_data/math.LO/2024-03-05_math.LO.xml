      <title>Modal weak Kleene logics: axiomatizations and relational semantics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weak Kleene logics are three-valued logics characterized by the presence of an infectious truth-value. In their external versions, as they were originally introduced by Bochvar and Hallden, these systems are equipped with an additional connective capable of expressing whether a formula is classically true. In this paper we further expand the expressive power of external weak Kleen logics by modalizing them with a unary operator. The addition of an alethic modality gives rise to the two systems $\B^{\square}$ and $MPWK$, which have two different readings of the modal operator. We provide these logics with a complete and decidable Hilbert-style axiomatization w.r.t. a three-valued possible worlds semantics. The starting point of these calculi are new axiomatizations for the non-modal bases B and PWKe, which we provide using the recent algebraization results about these two logics. In particular, we prove the algebraizability of $\PWKe$. Finally some standard extensions of the basic modal systems are provided with their completeness results w.r.t. special classes of frames.</description>

      <title>On fresh sets in iterations of Prikry type forcing notions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the existence (and mostly non-existence) of fresh sets in commonly used iterations of Prikry type forcing notions. Results of [4] are generalized. As an application, a question of a referee of [9] is answered. In addition stationary sets preservation is addressed.</description>

      <title>A Type Theory with a Tiny Object</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01939v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an extension of Martin-L\"of Type Theory that contains a tiny object; a type for which there is a right adjoint to the formation of function types as well as the expected left adjoint. We demonstrate the practicality of this type theory by proving various properties related to tininess internally and suggest a few potential applications.</description>

      <title>A new perspective on semi-retractions and the Ramsey property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.10991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.10991v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the notion of a semi-retraction between two first order structures (in typically different signatures) that was introduced by the second author as a link between the Ramsey property and generalized indiscernible sequences. We further these connections between combinatorics and model theory, and look at semi-retractions through a new lens establishing transfers of the Ramsey property and finite Ramsey degrees under quite general conditions that are optimal as demonstrated by counterexamples. Finally, we compare semi-retractions to the category theoretic notion of a pre-adjunction.</description>

      <title>Does $\mathsf{DC}$ imply $\mathsf{AC}_\omega$, uniformly?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.06676v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Axiom of Dependent Choice $\mathsf{DC}$ and the Axiom of Countable Choice $\mathsf{AC}_\omega$ are two weak forms of the Axiom of Choice that can be stated for a specific set: $\mathsf{DC}(X)$ asserts that any total binary relation on $X$ has an infinite chain, while $\mathsf{AC}_\omega (X)$ asserts that any countable collection of nonempty subsets of $X$ has a choice function. It is well-known that $\mathsf{DC} \Rightarrow \mathsf{AC}_\omega$. We study for which sets and under which hypotheses $\mathsf{DC}(X) \Rightarrow \mathsf{AC}_\omega (X)$, and then we show it is consistent with $\mathsf{ZF}$ that there is a set $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ for which $\mathsf{DC} (A)$ holds, but $\mathsf{AC}_\omega (A)$ fails.</description>

      <title>High stationarity and derived topologies on $\mathcal{P}_{\kappa}(A)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00805v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\kappa$ be an uncountable regular cardinal, $\kappa \subseteq A$. We study a notion of $n$-stationarity on $\mathcal{P}_{\kappa}(A)$. We construct a sequence of topologies $\langle \tau_0, \tau_1, \dots \rangle $ on $\mathcal{P}_{\kappa}(A)$ characterising the simultaneous reflection of a pair of $n$-stationary sets in terms of elements in the base of $\tau_n$. This result constitutes a complete generalisation to the context of $\mathcal{P}_{\kappa}(A)$ of Bagaria's prior characterisation of $n$-simultaneous reflection in terms of derived topologies on ordinals.</description>

      <title>Nelson algebras, residuated lattices and rough sets: A survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02606v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Over the past 50 years, Nelson algebras have been extensively studied by distinguished scholars as the algebraic counterpart of Nelson's constructive logic with strong negation. Despite these studies, a comprehensive survey of the topic is currently lacking, and the theory of Nelson algebras remains largely unknown to most logicians. This paper aims to fill this gap by focussing on the essential developments in the field over the past two decades. Additionally, we explore generalisations of Nelson algebras, such as N4-lattices which correspond to the paraconsistent version of Nelson's logic, as well as their applications to other areas of interest to logicians, such as duality and rough set theory. A general representation theorem states that each Nelson algebra is isomorphic to a subalgebra of a rough set-based Nelson algebra induced by a quasiorder. Furthermore, a formula is a theorem of Nelson logic if and only if it is valid in every finite Nelson algebra induced by a quasiorder.</description>

      <title>Categoricity and amalgamation for AEC and $ \kappa $ measurable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/math/9602216</link>
      <description>arXiv:math/9602216v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the original version of this paper, we assume a theory $T$ that the logic $\mathbb L_{\kappa, \aleph_{0}}$ is categorical in a cardinal $\lambda &gt; \kappa$, and $\kappa$ is a measurable cardinal. There we prove that the class of model of $T$ of cardinality $&lt;\lambda$ (but $\geq |T|+\kappa$) has the amalgamation property; this is a step toward understanding the character of such classes of models.
  In this revised version we replaced the class of models of $T$ by $\mathfrak k$, an AEC (abstract elementary class) which has LS-number ${&lt;} \, \kappa,$ or at least which behave nicely for ultrapowers by $D$, a normal ultra-filter on $\kappa$.
  Presently sub-section \S1A deals with $T \subseteq \mathbb L_{\kappa^{+}, \aleph_{0}}$ (and so does a large part of the introduction and little in the rest of \S1), but otherwise, all is done in the context of AEC.</description>

      <title>Moser-Tardos Algorithm with small number of random bits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.05888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.05888v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a variant of the parallel Moser-Tardos Algorithm. We prove that if we restrict attention to a class of problems whose dependency graphs have subexponential growth, then the expected total number of random bits used by the algorithm is constant; in particular, it is independent from the number of variables. This is achieved by using the same random bits to resample variables which are far enough in the dependency graph.
  There are two corollaries. First, we obtain a deterministic algorithm for finding a satisfying assignment, which for any class of problems as in the previous paragraph runs in time O(n), where n is the number of variables. Second, we present a Borel version of the Lov\'asz Local Lemma.</description>

      <title>Model theory in compactly generated (tensor-)triangulated categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.10629v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give an account of model theory in the context of compactly generated triangulated and tensor-triangulated categories ${\cal T}$. We describe pp formulas, pp-types and free realisations in such categories and we prove elimination of quantifiers and elimination of imaginaries. We compare the ways in which definable subcategories of ${\cal T}$ may be specified. Then we link definable subcategories of ${\cal T}$ and finite-type torsion theories on the category of modules over the compact objects of ${\cal T}$. We briefly consider spectra and dualities. If ${\cal T}$ is tensor-triangulated then new features appear, in particular there is an internal duality in rigidly-compactly generated tensor-triangulated categories.</description>

      <title>Local vs. global Lipschitz geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.11830v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we prove that for a definable set in an o-minimal structure with connected link (at 0 or infinity), the inner distance of the link is equivalent to the inner distance of the set restricted to the link. With this result, we obtain several consequences. We present also several relations between the local and the global Lipschitz geometry of singularities. For instance, we prove that two sets in Euclidean spaces, not necessarily definable in an o-minimal structure, are outer lipeomorphic if and only if their stereographic modifications are outer lipeomorphic if and only if their inversions are outer lipeomorphic.</description>
