      <title>Dynamic Risk Assessment for the Wildland-Urban Interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wildland-Urban Interface (WUI) fires represent a compound disaster resulting from the interactions between natural ecosystems and human settlements, characterized by significantly dynamic evolving risks. However, most current risk assessment studies are based on static frameworks, which struggle to effectively capture the dynamic changes in risk over time. To address this issue, this paper proposes an innovative method that integrates a dynamic evaluation matrix, grey incidence analysis, and an optimization model for the dynamic risk assessment of WUI fires. This method incorporates time-series data by constructing a dynamic evaluation matrix, subsequently calculates the weighted standardized matrix for each evaluated area and its local volume matrices relative to the positive and negative ideal matrices. The dynamic differences between the evaluated areas and the ideal state are quantified by calculating the grey incidence degree, and an optimization model is established to solve for the superiority degree used for risk ranking. Research demonstrates that this method not only simplifies the computational process but also effectively captures the dynamic evolution patterns of fire risk across different areas, enabling refined risk classification. Compared to existing static methods, this framework overcomes their limitation in adequately representing risk dynamics, providing a more scientific basis for decision-making in the dynamic management and proactive prevention and control of WUI fires.</description>

      <title>Towards modelling lifetime default risk: Exploring different subtypes of recurrent event Cox-regression models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01044v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the pursuit of modelling a loan's probability of default (PD) over its lifetime, repeat default events are often ignored when using Cox Proportional Hazard (PH) models. Excluding such events may produce biased and inaccurate PD-estimates, which can compromise financial buffers against future losses. Accordingly, we investigate a few subtypes of Cox-models that can incorporate recurrent default events. Using South African mortgage data, we explore both the Andersen-Gill (AG) and the Prentice-Williams-Peterson (PWP) spell-time models. These models are compared against a baseline that deliberately ignores recurrent events, called the time to first default (TFD) model. Models are evaluated using Harrell's c-statistic, adjusted Cox-Sell residuals, and a novel extension of time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. From these Cox-models, we demonstrate how to derive a portfolio-level term-structure of default risk, which is a series of marginal PD-estimates at each point of the average loan's lifetime. While the TFD- and PWP-models do not differ significantly across all diagnostics, the AG-model underperformed expectations. Depending on the prevalence of recurrent defaults, one may therefore safely ignore them when estimating lifetime default risk. Accordingly, our work enhances the current practice of using Cox-modelling in producing timeous and accurate PD-estimates under IFRS 9.</description>
