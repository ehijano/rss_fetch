      <title>On the Hidden Transient Interphase in Metal Anodes: Dynamic Precipitation Controls Electrochemical Interfaces in Batteries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Solid-Electrolyte Interphase, SEI, formed on a battery electrode has been a central area of research for decades. This thin, complex layer profoundly impacts the electrochemical deposition morphology and stability of the metal in battery anodes. Departing from conventional approaches, we investigate metal dissolution, the reverse reaction of deposition, in battery environments using a state-of-the-art electroanalytical system combining a rotating-disk electrode and in-operando visualization. Our key finding is the presence of a Transient Solid-Electrolyte Interphase, T-SEI, that forms during fast discharging at high dissolution rates. We attribute T-SEI formation to transient local supersaturation and resultant electrolyte salt deposition. The T-SEI fundamentally alters the dissolution kinetics at the electrochemical interface, leading to a self-limiting morphological evolution and eventually yielding a flat, clean surface. Unlike a classical SEI formed due to electrolyte decomposition, the T-SEI is fully relaxable upon removal of the enforced dissolution current. The formation of T-SEI, surprisingly, plays a critical role in the subsequent electrodeposition. When the metal is redeposited on a fully relaxed T-SEI surface, the morphology is remarkably different from that deposited on pristine or low-rate discharged metal electrodes. Electron backscatter diffraction analysis suggests a homoepitaxial relationship with the original grains in the electrode. This is in stark contrast to the isolated, particulate nuclei seen on standard metal electrodes without T-SEI formation. Our findings provide important insights into the electrochemical kinetics at the metal-electrolyte interface, particularly in concentrated or water-in-salt electrolytes that are close to the salt saturation limit. The results suggest a new dimension for electrochemical engineering in batteries.</description>

      <title>Fundamental Microscopic Properties as Predictors of Grain Boundary Energy Trends</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Correlations between fundamental microscopic properties computable from first principles, which we term canonical properties, and complex large-scale quantities of interest (QoIs) provide an avenue to predictive materials discovery. We propose that such correlations can be discovered through simulations with efficient approximate interatomic potentials (IPs), which serve as an ensemble of "synthetic materials." As a proof of concept we build a regression model relating canonical properties to the symmetric tilt grain boundary (GB) energy curves in face-centered cubic crystals characterized by the scaling factor in the universal lattice matching model of Runnels et al. (2016), which we take to be our QoI. Our analysis recovers known correlations of GB energy to other properties and discovers new ones. We also demonstrate, using available density functional theory (DFT) GB energy data, that the regression model constructed from IP data is consistent with DFT results confirming the assumption that the IPs and DFT belong to same statistical pool, thereby validating the approach.</description>

      <title>Study of helium diffusion in yttria: A multiscale approach based on the density functional theory and kinetic Monte Carlo, with transmission electron microscopy and thermo-desorption spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A known issue for future nuclear reactors is helium accumulation inside the steel structure materials, responsible for structural issues such as embrittlement and cracking. One possible solution is using new types of reinforced steel, such as oxide dispersion strengthened (ODS) steel. It consists of adding oxide nanoparticles to the Fe-based material, especially yttrium oxide (yttria, Y$_2$O$_3$), improving its properties. Therefore, one first step is understanding the helium diffusion inside this system. Very little is known about helium inside yttria, with most studies being theoretical ones. Based on this context, this work proposes a combined theoretical and experimental multiscale approach to investigate helium diffusion inside yttria.
  The theoretical approach starts with the density functional theory, used to model the atomic yttria cell and determine helium insertion sites. The transitions between the sites were described using the NEB method. Kinetic Monte Carlo was then employed to obtain the interstitial diffusion coefficient expression. It showed a limited diffusion at temperatures below 600 K, which may indicate a tendency for He to be blocked in the oxide. Then, the charged vacancies were explored. It showed that the vacancy further reduces helium diffusion. Finally, it was demonstrated that helium spreads across different vacancies and interstitial sites. The experimental part involved implanting helium ions at 50 keV in samples with nanometric or micrometric grains. Then, the specimens were characterised with transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and thermo-desorption spectroscopy (TDS) techniques. TEM did not evidence detectable bubbles even at the highest studied fluence (1\time 10^{16}$ cm$^{-2}$). The TDS highlighted different mechanisms for helium diffusion and the grain size's role, providing a model for diffusion coefficient calculation based on interstitial diffusion.</description>

      <title>Rate-Dependent Tensile Response of Polyvinyl Chloride Geomembranes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the challenge that face the effectiveness of Polyvinyl Chloride geomembranes (PVC GMs) as a hydraulic barrier is the capacity to withstand unexpected mechanical actions, particularly tensile forces, during installation and throughout their lifespan. These forces pose risks of premature failure and impermeability degradation. In this study, the characterization of the short and long-term mechanical response of PVC GMs to uniaxial tensile forces has been investigated. Uniaxial tensile test have been performed for tensile rates spanning several orders of magnitude. Analysis of the true stress-strain curves reveals a significant decrease in tensile modulus, strength, and strain at failure at low strain rates, which are relatively close to those applied in situ. Long-term investigations have been conducted as well, through relaxation tests. Our key results unveil two distinct characteristic times in stress relaxation, with the fast relaxation occurring over the first four hours. During this phase, the pre-relaxation loading rate affects the relaxation behavior. Beyond this phase, the relaxation behavior becomes independent from the pre-relaxation loading rate. Burger's rheological model is proposed to measure the stress relaxation at different rates. The model's results validate the existence of two characteristic times.</description>

      <title>A Versatile System for Photoconductance Decay Measurement Across a Wide Range of Semiconductor Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-resolved photoconductivity is widely used to characterize non-equilibrium charge-carrier lifetime, impurity content, and solar cell efficiency in a broad range of semiconductors. Most measurements are limited to the detection of reflection of electromagnetic radiation at a single frequency and a single photoexciting light wavelength. We present a time-resolved photoconductivity instrument that enables broadband frequency detection (essentially from DC to 100 GHz), temperature-dependent measurements, and multiple excitation photon energy. The measurement is realized with the help of a coplanar waveguide, which acts as an efficient antenna and whose performance was tested over 10 MHz-10 GHz. The instrument enables the study of surface and bulk charge-recombination specific processes.</description>

      <title>$\beta$ orientation reconstruction and shear deformation calculation in hcp-bcc-hcp phase transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a cluster-based technique to automate pixel-wise reconstruction of $\beta$ orientations from parent $\alpha$ orientations over large, indexed regions. This approach provides a valuable tool for analyzing problems that require historical information about current $\alpha$ microstructures, such as investigating variant selection mechanisms during the $\alpha \to \beta \to \alpha$ transformation. Additionally, we present a method for calculating deformation gradient variants associated with phase transformations between hcp ($\alpha$) and bcc ($\beta$) phases based upon a series of frame rotations and shape transformations. This method streamlines the integration of transformation kinematics into continuum-based models by enabling convenient computation of the deformation gradient governing the transformation.</description>

      <title>Magneto-optical evidence of tilting effect in coupled Weyl bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Theories have revealed the universality of the band tilting effect in topological Weyl semimetals (WSMs) and its implications for the material's physical properties. However, the experimental identification of tilted Weyl bands remains much less explored. Here, by combining magneto-infrared optical studies with a four-band coupled Weyl point model, we report spectroscopic evidence of the tilting effect in the well-established WSM niobium phosphide. Specifically, we observe Landau level transitions with rich features that are well reproduced within a model of coupled tilted Weyl points. Our analysis indicates that the tilting effect relaxes the selection rules and gives rise to transitions that would otherwise be forbidden in the non-tilt case. Additionally, we observe unconventional interband transitions with flat and negative magnetic field dispersions, highlighting the importance of coupling between Weyl points. Our results not only emphasize the significance of the tilting effect in the optical responses of WSMs but also demonstrate magneto-optics as an effective tool for probing the tilting effect in electronic band structures.</description>

      <title>Evolution of flat bands in two-dimensional fused pentagon network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Theoretical quest of flat-band tight-binding models usually relies on lattice structures on which electrons reside. Typical examples of candidate lattice structures include the Lieb-type lattices and the line graphs. Meanwhile, there can be accidental flat-band systems that belong to neither of such typical classes and deriving flat-band energies and wave functions for such systems is not straightforward. In this work, we investigate the characteristic band structure for the tight-binding model on a network composed of pentagonal rings, which is inspired by the theoretically-predicted carbon-based material. Although the lattice does not belong to conventional classes of flat band models, the exact flat bands appear only for fine-tuned parameters. We analytically derive the exact eigenenergies and eigenstates of the flat bands. By using the analytic form of the Bloch wave function, we construct the corresponding Wannier function and reveal its characteristic real-space profile. We also find that, even away from the exact flat-band limits, the nearly flat band exists near the Fermi level for the half-filled systems, which indicates that the present system will be a suitable platform for questing flat-band-induced correlated electron physics if it is realized in the real material.</description>

      <title>Apparent fractionation of isotopes in moderately cooled argon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fractionation of isotopes of natural Ar near the condensation (Tc) and freezing point has been studied using mass spectrometry (MS), numerical modeling and density functional theory. The heat of formation of 0.30, 0.52 and 0.70 kJ per Ar atom of the clusters Ar2, Ar3 and Ar4, respectively, shows the tendency of Ar to clusterization. At T &gt; Tc apparent separation coefficients {\alpha}40 = 0.80, {\alpha}38 = 1.07 and {\alpha}36 = 1.28 for 40Ar, 38Ar and 36Ar, respectively, are caused by the formation of dimers, which absence during the MS analysis at room temperature indicates their retention in the cryostat. At T &lt; Tc, fractionation increases ({\alpha}40 = 0.56, {\alpha}38 = 2.24 and {\alpha}36 = 1.67) due to a difference of 170-520 J/mol between the heat of condensation and dissolution of 38Ar and 36Ar in 40Ar condensate. The formation of a solid phase occurs with preferential freezing out of 40Ar ({\alpha}40 = 0.69, {\alpha}38 = 1.57 and {\alpha}36 = 1.42) for kinetic reasons.</description>

      <title>Unveiling New Mechanical Couplings in 3D Lattices: Axial-Bending and the Role of Symmetry Breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mechanical couplings with symmetry breaking open up novel applications such as robotic metamaterials and directional mechanical signal guidance. However, most studies on 3D mechanical couplings have been limited to ad-hoc axial-twist designs due to a lack of comprehensive understanding of 3D non-centrosymmetry and chirality. Few theoretical methods exist to identify and quantify mechanical couplings in non-centrosymmetric and chiral lattices, typically relying on crystal physics (point group symmetry) and generalized constitutive equations. By extending symmetry breaking to mirror and inversion symmetries, we identify a broader range of mechanical couplings beyond axial-twist, such as axial-bending couplings. We develop a generalized 3D micropolar model of curved cubic lattices, encompassing both non-centrosymmetric achiral and chiral geometries, to quantify anisotropic physical properties and mechanical couplings as functions of curvature and handedness. Integrating point group symmetry operations with micropolar homogenized constitutive equations for curved cubic lattices, including mirror and inversion symmetry breaking, provides a clear design framework for identifying and quantifying anisotropic physical properties and mechanical couplings beyond axial-twist. This study uncovers a novel axial-bending coupling in non-centrosymmetric structures and highlights the weak correlation between chirality and both axial-bending and axial-twisting couplings. It also offers design guidelines for achieving multimodal couplings. The relationship between metamaterials' geometry and physical properties aligns with Neumann's principle. This work presents a robust framework for understanding mechanical couplings related to symmetry breaking and spatial anisotropy in metamaterial design, drawing an analogy to crystal physics and crystal chemistry.</description>

      <title>A Recursive Hybrid Tetrahedron Method for Brillouin-zone Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A recursive extension of the hybrid tetrahedron method for Brillouin-zone integration is proposed, allowing iterative tetrahedron refinement and significantly reducing the error from the linear tetrahedron method. The Brillouin-zone integral is expressed as a weighted sum on the initial grid, with integral weights collected recursively from the finest grid. Our method is capable of simultaneously handling multiple singularities in the integrand and thus may provide practical solutions to various Brillouin-zone integral tasks encountered in realistic calculations, including the computation of response and spectral function with superior sampling convergence. We demonstrate its effectiveness through numerical calculations of the density response functions of two model Hamiltonians and one real material system, the face-centered cubic cobalt.</description>

      <title>A Generator of Neural Network Potential for Molecular Dynamics: Constructing Robust and Accurate Potentials with Active Learning for Nanosecond-scale Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural network potentials (NNPs) enable large-scale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of systems containing &gt;10,000 atoms with the accuracy comparable to ab initio methods and play a crucial role in material studies. Although NNPs are valuable for short-duration MD simulations, maintaining the stability of long-duration MD simulations remains challenging due to the uncharted regions of the potential energy surface (PES). Currently, there is no effective methodology to address this issue. To overcome this challenge, we developed an automatic generator of robust and accurate NNPs based on an active learning (AL) framework. This generator provides a fully integrated solution encompassing initial dataset creation, NNP training, evaluation, sampling of additional structures, screening, and labeling. Crucially, our approach uses a sampling strategy that focuses on generating unstable structures with short interatomic distances, combined with a screening strategy that efficiently samples these configurations based on interatomic distances and structural features. This approach greatly enhances the MD simulation stability, enabling nanosecond-scale simulations. We evaluated the performance of our NNP generator in terms of its MD simulation stability and physical properties by applying it to liquid propylene glycol (PG) and polyethylene glycol (PEG). The generated NNPs enable stable MD simulations of systems with &gt;10,000 atoms for 20 ns. The predicted physical properties, such as the density and self-diffusion coefficient, show excellent agreement with the experimental values. This work represents a remarkable advance in the generation of robust and accurate NNPs for organic materials, paving the way for long-duration MD simulations of complex systems.</description>

      <title>The Fe-N system: crystal structure prediction, phase stability, and mechanical properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nitriding introduces nitrides into the surface of steels, significantly enhancing the surface me-chanical properties. By combining the variable composition evolutionary algorithm and first-principles calculations based on density functional theory, 50 thermodynamically stable or metastable Fe-N compounds with various stoichiometric ratios were identified, exhibiting also dynamic and mechanical stability. The mechanical properties of these structures were systemati-cally studied, including the bulk modulus, shear modulus, Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio, Pugh's ratio, Cauchy pressure, Klemen parameters, universal elastic anisotropy, Debye tempera-ture, and Vickers hardness. All identified stable and metastable Fe-N compounds were found in the ductile region, with most exhibiting homogeneous elastic properties and isotropic metallic bonding. As the nitrogen concentration increases, their bulk moduli generally increase as well. The Vickers hardness values of Fe-N compounds range from 3.5 to 10.5 GPa, which are signifi-cantly higher than that of pure Fe (2.0 GPa), due to the stronger Fe-N bonds strength. This study provides insights into optimizing and designing Fe-N alloys with tailored mechanical properties.</description>

Abstract: Magnetic kagome lattices have attracted much attention recently due to the interplay of band topology with magnetism and electronic correlations, which give rise to a variety of exotic quantum states. A common structural distortion of the kagome lattice is the breathing mode, which can significantly influence the magnetism and band characteristics. However, the modulation of breathing mode and the associated topological phenomena remain rarely explored. Here, we demonstrate that the coupling of breathing modes with ferroelectricity, magnetism, and band topology in the M3X8 monolayer system enables electric field manipulation of topological spin structure and electronic states. The breathing mode mainly occurs in materials containing early 4d/5d transition metal elements and can be reversed or even suppressed via ferroelectric switching in low-barrier materials. Importantly, electric field-induced switching of the breathing mode can alter the chirality of the topological spin structure, or trigger a transition from a topological trivial insulator to a Chern insulator. This work paves the way for exploring novel physical phenomena driven by breathing modes in kagome materials.</description>

      <title>Chiral Phonons in 2D Halide Perovskites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phonons in chiral crystal structures can acquire a circular polarization, becoming chiral themselves. Chiral phonons carry a spin angular momentum, which is observable in heat currents, and, via coupling to the electron spin, in spin currents. Two-dimensional (2D) hybrid halide perovskites comprise a class of direct band gap semiconductors that can easily be forced into a chiral structure by incorporating chiral organic cations into the crystal. The degree of chirality can be tuned by modifying the organic cations. We reveal chiral phonons in such 2D perovskites, using on-the-fly machine-learning force fields based on density functional theory calculations. We find that particularly the low energy phonons, originating from the inorganic framework of the perovskites, are chiral. In the presence of a temperature gradient, a substantial angular momentum density can be induced, which is measurable in experiment.</description>

      <title>Adsorption of molecular hydrogen on honeycomb ZnO monolayers: A quantum density-functional theory perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the adsorption of molecular hydrogen on pristine zinc oxide (ZnO) platelets. The volumetric and gravimetric hydrogen storage capacities of the ZnO monolayers are evaluated in a broad range of thermodynamic conditions (i.e., for temperatures in the range 77 K &lt; T &lt; 450 K, and for external gas pressures up to 200 bar). The thermodynamic properties and the microscopic spatial distribution of the adsorbed hydrogen fluid are assessed within the density functional theory of liquids for quantum fluids at finite temperature (QLDFT), and the adsorption enthalphies are obtained by fitting the computed adsorption densities to the Toth model isotherm. Compared to graphene platelets, the ZnO sheets impose a rather tighter confinement to the motion of the hydrogen molecules parallel to the surface. The isosteric heat of adsorption approaches 3.2 kJ/mol in the low density regime. This quantity shows a fairly smooth dependence on the hydrogen uptake for temperatures below 100 K, while it is shown to depend quite sensitively on the adsorbate density above this temperature.</description>

      <title>Emergence of ferroelectric topological insulator as verified by quantum Hall effect of surface states in (Sn,Pb,In)Te films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emergent phenomena arising from nontrivial band structures based on topology and symmetry have been attracting keen interest in contemporary condensed-matter physics. Materials such as SnTe and PbTe are one such example, which demonstrate a topological phase transition while showing ferroelectric instability derived from their rock-salt structure. The ferroelectricity can lift the valley degeneracy, enabling the emergence of the Z2 topological insulator phase, although its observation in transport phenomena remains elusive. Here, we report magnetotransport properties of ferroelectric (Sn,Pb)Te thin films with finely-controlled Fermi levels via In doping. We identified the ferroelectric topological insulator phase from the observations of the quantum Hall states with filling factors of $\nu$ = 1, 2 and 3 with both spin- and valley-degeneracy lifting. The electronic states are two-dimensional, indicating the ferroelectricity-induced topological surface states with a single Dirac cone. The finding of the new topological state with ferroelectricity will further expand the field of topological physics and advance the development of functional properties, such as topological nonlinear photonics and nonreciprocal transport with memory effect.</description>

      <title>Engineering Work Function to Stabilize Metal Oxides in Reactive Hydrogen</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hydrogen, crucial for the green energy transition, poses a challenge due to its tendency to degrade surrounding wall materials. To harness hydrogen's potential, it is essential to identify materials' parameter(s) that modulate hydrogen-material interaction. In a recent publication, we have shown that the reduction (de-nitridation) of transition metal (TM)-nitrides in hydrogen radicals (H*) stops when their work function drops below a threshold limit. In this work, we tailor the work function of a complex TM-oxide by tuning the relative content of its constituent TM-atoms. We show that increasing the fraction of a low work function TM decreases the work function of the complex oxide, thereby decreasing its reducibility (de-oxidation) in H*. This leads to the stabilization of the higher oxidation states of a high work function TM, which otherwise readily reduce in H*. We propose that the work function serves as a tuneable parameter, modulating the interaction of hydrogen with TM compounds.</description>

      <title>On the distributed resistor-constant phase element transmission line in a reflective bounded domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we derive and study the analytical solution of the voltage and current diffusion equation for the case of a finite-length resistor-constant phase element (CPE) transmission line (TL) circuit that can represent a model for porous electrodes in the absence of any Faradic processes. The energy storage component is considered to be an elemental CPE per unit length of impedance $z_c(s)={1}/{(c_{\alpha} s^{\alpha})}$ instead of the ideal capacitor usually assumed in TL modeling. The problem becomes a time-fractional diffusion equation that we solve under galvanostatic charging, and derive from it a reduced impedance function of the form $z_{\alpha}(s_n)=s_n^{-\alpha/2}\coth({s_n^{\alpha/2}})$, where $s_n = j\omega_n$ is a normalized frequency. We also derive the system's step response, and the distribution function of relaxation times associated with it.</description>

      <title>High-precision Quantum Monte-Carlo study of charge transport in a lattice model of molecular organic semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use first-principle Quantum Monte-Carlo (QMC) simulations and numerical exact diagonalization to analyze the low-frequency charge carrier mobility within a simple tight-binding model of molecular organic semiconductors on a two-dimensional triangular lattice. These compounds feature transient localization, an unusual charge transport mechanism driven by dynamical disorder. The challenges of studying the transient localization of charge carriers in the low-frequency/long-time limit from first principles are discussed. We demonstrate that a combination of high-precision QMC data with prior estimates of frequency-dependent charge carrier mobility based on the static disorder approximation for phonon fields allows for improved estimates of mobility in the low-frequency limit. We also point out that a simple relaxation time approximation for charge mobility in organic semiconductors is not consistent with the QMC data. Physical similarities with charge transport in quark-gluon plasma are highlighted.</description>

      <title>Magnetic polaronic exciton in A-type 2D van der Waals bulk material CrSBr</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 2D magnetic semiconductor CrSBr exhibits unique magneto-optical properties, yet its electronic structure and photophysical mechanisms remain unclear at high magnetic field and low temperature. Through comprehensive spectroscopic investigations, its charge-transfer band edge is identified at 500 nm. Below this band-edge, local excitonic magnetic polaronic states from Cr3+ ions out of FM aggregates in layer and bilayer could be seen due to phonon-spin-exciton coupling, in which magnetic polaronic PL1 emission occurs at 720 nm from single Cr3+ d-d transition, a dark-state pair exciton occurs at 850 nm in 10 K magnetic field, and double-peak PL2 emission at 920 nm out of Cr3+ FM trimer in monolayer is seen; besides, the magnetic bi-polaronic PL3 at 990 nm can be assigned to Cr3+ tetramers between FM adjacent layers. In magnetic field perpendicular to the layer, direct competition between PL1and dark-state excitons and PL2 and PL3 excitonic states persist in different temperatures. This study sheds light on the complicated magneto-exciton interactions in the multi-body effect of CrSBr, beneficial for quantum modulation in layered magnetic semiconductors.</description>

      <title>Ubiquitous van der Waals altermagnetism with sliding/moire ferroelectricity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: According to the recent studies on sliding/moire ferroelectricity, most 2D van der Waals nonferroelectric monolayers can become ferroelectric via multilayer stacking. In this paper we propose that similar strategy can be used to induce desirable van der Waals altermagnetism with symmetry-compensated collinear magnetic orders and non-relativistic spin splitting. Our first-principles calculations show the pervasive co-existence of sliding ferroelectricity and altermagnetism in a series of magnetic multilayers with anti-parallel stacking configurations. Upon a twist angle in bilayers, moire ferroelectricity can be combined with altermagnetism, while some untwisted bilayers exhibit pseudo-altermagnetism with zero net magnetizations and non-relativistic spin splittings coupled with sliding ferroelectricity. Our study significantly expands the scope of altermagnetism, and its combination with sliding/moire ferroelectricity brings in new physics as well as promising applications, which should stimulate further experimental efforts.</description>

      <title>$\mu$SR evidence of a marked exchange interaction effect on the local spin dynamics of Tb-based molecular nanomagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the spin dynamics of two Terbium-based molecular nanomagnets, Tb-SQ and Tb-Trp, investigated by means of longitudinal muon spin relaxation ($\mu$SR) measurements as a function of applied field, flanked by AC susceptibility characterization. In the two molecules Tb(III) magnetic ion has an isotructural coordination sphere, but in the former the Tb(III) is coordinated by an organic paramagnetic ligand (SQ), while the latter is coordinated by a diamagnetic one (Trp). Thus Tb-SQ presents an exchange interaction between the Tb(III) ion and a radical while Tb-Trp does not. Both the samples exhibit a muon spin-lattice relaxation rate $\lambda_1(T, B_L)$ peak in the temperature range 10-25 K at all applied longitudinal magnetic fields $B_L = 50, 150, 300$ mT. In Tb-SQ, $\lambda_1(T, B_L)$ displays a BPP-like behavior led by three different correlations times: the first, dominating for $T\geq15K$, follows a thermally activated law $\tau_c =\tau_0 \exp(\sigma_A / k_B T)$ with energy barrier $\sigma_A/k_B$, while the second and third ones, dominating respectively for $8&lt;T&lt;15$ K and $T&lt;8$ K, follow a power-law-like behavior $\tau_c = c_0 T^{-\alpha}$ with two different values of $c_0$ and $\alpha$. On the other hand, the temperature and field behavior of $\lambda_1(T, B_L)$ in Tb-Trp strongly deviates from a BPP law, displaying a strongly anomalous character. Our results indicate that, in the absence of an exchange interaction and maintaining all the other relevant interactions constants, the local spin dynamics of single ion magnets strongly differ from the one observed in the presence of such interaction. The combination of $\mu$SR and AC susceptibility allows us to disentangle the different Orbach, Raman and direct mechanisms which are the key ingredients that control the spin dynamics in Tb-SQ, and evidence the potentiality of $\mu$SR in elucidating complex spin dynamics.</description>

Abstract: We provide comments on article titled "Procedures for proper validation of record critical current density claims" by Chiara Tarantini and David C. Larbalestier, arXiv:2410.22195. We respond to claims and assertions that the expressions for calculation of $J_{c,mag}$ from magnetic moments proposed in Polichetti et al. 2024, arXiv:2410.09197, are incorrect. We show that the analysis presented in Tarantini and Larbalestier is wrong. We also re-emphasize the expression presented in Polichetti et al. for calculation of $J_{c,mag}$ from magnetic moments in which the pre-factor is dimensionless and has NO units. We make the case for establishment of national user facilities for measurement of transport $J_c(H,T,\theta)$ that are easily accessible in an equitable and rapid manner to enable much needed advances in the field.</description>

      <title>Enhancement of magnetic spin Hall angle by extrinsic surface roughness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The magnetic spin Hall effect arises from a reactive counterpart of the dissipative spin response that is responsible for the ordinary spin Hall effect. This interpretation is supported by the dependence of spin Hall effect signals on the reversal of magnetic order parameters and can be explained in terms of the symmetries of well-defined linear response functions. This proposal has enabled the generation and manipulation of spin currents electrically. In terms of conversion efficiency, the spin Hall angle is a key parameter used to characterize a material's ability to convert spin currents to charge currents and vice versa. Consequently, there is an ongoing effort to identify mechanisms that can increase the spin Hall angle. In theis work, it is proposed a mechanism based on extrinsic surface roughness, which enhances the magnetic spin Hall angle when the ratio of roughness to thickness is high. This mechanism represents an important discovery that will advance the development of charge-to-spin devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in artificial intelligence have sparked interest in scientific assistants that could support researchers across the full spectrum of scientific workflows, from literature review to experimental design and data analysis. A key capability for such systems is the ability to process and reason about scientific information in both visual and textual forms - from interpreting spectroscopic data to understanding laboratory setups. Here, we introduce MaCBench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating how vision-language models handle real-world chemistry and materials science tasks across three core aspects: data extraction, experimental understanding, and results interpretation. Through a systematic evaluation of leading models, we find that while these systems show promising capabilities in basic perception tasks - achieving near-perfect performance in equipment identification and standardized data extraction - they exhibit fundamental limitations in spatial reasoning, cross-modal information synthesis, and multi-step logical inference. Our insights have important implications beyond chemistry and materials science, suggesting that developing reliable multimodal AI scientific assistants may require advances in curating suitable training data and approaches to training those models.</description>

      <title>Large Twist Angle dependent Ultrafast Transient Dynamics and Raman studies on MoSe2/WSe2 van der Waals Heterostructures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional van der Waals heterostructures (HS) exhibit twist-angle ({\theta}) dependent interlayer charge transfer, driven by moir\'e potential that tunes the electronic band structure with varying {\theta}. Apart from the magic angles of {$\sim$}3$^{\circ}$ and {$\sim$}57.5$^{\circ}$ that show flat valence bands (twisted WSe2 bilayer), the commensurate angles of 21.8$^{\circ}$ and 38.2$^{\circ}$ reveal the Umklapp light coupling of interlayer excitons (twisted MoSe2 /WSe2 HS). We report a non-degenerate optical pump-optical probe spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy of MoSe2/WSe2 HS at large twist angles. The recombination time of interlayer excitons reaches a minima near commensurate angles. Raman spectroscopy reveals an opposite shift in the A1g modes of MoSe2 and WSe2, with the maximum shift occurring in the vicinity of twist angles of 21.8$^{\circ}$ and 38.2$^{\circ}$. At these commensurate angles, maximum charge transfer increases Coulomb screening, reducing the interlayer exciton lifetime. This study emphasizes the significance of the large twist angle of HS in developing transition metal dichalcogenides-based optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17021v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting the exact many-body quantum dynamics of polarons in materials with strong carrier-phonon interactions presents a fundamental challenge, often necessitating one to adopt approximations that sacrifice the ability to predict the transition from nonequilibrium relaxation to thermodynamic equilibrium. Here, we exploit a recent breakthrough that generalizes the concept of memory beyond its conventional temporal meaning to also encompass space. Specifically, we leverage our discovery that the dynamics of observables in systems with local couplings satisfy Green's functions with kernels that are local in time and space. This enables us to employ the dynamics of small lattices over short times to predict the dynamics of thermodynamically large lattices over arbitrarily long timescales while circumventing the deleterious impacts of finite-size effects. We thus interrogate the \textit{exact} nonequilibrium formation and migration of polarons in one- (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) systems, revealing that their motion approaches diffusive transport only asymptotically in time and system size. We also compare transport in 1D and 2D systems to investigate the effect of dimension in polaron migration physics, illustrating how energy variations can cause localization -- a phenomenon observable via current microscopy experiments.</description>

      <title>Rubber-to-glass adhesion between a rigid sphere and a shape memory polymer substrate of finite thickness</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Shape memory polymers (SMPs) are emerging as innovative smart adhesive materials with broad application potential. Compared to conventional elastomeric adhesives, SMP adhesives are distinguished by the so-called rubber-to-glass (R2G) adhesion, which involves contact in the rubbery state followed by detachment in the glassy state. This process, through a shape-locking effect, enhances adhesion strength by more than an order of magnitude compared to conventional adhesive contact. Here, we investigate the fundamental problem of a rigid sphere undergoing R2G adhesion with an SMP substrate of finite thickness through experiments, finite element (FE) simulations, and theoretical modeling. It is demonstrated that during press-in, the contact problem can be modeled as a rigid oblate spheroid contacting an infinite substrate, while the pull-off process can be described by a modified ball-and-socket model. These equivalent models yield practically useful analytical solutions for the contact radius during press-in and the R2G adhesion force during pull-off. A critical thickness-to-contact-radius ratio of around 5 is identified, below which the thickness effect becomes significant. These insights provide valuable guidance for the design and application of SMP-based smart adhesives.</description>

      <title>Superparamagnetic Superparticles for Magnetic Hyperthermia Therapy: Overcoming the Particle Size Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17172v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Iron oxide (e.g., Fe$_3$O$_4$ or Fe$_2$O$_3$) nanoparticles are promising candidates for a variety of biomedical applications ranging from magnetic hyperthermia therapy to drug delivery and bio-detection, due to their superparamagnetism, non-toxicity, and biodegradability. While particles of small size (below a critical size, ~20 nm) display superparamagnetic behavior at room temperature, these particles tend to penetrate highly sensitive areas of the body such as the Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB), leading to undesired effects. In addition, these particles possess a high probability of retention, which can lead to genotoxicity and biochemical toxicity. Increasing particle size is a means for addressing these problems but also suppresses the superparamagnetism. We have overcome this particle size limit by synthesizing unique polycrystalline iron oxide nanoparticles composed of multiple nanocrystals of 10 to 15 nm size while tuning particle size from 160 to 400 nm. These so-called superparticles preserve superparamagnetic characteristics and exhibit excellent hyperthermia responses. The specific absorption rates (SAR) exceed 250 W/g (HAC = 800 Oe, f = 310 kHz) at a low concentration of 0.5 mg/mL, indicating their capability in cancer treatment with minimum dose. Our study underscores the potential of size-tunable polycrystalline iron oxide superparticles with superparamagnetic properties for advanced biomedical applications and sensing technologies.</description>

      <title>Resurfaced CsPbBr3 Nanocrystals Enable Free Radical Thermal Polymerization of Efficient Ultrafast Polyvinyl Styrene Nanocomposite Scintillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17259v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lead halide perovskite nanocrystals (LHP-NCs) embedded in a plastic matrix are highly promising for a variety of photonic technologies and are quickly gaining attention as ultrafast, radiation-resistant nanoscintillators for radiation detection. However, advancements in LHP-NC-based photonics are hindered by their well-known thermal instability, which makes them unsuitable for industrial thermally activated mass polymerization processes - crucial for creating polystyrene-based scintillating nanocomposites. In this study, we address this challenge by presenting the first thermal nanocomposite scintillators made from CsPbBr3 NCs passivated with fluorinated ligands that remain attached to the particles surfaces even at high temperatures, enabling their integration into mass-cured polyvinyl toluene without compromising optical properties. Consequently, these nanocomposites demonstrate scintillation light yields reaching 10,400 photons/MeV, sub-nanosecond scintillation kinetics, and remarkable radiation resilience, able to withstand gamma radiation doses of up to 1 MGy. This performance not only meets but also exceeds the scintillation of plastic scintillators, despite the radiation-induced damage to the host matrix.</description>

      <title>Wettability and Color Change of Copper by Controlling Area Fraction of Laser Ablated Surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this research, wettability control by area fraction of laser ablated surface of copper is presented. The functional surfaces with full wettability control from highly hydrophilic to super-hydrophobic were created on copper by nanosecond (ns) and picosecond (ps) laser irradiation. The area fraction and color change were evaluated by digital image processing of microscopic images of the laser-ablated copper surface. The control of the wetting angle from almost 0 degrees to 132 degrees was achieved for both ps and ns pulses by controlling the area fraction of the laser-ablated surface. Cassie, Cassie-Baxter, and Wenzel models were adopted to explain the experimental results. For the first time, the wettability and color of copper were controlled by controlling the area fraction of the laser-ablated surface. It is expected that the current results make an impact on the heat exchanger technology of water heat sinks, cooling units, atmospheric water generators, and fog harvesting and impact numerous applications from power plants to solar thermal water systems devices where highly-hydrophilic to super hydrophobic copper can be applied.</description>

      <title>Maximum entropy mediated liquid-to-solid nucleation and transition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations are a powerful tool for studying matter at the atomic scale. However, to simulate solids, an initial atomic structure is crucial for the successful execution of MD simulations, but can be difficult to prepare due to insufficient atomistic information. At the same time Wide Angle X-ray Scattering (WAXS) measurements can determine the Radial Distribution Function (RDF) of atomic structures. However, the interpretation of RDFs is often challenging. Here we present an algorithm that can bias MD simulations with RDFs by combining the information of the MD atomic interaction potential and the RDF under the principle of maximum relative entropy. We show that this algorithm can be used to adjust the RDF of one liquid model, e.g., the TIP3P water model, to reproduce the RDF and improve the Angular Distribution Function (ADF) of another model, such as the TIP4P/2005 water model. In addition, we demonstrate that the algorithm can initiate crystallization in liquid systems, leading to both stable and metastable crystalline states defined by the RDF, e.g., crystallization of water to ice and liquid TiO2 to rutile or anatase. Finally, we discuss how this method can be useful for improving interaction models, studying crystallization processes, interpreting measured RDFs, or training machine learned potentials.</description>

      <title>Improved Leakage Currents and Polarity Control through Oxygen Incorporation in Ferroelectric Al0.73Sc0.27N Thin Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17360v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article examines systematic oxygen (O)-incorporation to reduce total leakage currents in sputtered wurtzite-type ferroelectric Al0.73Sc0.27N thin films, along with its impact on the material structure and the polarity of the as-grown films. The O in the bulk Al0.73Sc0.27N was introduced through an external gas source during the reactive sputter process. In comparison to samples without doping, O-doped films showed almost a fourfold reduction of the leakage current near the coercive field. In addition, doping resulted in the reduction of the steady-state leakage currents by roughly one order of magnitude sub-coercive fields. Microstructure analysis using X-ray diffraction 1and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) revealed no significant structural degradation of the bulk Al0.73Sc0.27N. In case of the maximum O-doped film, the c-axis out-of-plane texture increased by only 20% from 1.8{\deg} and chemical mapping revealed a uniform distribution of oxygen incorporation into the bulk. Our results further demonstrate the ability to control the as-deposited polarity of Al0.73Sc0.27N via the O-concentration, changing from nitrogen- to metal-polar orientation. Thus, this article presents a promising approach to mitigate the leakage current in wurtzite-type Al0.73Sc0.27N without incurring any significant structural degradation of the bulk thin film quality, thereby making ferroelectric nitrides more suitable for microelectronic applications.</description>

      <title>A Method for Fabricating CMOS Back-End-of-Line-Compatible Solid-State Nanopore Devices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17416v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solid-state nanopores, nm-sized holes in thin, freestanding membranes, are powerful single-molecule sensors capable of interrogating a wide range of target analytes, from small molecules to large polymers. Interestingly, due to their high spatial resolution, nanopores can also identify tags on long polymers, making them an attractive option as the reading element for molecular information storage strategies. To fully leverage the compact and robust nature of solid-state nanopores, however, they will need to be packaged in a highly parallelized manner with on-chip electronic signal processing capabilities to rapidly and accurately handle the data generated. Additionally, the membrane itself must have specific physical, chemical, and electrical properties to ensure sufficient signal-to-noise ratios are achieved, with the traditional membrane material being SiNX . Unfortunately, the typical method of deposition, low-pressure vapour deposition, requires temperatures beyond the thermal budget of CMOS back-end-of-line integration processes, limiting the potential to generate an on-chip solution. To this end, we explore various lower-temperature deposition techniques that are BEOL-compatible to generate SiNx membranes for solid-state nanopore use, and successfully demonstrate the ability for these alternative methods to generate low-noise nanopores that are capable of performing single-molecule experiments.</description>

      <title>Scanning Thermal Microscopy in Air and Vacuum: A Comparison</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17507v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present measurements comparing scanning thermal microscopy in air and vacuum. Signal levels are compared and resolution is probed by scanning over the edge of a nanofabricated Ag square embedded in SiO2. Signals measured in air were seen to be 2.5 to 40 times larger than in vacuum. Furthermore, the air signals were stable while the vacuum signals varied significantly. Edge widths measured in air were approximately 39 % larger than those measured in vacuum. Our observations are consistent with the air measurements experiencing heat transfer from the surrounding sample via conduction and convection as well as the formation of a water-related meniscus at the tip-sample junction. These results contribute to the understanding of the complex heat exchange effects that can occur in scanning thermal microscopy when it is conducted in an ambient atmosphere.</description>

      <title>Initial Stages of Rejuvenation of Vapor-Deposited Glasses during Isothermal Annealing: Contrast Between Experiment and Simulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17540v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physical vapor deposition can prepare organic glasses with high kinetic stability. When heated, these glassy solids slowly transform into the supercooled liquid in a process known as rejuvenation. In this study, we anneal vapor-deposited glasses of methyl-m-toluate (MMT) for six hours at 0.98Tg to observe rejuvenation using dielectric spectroscopy. Glasses of moderate stability exhibited partial or full rejuvenation in six hours. For highly stable glasses, prepared at substrate temperatures of 0.85Tg and 0.80Tg, the six-hour annealing time is ~2% of the estimated transformation time, and no change in the onset temperature for the {\alpha} relaxation process was observed, as expected. Surprisingly, for these highly stable glasses, annealing resulted in significant increases in the storage component of the dielectric susceptibility, without corresponding increases in the loss component. These changes are interpreted to indicate that short-term annealing rejuvenates a high frequency relaxation (e.g., the boson peak) within the stable glass. We compare these results to computer simulations of the rejuvenation of highly stable glasses generated by the swap Monte Carlo algorithm. The in silico glasses, in contrast to the experiment, show no evidence of rejuvenation within the stable glass at times shorter than the alpha relaxation process.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12873v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bilayers (soft substrates coated with stiff films) are commonly found in nature with examples including skin tissue, vesicles, or organ membranes. They exhibit various types of instabilities when subjected to compression, depending on the contrast in material properties between the two components. We present wrinkling instabilities for 3D hyperelastic bilayer systems, including auxetics (materials with negative Poisson's ratio), under uni-axial tension. In tension, a soft bilayer can experience large lateral contraction, and we find that with an adequate contrast in the Poisson ratios, compressive stresses may develop and generate wrinkles aligned with the tensile direction. We rely on an analytic modelling of the phenomenon, and validate it with a user-defined Python script with periodic boundary conditions and constitutive relation implementation in advanced Finite Element simulations. Our findings reveal that wrinkles are observed when the Poisson ratio of the substrate is greater than that of the film. As the two Poisson ratios converge to a common value, the critical stretch of instability shoots up rapidly, and the wrinkling disappears. We also confirm these results by asymptotic analysis. This wrinkling analysis has significant potential in controlling surface patterns of auxetic skin grafts and hydrogel organ patches under mechanical loads. Moreover, the asymptotic expressions in this work can be used under finite strain for buckling-based metrology applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05092v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ab initio description of point defects in semiconductors, characterized by in-gap states of significant multideterminant character, presents a longstanding theoretical challenge for density functional theory (DFT) methods. In this study, we devise a wavefunction theory (WFT) based ab initio methodology as a competing alternative approach. Specifically, we apply perturbation theory (NEVPT2 level) on top of a defect-localized many-body wavefunction (CASSCF level), which provides a balanced description of dynamic and static correlation effects, respectively. This quantum chemical methodology, exemplified for the NV$^-$ center in diamond in this study, is not only used for the calculation of energies and properties, but also for geometry optimization, performed for each electronic state individually. By relaxing cluster models of increasing size and investigating convergence behavior, we quantitatively reproduce (i) the full energy spectrum of NV$^-$ including the recently characterized high-energy states, (ii) the effect of Jahn-Teller distortion on measurable properties, (iii) the fine structure of ground and excited states, (iv) the pressure dependence of zero-phonon lines. Our findings showcase that applying conventional wave-function-based quantum chemistry on carefully crafted clusters can be a robust routine tool for discussing defect-state energetics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04632v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The development of multifunctional devices calls for the discovery of new layered materials with novel electronic properties. f-electron systems naturally host a rich set of competing and intertwining phases owning to the presence of strong spin-orbit coupling, electron-electron interactions, and hybridization between itinerant and local electrons. However, very little attention has been devoted to exploring the f-electron family of compounds for new promising layered material candidates. Here, we identify 295 rare earth compounds from across the lanthanide series of elements that exhibit a spectrum of lattice symmetries and electronic properties. In particular, we find metallic compounds and insulating systems with band gaps covering a 0.1 eV to 5.3 eV range which opens new possibilities in infrared quantum sensors, designer photocatalysts, and tunable transistors. The inclusion of 4f-states in a layered system also suggests the possibility of 2D confined heavy-fermion superconductivity and topological semimetals. Our study serves as a springboard to further systematic theoretical investigation of correlation-driven properties of the 4f and other 2D materials composed of heavy elements.</description>

Abstract: Semi-Dirac fermions are massless in one direction and massive in the perpendicular directions. Such quasiparticles have been proposed in various contexts in condensed matter. Using first principles calculations, we identify a pair of semi-Dirac bands in the electronic structure of hexagonal close-packed (hcp) cadmium, which keep their linear out-of-plane and quadratic inplane dispersions up to the Fermi level. We demonstrate that the dichotomy between the linear and quadratic dispersions is driven by an orientation-sensitive hybridization between the $s$ and $p_z$ orbitals. The upper semi-Dirac band produces a lens-shaped nonellipsoidal Fermi sheet whose cross-section area has a $k$-dependence that is in excellent agreement with the experimentally measured period of Sondheimer oscillations.</description>

      <title>Phase sensitive information from a planar Josephson junction</title>

Abstract: Josephson tunneling across a planar junction generally depends on the relative twist angle, $\theta$, between the two layers. However, if under a discrete rotation, the order parameter in one layer is odd and the other is even (as, e.g., for a $s$-wave to $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave junction under a $\pi/2$ rotation) then the bulk Josephson current vanishes for all $\theta$. Even in this case, we show that for a finite junction, the Josephson current, $J$, has a nonzero edge contribution that depends on $\theta$ and the orientation of the junction edges in ways that can serve as an unambiguous probe of the order parameter symmetry of any time-reversal preserving system (including multiband systems and those in which spin-orbit coupling is significant). We also analyze the microscopic considerations that determine the magnitude of $J$.</description>

      <title>Experimental evidence for the $\omega^4$ tail of the nonphononic spectra of glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16996v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is now established that glasses feature low-frequency, nonphononic excitations, in addition to phonons that follow Debye's vibrational density of state (VDoS). Extensive computer studies demonstrated that these nonphononic, glassy excitations follow a universal non-Debye VDoS ${\cal D}_{\rm G}(\omega)\!\sim\!\omega^4$, at low frequencies $\omega$. Yet, due to intrinsic difficulties in disentangling ${\cal D}_{\rm G}(\omega)$ from the total VDoS ${\cal D}(\omega)$, which is experimentally accessible through various scattering techniques, the $\omega^4$ tail of ${\cal D}_{\rm G}(\omega)$ lacked direct experimental support. We develop a procedure to extract ${\cal D}_{\rm G}(\omega)$ from the measured ${\cal D}(\omega)$, based on recent advances in understanding low-frequency excitations in glasses, and apply it to available datasets for diverse glasses. The resulting analysis shows that the $\omega^4$ tail of the nonphononic vibrational spectra of glasses is nontrivially consistent with a broad range of experimental observations. It also further supports that ${\cal D}_{\rm G}(\omega)$ makes an additive contribution to ${\cal D}(\omega)$.</description>

      <title>Aperiodic defects in periodic solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03373v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To date, computational methods for modeling defects (vacancies, adsorbates, etc.) rely on periodic supercells in which the defect is far enough from its repeated image such that they can be assumed non-interacting. Yet, the relative proximity and periodic repetition of the defect's images may lead to spurious, unphysical artifacts, especially if the defect is charged and/or open-shell, causing a very slow convergence to the thermodynamic limit (TDL). In this Letter, we introduce a "defectless" embedding formalism such that the embedding field is computed in a pristine, primitive-unit-cell calculation. Subsequently, a single (i.e. "aperiodic") defect, which can also be charged, is introduced inside the embedded fragment. By eliminating the need for compensating background charges and periodicity of the defect, we circumvent all associated unphysicalities and numerical issues, achieving a very fast convergence to the TDL. Furthermore, using the toolbox of post-Hartree-Fock methods, this scheme can be straightforwardly applied to study strongly correlated defects, localized excited states and other problems, for which existing periodic protocols do not provide a satisfactory description.</description>

      <title>Equivariant Graph Neural Networks for Prediction of Tensor Material Properties of Crystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03563v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern E(3)-Equivariant networks may be used to predict rotationally equivariant properties, including tensorial quantities. Three such quantities: the dielectric, piezoelectric, and elasticity tensors, are computationally expensive to produce ab initio for crystalline systems; however, with greater availability of such data in large material property databases, we now have a sufficient target space to begin training equivariant models in the prediction of such properties. Here we explicitly develop spherical harmonic decompositions of these tensorial properties using their general symmetries. We then apply three distinct E(3)-equivariant convolutional structures to the prediction of the components of these decompositions, allowing us to predict the aforementioned tensorial quantities in an equivariant manner and compare performance. We further report results testing the transferability of these predictive models between different tensorial target sets.</description>

      <title>Engineering efficient light sources for silicon photonics: III-V nano-heterostructures monolithically grown on silicon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10858v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The demand for advanced photonics technology is increasing rapidly, fueled by the necessity for high-performance and cost-effective optical information processing systems extending into the quantum domain. Silicon, benefiting from its mature fabrication processes, stands as an ideal platform. However, its inherent indirect bandgap leads to inefficient light emission. The integration of III-V materials has been proven essential to overcome this drawback. These materials are recognized for their efficient light emission and superior bandgap engineering capabilities, making them indispensable in photonics and beyond. Here, we present the monolithic integration of small-volume III-V nano-heterostructures with silicon via selective area epitaxy in the pyramidal openings etched in (100)-oriented silicon substrate. The precise positioning of the nano-heterostructures is achieved using electron beam lithography. Our atomic resolution imaging and chemical analysis confirms the epitaxial nature of InP growth, revealing well-defined heterointerfaces. Each structure incorporates an InAsP quantum dot-like active medium, and the correlation of the growth parameters with the nanoscale structure was analyzed using advanced electron microscopy. The eight-band k.p calculations demonstrate energy level quantization in three spatial dimensions. Optical characterization shows that heterostructure emission can be engineered to cover the entire telecom wavelength range. Consequently, these InAsP/InP nano-heterostructures could serve as a gain medium for silicon-based hybrid nano-lasers and nano-LEDs and quantum light sources in the telecom wavelength range.</description>

      <title>Surface detachment and bed entrainment of fluvial plastics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03081v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Over the last decade, fluvial plastics have been identified as major threat to aquatic environments and human health. In order to develop adequate mitigation strategies for plastic pollution, a fundamental process understanding of riverine plastic transport is of significant importance. In this context, the implementation of research findings into numerical simulation environments is anticipated to enhance modelling capabilities and to support a rigorous decision making. Recent experimental research has focused on the incipient motion of plastic particles, as well as on the effects of surface tension on plastic concentration profiles. While these investigations have advanced the state-of-the-art knowledge, current literature still displays a lack of basic insights into layer-specific plastic transport physics. In this study, first principles are applied to advance knowledge on free-surface detachment and bed entrainment of fluvial plastics. A novel relationship for the critical surface detachment velocity is derived, followed by the development of a framework that allows to relate plastic Shields parameters to those of natural sediments. Overall, it is anticipated that these developments will trigger new research within the plastics community, and it is hoped that present findings will be implemented into Lagrangian particle tracking software.</description>

      <title>Tutorial: Classifying Photonic Topology Using the Spectral Localizer and Numerical $K$-Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03515v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, the spectral localizer framework has emerged as an efficient approach to classifying topology in photonic systems featuring local nonlinearities and radiative environments. In nonlinear systems, this framework provides rigorous definitions for concepts like topological solitons and topological dynamics, where a system's occupation induces a local change in its topology due to the nonlinearity. For systems embedded in radiative environments that do not possess a shared bulk spectral gap, this framework enables the identification of local topology and shows that local topological protection is preserved despite the lack of a common gap. However, as the spectral localizer framework is rooted in the mathematics of $C^*$-algebras, and not vector bundles, understanding and using this framework requires developing intuition for a somewhat different set of underlying concepts than those that appear in traditional approaches to classifying material topology. In this tutorial, we introduce the spectral localizer framework from a ground-up perspective, and provide physically motivated arguments for understanding its local topological markers and associated local measure of topological protection. In doing so, we provide numerous examples of the framework's application to a variety of topological classes, including crystalline and higher-order topology. We then show how Maxwell's equations can be reformulated to be compatible with the spectral localizer framework, including the possibility of radiative boundary conditions. To aid in this introduction, we also provide a physics-oriented introduction to multi-operator pseudospectral methods and numerical $K$-theory, two mathematical concepts that form the foundation for the spectral localizer framework.</description>

      <title>Cubic Dirac Semimetals: General Theory and Application to Rare-Earth Magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09699v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rare-earth magnets with parent cubic symmetry exhibit unique topological properties. However, the origin of these behaviors remains presently unclear. Here, we develop minimal models for Dirac semimetals (DSMs) with accidental band crossings and higher-order topology in cubic systems, incorporating candidate magnetic order to analyze bulk, surface, and hinge state characteristics. In certain cubic-symmetric DSMs, we identify an effective Z2 chiral symmetry which significantly impacts surface and hinge-localized states. Our results highlight distinct features in surface state dispersions, Fermi arcs, polarization dependence, and band splitting that correlate with photoemission data in rare-earth monopnictides. We also suggest candidate materials and experimental tests for further validation. These findings advance our understanding of surface states in rare-earth magnets with parent cubic symmetries and illuminate the role of DSM physics in these systems.</description>
