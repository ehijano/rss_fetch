      <title>The MAJORANA DEMONSTRATOR experiment's construction, commissioning, and performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: The MAJORANA DEMONSTRATOR , a modular array of isotopically enriched high-purity germanium (HPGe) detectors, was constructed to demonstrate backgrounds low enough to justify building a tonne-scale experiment to search for the neutrinoless double-beta decay ($\beta\beta(0\nu)$) of $^{76}\mathrm{Ge}$. Purpose: This paper presents a description of the instrument, its commissioning, and operations. It covers the electroforming, underground infrastructure, enrichment, detector fabrication, low-background and construction techniques, electronics, data acquisition, databases, and data processing of the MAJORANA DEMONSTRATOR. Method: The MAJORANA DEMONSTRATOR operated inside an ultra-low radioactivity passive shield at the 4850-foot~level of the Sanford Underground Research Facility (SURF) from 2015-2021. Results and Conclusions: The MAJORANA DEMONSTRATOR achieved the best energy resolution and second-best background level of any $\beta\beta(0\nu)$ search. This enabled it to achieve an ultimate half-life limit on $\beta\beta(0\nu)$ in $^{76}\mathrm{Ge}$ of $8.3\times 10^{25}$~yr (90\% C.L.) and perform a rich set of searches for other physics beyond the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>A novel 3D sampling method of geological rock-core using X-ray fluorescence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The current work describes a proof of concept of a 3D XRF scanner, which is able to perform elemental analysis over the cylindrical surface of geological rock-core and to reconstruct a 1D, 2D and a 3D elemental map of the scanned area. The presented method will reduce the time and cost for sample preparation, but also will reveal more information about the distribution of the elements over the surface.</description>

      <title>Short-period compact undulator (sCCU19) construction report</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Following the successful completion and testing of the sCCU-type undulator with 28mm period, we have designed, prototyped, constructed and bench tested another sCCU-type undulator with a much shorter 19mm-period magnetic structure. sCCU-type undulators are compact variable-gap devices with hydraulic-assist driver and innovative hybrid magnetic structure. The hydraulic system provides compensation of magnetic forces and ensures compactness of the design. Owing to innovative magnetic structure, these undulators demonstrate magnetic peak field ~15% stronger compared to conventional hybrid-structure PM undulators. The newly constructed undulator is 1.5 m long, 0.38m high, 0.21 m wide and weighs ~ 180 kg. Magnetic structure has 19 mm period and 6.5 mm minimum gap. The gap can be varied from 6.5mm to 80mm. At minimum (6.5mm) gap, the undulator demonstrated 0.87 T peak magnetic field. Magnetic field measurements indicated satisfactory uniformity of the field and acceptable field integrals through the entire gap range. High reliability of undulator mechanics and the control system was confirmed by extensive, varied and prolonged testing.</description>

      <title>Proton Radiation Damage and Annealing of COSI p-type Cross-strip HPGe Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In order to understand the effects of a space radiation environment on cross-strip germanium detectors, we investigated the effects of high-energy proton damage on a COSI detector and the capabilities of high-temperature annealing in repairing detector spectral resolution. We irradiated a COSI-balloon cross-strip high-purity germanium (HPGe) detector with a high-energy proton fluence corresponding to ~10 years in a space radiation environment. We repaired the resulting degradation in spectral resolution within 16% of its preradiation value through a series of high-temperature anneals. We characterize the repair of charge traps with time spent under high-temperature anneal to inform an annealing procedure for long-term maintenance of COSI's spectral resolution.</description>

      <title>First result from tetrafluoroethane (C$_2$H$_2$F$_4$) superheated emulsion detector for dark matter search at JUSL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The superheated emulsion detector consisting of the droplets of tetra-fluoroethane (C2HC$_2$H$_2$F$_4$2F4) has been fabricated at the laboratory and installed at the 555m deep underground laboratory, JUSL during July to Dec 2022. The 500ml detector ran for an effective period of 48.6 days at a threshold of 5.87 keV with an exposure of 2.47 kg-days. The acoustic signals produced due to the bubble nucleation were collected by the acoustic sensor and FPGAbased data acquisition system. The data shows a minimum sensitivity of SI-nucleon for carbon at WIMP mass of 22.81 GeV/c$^2$ and SD (p) for fluorine at 30.67 GeV/c$^2$. The threshold of WIMP mass is 5.16 GeV/c$^2$ for F and 4.44 GeV/c$^2$ for C at the operating threshold of 5.87 keV. The first result of the dark matter direct search experiment named InDEx with tetra-fluoro-ethane active liquid from JUSL underground laboratory is reported in this article.</description>

      <title>Uncooled Thermal Infrared Detection Near the Fundamental Limit Using a Nanomechanical Resonator with a Broadband Absorber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a thermal infrared detector utilizing a nano-optomechanical silicon nitride (SiN) resonator, equipped with a free-space impedance-matched (FSIM) absorber composed of a platinum (Pt) thin film, offering a broadband spectral absorptance on average of 47%. To reduce photothermal back-action caused by intensity fluctuations of the readout laser, the FSIM absorber incorporates a circular clearance for the laser. The study provides a comprehensive characterization of the thermal time constant, power responsivity, and frequency stability of the resonators, with experimental results compared to analytical models and finite element method (FEM) simulations. The fastest thermal response is observed for the smallest 1 mm resonators, with a thermal time constant tau_th = 14 ms. The noise equivalent power (NEP) of the resonators is assessed, showing that the smallest 1 mm resonators exhibit the best sensitivity, with NEP = 27 pW/sqrt(Hz) and a respective specific detectivity of D* = 3.8e9 cm sqrt(Hz)/W. This is less than three times below the theoretical maximum for an ideal IR detector with 50% absorptance. This places our resonators among the most sensitive room-temperature IR detectors reported to date offering an extended spectral range from the near-IR to far-IR. This work underscores the potential of nano-optomechanical resonators for high-performance IR sensing applications.</description>

      <title>Precise Magnetic Field Mapping of the EMPHATIC Phase 1 Magnet with COMSOL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01979v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A compact Halbach array magnet is used to measure the momentum of the secondary particles in EMPHATIC (Experiment to Measure the Production of Hadrons At a Test beam In Chicagoland). Hall probe data was taken for the central cylindrical bore of the magnet and a field map was constructed. COMSOL Multiphysics Software is used for modeling the magnet and constructing the corresponding magnetic field map. We present a fitting approach where the hall probe data is used to determine a 1mm-spacing map of the entire volume of the magnet using COMSOL. The new map will allow for linear interpolation within the volume, and expand the map to outside the measurement volume, thus increasing the acceptance and precision of EMPHATIC tracking system.</description>

      <title>Predicting the cryogenic performance of superconducting detectors by their visual properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The testing and quality assurance of cryogenic superconducting detectors is a time- and labor-intensive process. As experiments deploy increasingly larger arrays of detectors, new methods are needed for performing this testing quickly. Here, we propose a process for flagging under-performing detector wafers before they are ever tested cryogenically. Detectors are imaged under an optical microscope, and computer vision techniques are used to analyze the images, searching for visual defects and other predictors of poor performance. Pipeline performance is verified via a suite of images with simulated defects, yielding a detection accuracy of 98.6%. Lastly, results from running the pipeline on prototype microwave kinetic inductance detectors from the planned SPT-3G+ experiment are presented.</description>

      <title>Design and Implementation of the Cosmic Ray Tagger System for the ICARUS detector at FNAL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03034v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ICARUS-T600 Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber is operating at Fermilab at shallow depth and thus exposed to a high flux of cosmic rays that can fake neutrino interactions. A cosmic ray tagging (CRT) system ($\sim$1100 m$^2$), surrounding the cryostat with two layers of fiber embedded plastic scintillators, was developed to mitigate the cosmic ray induced background. Using nanosecond-level timing information, the CRT can distinguish incoming cosmic rays from outgoing particles from neutrino interactions in the TPC. In this paper an overview of the CRT system, its installation and commissioning at Fermilab, and its performance are discussed.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity and control of a 6-axis fused-silica seismometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13475v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a pair of seismometers capable of measurement in all six axes of rigid motion. The vacuum-compatible devices implement compact interferometric displacement sensors to surpass the sensitivity of typical electrical readout schemes. Together with the capability to subtract the sensitivity-limiting coupling of ground tilt into horizontal motion, our seismometers can widen the sensing band towards mHz frequencies. This has notable applications across a range of fields requiring access to low-frequency signals, such as seismology and climate research. We particularly highlight their potential application in gravitational-wave observatories (LIGO) in improving their observation capability of intermediate-mass black holes ($\sim 1000\,M_\odot$). The sensors are based on a near-monolithic fused-silica design consisting of a fused-silica mass and fibre, showing improved stability and robustness to tilt drifts, alignment, and control compared to all-metal or mixed metal-silica designs. We demonstrate tilt sensitivity that surpasses the best commercial alternatives in a significantly reduced footprint compared to our previous iterations of these sensors.</description>

      <title>The STAR Forward Silicon Tracker</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09952v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Forward Silicon Tracker (FST) is a pivotal component of the forward upgrade of the Solenoidal Tracker at RHIC (STAR), designed to discern hadron charge signs with a momentum resolution better than 30% for $0.2 &lt; p_T &lt; 2$ GeV/c in the $2.5 &lt; \eta &lt; 4$ pseudorapidity range. Its compact design features three disks along the beam direction, minimized material budget, and scattering effects. The FST uses Hamamatsu's p-in-n silicon strip sensors with a double metal layer that enables efficient signal routing to the readout electronics, enhancing overall detector performance. The flexible hybrid boards, essential for the readout system, are constructed with Kapton and copper layers to optimize signal handling and power distribution. These boards connect silicon strips to analogue pipeline ASIC APV25-S1 chips, which read up to 128 channels each. A cooling system with nonconducting, volatile NOVEC 7200 coolant at 22.2{\deg}C mitigates ASIC-generated heat. The FST enhances forward tracking performance at STAR as an integral part of the forward upgrade.</description>

      <title>The Systematics and Operational Studies (SOS) Apparatus as a testbed for nEDM@SNS experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03337v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The nEDM experiment at the SNS (nEDM@SNS) is the first measurement of the neutron EDM to directly measure the precession frequency of the neutron spin due to magnetic and electric fields. Previous measurements have inferred the precession frequency by measuring the residual polarization of neutrons after a long period of free precession. This difference provides independent information on potential unknown systematic uncertainties compared to previous and on-going measurements. It is precisely because nEDM@SNS is using a number of novel techniques, that it is essential to perform detailed studies of these techniques in order to optimize the statistical sensitivity and minimize the systematic uncertainty. The Systematic and Operational Studies Apparatus (SOSA) was one of the main efforts of nEDM@SNS collaboration, concentrated on development of a cryogenic test-bed for learning precise manipulation of spins and studing systematic effects of the proposed new technique. The test bed does not need an electric field but designed to have full NMR capability to the same level as nEDM@SNS.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10796v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A novel liquid argon purity monitor based on a 207 Bi radioactive source, emitting monochromatic internal-conversion electrons, is presented. This new monitor allows for a very precise and fast measurement of the electronegative impurities concentration in liquid argon. It can be operated continuously in liquid argon TPC experiments without interfering with the main detector operation. Different drift lengths can be assembled for the proposed device, to assess a large range of liquid argon purities while minimizing systematic uncertainties. Two prototypes have been built and successfully operated in dedicated test stands. The results and performance are reported.</description>

      <title>SymbolNet: Neural Symbolic Regression with Adaptive Dynamic Pruning for Compression</title>

Abstract: Compact symbolic expressions have been shown to be more efficient than neural network models in terms of resource consumption and inference speed when implemented on custom hardware such as FPGAs, while maintaining comparable accuracy~\cite{tsoi2023symbolic}. These capabilities are highly valuable in environments with stringent computational resource constraints, such as high-energy physics experiments at the CERN Large Hadron Collider. However, finding compact expressions for high-dimensional datasets remains challenging due to the inherent limitations of genetic programming, the search algorithm of most symbolic regression methods. Contrary to genetic programming, the neural network approach to symbolic regression offers scalability to high-dimensional inputs and leverages gradient methods for faster equation searching. Common ways of constraining expression complexity often involve multistage pruning with fine-tuning, which can result in significant performance loss. In this work, we propose $\tt{SymbolNet}$, a neural network approach to symbolic regression specifically designed as a model compression technique, aimed at enabling low-latency inference for high-dimensional inputs on custom hardware such as FPGAs. This framework allows dynamic pruning of model weights, input features, and mathematical operators in a single training process, where both training loss and expression complexity are optimized simultaneously. We introduce a sparsity regularization term for each pruning type, which can adaptively adjust its strength, leading to convergence at a target sparsity ratio. Unlike most existing symbolic regression methods that struggle with datasets containing more than $\mathcal{O}(10)$ inputs, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on the LHC jet tagging task (16 inputs), MNIST (784 inputs), and SVHN (3072 inputs).</description>

      <title>Lorentz-Equivariant Quantum Graph Neural Network for High-Energy Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01641</link>

Abstract: The rapid data surge from the high-luminosity Large Hadron Collider introduces critical computational challenges requiring novel approaches for efficient data processing in particle physics. Quantum machine learning, with its capability to leverage the extensive Hilbert space of quantum hardware, offers a promising solution. However, current quantum graph neural networks (GNNs) lack robustness to noise and are often constrained by fixed symmetry groups, limiting adaptability in complex particle interaction modeling. This paper demonstrates that replacing the Lorentz Group Equivariant Block modules in LorentzNet with a dressed quantum circuit significantly enhances performance despite using nearly 5.5 times fewer parameters. Additionally, quantum circuits effectively replace MLPs by inherently preserving symmetries, with Lorentz symmetry integration ensuring robust handling of relativistic invariance. Our Lorentz-Equivariant Quantum Graph Neural Network (Lorentz-EQGNN) achieved 74.00% test accuracy and an AUC of 87.38% on the Quark-Gluon jet tagging dataset, outperforming the classical and quantum GNNs with a reduced architecture using only 4 qubits. On the Electron-Photon dataset, Lorentz-EQGNN reached 67.00% test accuracy and an AUC of 68.20%, demonstrating competitive results with just 800 training samples. Evaluation of our model on generic MNIST and FashionMNIST datasets confirmed Lorentz-EQGNN's efficiency, achieving 88.10% and 74.80% test accuracy, respectively. Ablation studies validated the impact of quantum components on performance, with notable improvements in background rejection rates over classical counterparts. These results highlight Lorentz-EQGNN's potential for immediate applications in noise-resilient jet tagging, event classification, and broader data-scarce HEP tasks.</description>
