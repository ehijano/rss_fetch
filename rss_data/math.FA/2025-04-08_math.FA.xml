      <title>The Cowen-Douglas class and de Branges-Rovnyak spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a connection between the de Branges-Rovnyak spaces and the Cowen-Douglas class of operators which is associated with complex geometric structures. We prove that the backward shift operator on a de Branges-Rovnyak space never belongs to the Cowen-Douglas class when the symbol is an extreme point of the closed unit ball of $H^\infty$ (the algebra of bounded analytic functions on the open unit disk). On the contrary, in the non extreme case, it always belongs to the Cowen-Douglas class of rank one. Additionally, we compute the curvature in this case and derive certain exotic results on unitary equivalence and angular derivatives.</description>

      <title>Extreme non-differentiability of typical Lipschitz mappings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that no matter what subset of a normed space is given, a typical 1-Lipschitz mapping into a Banach space is non-differentiable at a typical point of the set in a very strong sense: the derivative ratio approximates, on arbitrary small scales, every linear operator of norm at most 1.
  For subsets of finite-dimensional normed spaces which can be covered by a countable union of closed purely unrectifiable sets this extreme non-differentiability holds for a typical Lipschitz mapping at every point.
  Both results are new even for Lipschitz mappings with a finite-dimensional co-domain.</description>

      <title>On a unique two-dimensional integral operator homogeneous with respect to all orientation preserving linear transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a two-dimensional operator with an antisymmetric integral kernel, recently introduced by Z. Avetisyan and A. Karapetyants in connection to the study of general homogeneous operators. This is the unique two-dimensional operator that has an antisymmetric kernel homogeneous with respect to all orientation-preserving linear transformations of the plane. It is shown that the operator under consideration interacts naturally, both in Cartesian and polar coordinates, with projective tensor products of some classical functional spaces, such as Lebesgue, Hardy, and H\"{o}lder spaces; conditions for their boundedness as operators acting from these spaces to Banach lattices of measurable functions and estimates of their norms are given.</description>

      <title>On a class of Mikhlin multipliers which do not preserve $L^1$-, $L^\infty$-regularity and continuity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that every Fourier multiplier with real-valued and positively homogeneous symbol of order 0, supported in a cone whose dual cone has a nonempty interior and such that the average of the positive part is sufficiently larger than the average of the negative part does not preserve the $L^1$- nor the $L^\infty$ regularity and neither the continuity.We also construct wave front sets which measure the microlocal regularity with respect to a large class of Banach spaces. As a consequence of the first part, we argue that one can never construct wave front sets that behave in a natural way and measure the microlocal $L^1$- nor $L^\infty$-regularity and neither the continuity</description>

      <title>Zero Products of Toeplitz operators on the Hardy and Bergman spaces over an annulus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the zero product problem of Toeplitz operators on the Hardy space and Bergman space over an annulus. Assuming a condition on the Fourier expansion of the symbols, we show that there are no zero divisors in the class of Toeplitz operators on the Hardy space of the annulus. Using the reduction theorem due to Abrahamse, we characterize compact Hankel operators on the Hardy space of the annulus, which also leads to a zero product result. Similar results are proved for the Bergman space over the annulus.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the Gaussian correlation inequality holds true for centered convex sets. The proof is based on Milman's observation that the Gaussian correlation inequality may be regarded as an example of the inverse Brascamp--Lieb inequality. We give further extensions of the Gaussian correlation inequality formulated by Szarek--Werner.</description>

      <title>A Busemann-Petty Type Problem for Dual Radon Transforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by resolution of the Busemann-Petty problem (1956), we consider the following comparison problem for dual Radon transforms: Given a pair of continuous functions defined on the affine Grassmannian whose dual Radon transforms satisfy a pointwise inequality, can their $L^p$ norms be compared in a meaningful way? We characterize the solution to this problem for each $p\geq 1$, and as a consequence of our investigation, we prove reverse $L^p$-$L^q$-estimates for dual Radon transforms. In particular, we reverse an inequality of Solmon (1979).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main aim of this article is to establish several $p$-numerical radius inequalities via the $(f,g)$-Aluthge transform of Hilbert space operators and operator matrices. Furthermore, various classical numerical radius and norm inequalities for Hilbert space operators are also discussed. The bounds obtained in this work improve upon several well-known earlier results.</description>

      <title>Some remarks on almost locally uniformly rotund points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the relations between different notions of almost locally uniformly rotund points that appear in literature. We show that every non-reflexive Banach space admits an equivalent norm having a point in the corresponding unit sphere which is not almost locally uniformly rotund, and which is strongly exposed by all its supporting functionals. This result is in contrast with a characterization due to P. Bandyopadhyay, D. Huang, and B.-L. Lin from 2004. We also show that such a characterization remains true in reflexive Banach spaces.</description>

      <title>Iterated convolution inequalities on Riemannian Symmetric Spaces of non-compact type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For $G$ a connected, non-compact, semi-simple Lie group with finite center and $K$ a maximal compact subgroup of $G$, we study the $K$-biinvariant, real-valued solutions $f \in L^1(G)$ of the iterated convolution inequality \begin{equation*} f \ge \displaystyle\sum_{n=2}^N a_n \left(*^n f\right) \:, \end{equation*} where $N \ge 2$ is an integer, for $2 \le n \le N$, $a_n$ are non-negative integers with at least one of them positive and \begin{equation*} *^n f = \underbrace{f * \cdots *f }_{n-times}\:. \end{equation*} We prove that $f$ must be non-negative and satisfy the non-trivial bound $\|f\|_{L^1(G)}\le t_{\mathcal{Q}}$ where \begin{equation*} \mathcal{Q}(t):=t-\displaystyle\sum_{n=2}^N a_n\:t^n\:, \end{equation*} and $t_{\mathcal{Q}}$ is the unique zero of $\mathcal{Q}'$ in $(0,\infty)$. Our arguments involve Spherical Fourier Analysis on Riemannian Symmetric Spaces of non-compact type and Complex analysis. We then apply our result to obtain an a priori estimate for solutions of an integro-differential equation which is related to the physical problem of the ground state energy of the Bose gas in the classical Euclidean setting. Our results are new even for $\mathbb{R}^n$ and generalize recent works by Carlen-Jauslin-Lieb-Loss (Int Math Res Not 24:18604-18612, 2021) and Nakamura-Sawano (J Geom Anal 35:68, 2025) for two-fold and $m$-fold monomial convolution inequalities respectively, on $\mathbb{R}^n$.</description>

      <title>Continuous Boostlet Transform and Associated Uncertainty Principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03679v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Continuous Boostlet Transform (CBT) is introduced as a powerful tool for analyzing spatiotemporal signals, particularly acoustic wavefields. Overcoming the limitations of classical wavelets, the CBT leverages the Poincar\'e group and isotropic dilations to capture sparse features of natural acoustic fields. This paper presents the mathematical framework of the CBT, including its definition, fundamental properties, and associated uncertainty principles, such as Heisenberg's, logarithmic, Pitt's, and Nazarov's inequalities. These results illuminate the trade-offs between time and frequency localization in the boostlet domain. Practical examples with constant and exponential functions highlight the CBT's adaptability. With applications in radar, communications, audio processing, and seismic analysis, the CBT offers flexible time-frequency resolution, making it ideal for non-stationary and transient signals, and a valuable tool for modern signal processing.</description>

      <title>Besov regularity of multivariate non-periodic functions in terms of half-period cosine coefficients and consequences for recovery and numerical integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03903v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the setting of $d$-variate periodic functions, often modelled as functions on the torus $\mathbb{T}^d\cong[0,1]^d$, the classical tensorized Fourier system is the system of choice for many applications. Turning to non-periodic functions on $[0,1]^d$ the Fourier system is not as well-suited as exemplified by the Gibbs phenomenon at the boundary. Other systems have therefore been considered for this setting. One example is the half-period cosine system, which occurs naturally as the eigenfunctions of the Laplace operator under homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions. We introduce and analyze associated function spaces, $S^{r}_{p,q}B_{\mathrm{hpc}}([0,1]^d)$, of dominating mixed Besov-type generalizing earlier concepts in this direction. As a main result, we show that there is a natural parameter range, where $S^{r}_{p,q}B_{\mathrm{hpc}}([0,1]^d)$ coincides with the classical Besov space of dominating mixed smoothness $S^{r}_{p,q}B([0,1]^d)$. This finding has direct implications for different functional analytic tasks in $S^{r}_{p,q}B([0,1]^d)$. It allows to systematically transfer methods, originally taylored to the periodic domain, to the non-periodic setup. To illustrate this, we investigate half-period cosine approximation, sampling reconstruction, and tent-transformed cubature. Concerning cubature, for instance, we are able to reproduce the optimal convergence rate $n^{-r}(\log n)^{(d-1)(1-1/q)}$ for tent-transformed digital nets in the range $1\le p,q\le\infty$, $\tfrac{1}{p}&lt;r&lt;2$, where $n$ is the number of samples. In our main proof we rely on Chui-Wang discretization of the dominating mixed Besov space $S^{r}_{p,q}B(\mathbb{R}^d)$, which we provide for the first time for the multivariate domain.</description>

      <title>On the Hardy number and the Bergman number of a planar domain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04207v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article deals with functions with a prefixed range and their inclusions in Hardy and weighted Bergman spaces. This idea was originally introduced by Hansen for Hardy spaces, and it was recently taken into weighted Bergman spaces by Karafyllia and Karamanlis. We provide a new characterization for the Hardy number of a domain in terms of its Green function. Based on this, we present a class of domains for which the Hardy number and the Bergman number coincide. However, in general, we show that the Hardy number and the Bergman number of a domain are not equal; even for domains which are regular for the Dirichlet problem.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a bornology $\mathcal{S}$ of subsets of a metric space $(X,d)$, we consider the following unified approaches of hyperspace convergence: convergence induced through uniform convergence of distance functionals ($\tau_{\mathcal{S},d}$-convergence); bornological convergence, and the weak convergence induced by a family of gap and excess functionals. An interesting problem regarding these convergences is to investigate when any two of them are equivalent. In this article, we investigate the relation of $\tau_{\mathcal{S},d}$-convergence with the other two convergences, which is not completely transparent. As a main tool for our investigation, we use the idea of pointwise enlargement of a set by a positive Lipschitz function. As applications of our results, we provide new proofs of some known results about Attouch-Wets convergence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04883v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate geometric aspects of the space of densities by analyzing transport along paths generated by quantum Markovian semigroups and more generally locally Markovian, or time-dependent Lindbladian, dynamics. Motivated by practical constraints, we also consider a more realistic scenario in which only a restricted set of Lindbladian generators is available. We study the corresponding transitivity properties and characterize the set of states that can be reached using such limited dynamical resources.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04952v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A complete classification of continuous, dually epi-translation invariant, and rotation equivariant valuations on convex functions is established. This characterizes the recently introduced functional Minkowski vectors, which naturally extend the classical Minkowski relations. For this, the existence of these operators with singular densities is shown, along with additional representations involving mixed Monge-Amp\`ere measures, Kubota-type formulas, and area measures of higher dimensional convex bodies. Dual results are formulated for valuations on super-coercive convex functions.</description>

Abstract: A new method to solve computationally challenging (random) parametric obstacle problems is developed and analyzed, where the parameters can influence the related partial differential equation (PDE) and determine the position and surface structure of the obstacle. As governing equation, a stationary elliptic diffusion problem is assumed. The high-dimensional solution of the obstacle problem is approximated by a specifically constructed convolutional neural network (CNN). This novel algorithm is inspired by a finite element constrained multigrid algorithm to represent the parameter to solution map. This has two benefits: First, it allows for efficient practical computations since multi-level data is used as an explicit output of the NN thanks to an appropriate data preprocessing. This improves the efficacy of the training process and subsequently leads to small errors in the natural energy norm. Second, the comparison of the CNN to a multigrid algorithm provides means to carry out a complete a priori convergence and complexity analysis of the proposed NN architecture. Numerical experiments illustrate a state-of-the-art performance for this challenging problem.</description>

      <title>Fast Convolutions on $\mathbb{Z}^2\backslash SE(2)$ via Radial Translational Dependence and Classical FFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathbb{Z}^2\backslash SE(2)$ denote the right coset space of the subgroup consisting of translational isometries of the orthogonal lattice $\mathbb{Z}^2$ in the non-Abelian group of planar motions $SE(2)$. This paper develops a fast and accurate numerical scheme for approximation of functions on $\mathbb{Z}^2\backslash SE(2)$. We address finite Fourier series of functions on the right coset space $\mathbb{Z}^2\backslash SE(2)$ using finite Fourier coefficients. The convergence/error analysis of finite Fourier coefficients are investigated. Conditions are established for the finite Fourier coefficients to converge to the Fourier coefficients. The matrix forms of the finite transforms are discussed. The implementation of the discrete method to compute numerical approximation of $SE(2)$-convolutions with functions which are radial in translations are considered. The paper is concluded by discussing capability of the numerical scheme to develop fast algorithms for approximating multiple convolutions with functions with are radial in translations.</description>

      <title>The H\"{o}rmander--Bernhardsson extremal function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05205v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We characterize the function $\varphi$ of minimal $L^1$ norm among all functions $f$ of exponential type at most $\pi$ for which $f(0)=1$. This function, studied by H\"{o}rmander and Bernhardsson in 1993, has only real zeros $\pm \tau_n$, $n=1,2, \ldots$. Starting from the fact that $n+\frac12-\tau_n$ is an $\ell^2$ sequence, established in an earlier paper of ours, we identify $\varphi$ in the following way. We factor $\varphi(z)$ as $\Phi(z)\Phi(-z)$, where $\Phi(z)= \prod_{n=1}^\infty(1+(-1)^n\frac{z}{\tau_n})$ and show that $\Phi$ satisfies a certain second order linear differential equation along with a functional equation either of which characterizes $\Phi$. We use these facts to establish an odd power series expansion of $n+\frac12-\tau_n$ in terms of $(n+\frac12)^{-1}$ and a power series expansion of the Fourier transform of $\varphi$, as suggested by the numerical work of H\"{o}rmander and Bernhardsson. The dual characterization of $\Phi$ arises from a commutation relation that holds more generally for a two-parameter family of differential operators, a fact that is used to perform high precision numerical computations.</description>

      <title>On the cyclic behavior of singular inner functions in Besov and sequence spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show the existence of singular inner functions that are cyclic in some Besov-type spaces of analytic functions over the unit disc. Our sufficient condition is stated only in terms of the modulus of smoothness of the underlying measure. Such singular inner functions are cyclic also in the space $\ell^p_A$ of holomorphic functions with coefficients in $\ell^p$. This can only happen for measures that place no mass on any Beurling-Carleson set.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Regarding the representation theorem of Kolmogorov and Arnold (KA) as an algorithm for representing or {\guillemotleft}expressing{\guillemotright} functions, we test its robustness by analyzing its ability to withstand adversarial attacks. We find KA to be robust to countable collections of continuous adversaries, but unearth a question about the equi-continuity of the outer functions that, so far, obstructs taking limits and defeating continuous groups of adversaries. This question on the regularity of the outer functions is relevant to the debate over the applicability of KA to the general theory of NNs.</description>

      <title>Existence and characterizations of hyper-dual group inverse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05264v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent work of Xiao and Zhong [AIMS Math. 9 (2024), 35125--35150: MR4840882], we propose a generalized inverse for a hyper-dual matrix called hyper-dual group generalized inverse (HDGGI). Under certain necessary and sufficient conditions, we establish the existence of the HDGGI of a hyper-dual matrix. We then show that the HDGGI is unique (whenever exists). The HDGGI is then used to solve a linear hyper-dual system. We also exploit some sufficient conditions under which the reverse and forward-order laws for a particular form of the HDGGI and HDMPGI hold. We also discuss the least-squares properties of hyper-dual group inverse. Using the definition of dual matrix of order $n$, we finally establish necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of the group inverse of a dual matrix of order $n$.</description>

      <title>Weak equals strong L2 regularity for partial tangential traces on Lipschitz domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.14977v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the boundary trace operators that naturally correspond to $\mathrm{H}(\operatorname{curl},\Omega)$, namely the tangential and twisted tangential trace, where $\Omega \subseteq \mathbb{R}^{3}$. In particular we regard partial tangential traces, i.e., we look only on a subset $\Gamma$ of the boundary $\partial\Omega$. We assume both $\Omega$ and $\Gamma$ to be strongly Lipschitz (possibly unbounded). We define the space of all $\mathrm{H}(\operatorname{curl},\Omega)$ fields that possess a $\mathrm{L}^{2}$ tangential trace in a weak sense and show that the set of all smooth fields is dense in that space, which is a generalization of Belgacem, Bernardi, Costabel and Dauge 1997. This is especially important for Maxwell's equation with mixed boundary condition as we answer the open problem by Weiss and Staffans 2013 (Section 5) for strongly Lipschitz pairs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.13869v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that every separable infinite-dimensional Banach space admits a G\^ateaux smooth and rotund norm which is not midpoint locally uniformly rotund. Moreover, by using a similar technique, we provide in every infinite-dimensional Banach space with separable dual a Fr\'echet smooth and weakly uniformly rotund norm which is not midpoint locally uniformly rotund. These two results provide a positive answer to some open problems by A. J. Guirao, V. Montesinos, and V. Zizler.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01999v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove several results about functions which preserve the Schur-Agler class under Hadamard or coefficient-wise product. First, functions which preserve the Schur class necessarily preserve the Schur-Agler class. Second, ``moments'' of certain commuting operator tuples form coefficients of Schur-Agler class preservers. Finally, any preserver of the full matrix Schur-Agler class must have coefficients given by moments of commuting operator tuples. We also point out that any counterexample to the multivariable von Neumann inequality can be used to derive a non-trivial Agler class preserver.</description>

      <title>On the $W$-entropy and Shannon entropy power on RCD$(K, N)$ and RCD$(K, n, N)$ spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01864v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove the $W$-entropy formula and the monotonicity and rigidity theorem of the $W$-entropy for the heat flow on RCD$(K, N)$ and RCD$(K, n, N)$ spaces $(X, d, \mu)$, where $K\in \mathbb{R}$, $n\in \mathbb{N}$ is the geometric dimension of $(X, d, \mu)$ and $N\geq n$. We also prove the $K$-concavity of the Shannon entropy power on RCD$(K, N)$ spaces. As an application, we derive the Shannon entropy isoperimetric inequality and the Stam type logarithmic Sobolev inequality on RCD$(0, N)$ spaces with maximal volume growth condition. Finally, we prove the rigidity theorem for the Stam type logarithmic Sobolev inequality with sharp constant on noncollapsing RCD$(0, N)$ spaces.</description>

      <title>Filtered Calculus and crossed products by R-actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.13532v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show an isomorphism between the kernel of the C*-algebra of the tangent groupoid of a filtered manifold and the crossed product of the order 0 pseudodifferential operators in the associated filtered calculus by a natural R-action. This isomorphism is constructed in the same way as in the classical pseudodifferential calculus by Debord and Skandalis. The proof however relies on a structure result for the C*-algebra of graded nilpotent Lie groups which did not appear in the commutative case. A consequence of this structure result is a decomposition of the principal symbol algebra, generalizing the decomposition of Epstein and Melrose in the case of contact manifolds.</description>

      <title>On predictors and filters for non-decaying unbounded continuous time signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05566v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The paper studies spectral representation and its applications for non-decaying
  continuous time signals
  that are not necessarily bounded at $\pm\infty$. The paper introduces notions of transfer functions, spectrum degeneracy, spectrum gaps,
  and bandlimitness, for these unbounded signals. As an example of applications, explicit formulae are given for transfer functions of low-pass and high-pass
  filters suitable for these signal. As another example of applications, it is shown that
  non-decaying unbounded signals with a single point spectrum degeneracy and sublinear rate of growth are predictable.
  The corresponding transfer functions for the predictors are obtained explicitly.</description>
