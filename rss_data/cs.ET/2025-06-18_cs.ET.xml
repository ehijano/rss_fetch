      <title>Empirical Studies of Large Scale Environment Scanning by Consumer Electronics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14771v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an empirical evaluation of the Matterport Pro3, a consumer-grade 3D scanning device, for large-scale environment reconstruction. We conduct detailed scanning (1,099 scanning points) of a six-floor building (17,567 square meters) and assess the device's effectiveness, limitations, and performance enhancements in diverse scenarios. Challenges encountered during the scanning are addressed through proposed solutions, while we also explore advanced methods to overcome them more effectively. Comparative analysis with another consumer-grade device (iPhone) highlights the Pro3's balance between cost-effectiveness and performance. The Matterport Pro3 achieves a denser point cloud with 1,877,324 points compared to the iPhone's 506,961 points and higher alignment accuracy with an RMSE of 0.0118 meters. The cloud-to-cloud (C2C) average distance error between the two point cloud models is 0.0408 meters, with a standard deviation of 0.0715 meters. The study demonstrates the Pro3's ability to generate high-quality 3D models suitable for large-scale applications, leveraging features such as LiDAR and advanced alignment techniques.</description>

      <title>On the solvable-unsolvable transition due to noise-induced chaos in digital memcomputing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Digital memcomputing machines (DMMs) have been designed to solve complex combinatorial optimization problems. Since DMMs are fundamentally classical dynamical systems, their ordinary differential equations (ODEs) can be efficiently simulated on modern computers. This provides a unique platform to study their performance under various conditions. An aspect that has received little attention so far is how their performance is affected by the numerical errors in the solution of their ODEs and the physical noise they would be naturally subject to if built in hardware. Here, we analyze these two aspects in detail by varying the integration time step (numerical noise) and adding stochastic perturbations (physical noise) into the equations of DMMs. We are particularly interested in understanding how noise induces a chaotic transition that marks the shift from successful problem-solving to failure in these systems. Our study includes an analysis of power spectra and Lyapunov exponents depending on the noise strength. The results reveal a correlation between the instance solvability and the sign of the ensemble averaged mean largest Lyapunov exponent. Interestingly, we find a regime in which DMMs with positive mean largest Lyapunov exponents still exhibit solvability. Furthermore, the power spectra provide additional information about our system by distinguishing between regular behavior (peaks) and chaotic behavior (broadband spectrum). Therefore, power spectra could be utilized to control whether a DMM operates in the optimal dynamical regime. Overall, we find that the qualitative effects of numerical and physical noise are mostly similar, despite their fundamentally different origin.</description>

      <title>Scaling Intelligence: Designing Data Centers for Next-Gen Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The explosive growth of Large Language Models (LLMs) - such as GPT-4 with 1.8 trillion parameters - demands a radical rethinking of data center architecture to ensure scalability, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness. Our work provides a comprehensive co-design framework that jointly explores FLOPS, HBM bandwidth and capacity, multiple network topologies (two-tier vs. FullFlat optical), the size of the scale-out domain, and popular parallelism/optimization strategies used in LLMs. We introduce and evaluate FullFlat network architectures, which provide uniform high-bandwidth, low-latency connectivity between all nodes, and demonstrate their transformative impact on performance and scalability. Through detailed sensitivity analyses, we quantify the benefits of overlapping compute and communication, leveraging hardware-accelerated collectives, wider scale-out domains, and larger memory capacity. Our study spans both sparse (mixture of experts) and dense transformer-based LLMs, revealing how system design choices affect Model FLOPS Utilization (MFU = Model flops per token x Observed tokens per sec / Peak flops of the hardware) and overall throughput. For the co-design study, we extended and validated a performance modeling tool capable of predicting LLM runtime within 10% of real-world measurements. Our findings offer actionable insights and a practical roadmap for designing AI data centers that can efficiently support trillion-parameter models, reduce optimization complexity, and sustain the rapid evolution of AI capabilities.</description>

      <title>Systems-Theoretic and Data-Driven Security Analysis in ML-enabled Medical Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of AI/ML into medical devices is rapidly transforming healthcare by enhancing diagnostic and treatment facilities. However, this advancement also introduces serious cybersecurity risks due to the use of complex and often opaque models, extensive interconnectivity, interoperability with third-party peripheral devices, Internet connectivity, and vulnerabilities in the underlying technologies. These factors contribute to a broad attack surface and make threat prevention, detection, and mitigation challenging. Given the highly safety-critical nature of these devices, a cyberattack on these devices can cause the ML models to mispredict, thereby posing significant safety risks to patients. Therefore, ensuring the security of these devices from the time of design is essential. This paper underscores the urgency of addressing the cybersecurity challenges in ML-enabled medical devices at the pre-market phase. We begin by analyzing publicly available data on device recalls and adverse events, and known vulnerabilities, to understand the threat landscape of AI/ML-enabled medical devices and their repercussions on patient safety. Building on this analysis, we introduce a suite of tools and techniques designed by us to assist security analysts in conducting comprehensive premarket risk assessments. Our work aims to empower manufacturers to embed cybersecurity as a core design principle in AI/ML-enabled medical devices, thereby making them safe for patients.</description>

      <title>Toward a Lightweight, Scalable, and Parallel Secure Encryption Engine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The exponential growth of Internet of Things (IoT) applications has intensified the demand for efficient, high-throughput, and energy-efficient data processing at the edge. Conventional CPU-centric encryption methods suffer from performance bottlenecks and excessive data movement, especially in latency-sensitive and resource-constrained environments. In this paper, we present SPiME, a lightweight, scalable, and FPGA-compatible Secure Processor-in-Memory Encryption architecture that integrates the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES-128) directly into a Processing-in-Memory (PiM) framework. SPiME is designed as a modular array of parallel PiM units, each combining an AES core with a minimal control unit to enable distributed in-place encryption with minimal overhead. The architecture is fully implemented in Verilog and tested on multiple AMD UltraScale and UltraScale+ FPGAs. Evaluation results show that SPiME can scale beyond 4,000 parallel units while maintaining less than 5\% utilization of key FPGA resources on high-end devices. It delivers over 25~Gbps in sustained encryption throughput with predictable, low-latency performance. The design's portability, configurability, and resource efficiency make it a compelling solution for secure edge computing, embedded cryptographic systems, and customizable hardware accelerators.</description>

      <title>Generative diffusion model surrogates for mechanistic agent-based biological models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09630v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mechanistic, multicellular, agent-based models are commonly used to investigate tissue, organ, and organism-scale biology at single-cell resolution. The Cellular-Potts Model (CPM) is a powerful and popular framework for developing and interrogating these models. CPMs become computationally expensive at large space- and time- scales making application and investigation of developed models difficult. Surrogate models may allow for the accelerated evaluation of CPMs of complex biological systems. However, the stochastic nature of these models means each set of parameters may give rise to different model configurations, complicating surrogate model development. In this work, we leverage denoising diffusion probabilistic models to train a generative AI surrogate of a CPM used to investigate in vitro vasculogenesis. We describe the use of an image classifier to learn the characteristics that define unique areas of a 2-dimensional parameter space. We then apply this classifier to aid in surrogate model selection and verification. Our CPM model surrogate generates model configurations 20,000 timesteps ahead of a reference configuration and demonstrates approximately a 22x reduction in computational time as compared to native code execution. Our work represents a step towards the implementation of DDPMs to develop digital twins of stochastic biological systems.</description>

      <title>Receiving RISs: Enabling Channel Estimation and Autonomous Configuration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10662v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This chapter focuses on a hardware architecture for semi-passive Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs) and investigates its consideration for boosting the performance of Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) communication systems. The architecture incorporates a single or multiple radio-frequency chains to receive pilot signals via tunable absorption phase profiles realized by the metasurface front end, as well as a controller encompassing a baseband processing unit to carry out channel estimation, and consequently, the optimization of the RIS reflection coefficients. A novel channel estimation protocol, according to which the RIS receives non-orthogonal training pilot sequences from two multi-antenna terminals via tunable absorption phase profiles, and then, estimates the respective channels via its signal processing unit, is presented. The channel estimates are particularly used by the RIS controller to design the capacity-achieving reflection phase configuration of the metasurface front end. The proposed channel estimation algorithm, which is based on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM), profits from the RIS random spatial absorption sampling to capture the entire signal space, and exploits the beamspace sparsity and low-rank properties of extremely large MIMO channels, which is particularly relevant for communication systems at the FR3 band and above. Our extensive numerical investigations showcase the superiority of the proposed channel estimation technique over benchmark schemes for various system and RIS hardware configuration parameters, as well as the effectiveness of using channel estimates at the RIS side to dynamically optimize the possibly phase-quantized reflection coefficients of its unit elements.</description>

      <title>Bhatt Conjectures: On Necessary-But-Not-Sufficient Benchmark Tautology for Human Like Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11423v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Bhatt Conjectures framework introduces rigorous, hierarchical benchmarks for evaluating AI reasoning and understanding, moving beyond pattern matching to assess representation invariance, robustness, and metacognitive self-awareness. The agentreasoning-sdk demonstrates practical implementation, revealing that current AI models struggle with complex reasoning tasks and highlighting the need for advanced evaluation protocols to distinguish genuine cognitive abilities from statistical inference. This comprehensive AI evaluation methodology establishes necessary-but-not-sufficient benchmark conditions for advancing artificial general intelligence research while maintaining academic search engine optimization standards through strategic keyword density optimization, technical terminology consistency, and cross-modal evaluation protocols.

      <title>Model Context Protocol (MCP) at First Glance: Studying the Security and Maintainability of MCP Servers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13538v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although Foundation Models (FMs), such as GPT-4, are increasingly used in domains like finance and software engineering, reliance on textual interfaces limits these models' real-world interaction. To address this, FM providers introduced tool calling-triggering a proliferation of frameworks with distinct tool interfaces. In late 2024, Anthropic introduced the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to standardize this tool ecosystem, which has become the de facto standard with over eight million weekly SDK downloads. Despite its adoption, MCP's AI-driven, non-deterministic control flow introduces new risks to sustainability, security, and maintainability, warranting closer examination.
  Towards this end, we present the first large-scale empirical study of MCP servers. Using state-of-the-art health metrics and a hybrid analysis pipeline, combining a general-purpose static analysis tool with an MCP-specific scanner, we evaluate 1,899 open-source MCP servers to assess their health, security, and maintainability. Despite MCP servers demonstrating strong health metrics, we identify eight distinct vulnerabilities -- only three overlapping with traditional software vulnerabilities. Additionally, 7.2% of servers contain general vulnerabilities and 5.5% exhibit MCP-specific tool poisoning. Regarding maintainability, while 66% exhibit code smells, 14.4% contain ten bug patterns overlapping with traditional open-source software projects. These findings highlight the need for MCP-specific vulnerability detection techniques while reaffirming the value of traditional analysis and refactoring practices.</description>
