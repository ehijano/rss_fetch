      <title>Energy loss baseline for light hadrons in oxygen-oxygen collisions at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}=5.36\,\text{TeV}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I present predictions for inclusive charged hadron spectra in minimum-bias proton-proton and oxygen-oxygen collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}} = 5.36\,\text{TeV}$, assuming no final-state interactions. Using next-to-leading order perturbative QCD matrix elements, along with state-of-the-art (nuclear) parton distribution and fragmentation functions, I establish a baseline for the nuclear modification factor $R^h_\text{AA}$ in oxygen-oxygen collisions in the absence of quenching. Theoretical uncertainties in this baseline are found to be substantial for transverse momenta below $20\,\text{GeV}$. In the intermediate range $20\,\text{GeV} \lesssim p_T^h \lesssim 70\,\text{GeV}$, these uncertainties are significantly reduced to approximately 5\%. At higher momenta ($p_T^h \gtrsim 70\,\text{GeV}$), however, predictions exhibit a marked spread due to differences between fragmentation functions, reflecting varying assumptions about isospin symmetry. Finally, I show that considering neon-neon collisions in the initial state or neutral pions in the final state does not appreciably change the nuclear modification factor.</description>

      <title>FASTColor -- Full-color Amplitude Surrogate Toolkit for QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-multiplicity events remain a bottleneck for LHC simulations due to their computational cost. We present a ML-surrogate approach to accelerate matrix element reweighting from leading-color (LC) to full-color (FC) accuracy, building on recent advancements in LC event generation. Comparing a variety of modern network architectures for representative QCD processes, we achieve speed-up of around a factor two over the current LC-to-FC baseline. We also show how transformers learn and exploit underlying symmetries, to improve generalization. Given the gained trust in trained networks and developments in learned uncertainties, the LC-to-FC approach will eventually benefit further from not needing a final classic unweighting step.</description>

      <title>Reviving WIMP dark matter with temperature-dependent couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The persistent null results at dark matter (DM) direct detection experiments have pushed the popular weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP) DM to tight corners. Generic WIMP models with direct detection rate below the current upper limits often lead to thermally overproduced relic abundance after freeze-out. To resolve this conundrum, we propose a novel scenario where DM has temperature-dependent couplings with the standard model (SM) bath. A scalar field having a large vacuum expectation value (VEV) at high temperatures generates sizeable DM-SM interactions leading to efficient DM annihilations responsible for generating the desired thermal relic. At lower temperatures, the scalar field VEV settles down to a small value as a result of a first-order phase transition (FOPT), effectively leading to suppressed DM-SM interaction rate at low temperature, consistent with null results at direct detection experiments. Upper bound on thermal DM mass forces the FOPT to occur at scales such that the corresponding gravitational wave signal remains within reach of future experiments like LISA.</description>

      <title>CP violation in decays into states with neutral kaons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: CP violation in the kaon system can manifest itself in decays to final states containing neutral kaons. The effect is governed by an efficiency function that reflects the specific experimental setup. We demonstrate that this efficiency function factorizes into two components: the kaon energy spectrum and a universal detector-dependent factor. We show that matter effects on kaon oscillations can have a significant effect on CP asymmetries. We provide estimates of the theoretical prediction for some such CP asymmetries for a Belle II-type experiment.</description>

      <title>Two-loop QCD corrections to $ZH$ and off-shell $Z$ boson pair production in gluon fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute two-loop corrections to the associated production of a Higgs boson with a $Z$ boson and to off-shell $Z$ boson pair production in the gluon fusion channel, mediated by a heavy quark. We perform deep expansions in the high-energy region and around the forward limit and show that their combination covers the whole phase space. Our results constitute the next-to-leading order virtual corrections to these processes. Their numerical evaluation is fast and the dependence on all parameters is maintained, thus a change of parameter values or renormalization scheme is straightforward. As a by-product of our calculation, we also obtain the two-loop heavy quark mediated virtual corrections to the processes of off-shell di-photon and photon-$Z$ production.</description>

      <title>Boiling After the Dust Settles: Constraining First-Order Phase Transitions During Dark Energy Domination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A first-order phase transition could occur in the late universe when vacuum energy begins dominating the energy density ($z \lesssim 0.3$) and convert some latent heat into other forms such as invisible radiation. This generic possibility also has concrete motivation in particle physics models which invoke a multitude of vacua to address theoretical puzzles. The na\"{i}ve constraint on such an event comes from measurements of the Hubble expansion rate, but this can only probe transitions involving $\mathcal{O}(10)\%$ of the dark energy. In this work, we show that significantly tighter constraints appear when accounting for phase transition fluctuations affecting CMB photon propagation anisotropically, akin to the integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect. For instance, if a completed phase transition has $\beta/H_\star\lesssim 25$, current CMB data limits the associated vacuum energy released to less than $1\%$ of the dark energy. A transition to negative vacuum energy (quasi-anti-de Sitter) is allowed only for $\beta/H_\star \gtrsim 300$. For $\beta/H_\star \lesssim 500$, the universe will not crunch for at least $14$ Gyr.</description>

      <title>Low-energy theory of jet processes and PDF factorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The consistency of collinear factorization violation with PDF factorization has been an outstanding challenge and subject of considerable debate. In this work we demonstrate their compatibility using a factorization theorem for non-global jet observables. Our analysis relies on consistency relations derived from renormalization conditions in effective field theory. We verify these relations through an explicit computation at three-loop order and show that the double-logarithmic evolution sourcing the super-leading logarithms reduces to single-logarithmic DGLAP running below the lowest perturbative scale. The crucial ingredient reconciling the two evolutions is a perturbative Glauber contribution to the low-energy matrix elements which breaks soft-collinear factorization at the cross section level but restores PDF factorization.</description>

      <title>Resonant axion and dark photon production in magnetic white dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using magnetic white dwarfs as a case study, we show that the emission of sub-MeV bosons from stellar plasmas can be substantially modified in the presence of a magnetic field. In particular, the magnetic field-induced anisotropy and cyclotron resonance both significantly affect the in-medium dispersion relations of the Standard Model photon. As a result, resonant level crossing between photons and other light bosons occurs under environmental conditions that differ from the resonance criteria in unmagnetized environments. We find that the magnetic field opens additional regions within magnetic white dwarfs where resonance can occur. These findings motivate revisiting astrophysical constraints on light bosons in systems where the cyclotron frequency is comparable to or larger than the plasma frequency.</description>

      <title>Searching for a Charged Higgs Boson in Top-Quark Decays via the $WZ$ Mode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Top-quark decays are sensitive probes of light charged Higgs bosons ($H^\pm$) due to the sizable $t\bar t$ production cross section at the LHC in conjunction with their distinct experimental signatures. While dedicated ATLAS and CMS searches considered only $H^\pm$ decays into $\tau\nu$, $cs$, or $cb$ for $m_{H^\pm}&lt;m_t$, the $WZ$ channel remains unexplored, despite being the dominant mode in $SU(2)_L$ triplet models. Since, top-quark pair production with $t \to H^\pm b$ and $H^\pm \to WZ$ gives rise to $t\bar{t}Z$-like signatures, we recast existing $t\bar{t}Z$ analyses to search for signs of charged Higgs bosons and set novel limits on the product of branching fractions Br$(t\to H^\pm b) \times $Br$(H^\pm\to WZ)$. These constraints turn out to be at the sub-permille level, despite the observed $2\sigma$ preference for a non-zero value. Interpreted within the hypercharge $Y=0$ Higgs triplet model, this translates into a stringent constraint on the triplet Higgs vacuum expectation value of $v_\Delta\lesssim 2$ GeV, which is stronger than those from the $cs,\tau\nu$ modes and even surpasses electroweak precision constraints from the $\rho$ parameter. Moreover, the $2\sigma$ preference for a non-zero cross section further strengthens the cumulative case for a $\approx152$ GeV boson as suggested, in particular, by di-photon excesses.</description>

      <title>NLO observables for QCD-like theories and application to pion dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: QCD-like theories are of interest in various areas of beyond-Standard-Model phenomenology, including composite Higgs models or pionic dark matter. The effective field theories provide a framework for describing the dynamics of such strongly coupled gauge theories at low energies. In this work, we present next-to-leading order (NLO) expressions for masses, condensates, decay constants, and scattering amplitudes in the chiral expansion of QCD-like theories with $N_F=2$ fermions with non-degenerate masses in both real and pseudoreal representations of the gauge group. We further apply the NLO formulas to fit existing lattice spectroscopic and scattering data for $Sp(N_c=4)$ gauge theory with $N_F=2$ fermions in fundamental representation, extracting the NLO low-energy constants of the theory. Using these fits, we refine the NLO formulas describing the $2\to 2$ pion self-interactions and confirm that the NLO contributions play a crucial role in determining the viable parameter space of pion dark matter scenarios like the strongly interacting massive particles (SIMP).</description>

      <title>Indirect detection of boosted light scalar dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the possibilities of detecting MeV-scale boosted dark matter (DM) via astrophysical observations. Given a particular model framework, using gamma-ray data from \texttt{COMPTEL} and \texttt{EGRET}, as well as neutrino constraints from the \texttt{Super-Kamiokande}, \texttt{Hyper-Kamiokande}, \texttt{JUNO}, diffuse supernova neutrino background (\texttt{DSNB}), and atmospheric neutrino observations, we find that boosted light scalar DM could be probed within the mass range of $\sim 20\!-\!80$ MeV, satisfying the Planck observed relic abundance. Our study shows, indirect search can play a key role in the detection of MeV-scale boosted DM, which are otherwise beyond the reach of usual collider or DM scattering experiments.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Isospin violating effects, both due to the nonvanishing quark mass difference $m_d-m_u$ and to virtual photons, are studied by fitting the squared masses of pseudoscalar mesons to the second order in the simultaneous expansion in powers of $1/N_c$, momenta and quark masses. It is shown that the gluon anomaly enhances the contribution of virtual photons and, thus, promotes to an additional (to the well-known current algebra result of Gross, Treiman and Wilczek) dynamical restoration of isospin symmetry in the spectrum of pseudo-Goldstone states. This mechanism turns out to be significant for the $\pi^0$-$\eta$ and $\pi^0$-$\eta'$ mixing angles and has virtually no effect on the value of the $\eta$-$\eta'$ mixing angle.</description>

      <title>Scale dependence improvement of the quartic scalar field thermal effective potential in the optimized perturbation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Perturbation theory, as well as most thermal field resummation methods widely used to study finite-temperature quantum field theories, presents a non-negligible renormalization scale dependence. To address this limitation, we propose an alternative method that combines the Renormalization Group Improvement (RGI) prescription for the thermal effective potential with the Optimized Perturbation Theory (OPT) variational resummation technique. Here, we apply this new framework, termed Variational Renormalization Group (VRG), to evaluate the effective potential of the scalar $\lambda \phi^4$ theory at finite temperatures, which represents a benchmark model for phase transition studies. We show that the proposed approach significantly improves scale stability, compared to the use of OPT alone, across key thermodynamic quantities, including the effective potential, critical temperature, and pressure. These results establish the VRG as a robust alternative tool for precision studies of thermal phase transitions, with direct implications for cosmological applications (e.g., early-universe thermodynamics) and condensed matter systems.</description>

      <title>Self-Interaction Effects on Vortex Scaling in Soliton Mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the impact of self-interaction strength on the formation and scale of turbulent vortex structures during the merger of Bose stars, using numerical simulations of the Gross-Pitaevskii-Poisson (GPP) equations. We find that vortex formation is a universal outcome of soliton mergers, with the vortex size strongly dependent on the self-interaction coupling parameter $g$. Through analysis of velocity correlations, kinetic energy spectra, and vorticity distributions, we conclude that for repulsive self-interaction, the vortex region expands as self-interaction strength increases; conversely, for attractive self-interaction, the vortex region shrinks as self-interaction strength increases.</description>

      <title>Exclusive $\mathrm{J}/\psi$ production off a dilute proton within a refined hotspot description</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the calculation of exclusive $\mathrm{J}/\psi$ production in electron-proton scattering within the QCD dipole model, employing a refined description of the proton in terms of gluonic hot spots in the dilute regime. In contrast to earlier studies, we incorporate key missing elements: the event-by-event fluctuations in both the number of hot spots and their local saturation scales, as well as the first relativistic corrections to the $\mathrm{J}/\psi$ wave function. We perform a Bayesian analysis to constrain the model parameters using HERA data. These enhancements significantly improve the agreement with HERA data. Saturation scale fluctuations are found to be more important than fluctuations in the number of hot spots. Including the first relativistic correction is found to be important, especially in order to describe the observed power-law behavior in the incoherent cross section at large $t$.</description>

      <title>Indirect dark matter searches with neutrino telescopes via energetic cosmic showers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the possibility that the high energy neutrino flux observed by terrestrial telescopes originates from dark matter (DM) annihilation. Specifically, we study a minimal, UV-complete $U(1)$ extension of the Standard Model with a Dirac DM candidate, whose annihilation into neutrinos proceeds exclusively through a $Z^\prime$ boson. By computing the annihilation cross section and comparing with the observed flux, we derive bounds on the model parameters. Additional constraints are obtained within the freeze-in framework, where the observed relic abundance is reproduced, leading to the strongest bounds. Considering cosmic string vibrations as a source of gravitational waves, we further constrain the vacuum expectation value of the $U(1)$ breaking. All results are contrasted with perturbativity limits and existing constraints from low- and high-energy experiments.</description>

      <title>Particle Collisions &amp; Quantum Entanglement in High-Energy Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exploration of fundamental quantum phenomena, such as entanglement and Bell inequality violations$-$extensively studied in low-energy regimes$-$has recently extended to high-energy particle collisions. Experimentally, Bell inequality violations, which challenge Einstein's principle of local realism, were first observed in low-energy entangled photon systems by A. Aspect, J. F. Clauser, and A. Zeilinger, earning them the 2022 Nobel Prize in Physics. Particle colliders provide a novel setting for probing quantum information theory, operating at energies over ten orders of magnitude higher than previous experiments and in the presence of electroweak and strong interactions. Additionally, collider detectors offer unique advantages for quantum state reconstruction via quantum state tomography. This book chapter reviews key theoretical and experimental advancements in this emerging field, highlighting its challenges, objectives, and potential impact on both quantum information theory and high-energy physics.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic Leptogenesis -- an EFT-Consistent Analysis via Wilson Coefficients I: Low-Scale, Non-Resonant Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyse electromagnetic leptogenesis within the framework of an effective field theory, where the dynamics is governed by the gauge-invariant dipole operator $O_{NB}$. The Wilson coefficient $C_{NB}$ is matched at one loop and renormalisation-group (RG) evolved to the electroweak scale. After electroweak symmetry breaking we compute flavour-dependent two-body decay widths and CP asymmetries for $N\to\nu+\gamma/Z$, and solve the fully flavoured Boltzmann equations. In the $N_1$-dominated regime the freeze-out baryon asymmetry is $Y_B^{\rm FO}\lesssim 10^{-17}$, far below the observed value $Y_B^{\rm obs}\simeq 8.7\times 10^{-11}$. The suppression is structural: gauge invariance forces a Higgs insertion; therefore dipole couplings $\mu\propto v/M_{\Psi}^2$ while the matched coefficient $C_{NB}$ is loop-generated and further reduced by RG running. We note that in the quasi-degenerate limit the self-energy resonance can be operative and suggest a plausible path to $Y_B^{\rm obs}$.</description>

      <title>Evidence of Relationships Among Fundamental Constants of the Standard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an approach to reducing the number of fundamental parameters in the Standard Model (SM) using genetic programming, a machine learning technique based on evolutionary algorithms. We outline the core principles of our method and identify the simplest analytic relationships among SM parameters. Our results suggest that the SM parameters associated with quark and boson masses are not randomly distributed, but instead follow a hierarchical structure within a high-dimensional functional space. The found analytic solution depends on only two input parameters, representing the simplest mathematical model that could provide a foundation for developing a future theoretical framework to address the SM.</description>

      <title>Predictions for $R_{AA}$ in 5.36 TeV C+C, O+O, and Ne+Ne collisions at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Experiments on collisions of light nuclei at $\sqrt{s}=5.36$ TeV have recently begun at the LHC. In this regard we make predictions for nuclear modification factor $R_{AA}$ in 5.36 TeV C+C, O+O, and Ne+Ne collisions for scenarios with and without quark-gluon plasma formation in $pp$ collisions. We find a sizeable difference in $R_{AA}$ for these two scenarios, which grows with decreasing atomic number. This says that data on $R_{AA}$ for light nuclei could potentially give information on the presence of jet quenching in $pp$ collisions.</description>

      <title>General finite two-loop amplitude integrand for photoproduction in quark annihilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The construction of integrands free of infrared and ultraviolet singularities may enable the application of numerical methods to evaluate loop amplitudes that are inaccessible with analytic techniques. At two loops, finite amplitude integrands have been constructed for the production of off-shell or massive colorless particles via quark annihilation. In this article, we extend this class of processes to include real photons in the final state.
  To achieve this, we introduce appropriate momentum flows and counterterms to eliminate singularities that occur because the photons are massless. These singularities arise only locally at the integrand level and do not lead to divergences upon integration. Our treatment also eliminates all power singularities arising from self-energy corrections in the integrand. We extend the analysis to gluon emission from virtual quarks. We believe these new insights will be useful for future extensions of infrared subtraction methods to processes with final-state jets.</description>

      <title>Potential of the reaction $e^+e^-\to p\bar{p}\pi^0$ for constructing higher $\rho$-meson spectroscopy above 2.4 GeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spectrum of light unflavored vector mesons above 2.4 GeV has not yet been firmly established experimentally. In this work, we demonstrate that the process $e^+e^- \to p\bar{p}\pi$ serves as a particularly promising channel as a probe for higher isovector $\rho$ excitations. In contrast to typical electron-positron annihilation processes into purely light-meson final states, the reaction $e^+e^- \to p\bar{p}\pi$ benefits from a relatively low continuum background, on the order of $(50\sim100)~\text{pb}$ around 2.4 GeV, which enhances the visibility of even modest resonance contributions. In addition, the comparatively high production threshold further suppresses potential contamination from lower $\rho$-meson excitations. Our analysis based on effective Lagrangian approach indicates that the observed lineshape of the $e^+e^- \to p\bar{p}\pi$ cross section measured by BESIII can be naturally interpreted by including the $\rho(5S)$ and $\rho(6S)$ contributions, namely the fourth and fifth radial excitations of $\rho(770)$. In particular, the pronounced rise of the cross section near 2.4 GeV provides strong evidence for the contribution of $\rho(5S)$ signal. Their branching ratios to the $p\bar{p}\pi$ final state are found to be below 4\%, which do not contradict with usual expectations. In addition, we evaluate pion-induced production of these two $\rho$-meson states as a complementary probe, offering useful guidance for the relevant experiments such as COMPASS.</description>

      <title>Jet cone size dependence of single inclusive jet suppression due to jet quenching in Pb+Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=5.02$ TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Jet suppression in high-energy heavy-ion collisions results from jet energy loss and transverse-momentum broadening during jet propagation through the quark-gluon plasma (QGP). The jet cone size ($R$) dependence of this suppression offers crucial insights into the energy loss mechanisms and QGP transport properties. In our study, we implement a comprehensive approach within the perturbative QCD parton model that incorporates both elastic and inelastic energy loss mechanisms. For elastic processes the contribution from recoiling thermal partons reduces the net in-cone energy loss for a given jet radius. For inelastic processes, we account for the angular distribution of radiated gluons, the thermalization of soft gluons, and transverse-momentum broadening. Using this framework, we calculate the jet nuclear modification factors ($R_{AA}$) and their double ratios $R_{AA}(R=0.2-1.0)/R_{AA}(R=0.2)$, and systematically compare with ALICE, ATLAS and CMS data in 0-10\% and 30-50\% Pb+Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 5.02~TeV. Numerical results show that $R_{AA}$ increases with the cone size $R$ because the in-cone energy loss decreases at larger radii. Specifically, as the radius $R$ grows, the probability for elastically scattered partons to escape the jet cone and the likelihood for radiated gluons to fall outside the cone both decrease, resulting in a net reduction of energy loss. The $R_{AA}$ double ratios are approximately unity for small radii ($R=0.4$ relative to $R=0.2$) and at high $p_{\rm T}\gtrsim200$ GeV$/c$, in agreement with the data within uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Oscillation-Independent Probes of Neutrino Non-Standard Interactions from Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the first oscillation-independent astrophysical method to probe non-standard neutrino interactions (NSI) in core-collapse supernovae. Using a self-consistent treatment of NSI effects in both supernova neutrino emission simulations and flavor independent neutral-current scattering in detectors, we show that anti-correlated coincidence signatures between liquid scintillator experiments such as JUNO and dark matter detectors such as DARWIN/XLZD, ARGO, or RES-NOVA break degeneracy between NSI and flavor conversions effects. For a Galactic supernova within $\lesssim1$ kpc this approach enables independent probes of neutrino-quark NSI couplings in parameter space overlapping and extending beyond existing terrestrial limits. Our results establish a novel oscillation-independent avenue to test fundamental neutrino interactions in extreme astrophysical environments.</description>

      <title>Entropy and multiplicity of hadrons in the high energy limit within dipole cascade models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate and compare QCD dipole cascade models, the 1D Mueller dipole model, its high energy limit and its generalization that follows from studies of 1D systems with conformal symmetry. To address the ambiguity stemming from different definitions of the rapidity ranges in experimental measurements, we propose the entropy as the function of the logarithm of the average multiplicity, $S(\ln\langle n \rangle)$, as a universal observable. From the solutions of the models, we calculate both the entropy and the average charged particle multiplicity and compare to data measured in proton-proton collisions. We obtained these quantities directly from the measured multiplicity distributions and determine the model parameters via fits. We find that the generalized dipole model provides a significantly better description of the data than the 1D Mueller model.</description>

      <title>Lepton flavor violating decays of Higgs boson in the NB-LSSM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lepton flavor violation (LFV) represents a clear new physics (NP) signal beyond the standard model (SM). NB-LSSM, the next to minimal supersymmetric extension of the SM with local B-L gauge symmetry, includes three Higgs singlets and three generations of right-handed neutrinos in the basis of MSSM, motivated by the new definition of SM-like Higgs resultly from the introducing of three Higgs singlets which mix with the two Higgs doublets at the tree level in the NB-LSSM. We calculate LFV processes $h\rightarrow l_i l_j$ in the mass eigenstate basis and the electroweak interaction basis separately, and the latter adopts the mass insertion approximation (MIA) method. In the suitable parameter space, we obtain the reasonable numerical results. At the same time, the corresponding constraints from the LFV rare decays $l_j\rightarrow l_i\gamma$ are considered to analyze the numerical results.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Total and energy-angle differential probabilities of positrons created in slow collisions of two identical nuclei are calculated within relativistic two-center approach. The time-dependent Dirac equation is solved in the rotating frame using the generalized pseudospectral method in modified prolate spheroidal coordinates. The magnetic interaction induced by the motion of the nuclei is included in the Hamiltonian. The rotational coupling term is also taken into account. Angle-integrated and angle-resolved energy spectra of the emitted positrons are calculated by projecting the propagated wave function onto positive-energy plane-wave states. Our results show that the magnetic interaction leads to a slight increase in the critical internuclear distance and enhances the total positron yield by up to several percent. However, it does not qualitatively alter the energy or angular distributions of emitted positrons. The angular distributions remain nearly isotropic. The characteristic supercritical regime signatures, found in previous works, are preserved.</description>

      <title>LHAASO Galactic Plane $\gamma$-rays Strongly Constrain Heavy Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LHAASO, a ground-based observatory, is unveiling new frontiers in our understanding of high-energy $\gamma-$rays and cosmic rays. It has recently observed high energy diffuse $\gamma-$rays from the Galactic plane in the TeV-PeV range. For the first time, we analyze this data to search for signatures of heavy decaying and annihilating dark matter in the mass range $10^{5}-10^{11}$ GeV. We compute the expected photon flux from both Galactic and extragalactic dark matter, incorporating attenuation due to photon pair production. For the Galactic contribution, we include both prompt photons and secondary photons produced via inverse Compton scattering, accounting for electron/positron propagation. For the extragalactic component, in addition to the prompt and inverse Compton contributions, we also include cascade photons arising from inverse Compton scattering of pair-produced electrons and positrons. By combining all these contributions, we derive constraints on the dark matter parameter space. Our bounds for various two body Standard Model final states are strongest to date. This underscore LHAASO's capability to discover the nature of heavy dark matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.07052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An accelerated charge interacts with itself through the electromagnetic field that it sources, a phenomenon known as electromagnetic radiation reaction. The DeWitt-Brehme-Hobbs (DWBH) equation describes the motion of a charged mass in the presence of combined electromagnetic and gravitational fields, taking into account electromagnetic radiation-reaction effects. Here, we find the first exact analytical solution of the DWBH equation in the case of a charged mass in the presence of copropagating and otherwise arbitrary electromagnetic and gravitational plane waves. Apart from its intrinsic importance, this solution approximates that of an ultrarelativistic particle in arbitrary gravitational and electromagnetic fields. Finally, the paradigmatic example of a sinusoidal electro-magnetic wave in the presence of a constant-amplitude gravitational wave is worked out explicitly and it shows how the presence of the gravitational wave can qualitatively change electromagnetic radiation-reaction effects.</description>

Abstract: We develop the field space geometry of scalar-fermion effective field theories as a vector bundle supermanifold. We further establish a Fermi normal coordinate system on the bundle that clarifies the geometric content in scattering amplitudes, particularly the imprints of field space non-analyticities. Specializing to the Standard Model Higgs sector, we examine the geometric consequences of custodial symmetry violation, including implications for the physical Higgs field as a distinguished scalar axis and deformations in the fermionic sector. Our results enable a systematic and realistic geometric interpretation of Higgs sector phenomenology.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Analysis of the Neutron Star Equation of State and Model Comparison: Insights from PSR J0437+4715, PSR J0614+3329, and Other Multi-Physics Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform a comprehensive Bayesian analysis to constrain the neutron star (NS) equation of state (EoS) using a wide range of terrestrial and astrophysical data. The terrestrial inputs include quantities related to symmetric nuclear matter (SNM) and symmetry energy up to two times saturation density ($\rho_0\sim$0.16 fm$^{-3}$), derived from finite nuclei and heavy-ion collisions (HICs). The astrophysical constraints incorporate NS radii and tidal deformabilities from recent NICER observations and GW170817, respectively. We consider five different EoS models: Taylor, $n/3$, Skyrme, RMF, and sound speed(CS), are analyzed by sequentially updating the priors with (i) $\chi$EFT based pure neutron matter, (ii) terrestrial, empirical and earlier astrophysical data, (iii) case (ii) including NICER radii of PSR J0437+4715 and J0614+3329, (iv) all data combined, and (v) excluding empirical nuclear inputs. We also perform Bayesian model comparison which favors the Skyrme model under all combined data (scenario (iv)), yielding tight constraints on symmetry energy parameters: $L_0 = 56 \pm 3$~MeV, $K_{\mathrm{sym}0} = -132 \pm 15$~MeV and also on SNM parameters: $K_0 = 265 \pm 12$~MeV, $Q_0 = -366 \pm 43$~MeV. The mass-radius and mass-tidal deformability posterior distributions are also well constrained. The radius and tidal deformability of a $1.4\,M_\odot$ neutron star are found to be $R_{1.4} = 11.85 \pm 0.11$~km and $\Lambda_{1.4} = 354 \pm 25$, respectively.</description>

      <title>Non-Abelian Casimir energy in the Curci-Ferrari model through a functional approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using functional integral methods, we investigate the non-Abelian Casimir energy in the Curci-Ferrari model, which offers an effective description of the infrared regime of Yang-Mills theory. We consider a 3+1D (resp.\ 2+1D) system of two infinite parallel plates (resp.\ wires) at a fixed distance from each other, with either perfect magnetic conductor (PMC) or perfect electric conductor (PEC) boundary conditions. Imposing the boundary conditions directly in the functional integral by the introduction of suitable auxiliary fields that act as Lagrange multipliers, we obtain a boundary effective action that captures the dynamics of this system. The Casimir energy is then computed both directly from the functional integral and via the energy-momentum tensor, providing equivalent results. We find that the Casimir energy for PEC and PMC conditions differs by a constant factor, which can be traced back to a van Dam--Veltman--Zakharov-like discontinuity (both in 3+1D and 2+1D). Lastly, we show that our analytical results are compatible with a variety of recent numerical lattice simulations of the non-perturbative Yang-Mills Casimir energy, in which a novel non-perturbative mass scale emerges.</description>

      <title>Directed searches for gravitational waves from ultralight vector boson clouds around merger remnant and galactic black holes during the first part of the fourth LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA observing run</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first directed searches for long-transient and continuous gravitational waves from ultralight vector boson clouds around known black holes (BHs). We use LIGO data from the first part of the fourth LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA observing run. The searches target two distinct types of BHs and use two new semicoherent methods: hidden Markov model (HMM) tracking for the remnant BHs of the mergers GW230814_230901 and GW231123_135430 (referred to as GW230814 and GW231123 in this study), and a dedicated method using the Band Sampled Data (BSD) framework for the galactic BH in the Cygnus X-1 binary system. Without finding evidence of a signal from vector bosons in the data, we estimate the mass range that can be constrained. For the HMM searches targeting the remnants from GW231123 and GW230814, we disfavor vector boson masses in the ranges $[0.94, 1.08]$ and $[2.75, 3.28] \times 10^{-13}$ eV, respectively, at 30% confidence, assuming a 1% false alarm probability. Although these searches are only marginally sensitive to signals from merger remnants at relatively large distances, future observations are expected to yield more stringent constraints with high confidence. For the BSD search targeting the BH in Cygnus X-1, we exclude vector boson masses in the range $[0.85, 1.59] \times 10^{-13}$ eV at 95% confidence, assuming an initial BH spin larger than 0.5.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty in Hadronic Diffuse $\gamma$-Ray Emission from the Temporal Stochasticity of Cosmic-Ray Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07481v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffuse $\gamma$-ray emission is a key probe of cosmic rays (CRs) distribution within the Galaxy. However, the discrepancies between observations and theoretical model expectations highlight the need for refined uncertainty estimates. In the literature, spatial and temporal variability of lepton flux has been discussed as an uncertainty in diffuse $\gamma$-ray estimation. In the present work, we demonstrate that variability in the high energy CR hadron flux is an important, yet previously underappreciated, source of uncertainty in diffuse $\gamma$-ray estimates. To assess this effect, we perform fully three-dimensional, time-dependent GALPROP simulations of CR protons injected from discrete Galactic sources. Our results reveal that the uncertainty in the hadronic component of diffuse $\gamma$ rays is non-negligible and can be comparable to, or even exceed, current experimental uncertainties at very high energies. This finding challenges the conventional assumption that only leptonic fluctuations are relevant to diffuse $\gamma$-ray modeling.</description>

Abstract: We unveil the dynamical equivalence of field theories with non-canonical kinetic terms and canonical theories with a volume element invariant under transverse diffeomorphisms. The proof of the equivalence also reveals a subtle connection between the standard Legendre transformation and the so-called Clairaut equation. Explicit examples of canonizable theories include classes of $k$-essence, non-linear electrodynamics, or $f(R)$ theories. The equivalence can also be extended to the class of mimetic theories.</description>

      <title>Inflationary Decoherence from the Gravitational Floor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07769v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We re-examine the decoherence rate of primordial fluctuations within minimal inflationary models, using only the gravitational interactions required for the underlying fluctuation-generation mechanism itself. Since gravity provides the weakest interactions the result provides a plausible floor on the rate of primordial decoherence. Previous calculations (arXiv:2211.11046) did so using only a subset of these interactions, motivated by assuming both system and environment were super-Hubble. We extend this by including the effects on super-Hubble modes of {\it all} gravitational interactions at leading order in H/Mp (and so need not restrict the decohering environment to being super-Hubble). We show how the decohering evolution becomes Markovian for super-Hubble modes, without the need to appeal to truncations (like the `rotating wave' approximation) that are often used in optics but can be inapprorpriate for cosmology. We find that the dominant contribution comes from the nonlocal cubic interactions obtained by solving the constraints. We identify UV divergences systematically and verify thereby that the leading part of the purity evolution is UV finite. In the end we find a decoherence rate that grows in the super-Hubble regime significantly {\it faster} than found earlier. We take the preliminary steps to resum this result to late times and briefly discuss why they are more complicated than for earlier calculations.</description>

      <title>A dense dark matter core of the subhalo in the strong lensing system JVAS B1938+666</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nature of dark matter remains unknown, motivating the study of fuzzy/wave dark matter (FDM/$\psi$DM) and self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) as alternative frameworks to address small-scale discrepancies in halo profiles inferred from observations. This study presents a non-parametric reconstruction of the mass distribution of the previously-found, dark subhalo in the strong-lensing system JVAS B1938+666. Compared with the standard Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profile, both SIDM and $\psi$DM ($m_{\psi}=1.32^{+0.22}_{-0.31}\times 10^{-22} \, \rm eV$) provide significantly better fits to the resulting density profile. Moreover, the SIDM model is favored over $\psi$DM with a Bayes factor of 14.44. The reconstructed density profile features a characteristic kiloparsec-scale core ($r_c \approx 0.5 \, \rm kpc$) with central density $\rho_c \approx 2.5\times 10^{7}\, \rm M_{\odot} \, kpc^{-3} $, exhibiting remarkable consistency with the core-halo mass scaling relations observed in Local Group dwarf spheroidals. These findings offer insights that may help address the core-cusp discrepancy in $\Lambda$CDM substructure predictions.</description>

      <title>Use of $SU(3)$ flavor projection operators to construct baryon-meson scattering amplitudes in the $1/N_c$ expansion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.00879v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An $SU(3)$ flavor projection operator technique is implemented to construct the baryon-meson scattering amplitude in the framework of the $1/N_c$ expansion of QCD, where $N_c$ is the number of color charges. The operator technique is implemented to evaluate not only the lowest-order scattering amplitude but also effects coming from first-order perturbative $SU(3)$ flavor symmetry breaking and strong isospin breaking. The most general expression is obtained by accounting for explicitly the effects of the decuplet-octet baryon mass difference. At order $\mathcal{O}(1/N_c^2)$, a large number of unknown operator coefficients appear, so there is little additional predictive power unless leading and subleading terms are retained. Although the resultant expression is general enough that it can be applied to any incoming and outgoing baryons and pseudo scalar mesons, provided that the Gell-Mann--Nishijima scheme is respected, results for $N\pi\to N\pi$ scattering processes are explicitly dealt with.</description>

      <title>Relaxing Constraints on Dark Matter Annihilation Near the Supermassive Black Hole in M87</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18751v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The supermassive black hole at the center of M87 could redistribute dark matter particles within its sphere of influence, creating a high-density region known as a density spike. This spike can significantly enhance dark matter annihilation signals, making M87 a critical target for deriving stringent constraints on annihilation cross sections. In this work, we demonstrate that these constraints are highly sensitive to the choice of the halo density profile for M87. Motivated by recent kinematic studies of M87, we adopt a cored halo model and find that the constraints on dark matter annihilation are significantly relaxed. Specifically, in the cored halo scenario, the smooth part of the halo overwhelmingly dominates the annihilation signals, whereas the commonly-assumed cuspy halo model attributes a major contribution to the spike. We demonstrate this effect using a dark matter model with a light mediator.</description>

      <title>Bremsstrahlung photon contributions to parton energy loss at high virtuality ($Q^2$) : a perturbative calculation at $O(\alpha_{s} \alpha_{em})$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02667v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, real photon production scattering kernels from jet-medium interactions in the QCD medium are perturbatively calculated using the higher-twist (HT) formalism. Focus is given towards real photon production from a highly virtual (and highly energetic) quark, taking into account heavy-quark mass scales [Phys. Rev. C 94, 054902 (2016)], fermion-boson conversion processes [Nucl. Phys. A 793, 128 (2007)], as well as coherence effects [Phys. Rev. C 105, 024908 (2022)]. A generalized factorization procedure, such as that used in e-A deep-inelastic scattering, is employed to derive an improved single-scattering medium-induced photon emission kernels that go beyond the traditional in-medium gluon exchange approximation. Diagrams with real-photon emission from the hard quark are classified based on the final-state particles, and include two types of scattering kernels at $O(\alpha_{em}\alpha_{s})$ giving the following final states: (i) real photon and real quark, (ii) real photon and real gluon. The collisional kernels, thus derived, include full phase factors from all non-vanishing diagrams and complete second-order derivative terms in the transverse momentum gradient expansion. Moreover, the calculation includes heavy-quark mass effects, thus exploring heavy-quark energy loss. The in-medium parton distribution functions and the related jet transport coefficients have a hard transverse momentum dependence (of the emitted gluon or photon) present within the phase factor. It is observed that the jet transport coefficients resemble the transverse-momentum-dependent parton distribution functions.</description>

Abstract: We provide a detailed analysis of event-shape observables, namely the energy correlation function and jet angularity, for heavy-flavor jets produced in electron-positron collisions, focusing on quantum chromodynamics (QCD) interactions. Using modern jet substructure techniques, we investigate the dead-cone effect, where QCD radiation is suppressed around a heavy quark within an angle proportional to its mass. Our analysis achieves next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy, combined with fixed-order contributions, to improve the description of the transition near the dead-cone threshold. To ensure a comprehensive perspective, we compare our analytical results with predictions from the Pythia, Herwig and Sherpa Monte Carlo simulations at past and future lepton colliders.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00125v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Exoplanets, with their large volumes and low temperatures, are ideal celestial detectors for probing dark matter (DM) interactions. DM particles can lose energy through scattering with the planetary interior and become gravitationally captured if their interaction with the visible sector is sufficiently strong. In the absence of annihilation, the captured DM thermalizes and accumulates at the planet's center, eventually collapsing into black holes (BH). Using gaseous exoplanets as an example, we demonstrate that BH formation can occur within an observable timescale for superheavy DM with masses greater than $10^6 \, \mathrm{ GeV}$ and nuclear scattering cross sections. The BHs may either accrete the planetary medium or evaporate via Hawking radiation, depending on the mass of the DM that formed them. We explore the possibility of periodic BH formation within the unconstrained DM parameter space and discuss potential detection methods, including observations of planetary-mass objects, pulsed high-energy cosmic rays, and variations in exoplanet temperatures. Our findings suggest that future extensive exoplanet observations could provide complementary opportunities to terrestrial and cosmological searches for superheavy DM.</description>

      <title>Strong decays of $P_{\psi}^N(4440)^+$ and $P_\psi^N(4457)^+$ within the Bethe-Salpeter framework</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08440v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By combining the effective Lagrangian and Bethe-Salpeter framework, we studied the mass spectra, wave functions, and strong decay widths of the two pentaquark states $P_\psi^N(4440)^+$ and $P_\psi^N(4457)^+$ reported by LHCb in 2019. Taking into account both the mass ordering and the decay widths, our results favor the interpretation of $P_\psi^N(4440)^+$ and $P_\psi^N(4457)^+$ as the isospin-$\frac12$ $[\bar D^*\Sigma_c]$ molecular states with $J^P$ configuration $(\frac{3}{2})^-$ and $(\frac12)^-$, respectively. We first calculate the one-boson-exchange interaction kernel of $[\bar D^*\Sigma_c]$ in the isospin-$\frac12$ configuration. Then we present the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) and wave functions for the bound states of a vector meson and a $\frac12$ baryon with $J^P={\frac12}^-$ and ${\frac32}^-$. The obtained mass results for the $(\frac32)^-$ and $(\frac12)^-$ are $4.442$ and $4.457$ GeV, respectively. Combining the effective Lagrangians and the BS wave functions, we further calculate the strong decay channels $\bar D^{(*)0}\Lambda_c^+$, $J/\psi(\eta_c) p$, and $\bar D\Sigma_c^{(*)}$ for the two $P_\psi^N$ states. In the favored $\frac32^-$ and $\frac12^-$ configuration, the obtained total widths are $21.8$ MeV and $13.0$ MeV, respectively, which are substantially consistent with the LHCb data. Our results suggest that $\bar D^{0}\Lambda_c^+$ and $\bar D^{(*)0}\Lambda_c^+$ are the dominant decay channels to detect $P_\psi^N(4440)^+$ and $P_\psi^N(4457)^+$, respectively.</description>

Abstract: We consider the addition to the Standard Model of a scalar $SU(2)$ multiplet $\Delta_n$ with dimension $n$ going from $1$ to $6$. The multiplet $\Delta_n$ is assumed to have null vacuum expectation value and an arbitrary (free) hypercharge. We determine the shape of the phase space for the new terms that appear in the scalar potential (SP); we observe in particular that, in the case of a 6-plet, the phase space is slightly concave along one of its boundaries. We determine the bounded-from-below and vacuum stability conditions on the SP for each value of $n$.</description>

      <title>Lepton flavor violation by three units</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17178v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The conservation of lepton flavor is a prediction of the Standard Model and is still an excellent approximate symmetry despite our observation of neutrino oscillations. Lepton flavor violation by one or two units have been discussed for decades, with several dedicated experiments exploring the vast model landscape but no discoveries so far. Here, we explore operators and processes that violate at least one lepton flavor by three units and identify testable signatures. In the Standard Model effective field theory, such operators already arise at mass dimension 7 and can be tested through their contributions to Michel parameters in leptonic decays. True neutrinoless charged-lepton flavor violation arises at mass dimension 10 and can realistically only be seen in the tau decay channels $\tau \to eee\bar{\mu}\bar{\mu}$ or $\tau \to \mu\mu\mu\bar{e}\bar{e}$, for example in Belle II. Testable rates for these tau decays require light new particles and subsequently predict an avalanche of remarkably clean but so-far unconstrained collider signatures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18540v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that the ${\psi(2\mathrm S)}$ subthreshold pole influences the cross section of the electron-positron annihilation into the ${\mathrm D\bar\mathrm D}$ final states. We perform fits to the merged BES \cite{bes2008} and BESIII \cite{besiii2024} data on ${\mathrm D^0\bar\mathrm D^0}$ and ${\mathrm D^+\mathrm D^-}$ final states, and also two common fits to both processes. The statistical significance of the ${\psi(2\mathrm S)}$ subthreshold pole in all these fits reaches values greater than 6.5$\sigma$.</description>

      <title>A Determination of ${\alpha}_s(m_Z)$ at ${\bf aN^3LO_{QCD}}\otimes {\bf {NLO}_{QED}}$ Accuracy from a Global PDF Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13871v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a determination of the strong coupling $\alpha_s(m_Z)$ from a global dataset including both fixed-target and collider data from deep-inelastic scattering and a variety of hadronic processes, with a simultaneous determination of parton distribution functions (PDFs) based on the NNPDF4.0 methodology. This determination is performed at NNLO and approximate N$^3$LO (aN$^3$LO) perturbative QCD accuracy, including QED corrections and a photon PDF up to NLO accuracy. We extract $\alpha_s$ using two independent methodologies, both of which take into account the cross-correlation between $\alpha_s$ and the PDFs. The two methodologies are validated by closure tests that allow us to detect and remove or correct for several sources of bias, and lead to mutually consistent results. We account for all correlated experimental uncertainties, as well as correlated theoretical uncertainties related to missing higher order perturbative corrections (MHOUs). We study the perturbative convergence of our results and the impact of QED corrections. We assess individual sources of uncertainty, specifically MHOUs and the value of the top quark mass. We provide a detailed appraisal of methodological choices, including the choice of input dataset, the form of solution of evolution equation, the treatment of the experimental covariance matrix, and the details of Monte Carlo data generation. We find $\alpha_s(m_Z)=0.1194^{+0.0007}_{-0.0014}$ at aN$^3$LO$_{\rm QCD}\otimes {\rm NLO}_{\rm QED}$ accuracy, consistent with the latest PDG average and with recent lattice results.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the strong vertices $\Lambda_cD^{(*)}N^*(1535)$ and $\Lambda_bB^{(*)}N^*(1535)$ in QCD sum rules</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23095v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we firstly analyze the mass and pole residue of negative parity nucleon $N^*(1535)$ within the two-point QCD sum rules. Basing on these results, we continuously study the strong coupling constants of vertices $\Lambda_cDN^*$, $\Lambda_cD^*N^*$, $\Lambda_bBN^*$ and $\Lambda_bB^*N^*$ in the framework of three-point QCD sum rules. At hadron side, all possible couplings of interpolating current to hadronic states are considered. At QCD side, the contributions of vacuum condensate terms $\langle\bar{q}q\rangle$, $\langle g_s^2GG\rangle$, $\langle\bar{q} g_s\sigma Gq\rangle$, $\langle\bar{q}q\rangle^2$ and $g_s^2\langle\bar{q}q\rangle^2$ are also considered. By setting the four momentum of $D^{(*)}[B^{(*)}]$ mesons off-shell, the strong coupling constants in deep space-like regions ($Q^2=-q^2\gg\Lambda_{QCD}^2$) are obtained. Then, the momentum dependent coupling constants in space-like regions are fitted into analytical function $G(Q^2)$ and are extrapolated into time-like regions ($Q^2&lt;0$). Finally, the on-shell values of strong coupling constants are obtained by taking $Q^{2}=-m_{D^{(*)}[B^{(*)}]}^2$. The results are $G_{\Lambda_cDN^*}(Q^2=-m_D^2)=4.06^{+0.96}_{-0.75}$, $f_{\Lambda_cD^*N^*}(Q^2=-m_{D^*}^2)=3.73^{+0.68}_{-0.16}$, $g_{\Lambda_cD^*N^*}(Q^2=-m_{D^*}^2)=9.22^{+3.16}_{-0.36}$, $G_{\Lambda_bBN^*}(Q^2=-m_B^2)=9.11^{+1.54}_{-1.61}$, $f_{\Lambda_bB^*N^*}(Q^2=-m_{B^*}^2)=8.55^{+2.69}_{-2.21}$ and $g_{\Lambda_bB^*N^*}(Q^2=-m_{B^*}^2)=-0.25^{+0.16}_{-0.01}$.</description>

      <title>Comparison of chiral limit studies in curvature mass versus on-shell renormalized quark-meson model using ChPT</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04597v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consistent chiral limit has been investigated in the curvature mass parametrized quark-meson (QM) model with the quark one-loop vacuum term (QMVT) employing the infrared regularized Chiral perturbation theory (ChPT) predicted scaling of the pion,~kaon decay constants $f_{\pi}, f_{K} $ and $M_{\eta}^2 = m_{\eta}^2 + m_{\eta^{\prime}}^2 $ when the $\pi \ \text{and} \ K $ meson masses are reduced as one moves away from the physical point in the Columbia plot.~Comparing the QMVT model Columbia plots with the corresponding Columbia plots computed,~in the very recent work of Ref.~\cite{vkt25} using the on-shell renormalized QM (RQM) model and the earlier work of Ref.~\cite{Resch} using functional renormalization group techniques in the extended mean field approximation of QM (e-MFA:QM-FRG) model,~it has been estimated how the first, second and crossover chiral transition regions in the $m_{\pi}-m_{K}$($m_{ud}-m_{s}$) and the $\mu-m_{K}$($\mu-m_{s}$) planes,~get modified by different methods of implementing the quark one-loop vacuum fluctuations in the QM model.~Since both the e-MFA:QM-FRG and the QMVT model,~use curvature meson masses to fix the parameters and the dimensional regularization of vacuum divergences are incorporated equivalently,~the differences in their results can be attributed to different methods of approaching the chiral limit.</description>

      <title>Studying Two-Photon Exchange in Deep Inelastic Scattering with the HERA Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.23092v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two-photon exchange (TPE) is one of the leading explanations for discrepancies in measurements of the proton electromagnetic form factors. It has been proposed that TPE could impact not only elastic scattering, but also the cross sections for both inclusive deep inelastic scattering (DIS) and semi-inclusive DIS, thereby affecting the interpretation of DIS structure functions in terms of parton distributions. It is expected that higher-order QED effects such as TPE should manifest as a deviation from unity in the ratio of \epp and \emp DIS cross sections. We use the existing inclusive $e^{\pm}p$ DIS data from HERA and SLAC to constrain higher-order QED effects on inclusive DIS.</description>

      <title>Fermion mass ratios from the exceptional Jordan algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10131v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The origin of the three fermion generations and their highly hierarchical mass spectra remains one of the most profound puzzles in particle physics. We show that the complexified exceptional Jordan algebra \(J_{3}(\mathbb{O}_{\mathbb{C}})\), the natural mathematical framework for the exceptional Lie group \(E_{6}\), provides a unified explanation for both. In this approach, the three generations arise from the three canonical eigenvalues of Jordan elements, while their mass hierarchies are determined by a minimal, universal ladder in the \(\mathrm{Sym}^{3}(\mathbf{3})\) representation of a flavor \(SU(3)\) subgroup.
  The construction yields several parameter-free predictions. The universal Jordan eigenvalue spectrum \((q-\delta, q, q+\delta)\) is fixed by the algebra to have a spread \(\delta^{2}=3/8\). The requirement of a minimal, consistent ladder uniquely selects fixed Clebsch-Gordan factors \((2,1,1)\) for state mixing. Together, these inputs derive closed-form expressions for the square-root mass ratios of all charged fermions (quarks and leptons) from a single underlying structure. A Dynkin \(\mathbb{Z}_{2}\) automorphism of \(E_{6}\) (a ``swap'') naturally relates the down-quark and charged-lepton sectors, predicting \(\sqrt{m_{\tau}/m_{\mu}} = \sqrt{m_{s}/m_{d}}\). The first-generation mass scale is set by a trace split \(\operatorname{Tr}X_{\ell}:\operatorname{Tr}X_{u}:\operatorname{Tr}X_{d}=1:2:3\), leading to the relation \(\sqrt{m_{e}}:\sqrt{m_{u}}:\sqrt{m_{d}}=1:2:3\).</description>

Abstract: In this article, the electroweak transition form factors of $\Lambda_b\to\Lambda_c$ and $\Xi_b\to\Xi_c$ are analyzed within the framework of three-point QCD sum rules. In phenomenological side, all possible couplings of interpolating current to hadronic states are considered. In QCD side, the perturbative part and the contributions of vacuum condensates up to dimension 8 are also included. With the estimated form factors, we study the decay widths and branching ratios of semileptonic decays $\Lambda_b\to\Lambda_cl\bar{\nu}_l$ and $\Xi_b\to\Xi_cl\bar{\nu}_l$ ($l=e,\mu$ and $\tau$). Our results for the branching ratios of $\Lambda_b\to\Lambda_cl\bar{\nu}_l$ are comparable with experimental data and the results from other collaborations. In addition, our prediction for the branching ratio of $\Xi_b\to\Xi_cl\bar{\nu}_l$ can provide a valuable reference for future experimental measurements.</description>

      <title>Prospects for relic neutrino detection using nuclear spin experiments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20357v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Direct detection of the cosmic neutrino background (C$\nu$B) remains one of the most formidable experimental challenges in modern physics. In this work, we extend recent studies of C$\nu$B-induced coherent transitions in polarised nuclear spin ensembles. Adopting an open quantum system framework, we model coherent neutrino effects in large spin ensembles using a Lindblad master equation that also incorporates realistic experimental imperfections such as local dephasing and imperfect polarisation. We solve the Lindblad equation numerically by way of a fast and computationally inexpensive method that can be extended to an arbitrarily large number of spins. Using our numerical solutions, we forecast the sensitivities of future experiments such as CASPEr to the local C$\nu$B overdensity parameter $\delta_\nu$. Our findings indicate that a CASPEr-like experiment, though primarily aimed at axion dark matter search, could also constrain the C$\nu$B overdensity to $\delta_\nu \sim 10^{12}-10^{14}$ in configurations achievable by currently planned experimental efforts, and down to $\delta_\nu \sim 10^{11}$ in the most optimised scenario. While C$\nu$B detection remains out of reach in the foreseeable future, our results highlight the potential of using quantum sensing to probe fundamental physics.</description>

Abstract: Generative modeling of high-energy collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) offers a data-driven route to simulations, anomaly detection, among other applications. A central challenge lies in the hybrid nature of particle-cloud data: each particle carries continuous kinematic features and discrete quantum numbers such as charge and flavor. We introduce a transformer-based multimodal flow that extends flow-matching with a continuous-time Markov jump bridge to jointly model LHC jets with both modalities. Trained on CMS Open Data, our model can generate high fidelity jets with realistic kinematics, jet substructure and flavor composition.</description>

      <title>Wave-particle duality and entanglement in neutrino oscillation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03089v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze neutrino oscillations from the perspective of quantum complementarity by extending the familiar wave-particle duality into a exact triality relation among visibility, predictability, and entanglement. Using a density-matrix approach, we construct explicit measures of these quantities in both two- and three-flavor frameworks and show that they satisfy an exact conservation-like identity throughout oscillation evolution. In this picture, visibility corresponds to interference strength, predictability to flavor imbalance, and entanglement to the reduction of purity due to flavor correlations. We demonstrate that neutrino oscillations naturally exhibit regimes of maximal entanglement, vanishing coherence, and entanglement monogamy constraining flavor correlations. Our results establish that long-baseline neutrino oscillations realize the triality relation in an energy-dependent way, with T2K probing vacuum-like coherence entanglement balance and DUNE revealing the decisive role of matter e ects in redistributing the quantum information budget.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02665v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the Veneziano amplitude of string theory is the unique solution to an analytically solvable bootstrap problem. Uniqueness follows from two assumptions: faster than power-law falloff in high-energy scattering and the existence of some infinite sequence in momentum transfer at which higher-spin exchanges cancel. The string amplitude-including the mass spectrum-is an output of this bootstrap. If the amplitude merely vanishes at high energies, the solution is a three-parameter family containing the Veneziano, Coon, and hypergeometric amplitudes, and more.</description>

Abstract: Starting from the running coupling in the gradient flow scheme, the QCD Lambda parameter $\Lambda_{\,\overline{\!\rm MS\!}\;}$ is determined analytically with respect to the reference scale $w_0$ in the pure gauge theory. A key element is the gluon condensate, which, being invariant under RG transformations, establishes a formal relationship between $\Lambda_{\,\overline{\!\rm MS\!}\;}$ and $w_0$. Good agreement with numerical estimates is found.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03547v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a galaxy, given its observed rotation curve, can one directly infer parameters of the dark matter density profile (such as dark matter particle mass $m$, scaling parameter $s$, core-to-envelope transition radius $r_t$ and NFW scale radius $r_s$), along with Baryonic parameters (such as the stellar mass-to-light ratio $\Upsilon_*$)? In this work, using simulated rotation curves, we train neural networks, which can then be fed observed rotation curves of dark matter dominated dwarf galaxies from the SPARC catalog, to infer parameter values and their uncertainties. Since observed rotation curves have errors, we also explore the very important effect of noise in the training data on the inference. We employ two different methods to quantify uncertainties in the estimated parameters, and compare the results with those obtained using Bayesian methods. We find that the trained neural networks can extract parameters that describe observations well for the galaxies we studied.</description>

      <title>Two-Step Procedure to Detect Cosmological Gravitational Wave Backgrounds with Next-Generation Terrestrial Gravitational-Wave Detectors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17717v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cosmological gravitational-wave backgrounds are an exciting science target for next-generation ground-based detectors, as they encode invaluable information about the primordial Universe. However, any such background is expected to be obscured by the astrophysical foreground from compact-binary coalescences. We propose a novel framework to detect a cosmological gravitational-wave background in the presence of binary black holes and binary neutron star signals with next-generation ground-based detectors, including Cosmic Explorer and the Einstein Telescope. Our procedure involves first removing all the individually resolved binary black hole signals by notching them out in the time-frequency domain. Then, we perform joint Bayesian inference on the individually resolved binary neutron star signals, the unresolved binary neutron star foreground, and the cosmological background. For a flat cosmological background, we find that we can claim detection at $5\,\sigma$ level when $\Omega_\mathrm{ref}\geqslant 2.7\times 10^{-12}/\sqrt{T_\mathrm{obs}/\mathrm{yr}}$, where $T_\mathrm{obs}$ is the observation time (in years), which is within a factor of $\lesssim2$ from the sensitivity reached in absence of these astrophysical foregrounds.</description>

      <title>The Belle II Experiment at SuperKEKB -- Input to the European Particle Physics Strategy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24155v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Belle II is an intensity-frontier experiment at the SuperKEKB collider in Tsukuba, Japan. Over the coming decades, it will record the decays of billions of bottom mesons, charm hadrons, and tau leptons produced in 10 GeV electron-positron collisions. The experiment's low-background environment and precisely known kinematics enable high-precision measurements of hundreds of Standard Model (SM) parameters while probing for new particles at mass scales far beyond the direct reach of high-energy colliders. We project Belle II's sensitivity for key measurements - where it will be uniquely positioned or world-leading - over datasets ranging from 1 to 50 ab${}^{-1}$. By exploring previously uncharted regions of non-SM parameter space with high precision, Belle II will either reveal new physics or set stringent constraints, guiding future experimental and theoretical efforts. Additionally, we outline near-term upgrades to the Belle II detector and SuperKEKB accelerator, which will enhance sensitivity in searches for new physics beyond the SM across flavor, tau, electroweak, and dark sector physics. These improvements will ensure that Belle II remains both complementary to and competitive with the LHC and other experiments.</description>

      <title>Positive neutrino masses with DESI DR2 via matter conversion to dark energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20338v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) is a massively parallel spectroscopic survey on the Mayall telescope at Kitt Peak, which has released measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations determined from over 14 million extragalactic targets. We combine DESI Data Release 2 with CMB datasets to search for evidence of matter conversion to dark energy (DE), focusing on a scenario mediated by stellar collapse to cosmologically-coupled black holes (CCBH). In this physical model, which has the same number of free parameters as $\Lambda$CDM, DE production is determined by the cosmic star formation rate density (SFRD), allowing for distinct early- and late-time cosmologies. Using two SFRDs to bracket current observations, we find that the CCBH model: accurately recovers the cosmological expansion history, agrees with early-time baryon abundance measured by BBN, reduces tension with the local distance ladder, and relaxes constraints on the summed neutrino mass $\sum m_\nu$. For these SFRDs, we find a peaked positive $\sum m_\nu &lt; 0.149\,\rm eV$ (95% confidence) and $\sum m_\nu = 0.106^{+0.050}_{-0.069}\,\rm eV$ respectively, in good agreement with lower limits from neutrino oscillation experiments. A peak in $\sum m_\nu &gt; 0$ results from late-time baryon consumption in the CCBH scenario and is expected to be a general feature of any model that converts sufficient matter to dark energy during and after reionization.</description>

      <title>Testing the Lense-Thirring Precession Origin of the QPO in Swift J1727.8$-$1613</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18857v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive spectral and timing analysis of the newly discovered black hole transient Swift J1727.8$-$1613, based on broadband (2$-$150 keV) observations from $Insight$-HXMT during its 2023 outburst. We use the flexible, energy-conserving SSsed model to model both the outer disc and inner, complex Comptonisation, using the expected disc emissivity to constrain the corona radius, $r_{cor}$. This decreases from 45 $R_{\rm g}$ to 9 $R_{\rm g}$ during the transition from the hard to hard intermediate and then soft intermediate state. We plot $r_{cor}$ versus the centroid frequency of the strong quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs; $\nu_{\rm c}$) seen in these data to test the inner hot flow Lense-Thirring (LT) precession model. The overall slope of the observed trend is in strong agreement with the predictions of LT precession, despite the complexities of accretion behavior, though there is an offset in absolute value which may indicate that the system parameters are still not well determined. The inner radius of the hot flow is consistent with a constant value throughout most of the outburst, indicating that changes in the jet (e.g. the discrete ejections) do not strongly affect the radiated power. Either the jet kinetic power is not a large fraction of the accretion power or the jet is instead mostly powered by the spin energy of the black hole.</description>

      <title>Anomaly cancellation for a $U(1)$ factor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11583v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use methods of arithmetic geometry to find solutions to the abelian local anomaly cancellation equations for a four-dimensional gauge theory whose Lie algebra has a single $\mathfrak{u}_1$ summand, assuming that a non-trivial solution exists. The resulting polynomial equations in the integer $\mathfrak{u}_1$ charges define a projective cubic hypersurface over the field of rational numbers. Generically, such a hypersurface is (by a theorem of Koll{\'a}r) unirational, making it possible to find a finitely-many-to-one parameterization of infinitely many solutions using secant and tangent constructions. As an example, for the Standard Model Lie algebra with its three generations of quarks and leptons (or even with just a single generation and two $\mathfrak{su}_3\oplus\mathfrak{su}_2$ singlet right-handed neutrinos), it follows that there are infinitely many anomaly-free possibilities for the $\mathfrak{u}_1$ hypercharges. We also discuss whether it is possible to find all solutions in this way.</description>
