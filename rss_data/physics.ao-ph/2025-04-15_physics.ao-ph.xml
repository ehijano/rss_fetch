      <title>NWP-based deep learning for tropical cyclone intensity prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Global artificial intelligence (AI) models are rapidly advancing and beginning to outperform traditional numerical weather prediction (NWP) models across metrics, yet predicting regional extreme weather such as tropical cyclone (TC) intensity presents unique spatial and temporal challenges that global AI models cannot capture. This study presents a new approach to train deep learning (DL) models specifically for regional extreme weather prediction. By leveraging physics-based NWP models to generate high-resolution data, we demonstrate that DL models can better predict or downscale TC intensity and structure when fine-scale processes are properly accounted for. Furthermore, by training DL models on different resolution outputs from physics-based simulations, we highlight the critical role of fine-scale processes in larger storm-scale dynamics, an aspect that current climate datasets used to train most global DL models cannot fully represent. These findings underscore the challenges in predicting or downscaling extreme weather with data-driven models, thus proposing the new role of NWP models as data generators for training DL models in the future AI model development for weather applications.</description>

      <title>Low latency global carbon budget reveals a continuous decline of the land carbon sink during the 2023/24 El Nino event</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The high growth rate of atmospheric CO2 in 2023 was found to be caused by a severe reduction of the global net land carbon sink. Here we update the global CO2 budget from January 1st to July 1st 2024, during which El Ni\~no drought conditions continued to prevail in the Tropics but ceased by March 2024. We used three dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs), machine learning emulators of ocean models, three atmospheric inversions driven by observations from the second Orbiting Carbon Observatory (OCO-2) satellite, and near-real-time fossil CO2 emissions estimates. In a one-year period from July 2023 to July 2024 covering the El Ni\~no 2023/24 event, we found a record-high CO2 growth rate of 3.66~$\pm$~0.09 ppm~yr$^{-1}$ ($\pm$~1 standard deviation) since 1979. Yet, the CO2 growth rate anomaly obtained after removing the long term trend is 1.1 ppm~yr$^{-1}$, which is marginally smaller than the July--July growth rate anomalies of the two major previous El Ni\~no events in 1997/98 and 2015/16. The atmospheric CO2 growth rate anomaly was primarily driven by a 2.24 GtC~yr$^{-1}$ reduction in the net land sink including 0.3 GtC~yr$^{-1}$ of fire emissions, partly offset by a 0.38 GtC~yr$^{-1}$ increase in the ocean sink relative to the 2015--2022 July--July mean. The tropics accounted for 97.5\% of the land CO2 flux anomaly, led by the Amazon (50.6\%), central Africa (34\%), and Southeast Asia (8.2\%), with extra-tropical sources in South Africa and southern Brazil during April--July 2024. Our three DGVMs suggest greater tropical CO2 losses in 2023/2024 than during the two previous large El Ni\~no in 1997/98 and 2015/16, whereas inversions indicate losses more comparable to 2015/16. Overall, this update of the low latency budget highlights the impact of recent El Ni\~no droughts in explaining the high CO2 growth rate until July 2024.</description>

      <title>Building Machine Learning Limited Area Models: Kilometer-Scale Weather Forecasting in Realistic Settings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning is revolutionizing global weather forecasting, with models that efficiently produce highly accurate forecasts. Apart from global forecasting there is also a large value in high-resolution regional weather forecasts, focusing on accurate simulations of the atmosphere for a limited area. Initial attempts have been made to use machine learning for such limited area scenarios, but these experiments do not consider realistic forecasting settings and do not investigate the many design choices involved. We present a framework for building kilometer-scale machine learning limited area models with boundary conditions imposed through a flexible boundary forcing method. This enables boundary conditions defined either from reanalysis or operational forecast data. Our approach employs specialized graph constructions with rectangular and triangular meshes, along with multi-step rollout training strategies to improve temporal consistency. We perform systematic evaluation of different design choices, including the boundary width, graph construction and boundary forcing integration. Models are evaluated across both a Danish and a Swiss domain, two regions that exhibit different orographical characteristics. Verification is performed against both gridded analysis data and in-situ observations, including a case study for the storm Ciara in February 2020. Both models achieve skillful predictions across a wide range of variables, with our Swiss model outperforming the numerical weather prediction baseline for key surface variables. With their substantially lower computational cost, our findings demonstrate great potential for machine learning limited area models in the future of regional weather forecasting.</description>

      <title>Lacking oceanic-driven internal multidecadal climate variability is compensated by forced variability in model simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Regional climate change in the $21^{st}$ century will result from the interplay between human-induced changes and internal climate variability. Competing effects from greenhouse gas warming and aerosol cooling have historically caused multidecadal forced climate variations overlapping with internal variability. Despite extensive historical observations, disentangling the contributions of internal and forced variability remains debated, largely due to the uncertain magnitude of anthropogenic aerosols.
  Here, we show that, after removing CO$_{2}$-congruent variability, multidecadal temperature variability in instrumental data is largely attributable to internal processes of oceanic origin. This follows from an emergent relationship, identified in historical climate model simulations, between the driver of variability in oceanic regions and the land-ocean variance ratio in the mid-latitudes. Thus, climate models with higher residual (non-CO$_{2}$) forced variability, largely linked to volcanic and anthropogenic aerosols, exhibit more spatially coherent and amplified temperature patterns over land compared to observations. In contrast, models with higher internal variability agree better with the instrumental data. Our results underscore that internal modes of ocean-driven variability may be too weak in many climate models, and that current projections may be underestimating the range of internal variability in regions with high oceanic influence.</description>

      <title>Physical Scales Matter: The Role of Receptive Fields and Advection in Satellite-Based Thunderstorm Nowcasting with Convolutional Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The focus of nowcasting development is transitioning from physically motivated advection methods to purely data-driven Machine Learning (ML) approaches. Nevertheless, recent work indicates that incorporating advection into the ML value chain has improved skill for radar-based precipitation nowcasts. However, the generality of this approach and the underlying causes remain unexplored. This study investigates the generality by probing the approach on satellite-based thunderstorm nowcasts for the first time. Resorting to a scale argument, we then put forth an explanation when and why skill improvements can be expected. In essence, advection guarantees that thunderstorm patterns relevant for nowcasting are contained in the receptive field at long lead times. To test our hypotheses, we train ResU-Nets solving segmentation tasks with lightning observations as ground truth. The input of the Baseline Neural Network (BNN) are short time series of multispectral satellite imagery and lightning observations, whereas the Advection-Informed Neural Network (AINN) additionally receives the Lagrangian persistence nowcast of all input channels at the desired lead time. Overall, we find only a minor skill improvement of the AINN over the BNN when considering fully averaged scores. However, assessing skill conditioned on lead time and wind speed, we demonstrate that our scale argument correctly predicts the onset of skill improvement of the AINN over the BNN after 2h lead time. We confirm that generally advection becomes gradually more important with longer lead times and higher wind speeds. Our work accentuates the importance of considering and incorporating the underlying physical scales when designing ML based forecasting models.</description>

      <title>No reliable studies of climate change without Henry's Law and a new thermometer for the global temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.01245v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In our previous paper "No experimental evidence for the significant anthropogenic climate change" we had a reference to this paper. Thus, we have presented a new theory: how Henry's Law regulates the concentration of CO$_2$ in the atmosphere. This theory uses a physically perfect unit impulse response to convolve signals. By comparing the theory and the present observations we are able to derive the response time about 7.4 years, which is roughly the residence time of CO$_2$ in the atmosphere. In addition, according to Henry's Law we can derive the temperature dependence of the equilibrium concentration of CO$_2$. It turns out that now the major increase of CO$_2$ in the atmosphere is due to the temperature change, the reason for which is approximately a change of cloudiness ($90\%$) and the rest ($10\%$) the greenhouse effect. The corresponding increase of CO$_2$ is $83$~ppm/$^\circ$C. According to our theory, the causality is very clear: the increase of the temperature results in more CO$_2$ in the atmosphere. This further CO$_2$ concentration increases also the temperature but less than $10\%$ via the greenhouse effect. The human contribution to the CO$_2$ concentration and the temperature is very small. About $90\%$ of a big human release of CO$_2$ dissolves in water. That is why the human release now warms the climate less than $0.03 ^\circ$C. We can also perform an inverse operation or calculate the temperature profile from the observed CO$_2$ curve. So we propose a new thermometer for the global surface temperature. This can be used almost in real time and it is more accurate than the present methods. It turns out that probably also N$_2$O and SF$_6$ concentrations in the atmosphere operate as global thermometers.</description>

      <title>Continuous Ensemble Weather Forecasting with Diffusion models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05431v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Weather forecasting has seen a shift in methods from numerical simulations to data-driven systems. While initial research in the area focused on deterministic forecasting, recent works have used diffusion models to produce skillful ensemble forecasts. These models are trained on a single forecasting step and rolled out autoregressively. However, they are computationally expensive and accumulate errors for high temporal resolution due to the many rollout steps. We address these limitations with Continuous Ensemble Forecasting, a novel and flexible method for sampling ensemble forecasts in diffusion models. The method can generate temporally consistent ensemble trajectories completely in parallel, with no autoregressive steps. Continuous Ensemble Forecasting can also be combined with autoregressive rollouts to yield forecasts at an arbitrary fine temporal resolution without sacrificing accuracy. We demonstrate that the method achieves competitive results for global weather forecasting with good probabilistic properties.</description>

      <title>Geodesic vortex detection on curved surfaces: Analyzing the 2002 austral stratospheric polar vortex warming event</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03135v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Geodesic vortex detection is a tool in nonlinear dynamical systems to objectively identify transient vortices with flow-invariant boundaries that defy the typical deformation found in 2-d turbulence. Initially formulated for flows on the Euclidean plane with Cartesian coordinates, we have extended this technique to flows on 2-d Riemannian manifolds with arbitrary coordinates. This extension required the further formulation of the concept of objectivity on manifolds. Moreover, a recently proposed birth-and-death vortex framing algorithm, based on geodesic detection, has been adapted to address the limited temporal validity of 2-d motion in otherwise 3-d flows, like those found in the Earth's stratosphere. With these adaptations, we focused on the Lagrangian, i.e., kinematic, aspects of the austral stratospheric polar vortex during the exceptional sudden warming event of 2002, which resulted in the vortex splitting. This study involved applying geodesic vortex detection to isentropic winds from reanalysis data. We provide a detailed analysis of the vortex's life cycle, covering its birth, the splitting process, and its eventual death. In addition, we offer new kinematic insights into ozone depletion within the vortex.</description>

      <title>Improving Tropical Cyclone Forecasting With Video Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16003v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tropical cyclone (TC) forecasting is crucial for disaster preparedness and mitigation. While recent deep learning approaches have shown promise, existing methods often treat TC evolution as a series of independent frame-to-frame predictions, limiting their ability to capture long-term dynamics. We present a novel application of video diffusion models for TC forecasting that explicitly models temporal dependencies through additional temporal layers. Our approach enables the model to generate multiple frames simultaneously, better capturing cyclone evolution patterns. We introduce a two-stage training strategy that significantly improves individual-frame quality and performance in low-data regimes. Experimental results show our method outperforms the previous approach of Nath et al. by 19.3% in MAE, 16.2% in PSNR, and 36.1% in SSIM. Most notably, we extend the reliable forecasting horizon from 36 to 50 hours. Through comprehensive evaluation using both traditional metrics and Fr\'echet Video Distance (FVD), we demonstrate that our approach produces more temporally coherent forecasts while maintaining competitive single-frame quality.
