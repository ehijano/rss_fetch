      <title>Exploring the role of diffusive coupling in spatiotemporal chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the chaotic dynamics of a large one-dimensional lattice of coupled maps with diffusive coupling of varying strength using the covariant Lyapunov vectors (CLVs). Using a lattice of diffusively coupled quadratic maps we quantify the growth of spatial structures in the chaotic dynamics as the strength of diffusion is increased. When the diffusion strength is increased from zero, we find that the leading Lyapunov exponent decreases rapidly from a positive value to zero to yield a small window of periodic dynamics which is then followed by chaotic dynamics. For values of the diffusion strength beyond the window of periodic dynamics, the leading Lyapunov exponent does not vary significantly with the strength of diffusion with the exception of a small variation for the largest diffusion strengths we explore. The Lyapunov spectrum and fractal dimension are described analytically as a function of the diffusion strength using the eigenvalues of the coupling operator. The spatial features of the CLVs are quantified and compared with the eigenvectors of the coupling operator. The chaotic dynamics are composed entirely of physical modes for all of the conditions we explore. The leading CLV is highly localized and the localization decreases with increasing strength of the spatial coupling. The violation of the dominance of Oseledets splitting indicates that the entanglement of pairs of CLVs becomes more significant between neighboring CLVs as the strength of the diffusion is increased.</description>

      <title>The Graph Structure of Baker's maps Implemented on a Computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The complex dynamics of baker's map and its variants in an infinite-precision mathematical domain have been extensively analyzed in the past five decades. However, their real structure implemented in a finite-precision computer remains unclear. This paper gives an explicit formulation for the quantized baker's map and its extension into higher dimensions. Our study reveals certain properties, such as the in-degree distribution in the state-mapping network approaching a constant with increasing precision, and a consistent maximum in-degree across various levels of fixed-point arithmetic precision. We also observe a fractal pattern in baker's map functional graph as precision increases, characterized by fractal dimensions. We then thoroughly examine the structural nuances of functional graphs created by the higher-dimensional baker's map (HDBM) in both fixed-point and floating-point arithmetic domains. An interesting aspect of our study is the use of interval arithmetic to establish a relationship between the HDBM's functional graphs across these two computational domains. A particularly intriguing discovery is the emergence of a semi-fractal pattern within the functional graph of a specific baker's map variant, observed as the precision is incrementally increased. The insights gained from our research offer a foundational understanding for the dynamic analysis and application of baker's map and its variants in various domains.</description>

      <title>Path planning for multi-quadrotor 3D boundary surveillance using non-autonomous discrete memristor hyperchaotic system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies have shown that chaotic maps are well-suited for applications requiring unpredictable behaviour, making them a valuable tool for enhancing unpredictability and complexity. A method is developed using 3D parametric equations to make boundary surveillance more robust and flexible to effectively cover and adapt to the ever-changing situations of boundary surveillance. A non-autonomous discrete memristor hyperchaotic map is utilized to significantly enhance the unpredictability of trajectories in boundary surveillance. Since the scaling property is an affine transformation, and the hyperchaotic systems are invariant under affine transformations, the adaptability of hyperchaotic trajectories is visually demonstrated by applying the scaling property for robust path planning. Furthermore, hyperchaotic systems enable the generation of mutually independent trajectories with slight variations in initial conditions, allowing multiple quadrotors to operate simultaneously along a single guiding path. This minimizes the chance of overlap and interference, ensuring effective and coordinated surveillance.</description>

      <title>Beyond the ensemble paradigm in low dimensional quantum gravity: Schwarzian density, quantum chaos and wormhole contributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Based on periodic orbit theory we address the individual-system versus ensemble interpretation of quantum gravity from a quantum chaos perspective. To this end we show that the spectrum of geodesic motion on high-dimensional hyperbolic manifolds, described by the Selberg trace formula, displays a Schwarzian ($\sinh 2\pi\sqrt{E}$) mean level density. Due to its chaotic classical limit, this quantum system also shows all universal signatures of quantum chaos. These two properties imply a possible duality to Jackiw-Teitelboim-type quantum gravity at the level of a single system instead of an ensemble of systems like matrix theories and SYK models. Beyond the universal regime we show how the full wormhole geometry on the gravity side emerges from the discreteness of the set of periodic orbits. Thereby, we take initial steps towards a duality between gravitational and mesoscopic chaotic quantum systems through the topological, respectively, periodic orbit expansions of their correlators.</description>

      <title>Traveling vegetation-herbivore waves can sustain ecosystems threatened by droughts and population growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04305v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dryland vegetation can survive water stress by forming spatial patterns but is often subjected to herbivory as an additional stress that puts it at risk of desertification. Understanding the mutual relationships between vegetation patterning and herbivory is crucial for securing food production in drylands, which constitute the majority of rangelands worldwide. Here, we introduce a novel vegetation-herbivore model that captures pattern-forming feedbacks associated with water and herbivory stress and a behavioral aspect of herbivores representing an exploitation strategy.Applying numerical continuation methods, we analyze the bifurcation structure of uniform and patterned vegetation-herbivore solutions, and use direct numerical simulations to study various forms of collective herbivore dynamics. We find that herbivory stress can induce traveling vegetation-herbivore waves and uncover the ecological mechanism that drives their formation. In the traveling-wave state, the herbivore distribution is asymmetric with higher density on one side of each vegetation patch. At low precipitation values their distribution is localized, while at high precipitation the herbivores are spread over the entire landscape. Importantly, their asymmetric distribution results in uneven herbivory stress, strong on one side of each vegetation patch and weak on the opposing side - weaker than the stress exerted in spatially uniform herbivore distribution. Consequently, the formation of traveling waves results in increased sustainability to herbivory stress. We conclude that vegetation-herbivore traveling waves may play an essential role in sustaining herbivore populations under conditions of combined water and herbivory stress, thereby contributing to food security in endangered regions threatened by droughts and population growth.</description>

      <title>System Symmetry and the Classification of Out-of-Time-Ordered Correlator Dynamics in Quantum Chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The symmetry of chaotic systems plays a pivotal role in determining the universality class of spectral statistics and dynamical behaviors, which can be described within the framework of random matrix theory. Understanding the influence of system symmetry on these behaviors is crucial for characterizing universal properties in quantum chaotic systems. In this work, we explore the universality of out-of-time-ordered correlator (OTOC) dynamics in quantum chaotic systems, focusing on the kicked rotor and the kicked Harper model. By modulating the periodically kicked potential, we control system symmetry to examine its impact on OTOC dynamics and level spacing distributions. Our results show that ensemble-averaged OTOC dynamics exhibit distinct universal behaviors depending on system symmetry, enabling classification through random matrix theory. These distinctions become evident after the localization time in localized regimes and emerge at specific time scales corresponding to the translational period of the Floquet operator in momentum space under quantum resonance conditions. Our findings provide a rigorous understanding of the relationship between symmetry and quantum chaotic dynamics, contributing to a deeper comprehension of universal behaviors in these systems.</description>

      <title>Learning Interpretable Hierarchical Dynamical Systems Models from Time Series Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In science, we are often interested in obtaining a generative model of the underlying system dynamics from observed time series. While powerful methods for dynamical systems reconstruction (DSR) exist when data come from a single domain, how to best integrate data from multiple dynamical regimes and leverage it for generalization is still an open question. This becomes particularly important when individual time series are short, and group-level information may help to fill in for gaps in single-domain data. At the same time, averaging is not an option in DSR, as it will wipe out crucial dynamical properties (e.g., limit cycles in one domain vs. chaos in another). Hence, a framework is needed that enables to efficiently harvest group-level (multi-domain) information while retaining all single-domain dynamical characteristics. Here we provide such a hierarchical approach and showcase it on popular DSR benchmarks, as well as on neuroscientific and medical time series. In addition to faithful reconstruction of all individual dynamical regimes, our unsupervised methodology discovers common low-dimensional feature spaces in which datasets with similar dynamics cluster. The features spanning these spaces were further dynamically highly interpretable, surprisingly in often linear relation to control parameters that govern the dynamics of the underlying system. Finally, we illustrate transfer learning and generalization to new parameter regimes.</description>

      <title>The General Three-Body Problem in Conformal-Euclidean Space: Hidden Symmetries and New Properties of a Low-Dimensional Syste</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13969v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite the huge number of research into the three-body problem in physics and mathematics, the study of this problem still remains relevant both from the point of view of its broad application and taking into account its fundamental significance for the theory of dynamical systems. In addition, to solve the problem of quantum-to-classical transition, it is important to answer the question: is irreversibility fundamental to the description of the classical world? To answer this question, we considered a reference classical dynamical system, the general three-body problem, formulating it in conformal Euclidean space and rigorously proving its equivalence to the Newtonian three-body problem. It is shown that a curved configuration space with a local coordinate system reveals new hidden symmetries of the internal motion of a dynamical system, which makes it possible to reduce the problem to a 6th order system instead of the known 8th order. The most important consequence of this consideration is that the chronologizing parameter of the motion of a system of particles, which we call internal time, is in the general case irreversible, which is characteristic of the general three-body problem. An equation is derived that describes the evolution of the flow of geodesic trajectories, with the help of which the entropy of the system is constructed. New criteria for assessing the complexity of a low-dimensional dynamic system and the dimension of stochastic fractal structures arising in three-dimensional space are obtained. An effective mathematical algorithm has been developed for the numerical simulation of the general three-body problem, which is traditionally a difficult-to-solve system of stiff ordinary differential equations.</description>
