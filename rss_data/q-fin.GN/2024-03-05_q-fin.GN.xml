      <title>Volatility-based strategy on Chinese equity index ETF options</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, there has been quick developments of derivative markets in China and standardized derivative trading have reached considerable volumes. In this research, we collect all the daily data of ETF options traded at Shanghai Stock Exchange and start with a simple short-volatility strategy. The strategy delivers nice performance before 2018, providing significant excess return over the buy and hold benchmark. However, after 2018, this strategy starts to deteriorate and no obvious risk-adjusted return is shown. Based on the discussion of relationship between the strategy's performance and market's volatility, we improve the model by adjusting positions and exposure according to volatility forecasts using methods such as volatility momentum and GARCH. The new models have improved performance in different ways, where larger upside capture and smaller drawbacks can be achieved in market fluctuation. This research has shown potentials of volatility-based trading on Chinese equity index options, and with further improvement and implementation considerations, real-world practical trading strategies can be formed.</description>

      <title>Assessing the Efficacy of Heuristic-Based Address Clustering for Bitcoin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exploring transactions within the Bitcoin blockchain entails examining the transfer of bitcoins among several hundred million entities. However, it is often impractical and resource-consuming to study such a vast number of entities. Consequently, entity clustering serves as an initial step in most analytical studies. This process often employs heuristics grounded in the practices and behaviors of these entities. In this research, we delve into the examination of two widely used heuristics, alongside the introduction of four novel ones. Our contribution includes the introduction of the \textit{clustering ratio}, a metric designed to quantify the reduction in the number of entities achieved by a given heuristic. The assessment of this reduction ratio plays an important role in justifying the selection of a specific heuristic for analytical purposes. Given the dynamic nature of the Bitcoin system, characterized by a continuous increase in the number of entities on the blockchain, and the evolving behaviors of these entities, we extend our study to explore the temporal evolution of the clustering ratio for each heuristic. This temporal analysis enhances our understanding of the effectiveness of these heuristics over time.</description>

      <title>Modeling the yield curve of Burundian bond market by parametric models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.00321v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The term structure of interest rates (yield curve) is a critical facet of financial analytics, impacting various investment and risk management decisions. It is used by the central bank to conduct and monitor its monetary policy. That instrument reflects the anticipation of inflation and the risk by investors. The rates reported on yield curve are the cornerstone of valuation of all assets. To provide such tool for Burundi financial market, we collected the auction reports of treasury securities from the website of the Central Bank of Burundi. Then, we computed the zero-coupon rates, and estimated actuarial rates of return by applying the Nelson-Siegel and Svensson models. This paper conducts a rigorous comparative analysis of these two prominent parametric yield curve models and finds that the Nelson-Siegel model is the optimal choice for modeling the Burundian yield curve. The findings contribute to the body of knowledge on yield curve modeling, enhancing its precision and applicability in financial markets. Furthermore, this research holds implications for investment strategies, risk management, second market pricing, financial decision-making, and the forthcoming establishment of the Burundian stock market.</description>
