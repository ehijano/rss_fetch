      <title>(Real)linear preservers of multiples of unitaries and matrix pairs with some extremal norm properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We determine the structure of linear maps on complex (real) square matrices sending unitary (orthogonal) matrices to multiples of unitary (orthogonal) matrices. The result is used to determine the linear preservers of matrix pairs satisfying the extremal norm properties $\|AB\| = \|A\| \|B\|$, $\|A^*B\| = \|A\| \|B\|$, or $\|AB^*\| = \|A\| \|B\|$, for the spectral norm $\|\cdot\|$.</description>

      <title>Few Bilinear Operators on Spaces of Continuous Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by recent work exhibiting a locally compact scattered space $L$ constructed under Ostaszewski's $\clubsuit$-principle, which yielded a complete classification of linear operators on $C_0(L\times L)$, we extend the analysis to the bilinear setting. We show that, for this space $L$, every bilinear operator $G:C_0(L)\times C_0(L)\to C_0(L)$ admits a unique decomposition into the sum of trivially predictable components. This establishes a bilinear analogue of the few operators phenomenon.</description>

      <title>On the comparison of ultradifferentiable weight function settings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We summarize, revisit and compare different notions of ultradifferentiable settings defined in terms of weight functions. More precisely, we emphasize the difference between the original Beurling-Bj\"orck-setting, when measuring the growth of the Fourier-transform, and the more recent approach by Braun, Meise and Taylor, when controlling the growth of the derivatives similarly like in the weight sequence framework. For the equality of both settings the convexity of the defining weight function is required and, somehow, has become a standard assumption. We study the meaning of this convexity condition and its failure in detail. First, we characterize the inclusion relations and hence the equality for Beurling-Bj\"orck-type classes in terms of weight functions analogously as it has already been done for the Braun-Meise-Taylor setting and work within the general weight matrix setting. Finally, we construct a technical (counter-)example which is a weight in the sense of Beurling-Bj\"orck but violates the convexity condition and which illustrates the different flavor of both weight function settings.</description>

      <title>Young functions on varifolds. Part I. Functional analytic foundations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study Young functions, a measure-theoretic model for multiple-valued functions, and the convergence of pairs of measures and Young functions via their associated graph measures. This setting allows us to study the convergence of pairs of surfaces and functions thereon, and a compactness theorem is immediate. To develop notions of differentiability of Young functions in the upcoming papers, we also introduce and investigate several test function spaces.</description>

      <title>Weak containment of representation on topological groupoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a second-countable, locally compact Hausdorff groupoid equipped with a Haar system. This paper investigates the weak containment of continuous unitary representations of groupoids. We show that both induction and inner tensor product of representations preserve weak containment. Additionally, we introduce the notion of a topological invariant mean on $G/H$ and explore its connection to amenability. With that, we establish a groupoid analogue of Greenleaf's theorem. Finally, we provide independent results concerning the restriction of induced representations for continuous unitary representations of relatively clopen wide subgroupoids $H\subseteq G$ with discrete unit space and closed transitive wide subgroupoids of compact transitive groupoids.</description>

      <title>Matrix-Weighted Besov Spaces Associated with Non-isotropic Dilations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\alpha\in\mathbb{R}$, $p\in[1,\infty)$, $q\in(0,\infty]$, $\mathbf{W}$ be a matrix weight, and $A$ be an expansive dilation on $\mathbb{R}^d$. In this paper, the authors firstly investigate and develop some aspects of homogeneous anisotropic Besov spaces $\dot{B}^{\alpha,q}_{p,A}(\mathbb{R}^d,\mathbf{W})$ and inhomogeneous anisotropic Besov spaces $B^{\alpha,q}_{p,A}(\mathbb{R}^d,\mathbf{W})$ theory in the matrix weight setting. Moreover, we show that these spaces are characterized by the magnitude of the $\varphi$-transforms in appropriate sequence spaces. Notably, all these results remain novel even in the diagonal non-isotropic case (when $A = \mathrm{diag}(\lambda_1, \lambda_2, \ldots, \lambda_d)$ with $\{\lambda_j\}_{j=1}^d \subset \mathbb{C}$).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.25981v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by applications to duality theorems for $p$-adic pro-\'etale cohomology of rigid analytic spaces, we study the category of Topological Vector Spaces in the setting of condensed mathematics. We prove that it contains, as full subcategories, both the category of (topologically) bounded algebraic Vector Spaces and the category of perfect complexes on the Fargues-Fontaine curve. Vector Spaces coming from $p$-adic pro-\'etale cohomology of smooth partially proper rigid analytic varieties are examples of sheaves belonging to the former category.</description>

      <title>Generalized $(C, \lambda)$-structure for nonlinear diffeomorphisms of Banach spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05499v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a notion of generalized $(C, \lambda)$-structure for nonlinear diffeomorphisms in Banach spaces. It combines generalized hyperbolicity for linear operators in Banach spaces with $(C, \lambda)$-structure for diffeomorphisms on compact manifolds. The main differencies are that we allow the hyperbolic splitting to be discontinuous and in invariance condition assume only inclusions instead of equalities for both stable and unstable subspace, which allows us to cover Morse-Smale systems and generalized hyperbolicity. We suggest that the generalized $(C, \lambda)$-structure for infinite-dimensional dynamics plays a role similar to ``Axiom A and strong transversality condition'' for dynamics on compact manifolds. For diffeomorphisms in reflexive Banach space we showed that generalized $(C, \lambda)$-structure implies Lipschitz (periodic) shadowing and is robust under $C^1$-small perturbations. Assuming that generalized $(C, \lambda)$-structure is continuous for diffeomorphisms on an arbitrary Banach space we obtain a weak form of structural stability: the diffeomorphism is semiconjugated from both sides with any $C^1$-small perturbation.</description>

      <title>Locally similar distances and equality of the induced intrinsic distances</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.05574v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a set and $d_1,d_2$ be two distances on $X$. We say that $d_1$ and $d_2$ are locally similar and write $d_1\cong d_2$, if $d_1$ and $d_2$ are topologically equivalent and for every $a$ in $X$, \[ \lim_{x\to a} \frac{d_2(x,a)}{d_1(x,a)}=1. \] We prove that if $d_1\cong d_2$, then the intrinsic distances induced by $d_1$ and $d_2$ are equal. We also provide some sufficient conditions for $d_1\cong d_2$ and consider several examples related to reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces.</description>

      <title>Bilinear embedding for divergence-form operators with negative potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05714v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\Omega \subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$ be open, $A$ a complex uniformly strictly accretive $d\times d$ matrix-valued function on $\Omega$ with $L^\infty$ coefficients, and $V$ a locally integrable function on $\Omega$ whose negative part is subcritical. We consider the operator $\mathscr{L} = -\mathrm{div}(A\nabla) + V$ with mixed boundary conditions on $\Omega$. We extend the bilinear inequality of Carbonaro and Dragi\v{c}evi\'c [15], originally established for nonnegative potentials, by introducing a novel condition on the coefficients that reduces to standard $p$-ellipticity when $V$ is nonnegative. As a consequence, we show that the solution to the parabolic problem $u'(t) + \mathscr{L} u(t) = f(t)$ with $u(0)=0$ has maximal regularity on $L^p(\Omega)$, in the same spirit as [13]. Moreover, we study mapping properties of the semigroup generated by $-\mathscr{L}$ under this new condition, thereby extending classical results for the Schr\"{o}dinger operator $-\Delta + V$ on $\mathbb{R}^d$ [8,47].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.05793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend a classical theorem of Carlson on moments of Dirichlet series from $p=2$ to $1 \leq p &lt; \infty$. When combined with the ergodic theorem for the Kronecker flow, a coherent approach to almost sure properties of vertical limit functions in $H^p$ spaces of Dirichlet series is obtained. This allows us to establish an almost sure analytic continuation of vertical limit functions to the right half-plane that can be used to compute the $H^p$ norm and to prove a version of Fatou's theorem.</description>

      <title>Quantum $f$-divergences and Their Local Behaviour: An Analysis via Relative Expansion Coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06183v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Any reasonable measure of distinguishability of quantum states must satisfy a data processing inequality, that is, it must not increase under the action of a quantum channel. We can ask about the proportion of information lost or preserved and this leads us to study contraction and expansion coefficients respectively, which can be combined into a single \emph{relative expansion coefficient} for study. We focus on two prominent families: (i) standard quantum $f$ divergences and (ii) their local (second-order) behaviour, which induces a monotone Riemannian semi-norm (that is linked to the $\chi^2$ divergence). Building on prior work, we identify new families of $f$ for which the global ($f$ divergence) and local (Riemannian) relative expansion coefficients coincide for every pair of channels, and we clarify how exceptional such exact coincidences are. Beyond equality, we introduce an \emph{equivalence} framework that transfers qualitative properties such as strict positivity uniformly across different relative expansion coefficients.
  Leveraging the link between equality in the data processing inequality (DPI) and channel reversibility, we apply our framework of relative expansion coefficients to approximate recoverability of quantum information. Using our relative expansion results for primitive channels, we prove a reverse quantum Markov convergence theorem, converting positive expansion coefficients into quantitative lower bounds on the convergence rate.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19875v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, it was shown that the image of a Toeplitz kernel of dimension greater than $1$ under composition by an inner function is nearly $S^*$-invariant if and only if the inner function is an automorphism. Building on this, we determine the minimal Toeplitz kernel containing the image of a Toeplitz kernel under a composition operator with a general inner symbol, and extend this to weighted composition operators. Specifically, the corresponding cases for minimal model spaces are also given, thereby extending known work on the action of composition operators on model spaces. Finally, we use the equivalences between Toeplitz kernels to derive the explicit maximal vectors for several Toeplitz kernels, with symbols expressed in terms of composition operators and inner functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07824v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The celebrated Sz.-Nagy-Foia\c{s} model theory says that there is a bijection between the class of purely contractive analytic functions and the class of completely non-unitary (c.n.u.) contractions modulo unitary equivalence. In this paper we provide a complete classification of the purely contractive analytic functions such that the associated contraction is a c.n.u. power partial isometry. As an application of our findings, we determine a class of contractive polynomials such that the associated c.n.u. power partial isometry is of the explicit diagonal form $S \oplus N \oplus C$, where $S$ and $C^*$ are unilateral shifts and $N$ is nilpotent. Finally, we obtain a characterization of operator-valued symbols for which the corresponding Toeplitz operator on vector-valued Hardy space is a partial isometry.</description>

Abstract: For appropriate parameters $k,p,q$, we introduce and systematically study the class of $(k,p,q)$-differential subalgebras. This is a vast class of Banach $^*$-algebras defined by their relation with their $C^*$-envelopes. Some examples are given by normable two-sided $^*$-ideals, domains of closed $^*$-derivations, full Hilbert algebras, and some weighted convolution algebras of various kinds. We prove that this class of algebras possesses various interesting properties, such as closedness under a functional calculus based on smooth functions, $^*$-regularity, Wiener's property $(W)$, and properties of automatic continuity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18529v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a linear--independence principle for finite families of translates in irreducible, square--integrable modulo the center (SI/Z) representations of step--two nilpotent Lie groups with one--dimensional center. Fix a one--parameter subgroup $\exp(\mathbb R X)$ and a noncentral element $Y$ (not assumed to commute with $X$). For every nonzero smooth vector $f$, any finite collection $\{\pi(\exp(x_k X))f\}_{k=1}^m$ (with distinct parameters $x_k$) of translates along $\exp(\mathbb R X)$, together with the single translate $\pi(\exp Y)f$, is linearly independent. The proof combines Schwartz regularity of matrix coefficients in the noncentral variables with an ergodic log--product estimate on a compact torus generated by commutator phases. As a result, we obtain an HRT--type statement for $(m,1)$ configurations (on--line direction with zero $X_{k_0}$--component and rogue $\exp X_{k_0}$) for all nonzero Schwartz windows, without spacing restrictions.</description>

      <title>Convergence Rates for the Trotter Splitting for Unbounded Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04045v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study convergence rates of the Trotter splitting $e^{A+L} = \lim_{n \to \infty} (e^{L/n} e^{A/n})^n$ in the strong operator topology. In the first part, we use complex interpolation theory to treat generators $L$ and $A$ of contraction semigroups on Banach spaces, with $L$ relatively $A$-bounded. In the second part, we study unitary dynamics on Hilbert spaces and develop a new technique based on the concept of energy constraints. Our results provide a complete picture of the convergence rates for the Trotter splitting for all common types of Schr\"odinger and Dirac operators, including singular, confining and magnetic vector potentials, as well as molecular many-body Hamiltonians in dimension $d=3$. Using the Brezis-Mironescu inequality, we derive convergence rates for the Schr\"odinger operator with $V(x)=\pm |x|^{-a}$ potential. In each case, our conditions are fully explicit.</description>

      <title>An approach to sub-Gaussian heat kernel estimates via analysis on metric spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04155v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we establish a new characterization of sub-Gaussian heat kernel estimates for strongly local regular Dirichlet forms on metric measure spaces. Our formulation is based on the newly introduced cutoff energy condition, which offers a simpler and more transparent alternative for earlier technical energy inequalities, in particular the cutoff Sobolev inequality. The main idea of our approach is to reinterpret the cutoff Sobolev inequality as a Poincar\'e type inequality, and analyze it using Haj{\l}asz--Koskela techniques from analysis on metric spaces. Applications of the new characterization are also discussed.</description>
