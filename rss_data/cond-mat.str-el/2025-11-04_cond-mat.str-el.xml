      <title>I. Magnetic, thermal and transport properties of YbCu$_{5-x}$Zn$_x$ alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the family of cubic YbCu$_4$X compounds ($X$ = Ni, Au and Zn), we have investigated the YbCu$_{5-x}$Zn$_x$ ($1\geq x \geq 0.7$) alloys by means of structural, magnetic, thermal and transport measurements. In the $\tau 1-$ YbCu$_{5-x}$Zn$_x$ (cubic AuBe$_5$ type, $0.7 \leq x \leq 1.5$) structural phase, Yb ion is in its Yb$^{3+}$ magnetic configuration. However, by increasing Zn content the unit cell grows faster than a reference computed as a Cu by Zn atoms substitution, which indicates a shift of Yb ions towards the larger Yb$^{2+}$ configuration. The magnetic behavior confirms such tendency with a clear decrease of the saturation magnetization and effective moment between $x=0.7$ and $x=1$. The specific heat at low temperature shows a logarithmic dependence characteristic for a non-fermi-liquid behavior. The characteristic energies of all studied parameters, including magneto resistivity, show notably low values as an indication that these alloys are close to a quantum critical point, which is approached from the non-magnetic side as the Zn content decreases.</description>

      <title>Low-Frequency Noise and Resistive Switching in $\beta$-Na$_{0.33}$V$_2$O$_5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interplay between charge ordering and its manifestation in macroscopic electrical transport in low-dimensional materials is crucial for understanding resistive switching mechanisms. In this study, we investigate the electronic transport and switching behavior of single-crystalline $\beta$-Na$_{0.33}$V$_2$O$_5$, focusing on low-frequency resistance noise dynamics of charge-order-driven resistive switching. Using electrical transport, low frequency noise spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction, we probe electron dynamics across the Na-ion- ordering (IO) and charge-ordering (CO) transitions. Near room temperature, the weak temperature dependence of the noise spectral density points to a dominance of nearest-neighbor polaron hopping. Below IO transition temperature (\( T_{IO} \sim 240 \, \text{K} \)), structural analysis reveals that Na-ions adopt a zig-zag occupancy pattern, breaking the two-fold rotational symmetry and influencing the electronic ground state. Subsequently, a sharp drop in resistance noise below the CO transition temperature (\( T_{CO} \sim 125 \, \text{K} \)) indicates the emergence of correlated electron behavior. Furthermore, application of sufficient electric field leads to the destabilization of the CO state, and a transition to a high-conducting state. The material exhibits distinct resistive switching between 35~K and 110~K, with a resistance change spanning two orders of magnitude, primarily driven by electronic mechanisms rather than Joule heating. These findings provide new insights into charge-order-induced switching and electronic correlations in quasi-one-dimensional systems, with potential applications in cryogenic memory and neuromorphic computing devices owing to the low noise levels in their stable resistive states.</description>

      <title>Absence of magnetic order and magnetic fluctuations in RuO$_{2}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel magnetic class blending ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism, termed altermagnetism, has gained significant attention for its staggered order in coordinate and momentum spaces, time-reversal symmetry-breaking phenomena, and promising applications in spintronics. Ruthenium dioxide (RuO$_{2}$) has been considered a candidate material for altermagnetism, yet the presence of magnetic moments on Ru atoms remains a subject of debate. In this study, we systematically investigated the magnetic properties of RuO$_{2}$ powder using nuclear quadrupole resonance (NQR) measurements. The NQR spectra show that there is no internal magnetic field. Furthermore, the temperature independence of spin-lattice relaxation rate, $1/T_1T$, proves that there are no magnetic fluctuations. Our results unambiguously demonstrate that Ru atoms in RuO$_{2}$ possess neither static magnetic moments nor fluctuating magnetic moments, and thus RuO$_{2}$ does not possess the magnetic characteristics essential for altermagnetism.</description>

      <title>Polariton-induced superconductivity in two-dimensional metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electronic properties of two-dimensional (2D) metals are altered by changes in their three-dimensional dielectric environment. In this Letter we propose that superconductivity can be induced in a 2D metal by resonant coupling between its plasmonic collective modes and optical phonons in a nearby polar dielectric. Specifically, we predict that relatively high-temperature superconductivity can be induced in bilayer graphene twisted to an angle somewhat larger than the magic value by surrounding it with a THz polar dielectric. Our conclusions are based on numerical solutions of Eliashberg equations for massless Dirac fermions with tunable Fermi velocities and Fermi energies, and can be understood qualitatively in terms of a generalized McMillan formula.</description>

      <title>Representation of the Luttinger Liquid with Single Point-like Impurity as a Field Theory for the Phase of Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new approach describing Luttinger Liquid with point-like impurity as field theory for the phase of scattering is developed. It based on a matching of the electron wave functions at impurity position point. As a result of the approach, an expression for non-local action has been taken. The non-locality of the theory leads to convergence of the observed values in an ultraviolet region. It allows studying conductance of the channel up to electron-electron interaction strength of the order of unit. Expansion of the non-local action in small frequency powers makes possible to develop a new approach to the renormalization group analysis of the problem. This method differs from the "poor man's" approach widely used in solid-state physics. We have shown, in the Luttinger Liquid "poor man's" approach breaks already in two-loop approximation. We analyse the reason of this discrepancy. The qualitative picture of the phenomenon is discussed.</description>

      <title>Exploring the limit of the Lattice-Bisognano-Wichmann form describing the Entanglement Hamiltonian: A quantum Monte Carlo study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The entanglement Hamiltonian (EH) encapsulates the essential entanglement properties of a quantum many-body system and serves as a powerful theoretical construct. From the EH, one can extract a variety of entanglement quantities, such as entanglement entropies, negativity, and the entanglement spectrum. However, its general analytical form remains largely unknown. While the Bisognano-Wichmann theorem gives an exact EH form for Lorentz-invariant field theories, its validity on lattice systems is limited, especially when Lorentz invariance is absent. In this work, we propose a general scheme based on the lattice-Bisognano-Wichmann (LBW) ansatz and multi-replica-trick quantum Monte Carlo methods to numerically reconstruct the entanglement Hamiltonian in two-dimensional systems and systematically explore its applicability to systems without translational invariance, going beyond the original scope of the primordial Bisognano-Wichmann theorem. Various quantum phases--including gapped and gapless phases, critical points, and phases with either discrete or continuous symmetry breaking--are investigated, demonstrating the versatility of our method in reconstructing entanglement Hamiltonians. Furthermore, we find that when the entanglement boundary of a system is ordinary (i.e., free from surface anomalies), the LBW ansatz provides an accurate approximation well beyond Lorentz-invariant cases. Our work thus establishes a general framework for investigating the analytical structure of entanglement in complex quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Superlinear Hall angle and carrier mobility from non-Boltzmann magnetotransport in the spatially disordered Yukawa-SYK model on a square lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exact numerical results for the DC magnetoconductivity tensor of the two-dimensional spatially disordered Yukawa-Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (2D-YSYK) model on a square lattice, at first order in applied perpendicular magnetic field, are obtained from the self-consistent disorder-averaged solution of the 2D-YSYK saddle-point equations. This system describes fermions endowed with a Fermi surface and coupled to a bosonic scalar field through spatially random Yukawa interactions. The resulting local and energy-dependent fermionic self-energies are employed in the Kubo formalism to calculate the longitudinal and Hall conductivities, the Hall coefficient, the carrier mobility, and the cotangent of the Hall angle, at fixed fermion density. From the interplay between YSYK interactions and square-lattice embedding, and the non-Boltzmann frequency-dependent self energies, we find nontrivial evolution of the magnetotransport coefficients as a function of temperature and YSYK interaction strength, notably a superlinear evolution of the Hall-angle cotangent and the inverse carrier mobility with temperature, concomitant with linear-in-temperature resistivity, in an extended crossover regime above the low-temperature Marginal Fermi Liquid (MFL) ground state. Our model and results provide a controlled theoretical framework to interpret linear magnetotransport experiments in strange-metal phases found in strongly correlated solid-state electron systems.</description>

      <title>Improved contraction of finite projected entangled pair states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an improved version of the algorithm contracting and optimizing finite projected entangled pair states (fPEPS) in conjunction with projected entangled pair operators (PEPOs). Our work has two components to it. First, we explain in detail the characteristic contraction patterns that occur in fPEPS calculations and how to slice them such that peak memory occupation remains minimal while ensuring efficient parallel computation. Second, we combine controlled bond expansion [A. Gleis, J.-W. Li, and J. von Delft, Phys. Rev. Lett. 130, 246402 (2023)] with randomized singular value decomposition [V. Rokhlin, A. Szlam, and M. Tygert, SIAM J. Matrix Anal. Appl. (2009)] and apply it throughout the fPEPS algorithm. We present benchmark results for the Hubbard model for system sizes up to 8x8 and SU(2) symmetric bond dimension of up to D = 6 for PEPS bonds and $\chi$ = 500 for the environment bonds. Finally, we comment on the state and future of the fPEPS-PEPO framework.</description>

      <title>Non Fermi-Liquid Magnetoresistance Oscillations in Quasi-One-Dimensional Conductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically demonstrate that strong non Fermi-liquid magnetic oscillations of electron-electron scattering time can exist in quasi-one-dimensional (Q1D) conductors under condition of the magnetic breakdown between two open electron orbits. They are shown to be due to electron-electron interactions in a metallic phase under condition of the magnetic breakdown and they are beyond the Fermi-liquid theory. In particular, we consider as example the organic conductor (TMTSF)$_2$ClO$_4$ and perform both analytical and numerical calculations for its known electron spectrum. We also argue that similar oscillations of resistivity can exist in a metallic phase of another Q1D organic conductor - (Per)$_2$Au(mnt)$_2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.01068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically show that strongly forbidden oscillations of a specific heat have to exist in metallic phases of some quasi-one-dimensional (Q1D) conductors. They appear due to electron-electron interactions under condition of the magnetic breakdown phenomenon between the so-called open interference electron orbits. We argue that such forbidden thermodynamic oscillations can exist in Q1D conductors (TMTSF)$_2$ClO$_4$ and (Per)$_2$Au(mnt)$_2$, where TMTSF stands for tetramethyltetraselenafulvalene, Per is polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon and mnt is mononitrotoluene,

      <title>From Wavefunction Sign Structure to Static Correlation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Static correlation, the breakdown of mean-field theory in correlated many-fermion systems, can be reframed as a quantitative gauge of the fermion-sign problem. The variational energy gap between correlated wavefunctions constrained by mean-field and exact Dirichlet nodes defines a nodal penalty driven by their topological differences. Method-agnostic and dictated solely by the sign structure of the wavefunction, this penalty measures the intrinsic complexity of fermionic correlations. This framework unifies orbital and real-space views and opens a general route toward a rigorous, method-independent decomposition of electron correlation, guiding topology-aware approaches and future node-centric strategies.</description>

      <title>Quantum critical behavior of diluted quasi-one-dimensional Ising chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: CoNb$_2$O$_6$ is a unique magnetic material. It features bulk three-dimensional magnetic order at low temperatures, but its quantum critical behavior in a magnetic field is well described by the one-dimensional transverse-field Ising universality class. This behavior is facilitated by the structural arrangement of magnetic Co$^{2+}$ ions in nearly isolated zig-zag chains. In this work, we investigate the effect of random site dilution on the critical properties of such a quasi-one-dimensional quantum Ising system. To this end, we introduce an anisotropic site-diluted three-dimensional transverse-field Ising model. We find that site dilution leads to unconventional activated scaling behavior at the quantum phase transition. Interestingly, the critical exponents of the quantum critical point are in good agreement with those of the disordered three-dimensional transverse-field Ising universality class, despite the strong spatial anisotropy. We discuss the generality our findings as well as implications for experiments.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use high-dimensional bosonization to derive an effective field theory that describes the Pomeranchuck transition in isotropic two-dimensional Fermi liquids. We find that the transition is triggered by the softening of an eigenmode that leads to spontaneous Fermi surface distortion. The resultant theory in terms of this critical mode has dynamical critical exponent $z = 2$ and the upper critical dimension is $d_c = 4-z= 2$. As a result the system is at the upper critical dimension in 2D, resulting in a Gaussian fixed point with a marginally irrelevant quartic perturbation.</description>

However, such scenario is typically discarded when unbound electrons are observed near the chemical potential. Here, using attractive Hubbard model as a representative example, we demonstrate the emergence of such ''bosonic'' bound pairs in the presence of residual low-energy electrons through determinant quantum Monte Carlo computation of their propagators. Furthermore, above the superfluid temperature the electronic spectral function is found to display a typical non-Fermi liquid behavior, namely a pseudogap near the chemical potential. This study provides the microscopic foundation for scenarios of boson-fermion mixed liquid as effective descriptions for some of the strongly correlated functional materials.</description>

      <title>The Quantum Self-Consistent Harmonic Approximation: A Unified Framework for Quantum Spin System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Self-Consistent Harmonic Approximation (SCHA) has been utilized to investigate quantum and thermal phase transitions within magnetic models and, more recently, in spintronic applications. The SCHA methodology involves utilizing simple harmonic Hamiltonians, which are augmented with renormalization parameters that incorporate high-order fluctuations typically overlooked by conventional Linear Spin-Wave (LSW) theories. Although this approach exhibits reasonable accuracy for models defined by large spin values, its reliability diminishes when applied to quantum systems with $S=1/2$. The traditional development of SCHA has incorporated semiclassical assumptions that obscure quantum effects. In this study, we introduce a quantum framework for the SCHA that eliminates the need for semiclassical approximations. Our Quantum Self-Consistent Harmonic Approximation (QSCHA) utilizes the spin coherent states formalism within a fully quantum formulation. Consequently, we derive a novel renormalization parameter that accurately integrates quantum corrections. To assess the efficacy of this new approach, we apply the QSCHA to analyze the critical temperature transitions across various well-documented magnetic models. The findings, combined with the simplified operational procedure relative to other conventional interacting spin-wave methodologies, suggest that QSCHA is a promising tool for advancing research in quantum magnetism and spintronics.</description>

      <title>Quantum Acoustics Demystifies the Strange Metals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.01853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phonons have long been thought to be incapable of explaining key phenomena in strange metals, including linear-in-\textit{T} Planckian resistivity from high to very low temperatures. We argue that these conclusions were based on static, perturbative approaches that overlooked essential time-dependent and nonperturbative electron-lattice physics. In fact ``phonons'' are not the best target for discussion, just like ``photons'' are not the best way to think about Maxwell's equations. Quantum optics connects photons and electromagnetism, as developed 60 years ago by Glauber and others. We have been developing the parallel world of quantum acoustics. Far from being only of academic interest, the new tools are rapidly exposing the secrets of the strange metals, revealing strong vibronic (vibration-electronic) interactions playing a crucial role forming polarons and charge density waves, linear-in-$T$ resistivity at the Planckian rate over thousands of degrees, resolution of the Drude peak infrared anomaly, and the absence of a $T^4$ low-temperature resistivity rise in 2D systems, and of a Mott-Ioffe-Regel resistivity saturation. We derive Planckian transport, polarons, CDWs, and pseudogaps from the Fr\"ohlich model. The ``new physics'' has been hiding in this model all along, in the right parameter regime, if it is treated nonperturbatively. In the course of this work we have uncovered the generalization of Anderson localization to dynamic media: a universal Planckian diffusion emerges, a ``ghost'' of Anderson localization. Planckian diffusion is clearly defined and is more fundamental than the popular but elusive, model dependent concept of ``Planckian speed limit''.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.00224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computers must operate in concert with classical computers to deliver on the promise of quantum advantage for practical problems. To achieve that, it is important to understand how quantum and classical computing can interact together, and how one can characterize the scalability and efficiency of hybrid quantum-classical workflows. So far, early experiments with quantum-centric supercomputing workflows have been limited in scale and complexity. Here, we use a Heron quantum processor deployed on premises with the entire supercomputer Fugaku to perform the largest computation of electronic structure involving quantum and classical high-performance computing. We design a closed-loop workflow between the quantum processors and 152,064 classical nodes of Fugaku, to approximate the electronic structure of chemistry models beyond the reach of exact diagonalization, with accuracy comparable to some all-classical approximation methods. Our work pushes the limits of the integration of quantum and classical high-performance computing, showcasing computational resource orchestration at the largest scale possible for current classical supercomputers.</description>

      <title>Transmission Coefficients from Phantom Currents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.00356v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A representative quantity that characterizes the dynamics of conformal interfaces is the transmission coefficient, which is defined through correlation functions of the stress tensor. Typically, this coefficient is complicated and highly dependent on its details. In this work, we introduce a new perspective based on the notion of a ``phantom current''. We have shown that a spin-2 phantom current arising from the folding trick completely determines the transmission coefficient. In particular, when there is a single phantom current, the transmission coefficient is uniquely fixed by its conformal dimension. As a result, our framework provides a unified explanation of known results in minimal models and the free boson, while also yielding concrete predictions for previously unexplored interfaces.</description>

      <title>Conformal Bootstrap with Duality-Inspired Fusion Rule</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first systematic exploration of conformal field theories (CFTs) possessing fusion rules inspired by categorical (non-invertible) symmetries, using the conformal bootstrap. Specifically, we impose a selection rule motivated by Kramers-Wannier duality and derive bounds on the conformal dimensions $(\Delta_\sigma, \Delta_\epsilon)$ of the lowest-lying $\mathbb{Z}_2$-odd scalar $\sigma$ and $\mathbb{Z}_2$-even scalar $\epsilon$ in dimensions $d=2$ through $d=7$. Our bounds correctly allow the $d=2$ Ising model while excluding the $d=3$ Ising model, demonstrating the effectiveness of the imposed condition. Furthermore, we observe a distinct feature in $d=2$ corresponding to the $\mathcal{M}(8,7)$ minimal model and find non-trivial constraints in $d=3$ ($\Delta_\sigma \gtrsim 0.85$), relevant for theories like QED$_3$. This work opens a new avenue for non-perturbatively probing the vast landscape of CFTs constrained by non-invertible symmetries.</description>

      <title>Cu-spin Correlation in the Electron-overdoped High-Tc Cuprate Thin Films of La_2-x_Ce_x_CuO_4_ Probed by Low-energy Muons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigated the Cu-spin correlation in the overdoped regime of the electron-doped high-Tc cuprate thin films of La_2-x_Ce_x_CuO_4_, changing the reduction condition from muon spin relaxation using low-energy muons. The Cu-spin correlation developed at low temperatures for optimally reduced films with x=0.13 as well as x=0.17 where the superconductivity was almost suppressed. These results are contrary to those observed in the hole-doped high-Tc cuprates where the development of the antiferromagnetic Cu-spin correlation disappears together with the suppression of superconductivity. The Cu-spin correlation developed at low temperatures in x=0.17 may be understood in terms of antiferromagnetism, but it may be related to a ferromagnetic order recently suggested in the nonsuperconducting heavily overdoped La$_2-x_Ce_x_CuO_4_ with x~0.18.</description>

      <title>Atomic-Scale Roughness of Freestanding Oxide Membranes Revealed by Electron Ptychography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Freestanding oxide films offer significant potential for integrating exotic quantum functionalities with semiconductor technologies. However, their performance is critically limited by surface roughness and interfacial imperfection caused by dangling bonds, which disrupt coherent interactions and suppress quantum phenomena at heterointerfaces. To address the challenge of structural characterization of surfaces and interfaces, we develop a metrological approach achieving atomic-scale precision in mapping the topography of both free surfaces and buried interfaces within ultrathin oxide heterostructures leveraging three-dimensional structures reconstructed from multislice electron ptychography. This method also allows for counting the number of atoms, even including light elements such as oxygen, along the electron trajectory in electron microscopy, leading to the identification of surface termination in oxide films. The planar-view of measurement geometry, allowing for large field-of-view imaging, provides remarkably rich information and high statistics about the atomic-scale structural inhomogeneities in freestanding membranes. This quantitative analysis provides unprecedented capabilities for correlating structural imperfection with quantum device performance, offering critical insights for engineering robust heterointerfaces in next-generation oxide electronics.</description>

      <title>Applicability of Electrical Conductivity Ratio Method to Complicated Band Structure and the Carrier Scattering Mechanisms of SnSe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00522v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The electrical conductivity ratio (ECR) method can be used to analyze carrier scattering mechanism (CSM) without the need of magenetic transport measurements. In this work, the applicability of the ECR method in the analysis of complex energy band structures is discussed. Combined with the thermoelectric properties of SnSe, the feasibility using ECR method of ideal single band transport model to study the CSM of semiconductor materials with complicated band structure is studied. The results indicate that ECR method is not only applicable to idea band structure as reported before but also to the complicated band structure. The analysis results of the CSM of single crystal SnSe by ECR method using ideal single-band model agree with the carrier mobility temperature dependence in the nonphase transition temperature range. The CSM along three direction of single crystal SnSe are different because of its anisotropic crystal structure. The difference between dislocation scattering (DS) and charged impurity scattering (CIS) is that DS is always accompanied by polar optical phonon scattering (POP), such as the CSM of SnSe along b axis direction. The difference between CIS and DS can be more easily distinguished by the ECR method than the carrier mobility temperature dependent method. DS and POP might be one of the approaches to improve thermoelectric property because the scattering factor for DS or POP is larger than that of acoustic phonon scattering (APS) and alloy scattering (AS). For polycrystalline SnSe, the carrier scattering mechanisms varies with the crystal structure and the temperature. This indicates that the ECR method can better reflect the variation of carrier scattering mechanisms with temperature compared to the carrier mobility temperature dependence method.</description>

      <title>The stability and topological behaviors in lanthanide antiperovskite nitrides: a high-throughput study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.00724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Antiperovskite (APV) nitrides exhibit a diverse range of electronic properties, including superconductivity, magnetic effects, and nontrivial topological behaviors. In this study, we propose a new family of APV nitrides by incorporating 4$f$-electron metals, known for strong electron correlations, localized magnetic moments, and spin-orbit coupling, to further explore the unique properties of APVs. A high-throughput density functional theory (DFT) calculation was utilized to identify stable lanthanide APV nitride compounds. To address the challenge of strong electron correlation, we developed a double-screening framework that assumes either a fully itinerant or localized nature of the $f$-electrons during calculations. Using this approach, we systematically identified 37 stable lanthanide APV nitride compounds from both thermodynamic and dynamical perspectives. Furthermore, we report nontrivial topological behaviors observed among these stable lanthanide APV nitride compounds, as computed by DFT. Notably, Dirac and semi-Dirac cones are observed near the Fermi level for Er$_3$TlN. This study opens a pathway to investigate lanthanide APVs, revealing potential novel physical properties by leveraging the rich physics of both APVs and $f$-electrons.</description>

      <title>Exposing Altermagnetism through Momentum Density Spectroscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.01094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Materials which show a strong time-reversal symmetry-breaking response leading to spin-polarization phenomena, in conjunction with antiparallel magnetic alignments producing zero net magnetization, have recently been identified, classified, and been given the name 'altermagnets'. However, measuring and diagnosing possible candidates as altermagnetics still remains a challenge. From the uncertainty of the material being an altermagnet, additional experimental probes are essential to resolve this. Here, we propose using spin-dependent and magnetic momentum density probes such as spin-polarised positron annihilation and revisiting magnetic Compton scattering. By looking at the previously claimed altermagnetic candidates RuO2, CrSb and MnTe, we present theoretical altermagnetic calculations of the experimental quantities measured by these probes. We show that these quantities should produce a measurable signal and unequivocally confirm the altermagnetic state. We also highlight the additional benefits from these probes such as extracting spin-resolved Fermi surfaces which are key for further understanding the nature of the altermagnetic state.</description>

      <title>Parastatistics revealed: Peierls phase twists and shifted conformal towers in interacting periodic chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider interacting paraparticle chains with a constant $R$-matrix where the Hamiltonian sums over the internal degrees (flavors) of the paraparticles. For such flavor-blind Hamiltonians we show a general factorization of the Hilbert space into occupation and flavor parts with the Hamiltonian acting non-trivially only on the former. For open boundaries, the spectrum therefore coincides with that of the occupation Hamiltonian $H_{\rm occ}$ with the flavor part merely adding degeneracies. For periodic boundaries, a cyclic reordering of the flavors leads to a separation of $H_{\rm occ}$ into flux sectors at fixed particle number, thus making the parastatistics directly observable in the energy spectrum. For important exemplary cases, $H_{\rm occ}$ reduces to the XXZ chain with flux allowing for an exact solution. In the gapless regime, this solution shows flux-shifted $c=1$ conformal towers in the low-energy spectrum and a temperature-dependent chemical potential in the bulk thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Modulation of Quantum Transport in Complex Oxide Heterostructures with Proton Implantation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interfacial electronic properties of complex oxides are governed by a delicate balance between charge transfer, lattice distortions, and electronic correlations, posing a key challenge for controlled tunability in materials research. Here, we demonstrate that proton implantation serves as a precise tool for modulating interfacial transport in SrTiO3-based heterostructures. By introducing protons into the SrTiO3 substrate beneath an amorphous (La,Sr)(Al,Ta)O3 capping layer, we uncover a competition between disorder and charge doping induced by implantation. At low implantation fluences below 1x1015 protons/cm2 (1E15), charge doping dominates, leading to an increase in carrier density and mobility, analogous to electrostatic gating effect. This enables the emergence of quantum transport oscillations at low temperature. Conversely, at higher fluences (above 1E15), disorder scattering prevails, suppressing carrier mobility and inducing an insulating state. The nonmonotonic evolution of transport with implantation fluence underscores the critical interplay between electronic correlations and disorder, offering a new paradigm for the controlled engineering of interfacial quantum states in SrTiO3-based oxide heterostructures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.01339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transient states of matter far from equilibrium may exhibit physical properties beyond those allowed by the equilibrium-state crystalline symmetries. We explore ultrafast and direct electronic excitations of transient states in a cavity superconductor by using time-resolved terahertz-pump terahertz-probe spectroscopy. Our results show that the strong terahertz field can transiently modify the symmetries of the electronic subsystems via the injection of a transient supercurrent, leading to high-order nonlinear dynamical responses that are not compatible with the equilibrium-state symmetries, which evidences for transient symmetry breaking on the picosecond time scale. Our study also finds that the strong coupling of the superconductor to the designed microcavities enables the sensitive detection of the nonlinear responses associated to the transient symmetry breaking.</description>

      <title>Large spin signal and spin rectification in folded-bilayer graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.01627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graphene is an exceptional platform for spin-based non-volatile memory, logic, and neuromorphic computing by combining long-distance spin transport with electrical tunability at room temperature. However, advancing beyond passive spin channels requires devices capable of generating large spin signals with efficient rectification capabilities, which are essential for active spintronic components. Here, we demonstrate a folded-bilayer graphene spin-valve device with giant non-local spin signals in the several mV range with pronounced spin-rectification effects. The efficient spin injection creates a giant spin accumulation of 20 meV, and generates a spin-diode effect with an asymmetry of over an order of magnitude between forward and reverse bias conditions. This spin-diode effect arises from the nonlinear coupling between large spin accumulation and the applied electric field. These large spin signals, together with the spin-diode effect, are achieved with folded-bilayer graphene, offering a promising platform for developing active ultrathin two-dimensional spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Relevance of long-range screening in Mott transition examined via a hydrogen lattice</title>

Abstract: The Mott transition, a metal-insulator transition due to strong electronic interaction, is observed in many materials without an accompanying change of system symmetry. An important open question in Mott's proposal is the role of long-range screening, whose drastic change across the quantum phase transition may self-consistently make the transition more abrupt, toward a first-order one. Here we investigate this effect in a model system of hydrogen atoms in a cubic lattice, using charge self-consistent dynamical mean-field theory that incorporates approximately the long-range interaction within the density functional treatment. We found that the system is well within the charge-transfer regime and that the charge-transfer gap intimately related to the Mott transition closes smoothly instead. This indicates that the long-range screening does not play an essential role in this prototypical example. This finding can be understood from the fact that the obtained insulating phase in this model system is driven by strong local interaction, and the transition is associated with the closing of charge-transfer gap. Contrary to Mott's length scale argument, such energetic competition between kinetic energy and \textit{local} interaction is thus insensitive to long-range screening.</description>

      <title>Phase Diagram and Spectroscopic Signatures of a Supersolid in Quantum Ising Magnet K$_2$Co(SeO$_3$)$_2$</title>

Abstract: A supersolid is a quantum-entangled state of matter exhibiting the dual characteristics of superfluidity and solidity. Theory predicts that hard-core bosons with repulsive interactions on a triangular lattice can form supersolid phases at half filling and near complete filling. Leveraging an exact mapping between bosons and spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ degrees of freedom, we investigate these phases in the spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ triangular-lattice antiferromagnet \K212 with exchange constants $J_z = 2.96(2)$~meV and $J_{\perp} = 0.21(3)$~meV. At zero field, neutron diffraction reveals the gradual development for $T&lt;15$~K of quasi-two-dimensional $\sqrt{3}\times\sqrt{3}$ magnetic order with $Z_3$ translational symmetry breaking (solidity) albeit with 44(5)% reduced amplitude at $T=0.3$~K indicating strong quantum fluctuations. These are apparent in equidistant bands of continuum neutron scattering for $\hslash\omega_n\approx n\times J_z$, where $n=0,1,2,3$. The lowest energy ($n=0$) $\bf Q$-dependent continuum has a lower resonant edge and includes a quasi-elastic component at K $(\frac{1}{3}\frac{1}{3})$ consistent with broken $U(1)$ spin rotational symmetry (boson superfluidity). Competing instabilities are apparent in soft albeit finite-energy modes at M $(\frac{1}{2}0)$ and at $\frac{1}{2}$K $(\frac{1}{6}\frac{1}{6})$. For $\bf c$-axis-oriented magnetic fields $17~{\rm T} &lt;\mu_0 H&lt; 21~{\rm T}$ that almost saturate the magnetization, corresponding to nearly filling the lattice with bosons, we find a new phase consistent with a second supersolid. These phases are separated by a pronounced 1/3 magnetization plateau that supports coherent spin waves, from which we determine the spin Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>Geometric Frustration Assisted Kinetic Ferromagnetism in Doped Mott Insulators</title>

Abstract: Understanding ferromagnetism mechanism in doped Mott insulators on frustrated lattices remains challenging at intermediate coupling and finite doping. Here, we study the itinerant ferromagnetism and propose its mechanism in doped Mott insulators on a geometrically frustrated triangular lattice. Using large-scale density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) and unrestricted Hartree-Fock mean-field methods, we reveal that itinerant ferromagnetism appears at intermediate coupling ($10\lesssim U\ll\infty$) near 50% electron doping in the triangular-lattice Hubbard model. By analyzing all microscopic hopping processes, we find that doublon-singlon exchange alone drives the fully polarized ferromagnetism and uncovers the particle-hole asymmetry. We also establish the magnetic phase diagram and compare local spin correlations with recent experiments. Random phase approximation and DMRG calculations consistently confirm that the ferromagnetism persists when $SU(2)$ symmetry is explicitly broken by magnetic anisotropy. These results clarify a microscopic route to itinerant ferromagnetism at intermediate coupling and finite doping in doped Mott insulators.</description>

      <title>Continuous order-to-order quantum phase transitions from fixed-point annihilation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06890v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A central concept in the theory of phase transitions beyond the Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson paradigm is fractionalization: the formation of new quasiparticles that interact via emergent gauge fields. This concept has been extensively explored in the context of continuous quantum phase transitions between distinct orders that break different symmetries. We propose a mechanism for continuous order-to-order quantum phase transitions that operates independently of fractionalization. This mechanism is based on the collision and annihilation of two renormalization group fixed points: a quantum critical fixed point and an infrared stable fixed point. The annihilation of these fixed points rearranges the flow topology, eliminating the disordered phase associated with the infrared stable fixed point and promoting a second critical fixed point, unaffected by the collision, to a quantum critical point between distinct orders. We argue that this mechanism is relevant to a broad spectrum of physical systems. In particular, it can manifest in Luttinger fermion systems in three spatial dimensions, leading to a continuous quantum phase transition between an antiferromagnetic Weyl semimetal state, which breaks time-reversal symmetry, and a nematic topological insulator, characterized by broken lattice rotational symmetry. This continuous antiferromagnetic-Weyl-to-nematic-insulator transition might be observed in rare-earth pyrochlore iridates $R_2$Ir$_2$O$_7$. Other possible realizations include kagome quantum magnets, quantum impurity models, and quantum chromodynamics with supplemental four-fermion interactions.</description>

      <title>$\lambda$-Jellium Model for the Anomalous Hall Crystal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12704v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The jellium model is a paradigmatic problem in condensed matter physics, exhibiting a phase transition between metallic and Wigner crystal phases. However, its vanishing Berry curvature makes it ill-suited for studying recent experimental platforms that combine strong interactions with nontrivial quantum geometry. These experiments inspired the anomalous Hall crystal (AHC) -- a topological variant of the Wigner crystal. The AHC spontaneously breaks continuous translation symmetry but has a nonzero Chern number. In this work, we introduce $\lambda-$jellium, a minimal extension of the two-dimensional jellium model. Its Berry curvature distribution is controlled by a single parameter, $\lambda$, where $\lambda=0$ corresponds to the standard jellium model. This setup facilitates the systematic exploration of Berry curvature's impact on electron crystallization. The phase diagram of this model, established using self-consistent Hartree Fock calculations, reveals several interesting features: (i) The AHC phase occupies a large region of the phase diagram. (ii) Two distinct Wigner crystal phases, the latter enabled by quantum geometry, and two distinct Fermi liquid phases are present. (iii) A continuous phase transition separates the AHC and one of the WC phases. (iv) In some parts of the AHC phase, the lattice geometry is non-triangular, unlike in the classical Wigner crystal. In addition to elucidating the physics of correlated electrons with nonzero Berry curvature, we expect that the simplicity of the model makes it an excellent starting point for more advanced numerical methods.</description>

      <title>Is Herbertsmithite far from an ideal antiferromagnet? Ab-initio answer including in-plane Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions and coupling with extra-plane impurities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19728v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Herbertsmithite is known as the archetype of a S=1/2 nearest-neighbor Heisenberg antiferromagnet on the Kagom\'e lattice, theoretically presumed to be a quantum gapless spin liquid. However, more and more experiments reveal that the model suffers from deviations from the ideal one, evidenced at very low temperatures. This detailed ab initio study focuses on two such deviations that have never been quantitatively calculated: the anisotropic exchange interactions and the Heisenberg exchange with extra-plane magnetic impurities. The Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction is found to have an in-plane component almost three times larger than the out-of-plane component, but typically obviated in theoretical studies. Moreover, it is shown that the extra-plane magnetic impurities have a strong ferromagnetic interaction (minus half the main exchange $J_1$ ) with the Kagom\'e magnetic sites. Combined with an estimated occurrence of these magnetic impurities of $\sim15\%$, the present results indicate that two-dimensional magnetic models only describe part of the physics.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Anyon Clusters in Fractional Quantum Hall Fluids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20257v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In fractional quantum Hall fluids, the quasiparticle excitations are anyons with fractional charges and statistics. Effective interactions among the anyons can be induced by either model or realistic electron-electron (e-e) interactions. Without losing the generality, we investigate such phenomena for the Laughlin 1/3 and Moore-Read (MR) non-Abelian phases. Anyons display rich internal dynamics in both cases that will lead to interesting experimental consequences. In particular, bound states of two Laughlin anyons are preferred under short-range e-e interactions, leading to 2e/3 -- instead of e/3 -- effective charge carriers at low temperatures, which have been seen in several experiments. MR phases host two topologically distinct fusion channels: 1 and psi. The different effective interactions of e/4 anyons in the two sectors suggest the vanishing of the degeneracy of fusion channels when the e-e interaction is no longer its model Hamiltonian, in which case different bound states could also appear. This indicates the possibility of energetically manipulating the two types of anyons by tuning the bare e-e interactions. We point out that the results of recently developed high-resolution STM measurements will be affected by the effective anyon interactions, where anyons are clustered together after the tunneling of electrons. The low-lying parts of the local density of states affected by various anyon clusters are simulated for both Abelian and non-Abelian systems with (screened) Coulomb interactions.</description>

      <title>Bootstrapping Flat-band Superconductors: Rigorous Lower Bounds on Superfluid Stiffness</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18969v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The superfluid stiffness fundamentally constrains the transition temperature of superconductors, especially in the strongly coupled regime. However, accurately determining this inherently quantum many-body property in microscopic models remains a significant challenge. In this work, we show how the \textit{quantum many-body bootstrap} framework, specifically the reduced density matrix (RDM) bootstrap, can be leveraged to obtain rigorous lower bounds on the superfluid stiffness in frustration-free interacting models with superconducting ground state. We numerically apply the method to a special class of frustration free models, which are known as quantum geometric nesting models, for flat-band superconductivity, where we uncover a general relation between the stiffness and the pair mass. Going beyond the familiar Hubbard case within this class, we find how additional interactions, notably simple magnetic couplings, can enhance the superfluid stiffness. Furthermore, we find that the RDM bootstrap unexpectedly reveals that the trion-type correlations are essential for bounding the stiffness, offering new insights on the structure of these models. A straightforward generalization of the method can lead to bounds on susceptibilities complementary to variational approaches. Our findings underscore the immense potential of the quantum many-body bootstrap as a powerful tool to derive rigorous bounds on physical quantities beyond energy.</description>

      <title>Identifying Entanglement Phases with Bipartite Projected Ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08052v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce bipartite projected ensembles (BPEs) for quantum many-body wave functions, which consist of pure states supported on two local subsystems, with each state associated with the outcome of a projective measurement of the complementary subsystem in a fixed local basis. We demonstrate that the corresponding ensemble-averaged entanglements (EAEs) between two subsystems can effectively identify entanglement phases. In volume-law entangled states, EAE converges to a nonzero value with increasing distance between subsystems. For critical systems, EAE exhibits power-law decay, and it decays exponentially for area-law systems. Thus, entanglement phase transitions can be viewed as a disordered-ordered phase transition. We also apply BPE and EAE to measured random Clifford circuits to probe measurement-induced phase transitions. We show that EAE serves not only as a witness to phase transitions, but also unveils additional critical phenomena properties, including dynamical scaling and surface critical exponents. Our findings provide an alternative approach to diagnosing entanglement laws, thus enhancing the understanding of entanglement phase transitions. Moreover, given the accessibility of measuring EAE in quantum simulators, our results hold promise for impacting quantum simulations.</description>

Abstract: Chirality is a property of a gapped phase of matter in two spatial dimensions that can be manifested through non-zero thermal or electrical Hall conductance. In this paper, we prove two no-go theorems that forbid such chirality for a quantum state in a finite dimensional local Hilbert space with strict area law entanglement entropies. As a crucial ingredient in the proofs, we introduce a new quantum information-theoretic primitive called instantaneous modular flow, which has many other potential applications.</description>

Abstract: We derive a refined version of the Affleck-Ludwig-Cardy formula for a 1+1d conformal field theory, which controls the asymptotic density of high energy states on an interval transforming under a given representation of a noninvertible global symmetry. We use this to determine the universal leading and sub-leading contributions to the noninvertible symmetry-resolved entanglement entropy of a single interval. As a concrete example, we show that the ground state entanglement Hamiltonian for a single interval in the critical double Ising model enjoys a Kac-Paljutkin $H_8$ Hopf algebra symmetry when the boundary conditions at the entanglement cuts are chosen to preserve the product of two Kramers-Wannier symmetries, and we present the corresponding symmetry-resolved entanglement entropies. Our analysis utilizes recent developments in symmetry topological field theories (SymTFTs).</description>

      <title>Instability of steady-state mixed-state symmetry-protected topological order to strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12900v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent experimental progress in controlling open quantum systems enables the pursuit of mixed-state nonequilibrium quantum phases. We investigate whether open quantum systems hosting mixed-state symmetry-protected topological states as steady states retain this property under symmetric perturbations. Focusing on the decohered cluster state -- a mixed-state symmetry-protected topological state protected by a combined strong and weak symmetry -- we construct a parent Lindbladian that hosts it as a steady state. This Lindbladian can be mapped onto exactly solvable reaction-diffusion dynamics, even in the presence of certain perturbations, allowing us to solve the parent Lindbladian in detail and reveal previously-unknown steady states. Using both analytical and numerical methods, we find that typical symmetric perturbations cause strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking at arbitrarily small perturbations, destabilize the steady-state mixed-state symmetry-protected topological order. However, when perturbations introduce only weak symmetry defects, the steady-state mixed-state symmetry-protected topological order remains stable. Additionally, we construct a quantum channel which replicates the essential physics of the Lindbladian and can be efficiently simulated using only Clifford gates, Pauli measurements, and feedback.</description>

Abstract: The discovery of ambient-pressure superconductivity with $T_{c,\text{onset}} &gt; 40$ K in {\LNO} (LNO) thin films grown on the SrLaAlO$_4$ (SLAO) substrate with compressive ($\varepsilon\approx-2\%$) epitaxial strain provides a unique platform for investigating the superconducting mechanisms in nickelate superconductors. Here, we use resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) to unveil the dispersive spin excitations in the LNO/SLAO superconducting thin film and establish the strain dependence of the electronic and spin excitations in LNO thin films with strain ranging from $\varepsilon\approx-2\%$ to $+1.9\%$. Compared with the bulk crystal, the LNO/SLAO thin film (with $\varepsilon\approx-2\%$) exhibits similar $dd$ excitations and spin dynamics with larger bandwidth. By contrast, tensile-strained LNO/SrTiO$_3$ ($\varepsilon \approx +1.9\%$) exhibits a marked suppression of both the spin excitations and the Ni 3{\dz}-derived $dd$ excitations. The strain dependence of the spin excitations reflects significant changes in the interlayer exchange coupling $J_z$, and the diminishing $dd$ excitations in tensile-strained samples indicate weaker Ni 3{\dz}-O 2$p_{z}$ hybridization. This strain evolution of the spin excitations and $J_z$ is attributed to the strain-tuned $c$-axis Ni-O-Ni bond angle $\varphi$, which controls the Ni 3{\dz}-O 2$p_{z}$ hybridization. Since superconductivity is observed only in films grown on SLAO, and spin correlations are enhanced along with the emergence of superconductivity, our results identify $\varphi$ as a key structural lever controlling $J_z$ and provide direct spectroscopic support for interlayer spin-fluctuation-mediated pairing scenarios in bilayer nickelates.</description>

      <title>Nagaoka ferromagnetism in semiconductor artificial graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01492v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the emergence of Nagaoka ferromagnetism in semiconductor-based artificial graphene with realistic Coulomb interaction using high-precision variational and diffusion Monte Carlo methods, complemented by exact diagonalization calculations of the generalized Hubbard model. We analyze models of armchair hexagonal geometries nanopatterned on GaAs quantum wells. Our results reveal a distinct magnetic phase transition driven by the absence/addition of a single electron at half-filling. This form of itinerant magnetism predicted rigorously for Hubbard model remained unascertained in large scale realistic systems. We demonstrate that Coulomb scattering terms play a crucial role in stabilizing Nagaoka ferromagnetism, enabling the observation of the phase transition for system parameters near $U/t \approx 60$.</description>

      <title>Strong Hilbert space fragmentation and fractons from subsystem and higher-form symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15889v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new route to Hilbert space fragmentation in high dimensions leveraging the group-word formalism. We show that taking strongly fragmented models in one dimension and "lifting" to higher dimensions using subsystem symmetries can yield strongly fragmented dynamics in higher dimensions, with subdimensional (e.g., lineonic) excitations. This provides a new route to higher-dimensional strong fragmentation, and also a new route to fractonic behavior. Meanwhile, lifting one-dimensional strongly fragmented models to higher dimensions using higher-form symmetries yields models with topologically robust weak fragmentation. In three or more spatial dimensions, one can also "mix and match" subsystem and higher-form symmetries, leading to canonical fracton models such as X-cube. We speculate that this approach could also yield a new route to non-Abelian fractons. These constructions unify a number of phenomena that have been discussed in the literature, as well as furnishing models with novel properties.</description>

      <title>Perfect Particle Transmission through Duality Defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26780v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study wavepackets that propagate across (a) topological interfaces in quantum spin systems exhibiting non-invertible symmetries and (b) duality defects coupling dual theories. We demonstrate that the transmission is always perfect, and that a particle traversing the interface is converted into a nonlocal string-like excitation. We give a systematic way of constructing such a defect by identifying its Hilbert space with the virtual bond dimension of the matrix product operator representing defect lines. Our work both gives an operational meaning to topological interfaces, and provides a lattice analogue of recent results solving the monopole paradox in quantum field theory.</description>
