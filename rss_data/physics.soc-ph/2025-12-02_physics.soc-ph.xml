      <title>X-SYCON: Xylem-Inspired Passive Gradient Control for Communication-Free Swarm Response in Dynamic Disaster Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present X-SYCON, a xylem-inspired multi-agent architecture in which coordination emerges from passive field dynamics rather than explicit planning or communication. Incidents (demands) and obstructions (hazards) continually write diffusing and decaying scalar fields, and agents greedily ascend a local utility $U=\phi_{\mathrm{DE}}-\kappa\,\phi_{\mathrm{HZ}}$ with light anti-congestion and separation. A beaconing rule triggered on first contact temporarily deepens the local demand sink, accelerating completion without reducing time-to-first-response. Across dynamic, partially blocked simulated environments, we observe low miss rates and stable throughput with interpretable, tunable trade-offs over carrier count, arrival rate, hazard density, and hazard sensitivity $\kappa$. We derive that a characteristic hydraulic length scale $\ell\approx\sqrt{D/\lambda}$ predicts recruitment range in a continuum approximation, and we provide a work-conservation (Ohm-law) bound consistent with sublinear capacity scaling with team size. Empirically: (i) soft hazard penalties yield fewer misses when obstacles already block motion; (ii) throughput saturates sublinearly with carriers while reliability improves sharply; (iii) stronger arrivals can reduce misses by sustaining sinks that recruit help; and (iv) phase-stability regions shrink with hazard density but are recovered by more carriers or higher arrivals. We refer to X-SYCON as an instance of Distributed Passive Computation and Control, and we evaluate it in simulations modeling communication-denied disaster response and other constrained sensing-action regimes.</description>

      <title>A Survey on Centrality and Importance Measures in Hypergraphs: Categorization and Empirical Insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying central entities and interactions is a fundamental problem in network science. While well-studied for graphs (pairwise relations), many biological and social systems exhibit higher-order interactions best modeled by hypergraphs. This has led to a proliferation of specialized hypergraph centrality measures, but the field remains fragmented and lacks a unifying framework. This paper addresses this gap by providing the first systematic survey of 39 distinct measures. We introduce a novel taxonomy classifying them as: (1) structural (topology-based), (2) functional (impact on system dynamics), or (3) contextual (incorporating external features). We also present an experimental assessment comparing their empirical similarity and computation time. Finally, we discuss applications, establishing a coherent roadmap for future research in this area.</description>

      <title>Roullete curves, coin paradox and Aristotle's wheel paradox</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work discusses the concept of roulette, the generated curves that occur when one curve rolls without slipping along another, tracing the path of a fixed point. The coin paradox and Aristotle's wheel paradox are used as pedagogical motivations to discuss the parametric equations of epicycloids and hypocycloids, providing a geometrical intuition for the mathematical derivations and computational implementation of those curves. Python code is provided to motivate the application of the derived parametric equations, resulting in concrete visualizations and animations.</description>

      <title>Network Curvature as a Structural Driver of Dengue Spread: A Bayesian Spatial Analysis of Recife (2015-2024)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate whether the structural connectivity of urban road networks helps explain dengue incidence in Recife, Brazil (2015--2024). For each neighborhood, we compute the average \emph{communicability curvature}, a graph-theoretic measure capturing the ability of a locality to influence others through multiple network paths. We integrate this metric into Negative Binomial models, fixed-effects regressions, SAR/SAC spatial models, and a hierarchical INLA/BYM2 specification. Across all frameworks, curvature is the strongest and most stable predictor of dengue risk. In the BYM2 model, the structured spatial component collapses ($\phi \approx 0$), indicating that functional network connectivity explains nearly all spatial dependence typically attributed to adjacency-based CAR terms. The results show that dengue spread in Recife is driven less by geographic contiguity and more by network-mediated structural flows.</description>

      <title>Surveys on the Existence of Extraterrestrial Intelligent Life and Effects of Revealing Expert Consensus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vickers et al. (2025) established that 58.20% of astrobiology experts believe intelligent extraterrestrial life likely exists, providing the first empirical baseline for public comparison. We surveyed 6,114 highly educated and scientifically engaged individuals (77.60% bachelor's degree+; 67.99% high-to-very-high scientific engagement) to assess their beliefs about extraterrestrial intelligent life existence: (1) personal beliefs, (2) perceived social circle beliefs, (3) perceived expert beliefs, and (4) responses to expert consensus revelation. Results showed 95.01% believed extraterrestrial intelligent life exists, with 62.59% holding definitive rather than probable convictions. Participants exhibited massive pluralistic ignorance, a 'cosmic closet', underestimating social circle beliefs by 46.07 percentage points despite near-universal personal conviction. Participants also exhibited a novel 'conviction intensity gap': while overestimating expert belief prevalence (67.63% vs. 58.20% actual), they underestimated expert conviction strength, perceiving only 21.10% as holding definitive beliefs. Experimental revelation of actual consensus (N = 5,106; 83.51% passed manipulation check) produced negligible personal belief change (d = -0.11) and small social belief change (d = 0.14). These findings demonstrate that consensus misperception operates along two dimensions, prevalence and intensity, and that even scientifically engaged audiences resist belief revision via expert consensus information.</description>

      <title>Relations Between the Inequality Indices Gini, Pietra and Kolkata: Theory and Data Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study here relations between three inequality indices, namely the Gini ($g$), Pietra ($p$) and Kolkata ($k$) introduced in 1912, 1915 and 2014 respectively and all are derived from the Lorenz function $L(x)$ introduced in 1905. The Kolkata index (which corresponds to a fixed point of the complementary Lorenz function $L_c(x) \equiv 1-L(x)$) gives the fraction of wealth $k$ possessed by the richest $ 1-k$ fraction of people ($k$ = 0.8 corresponds to Pareto's 80-20 law from 1896). We show rigorously that the Pietra or Robin Hood index $p$ should equal to the excess wealth $2k-1$ possessed by the richest $1-k$ people. Our numerical data analysis for US IRS Income data (1983-2022), Bollywood (India) movie income data (1999-2024) and the citation inequalities across the publications by forty Nobel Laureates (2020-2025) in Economics, Physics, Chemistry and Medicine clearly shows that $p/(2k -1)$ is always greater than unity but the deviation is never more than five percent. Assuming some simple analytic form for the Lorenz function, we also derived the relations $k = (1/2) + (3/8)g$ for small $g$ values and $p/g = 3/4$. However, these relations generally deviate significantly for larger $g$ or $k$ values when compared with observations.</description>

      <title>Entropy-Driven Sensor Deployment and Source Detection in Hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying the diffusion source in complex networks is critical for understanding and controlling epidemic spread. In realistic settings, full observation of node states is rarely available, making sensor-based source detection a practical alternative. However, existing sensor-based methods are often confined to simple networks, failing to capture the higher-order group dynamics of real-world spreading process. By deploying a limited number of sensors to monitor the diffusion process, one can infer the origin from partial observations. Yet, determining optimal sensor placement is challenging, i.e., poor deployment leads to redundant or noisy data, while optimal placement must balance coverage diversity and information value under limited resources. To address these challenges, we propose a dedicated framework termed Sensor-based Source Detection in Hypergraphs (SSDH). Specifically, we introduce a novel entropy-driven sensor deployment strategy that effectively captures critical early-stage diffusion signals by maximizing information gain under limited resources. Furthermore, we develop a source localization algorithm that quantifies propagation uncertainty through a newly defined path uncertainty-based score. By integrating this score with topological distance, SSDH enables accurate and robust source identification. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and empirical hypergraphs demonstrate that SSDH consistently outperforms competing algorithms by 5%--30% across different sensor ratios, final spreading ratios, and infection probabilities. These results validate the effectiveness of SSDH and highlight its superior capability to tackle source localization in complex systems characterized by higher-order interactions.</description>

      <title>Routing-Method Effects on Distance, Time, Fuel, and Emissions in Europe-Asia Trade: A Comparison of the Suez, Cape, and Northern Sea Route Corridors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Growing interest in decarbonization and Arctic accessibility has renewed attention on Europe-Asia shipping corridors. The Northern Sea Route (NSR) is often portrayed as a 30-40% shortcut relative to Suez, with savings propagated to time, fuel, and CO2. The effect of enforcing sea-only feasibility on these baselines, and its downstream impact on time, fuel, and CO2, remains under-examined.
  We compare great-circle baselines with sea-only routes computed via A-star search (A*) on a 0.5-degree grid between Northern Europe and Northeast Asia across the Suez, Cape of Good Hope, and NSR corridors under three waypoint philosophies. Distances are mapped to voyage time using corridor-typical speeds and to fuel/CO2 using main- and auxiliary-engine accounting.
  Sea-only routing preserves the ranking NSR &lt; Suez &lt; Cape but compresses NSR's advantage once realistic speeds are applied. NSR remains shortest (about 8000-10000 nm versus 11000-12000 nm for Suez), yet typical durations differ modestly and fuel/CO2 savings over Suez are small and variant-dependent. Equal-speed tests restore geometric ordering, and endpoint sensitivity shows larger NSR gains for more northern East Asian ports.
  The framework provides a reproducible, corridor-agnostic benchmark for later integration of sea ice, weather, regulatory overlays, and AIS data in dynamic Arctic voyage planning.</description>

      <title>The Hidden Cost of Straight Lines: Quantifying Misallocation Risk in Voronoi-based Service Area Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Voronoi tessellations are standard in spatial planning for assigning service areas based on Euclidean proximity, underpinning regulatory frameworks like the proximity principle in waste management. However, in regions with complex topography, Euclidean distance poorly approximates functional accessibility, causing misallocations that undermine efficiency and equity. This paper develops a probabilistic framework to quantify misallocation risk by modeling travel distances as random scaling of Euclidean distances and deriving incorrect assignment probability as a function of local Voronoi geometry. Using plant-municipality observations (n=383) in Extremadura, Spain (41,635 km2), we demonstrate that the Log-Normal distribution provides best relative fit among alternatives (K-S statistic=0.110). Validation reveals 15.4% of municipalities are misallocated, consistent with the theoretical prediction interval (52-65 municipalities at 95% confidence). Our framework achieves 95% agreement with complex spatial models at O(n) complexity. Poor absolute fit of global distributions (p-values&lt;0.01) reflects diverse topography (elevation 200-2,400m), motivating spatial stratification. Sensitivity analysis validates the fitted dispersion parameter (s=0.093) for predicting observed misallocation. We provide a calibration protocol requiring only 30-100 pilot samples per zone, enabling rapid risk assessment without full network analysis. This establishes the first probabilistic framework for Voronoi misallocation risk with practical guidelines emphasizing spatial heterogeneity and context-dependent calibration.</description>

      <title>An Operational Quantum Information Framework for Experimental Studies on Color Perception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Starting from the foundational axiomatization of the perceptual color space initiated by Schr\"odinger in 1920 and eventually refined by Resnikoff in 1974, Berthier, Provenzi and their collaborators have recently proposed a reformulation of perceptual color attributes within the framework of quantum information. Their work is based on the Jordan algebra formalism of quantum theories and, more specifically, on a quantum system described by a spin factor over the field of real numbers. This theoretical framework is not that of ordinary quantum mechanics, mainly because it requires dealing with rebits, whereas the latter uses qubits. The aim of this paper is to show that this difference in no way hinders the implementation of experimental protocols for testing the validity of the predictions of the color perception model. In particular, we show how to compute the quantum information based perceptual attributes of perceived colors in terms of qubit density matrices.</description>

      <title>Astro-Animation -- How Artists and Scientists Envision the Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00535v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For several years, students at an art college, working with NASA astronomers, have produced animations inspired by research on black holes, dark matter and more. They can be whimsical or poetic but still constrained by scientific rigour. The animations are used for scientific outreach and are freely available. Our program received a positive assessment through an evaluation we undertook. We are now planning a mobile STEAM exhibition to engage teenagers from underrepresented communities who may not typically consider STE(A)M for their studies. "Science anxiety" has been reported to be a significant barrier to learning. Mixing animation with astronomy can stimulate interest in STEAM, making science engaging in an unconventional way. One component would be activities where participants create artistic responses to astronomy. We undertook a workshop at a local city-run school, specialising in the arts for ages 14-17, to brainstorm the art/science activities. There we gave short scientific presentations leading to art activities: a giant colouring wall with projected celestial phenomena, a stop-motion station, and colouring images of comet 67P to produce an animation. Surveys before and after the activities showed positive responses. The hand of the artist has long been an important concept in animation (Crafton 1991). In a film entitled "The Movements of the Universe", this concept is adapted to the hands of scientists. Combining animation, filmed interviews at NASA (including a Nobel prize winner), and the scientists' hands, bring unexpected feelings of dream and humour to the audience. In this paper we explore three different viewpoints of these activities from a scientist, an animator, and an animation student.</description>

      <title>Massive geolocation data reveal evacuation behaviour during the 2024 Noto Peninsula earthquake and tsunami</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05795v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: On 1 January 2024, devastating tsunamis caused by the Noto Peninsula earthquake hit coastal areas within several minutes, but only two tsunami casualties were officially reported. Despite its importance, the cause of this unexpectedly low human loss was unclear because of the limited access to the peninsula and the presence of many visitors during the holiday, which made conducting conventional surveys infeasible. Here, we reveal evacuation behaviour during the 2024 Noto Peninsula tsunami using massive geolocation data collected from a smartphone app. By analysing these massive data, which include over 1.5 million records collected on this day, we find that the evacuation was extremely fast, occurring within 2--6 minutes after the origin time. Further analyses suggest that these fast departures were driven mainly by strong ground shaking; the fact that the tsunami occurred during the family-oriented New Year holiday was also a key factor. Additionally, the long-term analysis of the data reveals that people started returning to the coastal area 20--100 minutes after the origin time, which was long before the downgrading and cancellation of the tsunami warnings. These results highlight the utility of the innovative data-driven approach to evacuation surveys, which addresses the limitations of conventional evacuation surveys.</description>

      <title>Planning future charging infrastructure for private EVs: A city-scale assessment of demand and capacity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16175v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study proposes the first demand-driven, multi-objective planning model for optimizing city-scale capacity allocation of EV charging infrastructure. The model employs a bottom-up approach to estimate charging demand differentiated by vehicle type-battery electric vehicles (BEVs), extended-range electric vehicles (EREVs), and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs). Chongqing, a rapidly expanding EV industry cluster in China with a strong industrial base, supportive policies, and diverse urban morphologies, is selected as the case study. The results show that (1) monthly EV electricity consumption in Chongqing rose from 18.9 gigawatt-hours (GWh) in June 2022 to 57.5 GWh in December 2024, with associated carbon emissions increasing from 9.9 kilotons of carbon dioxide (ktCO2) to 30 ktCO2; (2) 181,622 additional charging piles were installed between 2022 and 2024, with the fastest growth observed in Yubei, reflecting a demand-responsive strategy that prioritizes areas with higher population density, higher income levels, and adequate land availability for pile deployment, rather than broad geographic coverage; and (3) between 2025 and 2030, EV electricity demand is projected to reach 1940 GWh, with the number of charging piles exceeding 1.4 million, and charging demand from EREVs and PHEVs expected to overtake BEVs later in the period. While Chongqing serves as the pilot area, the proposed planning platform is adaptable for application in cities worldwide, enabling cross-regional comparisons under diverse socio-economic, geographic, and policy conditions. Overall, this work offers policymakers a versatile tool to support sustainable, cost-effective EV infrastructure deployment aligned with low-carbon electrification targets in the transportation sector.</description>

Abstract: Economic inequality emerges from the interplay between regional growth-rate differences and the interaction network that couples regions. We propose a minimal income-dynamics model, where heterogeneity is governed by growth-rate assortativity $\mathcal{A}$ and regional concentration $\mathcal{R}$, allowing us to quantify the spatiotemporal patterns of empirically observed log-income distributions. To systematically analyze these patterns, we derive closed-form approximations for the Hellinger distance and the Gini index in limiting configurations. Our findings highlight the spatial segregation of growth rates as a key driver of economic class division and demonstrate how small-world shortcuts in the underlying network can disrupt this segregation. Finally, our framework provides a robust explanation for the bimodality and strong regional correlations found in global income distributions.</description>
