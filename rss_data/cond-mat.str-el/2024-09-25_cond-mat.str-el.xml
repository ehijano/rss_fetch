      <title>Quantum-interference-induced pairing in antiferromagnetic bosonic $t$-$J$ model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The pairing mechanism in an antiferromagnetic (AFM) bosonic $t$-$J$ model is investigated via large-scale density matrix renormalization group calculations. In contrast to the competing orders in the fermionic $t$-$J$ model, we discover that a pair density wave (PDW) of tightly bound hole pairs coexists with the AFM order forming a ``supersolid'' at small doping in the bosonic model. The pairing order collapses at larger doping to a superfluid of single-boson condensation with the spin background polarized to a ferromagnetic (FM) order simultaneously. This pairing phase will disappear once a hidden quantum many-body Berry phase in the model is artificially switched off. Such a Berry phase, termed the phase string, introduces the sole ``sign problem'' in this bosonic model and imposes quantum phase frustration in the interference pattern between spin and charge degrees of freedom. Only via tightly pairing of doped holes, can such quantum frustration be most effectively erased in an AFM background. By contrast, the pairing vanishes as such a Berry phase trivializes in an FM background or is switched off by a sign-problem-free model (the Bose-Hubbard model at large $U$). The pairing mechanism proposed here is inherently quantum and many-body, stemming from exotic interference patterns caused by strong correlation effects, which is distinct from the semi-classical mechanisms based on bosonic fluctuations. Experimental schemes have been recently proposed to realize the bosonic $t$-$J$ model on ultracold Rydberg atom arrays, offering a useful platform to test the present unconventional pairing mechanism, which is also relevant to the fermionic case associated with high-temperature superconductors.</description>

      <title>Cluster dynamical mean field study of intra-unit-cell charge nematicity in hole-doped cuprates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent scanning-tunneling microscopy on hole-doped Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_8$, one of the materials of the cuprate family, finds a long-range ordered spontaneous splitting of the energy levels of oxygen orbitals inside the CuO$_2$ unit cells [S. Wang et al., Nat. Mat. 23, 492-498 (2024)]. This spontaneous intra-unit-cell orbital ordering, also known as electronic nematicity, breaks $C_4$ symmetry and is thought to arise from the Coulomb interaction (denoted by $V_{pp}$) between oxygen $p_x$ and $p_y$ electrons. In this work, we study the spontaneous emergence of electronic nematicity within the three-band Hubbard (aka the Emery-VSA model), using cluster dynamical mean field theory. This method incorporates short-range electronic correlations and gives us access to the density of states, a quantity that is directly probed in experiments. We argue that there is a delicate competition between $V_{pp}$ and $V_{pd}$ (the latter being the Coulomb interaction between copper $d_{x^2-y^2}$ and oxygen $p_{x,y}$ electrons) that must be taken into account in order to find a Zhang-Rice singlet band well-resolved from the upper Hubbard band, and a splitting of the charge-transfer band (one of the signatures of charge nematicity) by roughly 50 meV, as observed recently.</description>

      <title>Magneto-optical Detection of Altermagnetism in Organic Antiferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We measured the magneto-optical Kerr effect in an orthorhombic organic antiferromagnet kappa-(BEDT-TTF)2Cu[N(CN)2]Cl, which is a candidate for altermagnets. From the Maxwell equations, we obtained formulae describing the optical phenomena of propagation and reflection for general crystals even with off-diagonal responses. These formulae enabled us to correctly measure and obtain the off-diagonal optical responses from the organic antiferromagnet, which appeared at around the N\'eel temperature and exhibited a nonlinear field dependence in the antiferromagnetic phase. The obtained off-diagonal optical conductivity spectra for almost entire \pi-electron band clearly shows the energy scale of spin band splitting, importance of the collinear antiferromagnetic spin ordering, and anisotropic diagonal transfers in relation to the piezomagnetic effect, which are essential for altermagnets.</description>

      <title>Quantum entanglement and quantum geometry measured with inelastic X-ray scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15583v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using inelastic X-ray scattering (IXS), we experimentally investigate the quantum geometry and quantum information in the large-gap insulator, LiF. Using sum rules for the density-density response function measured in IXS, we compute the quantum Fisher information of the equilibrium density matrix of LiF associated with density perturbations. Next, by exploiting universal relations between the quantum Fisher information, the optical conductivity, and the quantum metric tensor, we extrapolate the diagonal $(h,k,l) = (1,0,0)$ component of the quantum metric of LiF, known as the quantum weight. We compare our results to recently-proposed bounds on the quantum weight and find that LiF resides near the lower bound, supporting the general understanding of this material as a highly localized, ionic insulator. Our work serves as a proof-of-principle that IXS techniques can be used to quantify state-of-the-art quantum geometric quantities of materials.</description>

      <title>Vortex wall phase in fractonic XY-plaquette model on square lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15638v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The XY-plaquette model is the most straightforward lattice realization of a broad class of fractonic field theories that host quasiparticles with restricted mobility. The plaquette interaction appears naturally as a ring-exchange term in the low-energy description of exciton Bose liquids, cold atomic gases, and quantum dimer models. Using first-principle Monte Carlo simulations, we study the phase diagram and the vortex dynamics in the XY-plaquette model on a square lattice in two spatial dimensions. In its minimal formulation, the model contains a ring-exchange plaquette term in two spatial dimensions and a standard XY-link term in the (imaginary) time direction. We show that the phase diagram of the minimal XY-plaquette model possesses two phases: (i) a disordered vortex-dominated phase in which a single percolating vortex trajectory occupies the whole 3d spacetime; (ii) a partially disordered phase in which the vortices become partially immobile, with their worldlines strictly confined to one or several infinite two-dimensional planes. The spatial positions and spatial orientations (along $x$ or $y$ axis) of these vortex domain walls appear to be spontaneous. Individual vortices form a disordered system within each vortex domain wall, so the fractal spacetime dimension of vortex trajectories approaches $D_f = 2$. We argue that the appearance of the vortex walls could be interpreted as a consequence of the spontaneous breaking of a global internal symmetry in the compact XY-plaquette model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As for the study of Landau level wavefunctions for the quantum Hall effect, the magnetic translation group and the magnetic Bloch wavefunctions are extensively investigated in the past few decades. It is natural to ask what is its electric counterpart. In this article, the electric translation group is defined as well as the electric Brillouin zone, which is applied to the problem of one dimensional tight-binding model under an external electric field. The spectrum of electric Floquet-Bloch states can be generated by the projective representation of electric translation group, and the topological properties of these states are investigated.</description>

      <title>Equivalence of pseudogap and pairing energy in a cuprate high-temperature superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The pseudogap stands out in the phase diagram of the cuprate high-temperature superconductors because its origin and relationship to superconductivity remain elusive. The origin of the pseudogap has been debated, with competing hypotheses attributing it to preformed electron pairs or local order, such as charge density waves. Here, we present unambiguous evidence supporting the pairing scenario, using local shot-noise spectroscopy measurements in Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+{\delta}. Our data demonstrates that the pseudogap energy coincides with the onset of electron pairing, and is spatially heterogeneous with values reaching up to 70 meV. Our results exclude a pure local order origin of the pseudogap, link the pseudogap to Cooper pair formation, and show that the limiting factor for higher Tc in cuprates is phase coherence.</description>

      <title>Aspects of Hilbert space fragmentation in the quantum East model: fragmentation, subspace-restricted quantum scars, and effects of density-density interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a one-dimensional correlated-hopping model of spinless fermions with an East constraint. We first analytically unravel the fractured Hilbert space by labeling each fragment by a unique root configuration. This enables us to compute the total number of fragments and frozen states using transfer matrices. This method further allows us to analytically calculate how all the fragments grow with system size by mapping the transitions allowed by the East constraint to the combinatorics sequence of Dyck words with the help of the Catalan triangle. The energy level spacing statistics indicates that while the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) does not hold within the full Hilbert space, the largest fragments obey a weaker version of the subspace-restricted thermalization. This weaker form of the ETH is supported by the presence of subspace-restricted quantum many-body scars. Our analysis further reveals that the filling fraction at which the model has the largest fragment shifts with increasing system sizes from half-filling. In order to stabilize the ground state at a particular filling fraction, we examine the effect of perturbations, namely, a nearest-neighbor density-density interaction with strength $V$. Within the largest fragment, the model undergoes a transition from a weakly ETH-violating phase to a statistical bubble localized phase with increasing $V$. The $V\to \infty$ limit reduces to an integrable model with inversion symmetry. The stabilization of the ground state at half-filling for finite $V$ abruptly changes exactly at $V\to\infty$ due to the emergence of a distinct fragmentation structure. We analytically uncover this new fractured Hilbert space, followed by the mapping of each fragment to a nearest-neighbor tight-binding model of non-interacting fermions. Finally, we propose an experimental setup to realize the infinite-$V$ model.</description>

      <title>Fluctuation-induced Bistability of Fermionic Atoms Coupled to a Dissipative Cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16035v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the steady state phase diagram of fermionic atoms subjected to an optical lattice and coupled to a high finesse optical cavity with photon losses. The coupling between the atoms and the cavity field is induced by a transverse pump beam. Taking fluctuations around the mean-field solutions into account, we find that a transition to a self-organized phase takes place at a critical value of the pump strength. In the self-organized phase the cavity field takes a finite expectation value and the atoms show a modulation in the density. Surprisingly, at even larger pump strengths two self-organized stable solutions of the cavity field and the atoms occur, signaling the presence of a bistability. We show that the bistable behavior is induced by the atoms-cavity fluctuations and is not captured by the the mean-field approach.</description>

      <title>Nearly degenerate ground states of a checkerboard antiferromagnet and their bosonic interpretation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2011.06520v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The spin-$1/2$ model system with antiferromagnetic (AF) couplings on a $J_1$-$J_2$ checkerboard lattice, known as the planar pyrochlore model, is strongly frustrated and associated with a two-to-one dimensional crossover. Using the Projected Entangled Simplex States tensor network ansatz, we identify a large number of nearly degenerate states in the frustrated region ($J_1&lt;J_2$). Specifically, we find the long-sought crossed-dimer valence bond solid (VBS) state to be the ground state at $J_1\lesssim J_2$, while various 1D AF correlated states take over the rest. We verify the stability of the VBS state against nematic perturbation. The corresponding bosonic picture provides an intuitive understanding of the low-energy physics. Particularly, it predicts weaker VBS states in the easy-plane limit, which we confirm numerically. Our results clarify the most essential ground state properties of this interesting system and demonstrate the usefulness of bosonic picture in dealing with frustrated magnetism.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by the mathematical beauty and the recent experimental realizations of fractal systems, we study the spin-$1/2$ antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on a Sierpi\'nski gasket. The fractal porous feature generates new kinds of frustration to exhibit exotic quantum states. Using advanced tensor network techniques, we identify a quantum gapless-spin-liquid ground state in fractional spatial dimension. This fractal spin system also demonstrates nontrivial non-local properties. While the extremely short-range correlation causes a highly degenerate spin form factor, the entanglement in this fractal system suggests a long-range scaling behavior. We also study the dynamic structure factor and clearly identify the gapless excitation with a stable corner excitation emerged from the ground-state entanglement. Our results unambiguously point out multiple essential properties of this fractal spin system, and open a new route to explore spin liquid and frustrated magnetism.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.00813v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Concepts of the complex partition functions and the Fisher zeros provide intrinsic statistical mechanisms for finite temperature and real time dynamical phase transitions. We extend the utility of these complexifications to quantum phase transitions. We exactly identify different Fisher zeros on lines or closed curves and elucidate their correspondence with domain-wall excitations or confined mesons for the one-dimensional transverse field Ising model. The crossover behavior of the Fisher zeros provides a fascinating picture for criticality near the quantum phase transition, where the excitation energy scales are quantitatively determined. We further confirm our results by tensor network calculations and demonstrate a clear signal of deconfined meson excitations from the disruption of the closed zero curves. Our results unambiguously show significant features of Fisher zeros for a quantum phase transition and open up a new route to explore quantum criticality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.15153v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the effect of hole doping on the Kitaev spin liquid (KSL) and find that for ferromagnetic (FM) Kitaev exchange $K$ the system is very susceptible to the formation of a FM spin polarization. Through density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations on finite systems, we uncover that the introduction of a single hole with a hopping strength of just $t\sim{}0.28K$ is enough to disrupt fractionalization and polarize the spins in the [001] direction due to an order-by-disorder mechanism. Taking into account a material relevant FM anisotropic spin exchange $\varGamma$ drives the polarization towards the [111] direction via a reorientation transition into a topological FM state with chiral magnon excitations. We develop a parton mean-field theory incorporating fermionic holons and bosonic spinons/magnons, which accounts for the doping induced FM phases and topological magnon excitations. We discuss experimental signatures and implications for Kitaev candidate materials.</description>

Abstract: The unconventional superconductor CeRh$_2$As$_2$ (critical temperature $T_{\mathrm{c}}\approx0.4\,\mathrm{K}$) displays an exceptionally rare magnetic-field-induced transition between two distinct superconducting (SC) phases, proposed to be states of even and odd parity of the SC order parameter, which are enabled by a locally noncentrosymmetric structure. The superconductivity is preceded by a phase transition of unknown origin at $T_{0}\approx0.5\,\mathrm{K}$. Electronic low-temperature properties of CeRh$_2$As$_2$ show pronounced non-Fermi-liquid behavior, indicative of a proximity to a quantum critical point (QCP). The role of quantum fluctuations and normal state orders for the superconductivity in a system with staggered Rashba interaction is currently an open question, pertinent to explaining the occurrence of two-phase superconductivity. In this work, using measurements of resistivity and specific heat under hydrostatic pressure, we show that the $T_{0}$ order vanishes completely at a modest pressure of $P_{0}=0.5\,\mathrm{GPa}$, revealing a QCP. In line with the quantum criticality picture, the linear temperature dependence of the resistivity at $P_{0}$ evolves into a Fermi-liquid quadratic dependence as quantum critical fluctuations are suppressed by increasing pressure. Furthermore, the domelike behavior of $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ around $P_{0}$ implies that the fluctuations of the $T_{0}$ order are involved in the SC pairing mechanism.</description>

      <title>Universal collective Larmor-Silin mode emerging in magnetized correlated Dirac fermions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.14358v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Employing large-scale quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we find that in the magnetized interacting Dirac fermion model there emerges a universal collective Larmor-Silin spin wave mode in the transverse dynamical spin susceptibility. Such mode purely originates from the interaction among Dirac fermions and distinguishes itself from the usual particle-hole continuum with finite lifetime and clear dispersion, both at small and large momenta in a large portion of the Brillouin zone. Our unbiased numerical results offer the dynamic signature of this collective excitation in interacting Dirac fermion systems, and provide experimental guidance for inelastic neutron scattering, electron spin resonance, and other spectroscopic approaches in the investigation of such universal collective modes in quantum Moire materials, topological insulators, and quantum spin liquid materials under magnetic field, with quintessential interaction nature beyond the commonly assumed noninteracting Dirac fermion or spinon approximations.</description>

      <title>Exact Fisher zeros and thermofield dynamics across a quantum critical point</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18981v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By setting the inverse temperature $\beta$ loose to occupy the complex plane, Michael E. Fisher showed that the zeros of the complex partition function $Z$, if approaching the real $\beta$ axis, reveal a thermodynamic phase transition. More recently, Fisher zeros were used to mark the dynamical phase transition in quench dynamics. It remains unclear, however, how Fisher zeros can be employed to better understand quantum phase transitions or the non-unitary dynamics of open quantum systems. Here we answer this question by a comprehensive analysis of the analytically continued one-dimensional transverse field Ising model. We exhaust all the Fisher zeros to show that in the thermodynamic limit they congregate into a remarkably simple pattern in the form of continuous open or closed lines. These Fisher lines evolve smoothly as the coupling constant is tuned, and a qualitative change identifies the quantum critical point. By exploiting the connection between $Z$ and the thermofield double states, we obtain analytical expressions for the short- and long-time dynamics of the survival amplitude including its scaling behavior at the quantum critical point. We point out $Z$ can be realized and probed in monitored quantum circuits. The exact analytical results are corroborated by numerical tensor renormalization group. We further show similar patterns of Fisher zeros also emerge in other spin models. Therefore the approach outlined may serve as a powerful tool for interacting quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Infrared spectroscopy study of kagome material CsTi$_3$Bi$_5$</title>

Abstract: The kagome material CsTi$_3$Bi$_5$, which is isostructural to the extensively studied charge density wave (CDW) compound CsV$_3$Sb$_5$, exhibits intriguing electronic features within its two-dimensional kagome lattices of titanium atoms. Here, we perform optical spectroscopic measurements together with the first-principles calculations on single-crystalline CsTi$_3$Bi$_5$ to investigate its electronic properties comprehensively. It is found that the overall optical spectra are very similar to those of CsV$_3$Sb$_5$, but the existence of CDW instability is ruled out in CsTi$_3$Bi$_5$. Via careful comparison to the optical responses of CsV$_3$Sb$_5$, we attribute this difference to a significant reduction in the itinerant carrier density of CsTi$_3$Bi$_5$, which is associated with the absence of van Hove singularity near the Fermi level at $M$ point. This result supports the scenario that the CDW in CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ is driven by the nesting of van Hove singularity. Additionally, we unveil some exotic low-lying absorption features, which provide clear evidence of flat bands in CsTi$_3$Bi$_5$. Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of exotic phenomena in CsTi$_3$Bi$_5$ and provide valuable insights into the role of van Hove singularity in CsV$_3$Sb$_5$.</description>

      <title>Tuning competition between charge order and superconductivity in the square-lattice $t$-$t'$-$J$ model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15270v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, a flurry of works have found strong competition between charge density wave (CDW) and superconductivity (SC) in the doped Hubbard and $t$-$J$ models on the square lattice. Interestingly, some recent results suggest that the electron-phonon coupling may suppress CDW order and enhance SC. In this work, we consider the square-lattice Hubbard model with the Holstein or Su-Schrieffer-Heeger electron-phonon coupling at the large-$U$ and antiadiabatic (infinite phonon frequency) limit, which gives an effective $t$-$J$ model with either a density attractive interaction $V$ or a $J_P$ term that contributes a larger spin exchange and a density repulsive interaction. To explore how these effective couplings may suppress CDW and give a SC, we implement the density matrix renormalization group simulation on the $t$-$t'$-$J$ model with $V$ or $J_P$ coupling. We focus on the {\it six-leg} cylinder system with the next-nearest-neighbor hopping $t'$, which hosts partially filled stripe and $d$-wave SC in phase diagram. By tuning $t'/t &gt; 0$ and $V$ or $J_P$, we establish two quantum phase diagrams. In the SC phases, the increased $V$ or $J_P$ coupling can enhance the quasi-long-range SC order, consistent with some previous findings. Nonetheless, no SC emerges when the partially filled stripe phase disappears with increased $V$ or $J_P$. Instead, the system has a transition to either a phase-separation-like regime or a filled stripe phase. On the other hand, with increased $t'/t$, not only the partially filled stripe but the phase separation and filled stripe can also be tuned to SC phase. Our results suggest that although $V$ and $J_P$ couplings may strengthen hole binding, the hole dynamics controlled by $t'/t$ appears to play more crucial role for obtaining a SC in $t$-$J$ model.</description>

      <title>The deformed Inozemtsev spin chain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.13066v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Inozemtsev chain is an exactly solvable interpolation between the short-range Heisenberg and long-range Haldane-Shastry (HS) chains. In order to unlock its potential to study spin interactions with tunable interaction range using the powerful tools of integrability, the model's mathematical properties require better understanding. As a major step in this direction, we present a new generalisation of the Inozemtsev chain with spin symmetry reduced to U(1), interpolating between a Heisenberg xxz chain and the xxz-type HS chain, and integrable throughout. Underlying it is a new quantum many-body system that extends the elliptic Ruijsenaars system by including spins, contains the trigonometric spin-Ruijsenaars-Macdonald system as a special case, and yields our spin chain by 'freezing'. Our models have potential applications from condensed-matter to high-energy theory, and provide a crucial step towards a general theory for long-range integrability.</description>

      <title>Bethe ansatz inside Calogero-Sutherland models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.16865v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the trigonometric quantum spin-Calogero-Sutherland model, and the Haldane-Shastry spin chain as a special case, using a Bethe-ansatz analysis. We harness the model's Yangian symmetry to import the standard tools of integrability for Heisenberg spin chains into the world of integrable long-range models with spins. From the transfer matrix with a diagonal twist we construct Heisenberg-style symmetries (Bethe algebra) that refine the usual hierarchy of commuting Hamiltonians (quantum determinant) of the spin-Calogero-Sutherland model. We compute the first few of these new conserved charges explicitly, and diagonalise them by Bethe ansatz inside each irreducible Yangian representation. This yields a new eigenbasis for the spin-Calogero-Sutherland model that generalises the Yangian Gelfand-Tsetlin basis of Takemura and Uglov. The Bethe-ansatz analysis involves non-generic values of the inhomogeneities. Our review of the inhomogeneous Heisenberg XXX chain, with special attention to how the Bethe ansatz works in the presence of fusion, may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Efficiency of neural quantum states in light of the quantum geometric tensor</title>

Abstract: Neural quantum state (NQS) ans\"atze have shown promise in variational Monte Carlo algorithms by their theoretical capability of representing any quantum state. However, the reason behind the practical improvement in their performance with an increase in the number of parameters is not fully understood. In this work, we systematically study the efficiency of a shallow neural network to represent the ground states in different phases of the spin-1 bilinear-biquadratic chain, as the number of parameters increases. We train our ansatz by a supervised learning procedure, minimizing the infidelity w.r.t. the exact ground state. We observe that the accuracy of our ansatz improves with the network width in most cases, and eventually saturates. We demonstrate that this can be explained by looking at the spectrum of the quantum geometric tensor (QGT), particularly its rank. By introducing an appropriate indicator, we establish that the QGT rank provides a useful diagnostic for the practical representation power of an NQS ansatz.</description>

      <title>Categorical-Symmetry Resolved Entanglement in CFT</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06322v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a symmetry resolution of entanglement for categorical non-invertible symmetries (CaT-SREE) in (1 + 1)-dimensional CFTs. The definition parallels that of group-like invertible symmetries, employing the concept of symmetric boundary states with respect to a categorical symmetry. Our examination extends to rational CFTs, where the behavior of CaT-SREE mirrors that of group-like invertible symmetries. We find that CaT-SREE can be defined if there is no obstruction to gauging the categorical symmetry, as happens in the case of group-like symmetries. We also provide instances of the breakdown of entanglement equipartition at the next-to-leading order in the cutoff expansion. Our findings shed light on how the interplay between conformal boundary conditions and categorical symmetries lead to specific patterns in the entanglement entropy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15972v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Order parameters represent a fundamental resource to characterize quantum matter. We show that pair superfluids can be rigorously defined in terms of a nonlocal order parameter, named odd parity, which derivation is experimentally accessible by local density measurements. As a case of study, we first investigate a constrained Bose-Hubbard model at different densities, both in one and two spatial dimensions. Here, our analysis finds pair superfluidity for relatively strong attractive interactions. The odd parity operator acts as the unique order parameter for such phase irrespectively to the density of the system and its dimensionality in regimes of total particle number conservation. In order to enforce our finding, we confirm the generality of our approach also on a two-component Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian, which experimental realization represents a timely topic in ultracold atomic systems. Our results shed new light on the role of correlated density fluctuations in pair superfluids. In addition, they provide a powerful tool for the experimental detection of such exotic phases and the characterization of their transition to the atomic superfluid phase.</description>

      <title>Electron-hole polarization supporting short-range pairing in cuprate high-temperature superconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00787v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate the dramatic effect of non-uniform, discrete electric polarizability in high-T$_{C}$ superconductors on the spatial fluctuations of the short to medium range Coulomb interactions through a real-space semiclassical model. Although this is a general property, we concentrate on the cuprates as parent compounds, in which the charge carriers are primarily concentrated on the O sublattice. The anisotropic effective Cu-O bond polarization caused by charge transfer energy modulation and the O$^{2-}$ atomic polarizability together generate a non-monotonic screened hole-hole Coulomb interaction at short distances that displays a local minimum at the in-plane second nearest neighbor O-O distance solely along the Cu-O bond direction. These polarization effects suppress short-range Coulomb repulsion in the antinodal directions as necessary for pairing, strongly reducing the need for retardation effects and explaining the short coherence lengths and the pseudogap phase anisotropy observed in many high-T$_C$ superconductors.</description>

      <title>Rotations, Negative Eigenvalues, and Newton Method in Tensor Network Renormalization Group</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10312v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the tensor network approach to statistical physics, properties of the critical point of a 2D lattice model are encoded by a four-legged tensor which is a fixed point of an RG map. The traditional way to find the fixed point tensor consists in iterating the RG map after having tuned the temperature to criticality. Here we develop a different and more direct technique, which solves the fixed point equation via the Newton method. This is challenging due to the existence of marginal deformations -- linear transformations of the coordinate frame, which parametrize a two-dimensional family of fixed points. We address this challenge by including a 90 degree rotation into the RG map. This flips the sign of the problematic marginal eigenvalues, rendering the fixed point isolated and accessible via the Newton method. We demonstrate the power of this technique via explicit computations for the 2D Ising model. Using the Gilt-TNR algorithm at bond dimension $\chi=30$, we find the fixed point tensor with $10^{-9}$ accuracy, much higher than what was previously achieved.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Negativity and Replica Symmetry Breaking in General Holographic States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13009v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The entanglement negativity $\mathcal{E}(A:B)$ is a useful measure of quantum entanglement in bipartite mixed states. In random tensor networks (RTNs), which are related to fixed-area states, it was found in [arXiv:2101.11029] that the dominant saddles computing the even R\'enyi negativity $\mathcal{E}^{(2k)}$ generically break the $\mathbb{Z}_{2k}$ replica symmetry. This calls into question previous calculations of holographic negativity using 2D CFT techniques that assumed $\mathbb{Z}_{2k}$ replica symmetry and proposed that the negativity was related to the entanglement wedge cross section. In this paper, we resolve this issue by showing that in general holographic states, the saddles computing $\mathcal{E}^{(2k)}$ indeed break the $\mathbb{Z}_{2k}$ replica symmetry. Our argument involves an identity relating $\mathcal{E}^{(2k)}$ to the $k$-th R\'enyi entropy on subregion $AB^*$ in the doubled state $|{\rho_{AB}}\rangle_{AA^*BB^*}$, from which we see that the $\mathbb{Z}_{2k}$ replica symmetry is broken down to $\mathbb{Z}_{k}$. For $k&lt;1$, which includes the case of $\mathcal{E}(A:B)$ at $k=1/2$, we use a modified cosmic brane proposal to derive a new holographic prescription for $\mathcal{E}^{(2k)}$ and show that it is given by a new saddle with multiple cosmic branes anchored to subregions $A$ and $B$ in the original state. Using our prescription, we reproduce known results for the PSSY model and show that our saddle dominates over previously proposed CFT calculations near $k=1$. Moreover, we argue that the $\mathbb{Z}_{2k}$ symmetric configurations previously proposed are not gravitational saddles, unlike our proposal. Finally, we contrast holographic calculations with those arising from RTNs with non-maximally entangled links, demonstrating that the qualitative form of backreaction in such RTNs is different from that in gravity.</description>
