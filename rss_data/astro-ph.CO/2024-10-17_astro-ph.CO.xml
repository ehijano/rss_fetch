      <title>Probe of spatial geometry from scalar induced gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a novel probe of spatial geometry of the Universe through the observation of gravitational waves (GWs) induced by first order curvature perturbations. The existence of spatial curvature leaves imprints on the gravitational wave spectrum and formation of primordial black holes. Given the peaked scalar spectrum, the induced spectrum deviates from the flat space power spectrum and the deviation is dependent on the spatial curvature K and reheating temperature $T_{rh}$. For prolonged reheating and negative spatial curvature the spectrum is amplified enough and exhibits an additional peak solely due to K indicating a possible detection by future gravitational wave experiments including LISA and DECIGO. We also observe that the presence of negative spatial curvature improves the constraints on PBH formation, increasing the mass of black holes which are viable dark matter candidates.</description>

      <title>Semi-supervised Learning for Detecting Inverse Compton Emission in Galaxy Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inverse Compton (IC) emission associated with the non-thermal component of the intracluster medium (ICM) has been a long sought phenomenon in cluster physics. Traditional spectral fitting often suffers from the degeneracy between the two-temperature thermal spectrum (2T) and the one-temperature plus IC power-law spectrum (1T+IC). We present a semi-supervised deep learning approach to search for IC emission in galaxy clusters. We employ a conditional autoencoder (CAE), which is based on an autoencoder with latent representations trained to constrain the thermal parameters of the ICM. The algorithm is trained and tested using synthetic NuSTAR X-ray spectra with instrumental and astrophysical backgrounds included. The training data set only contains 2T spectra, which is more common than 1T+IC spectra. Anomaly detection is performed on the validation and test datasets, consisting of 2T spectra as the normal set and 1T+IC spectra as anomalies. With a threshold anomaly score, chosen based on cross-validation, our algorithm is able to identify spectra that contain an IC component in the test dataset, with a balanced accuracy (BAcc) of 0.64, which outperforms traditional spectral fitting (BAcc = 0.55) and ordinary autoencoder (BAcc = 0.55). Traditional spectral fitting is better at identifying IC cases among true IC spectra (a better recall), while IC predictions made by CAE have a higher chance of being true IC cases (a better precision), demonstrating their mutual complement to each other.</description>

      <title>Methods for CMB map analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This introductory guide aims to provide insight to new researchers in the field of cosmic microwave background (CMB) map analysis on best practices for several common procedures. I will discuss common map-modifying procedures such as masking, downgrading resolution, the effect of the beam and the pixel window function, and adding white noise. I will explore how these modifications affect the final power spectrum measured from a map. This guide aims to describe the best way to perform each of these procedures, when the different steps and measures should be carried out, and the effects of incorrectly performing or applying any of them.</description>

      <title>Galaxy Mass Modelling from Multi-Wavelength JWST Strong Lens Analysis: Dark Matter Substructure, Angular Mass Complexity, or Both?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze two galaxy-scale strong gravitational lenses, SPT0418-47 and SPT2147-50, using JWST NIRCam imaging across multiple filters. To account for angular complexity in the lens mass distribution, we introduce multipole perturbations with orders $m=1, 3, 4$. Our results show strong evidence for angular mass complexity in SPT2147, with multipole strengths of 0.3-1.7 $\%$ for $m=3, 4$ and 2.4-9.5 $\%$ for $m=1$, while SPT0418 shows no such preference. We also test lens models that include a dark matter substructure, finding a strong preference for a substructure in SPT2147-50 with a Bayes factor (log-evidence change) of $\sim 60$ when multipoles are not included. Including multipoles reduces the Bayes factor to $\sim 11$, still corresponding to a $5\sigma$ detection of a subhalo with an NFW mass of $\log_{10}(M_{200}/M_{\odot}) = 10.87\substack{+0.53\\ -0.71}$. While SPT2147-50 may represent the fourth detection of a dark matter substructure in a strong lens, further analysis is needed to confirm that the signal is not due to systematics associated with the lens mass model.</description>

      <title>Is the $w_0w_a$CDM cosmological parameterization evidence for dark energy dynamics partially caused by the excess smoothing of Planck CMB anisotropy data?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the performance of the spatially-flat dynamical dark energy (DE) $w_0w_a$CDM parameterization, with redshift-dependent DE fluid equation of state parameter $w(z) = w_0 + w_a z/(1+z)$, with and without a varying CMB lensing consistency parameter $A_L$, against Planck cosmic microwave background (CMB) data (P18 and lensing) and a combination of non-CMB data composed of baryonic acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements that do not include DESI BAO data, Pantheon+ type Ia supernovae (SNIa) observations, Hubble parameter [$H(z)$] measurements, and growth factor ($f\sigma_8$) data points. From our most restrictive data set, P18+lensing+non-CMB, for the $w_0w_a$CDM+$A_L$ parameterization, we obtain $w_0=-0.879\pm 0.060$, $w_a=-0.39^{+0.26}_{-0.22}$, the asymptotic limit $w(z\to\infty) = w_0+w_a=-1.27^{+0.20}_{-0.17}$, and $A_L=1.078^{+0.036}_{-0.040}$ (all $1\sigma$ errors). This joint analysis of CMB and non-CMB data favors DE dynamics over a cosmological constant at $\sim 1\sigma$ and $A_L&gt;1$ at $\sim 2\sigma$, i.e. more smoothing of the Planck CMB anisotropy data than is predicted by the best-fit model. For the $w_0w_a$CDM parameterization with $A_L=1$ the evidence in favor of DE dynamics is larger, $\sim 2\sigma$, suggesting that at least part of the evidence for DE dynamics comes from the excess smoothing of the Planck CMB anisotropy data. For the $w_0w_a$CDM parameterization with $A_L=1$, there is a difference of $2.8\sigma$ between P18 and non-CMB cosmological parameter constraints and $2.7\sigma$ between P18+lensing and non-CMB constraints. When $A_L$ is allowed to vary these tensions reduced to $1.9\sigma$ and $2.1\sigma$ respectively. Our P18+lensing+non-CMB data compilation positively favors the $w_0w_a$CDM parameterization without and with a varying $A_L$ parameter over the flat $\Lambda$CDM model, and $w_0w_a$CDM+$A_L$ is also positively favored over $w_0w_a$CDM.</description>

      <title>Stochastic inflation beyond slow roll: noise modelling and importance sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We simulate the distribution of very rare, large excursions in the primordial density field produced in models of inflation in the very early universe which include a strong enhancement of the power spectrum. The stochastic $\delta \mathcal{N}$ formalism is used to identify the probability distribution for the primordial curvature perturbation with the first-passage-time distribution, $P(\delta \mathcal{N})$, and we compare our stochastic results with those obtained in the classical $\delta \mathcal{N}$ approach. We extend the PyFPT numerical code to simulate the full 2D phase space, and apply importance sampling which allows very rare fluctuations to be simulated in $\mathcal{O}(10)$ minutes on a single CPU, where previous direct simulations required supercomputers. We demonstrate that the stochastic noise due to quantum fluctuations after a sudden transition to ultra-slow roll can be accurately modelled using an analytical Bessel-function ansatz to identify the homogeneous growing mode. The stochastic noise found in this way is a function of the field value only. This enables us to coarse grain the inflation field at the Hubble scale and include non-linear, stochastic evolution on all super-Hubble length scales.</description>

      <title>Prevention is better than cure? Feedback from high specific energy winds in cosmological simulations with Arkenstone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We deploy the new Arkenstone galactic wind model in cosmological simulations for the first time, allowing us to robustly resolve the evolution and impact of high specific energy winds. In a (25$\,h^{-1}\,$Mpc)$^3$ box we perform a set of numerical experiments that systematically vary the mass and energy loadings of such winds, finding that their energy content is the key parameter controlling the stellar to dark matter mass ratio. Increasing the mass loading, at fixed energy, actually results in mildly enhanced star formation, counter to prevailing wisdom but in agreement with recent analytic models. Of the simple parametrisations that we test, we find that an energy loading that scales inversely with halo mass best matches a wide range of observations, and can do so with mass loadings drastically lower than those in most previous cosmological simulations. In this scenario, much less material is ejected from the interstellar medium. Instead, winds both heat gas in the circumgalactic medium, slowing infall onto the galaxy, and also drive shocks beyond the virial radius, preventing accretion onto the halo in the first place. We have not yet tied the mass and energy loadings to high-resolution simulations (a key goal of the Learning the Universe collaboration); however, we can already report that a much lower fraction of the available supernova energy is needed in preventative galaxy regulation than required by ejective wind feedback models such as IllustrisTNG.</description>

      <title>On statistical signatures of ISM turbulence in dust polarization maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13244v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present results from a high-resolution interstellar turbulence simulation and show that it closely reproduces recent $Planck$ measurements. Our model captures the scaling of $EE$ and $BB$ spectra, and the $EE/BB$ ratio in the inertial range. The PDF of the dust polarization fraction is also consistent with observations. The $TE$ cross-correlation is in broad agreement with observations. This simulation provides new insights into the physical origins of the observed $E/B$ asymmetry and positive $TE$ signal, facilitating the development of advanced Galactic dust emission models for current and future CMB experiments.</description>

      <title>The Milky Way Radial Metallicity Gradient as an Equilibrium Phenomenon: Why Old Stars are Metal-Rich</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metallicities of both gas and stars decline toward large radii in spiral galaxies, a trend known as the radial metallicity gradient. We quantify the evolution of the metallicity gradient in the Milky Way as traced by APOGEE red giants with age estimates from machine learning algorithms. Stars up to ages of $\sim$9 Gyr follow a similar relation between metallicity and Galactocentric radius. This constancy challenges current models of Galactic chemical evolution, which typically predict lower metallicities for older stellar populations. Our results favor an equilibrium scenario, in which the gas-phase gradient reaches a nearly constant normalization early in the disk lifetime. Using a fiducial choice of parameters, we demonstrate that one possible origin of this behavior is an outflow that more readily ejects gas from the interstellar medium with increasing Galactocentric radius. A direct effect of the outflow is that baryons do not remain in the interstellar medium for long, which causes the ratio of star formation to accretion, $\dot{\Sigma}_\star / \dot{\Sigma}_\text{in}$, to quickly become constant. This ratio is closely related to the local equilibrium metallicity, since its numerator and denominator set the rates of metal production by stars and hydrogen gained through accretion, respectively. Building in a merger event results in a perturbation that evolves back toward the equilibrium state on $\sim$Gyr timescales. Under the equilibrium scenario, the radial metallicity gradient is not a consequence of the inside-out growth of the disk but instead reflects a trend of declining $\dot{\Sigma}_\star / \dot{\Sigma}_\text{in}$ with increasing Galactocentric radius.</description>

      <title>The Affleck-Dine Curvaton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Standard Model of particle physics does not explain the origin of the universe's baryon asymmetry or its primordial fluctuations. The Affleck-Dine mechanism is a well-motivated scenario for generating the baryon asymmetry through the post-inflationary dynamics of a complex scalar field with baryon number. The curvaton mechanism is a popular approach for producing curvature perturbations through the dynamics of a light spectator field which decays after inflation. We demonstrate that the same complex field can viably perform both roles without any modifications to the minimal realization of Affleck-Dine baryogenesis. This scenario can also accommodate appreciable levels of primordial non-Gaussianity, beyond those achievable with only a real-valued curvaton field, and may be observable with future CMB experiments.</description>

      <title>BayeSN and SALT: A Comparison of Dust Inference Across SN Ia Light-curve Models with DES5YR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13747v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We apply the probabilistic hierarchical SN Ia SED model BayeSN to analyse SALT-based simulations of SNe Ia to probe consistency between the two models. This paper is the first cross-comparison of dust inference methods using SALT and BayeSN, of great importance given the history of conflicting conclusions regarding the distributions of host galaxy dust properties between the two. Overall we find that BayeSN is able to accurately recover our simulated SALT inputs, establishing excellent consistency between the two models. When inferring dust parameters with simulated samples including non-Ia contamination, we find that our choice of photometric classifier causes a bias in the inferred dust distribution; this arises because SNe Ia heavily impacted by dust are misclassified as contaminants and excluded. We then apply BayeSN to a sample of SNe from DES5YR to jointly infer host galaxy dust distributions and intrinsic differences on either side of a `mass step' at $10^{10}$ M$\odot$. We find evidence in favour of an intrinsic contribution to the mass step and a considerably smaller difference in $R_V$ distributions than most SALT-based analyses, at most $\Delta\mu_{R_V}=0.72\pm0.26$. We also build on recent results in favour of an environmental-dependence on the secondary maximum of SNe Ia in $i$-band. Twenty days post-peak, we find a offset in intrinsic $i$-band light curve between each mass bin at a significance in excess of $3\sigma$.</description>

      <title>Particle creation from non-geodesic trajectories in multifield inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13843v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Particle production in de Sitter spacetime arises from the exponential expansion of space, rendering the Bunch-Davies vacuum perceived as a particle-containing state by late-time observers. For states defined as eigenstates of both momentum and the Hamiltonian, the Bunch-Davies vacuum exhibits a constant particle density per physical momentum. We explore particle production beyond this baseline, focusing on deviations from exact de Sitter conditions and non-gravitational interactions, such as slow-roll inflation or interactions arising from the coupling of inflation to other fields. Using Bogoliubov transformations, we calculate the number density of energy/momentum eigenstates. In single-field inflation, this density captures the observed spectral index of the primordial power spectrum, while in two-field models, it reflects the non-gravitational coupling driving background trajectory turning. We present analytical results applicable to various scenarios involving particle production from non-adiabatic processes during inflation.</description>

      <title>The Early Data Release of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.06308v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) completed its five-month Survey Validation in May 2021. Spectra of stellar and extragalactic targets from Survey Validation constitute the first major data sample from the DESI survey. This paper describes the public release of those spectra, the catalogs of derived properties, and the intermediate data products. In total, the public release includes good-quality spectral information from 466,447 objects targeted as part of the Milky Way Survey, 428,758 as part of the Bright Galaxy Survey, 227,318 as part of the Luminous Red Galaxy sample, 437,664 as part of the Emission Line Galaxy sample, and 76,079 as part of the Quasar sample. In addition, the release includes spectral information from 137,148 objects that expand the scope beyond the primary samples as part of a series of secondary programs. Here, we describe the spectral data, data quality, data products, Large-Scale Structure science catalogs, access to the data, and references that provide relevant background to using these spectra.</description>

      <title>A dark standard siren measurement of the Hubble constant following LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA O4a and previous runs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16092v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new constraint on the Hubble constant ($H_0$) from the standard dark siren method using a sample of $5$ well-covered gravitational waves (GW) alerts reported during the first part of the fourth LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA observing run and with $3$ updated standard dark sirens from third observation run in combination the previous constraints from the first three runs. Our methodology relies on the galaxy catalogue method alone. We use a Deep Learning method to derive the full probability density estimation of photometric redshifts using the Legacy Survey catalogues. We add the constraints from well localized Binary Black Hole mergers to the sample of standard dark sirens analysed in our previous work. We combine the $H_0$ posterior for $5$ new standard sirens with other $10$ previous events (using the most recent available data for the 5 novel events and updated 3 previous posteriors from O3), finding $H_0 = 70.4^{+13.6}_{-11.7}~{\rm km~s^{-1}~Mpc^{-1}}$ (68\% Confidence interval) with the catalogue method only. This result represents an improvement of $\sim 23\%$ comparing the new $15$ dark siren constrain with the previous $10$ dark siren constraint and a reduction in uncertainty of $\sim 40\%$ from the combination of $15$ dark and bright sirens compared with the GW170817 bright siren alone. The combination of dark and bright siren GW170817 with recent jet constraints yields $H_0$ of $68.0^{+4.4}_{-3.8}~{\rm km~s^{-1}~Mpc^{-1}}$, a $\sim 6\%$ precision from Standard Sirens, reducing the previous constraint uncertainty by $\sim 10\%$ .</description>

      <title>Extending MGCAMB tests of gravity to nonlinear scales</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09204v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modified Growth with {\tt CAMB} ({\tt MGCAMB}) is a patch for the Einstein-Boltzmann solver {\tt CAMB} for cosmological tests of gravity. Until now, {\tt MGCAMB} was limited to scales well-described by linear perturbation theory. In this work, we extend the framework with a phenomenological model that can capture nonlinear corrections in a broad range of modified gravity theories. The extension employs the publicly available halo model reaction code {\tt ReACT}, developed for modeling the nonlinear corrections to cosmological observables in extensions of the $\Lambda$CDM model. The nonlinear extension makes it possible to use a wider range of data from large scale structure surveys, without applying a linear scale cut. We demonstrate that, with the 3$\times$2pt Dark Energy Survey data, we achieve a stronger constraint on the linear phenomenological functions $\mu$ and $\Sigma$, after marginalzing over the additional nonlinear parameter $p_1$, compared to the case without the nonlinear extension and using a linear cut. The new version of {\tt MGCAMB} is now forked with {\tt CAMB} on GitHub allowing for compatibility with future upgrades.</description>

      <title>The dependence of halo bias on the protohalo shape alignment with the initial tidal field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11182v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a numerical evidence supporting the primordial origin of secondary halo bias even on the galactic mass scale. Analyzing the data from the IllustrisTNG 300-1 simulations, we investigate the dependence of halo bias on the degree of misalignment between the protohalo inertia and initial tidal tensors, $\tau$, measured at redshift, $z_{i}=127$. From the TNG 300-1 galactic halos in logarithmic mass range of $10.5&lt; m\equiv \log[M/(h^{-1}M_{\odot})]\le 13$ identified at $z=0,\ 0.5$ and $1$, a clear signal of $\tau$ bias is detected. For the case that $\tau$ is measured from the initial tidal field smoothed on the scale of $R_{f}/(h^{-1}\,{\rm Mpc})\lesssim 1$, the halo $\tau$ bias is found to be very similar in its tendency and amplitude to the spin bias at all of the three redshifts, if the effects of backsplash halos are properly eliminated. For the case of $R_{f}/(h^{-1}\,{\rm Mpc})=2$, the $\tau$ bias at $z=1$ turns out to behave like the age bias, diminishing rapidly in the range of $m&gt; 12$. At $z=0$ and $0.5$, however, the $\tau$ and age bias factors show large differences in their overall strengths, which is attributed to the dominant nonlinear effects that undermine the former but enhance the latter. Given these numerical results along with the previous finding that $\tau$ shares a large amount of mutual information with the formation epochs and spin parameters of galactic halos, it is concluded that the origins of halo age and spin bias must be closely linked with the primordial factor, $\tau$, and that the difference in the tendency between the two bias factors on the galactic mass scale reflects the multi-scale influence of $\tau$ on the halo secondary properties.</description>

      <title>Impact of lensing bias on the cosmological dispersion measure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06621v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The cosmological dispersion measure (DM) as a function of redshift, derived from localized fast radio bursts (FRBs), has been used as a tool for constraining the cosmic ionized fraction and cosmological parameters. For these purposes, the DM in a homogeneous cosmological model has typically been used, neglecting the inhomogeneity of matter distribution. In this study, we derive a bias in the ensemble average of the DM over many FRBs owing to gravitational lensing by the inhomogeneous matter distribution based on cosmological perturbation theory. We demonstrate that the ensemble average is $0.4 \, \%$--$1\,\%$ smaller than the DM in the corresponding homogeneous model for a source redshift of $z_{\rm s}=1$, according to recent cosmological hydrodynamic simulations of IllustrisTNG and BAHAMAS. This reduction occurs because light rays from FRBs tend to avoid high-density regions owing to lensing deflection. We also discuss another selection effect, magnification bias, where demagnified FRBs with low DMs, fainter than the detection threshold, are excluded from the observed sample, leading to a selective observation of magnified FRBs with high DMs. Lensing bias, including magnification bias, must be considered to achieve percent level accuracy in the DM--redshift relation.</description>

      <title>Axions in Andromeda: Searching for Minicluster -- Neutron Star Encounters with the Green Bank Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13060v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The QCD axion and axion-like particles are compelling candidates for galactic dark matter. Theoretically, axions can convert into photons in the presence of a strong external magnetic field, which means it is possible to search for them experimentally. One approach is to use radio telescopes with high-resolution spectrometers to look for axion-photon conversion in the magnetospheres of neutron stars. In this paper, we describe the results obtained using a novel approach where we used the Green Bank Telescope (GBT) to search for radio transients produced by collisions between neutron stars and dark matter clumps known as axion miniclusters. We used the VErsatile GBT Astronomical Spectrometer (VEGAS) and the X-band receiver (8 to 10 GHz) to observe the core of Andromeda. Our measurements are sensitive to axions with masses between 33 and 42 $\mu$eV with $\Delta$$m_a$ = 3.8$\times10^{-4}$ $\mu$eV. This paper gives a description of the search method we developed, including observation and analysis strategies. Given our analysis algorithm choices and the instrument sensitivity ($\sim$2 mJy in each spectral channel), we did not find any candidate signals greater than 5$\sigma$. We are currently implementing this search method in other spectral bands.</description>

      <title>Evolving Dark Energy or Supernovae Systematics?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07175v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent results from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) collaboration have been interpreted as evidence for evolving dark energy. However, this interpretation is strongly dependent on which Type Ia supernova (SN) sample is combined with DESI measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) and observations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation. The strength of the evidence for evolving dark energy ranges from ~3.9 sigma for the Dark Energy 5 year (DES5Y) SN sample to ~ 2.5 sigma for the Pantheon+ sample. Here I compare SN common to both the DES5Y and Pantheon+ compilations finding evidence for an offset of ~0.04 mag. between low and high redshifts. Correcting for this offset brings the DES5Y sample into very good agreement with the Planck LCDM cosmology. Given that most of the parameter range favoured by the uncorrected DES5Y sample is discrepant with many other cosmological datasets, I conclude that the evidence for evolving dark energy is most likely a result of systematics in the DES5Y sample.</description>

      <title>Diffuse Ultra-High-Energy Gamma-Ray Emission From TeV Halos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.00051v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The LHAASO Collaboration has recently reported a measurement of the diffuse gamma-ray emission from the Galactic Plane at energies between 10 TeV and 1 PeV. While this emission is brighter than that expected from cosmic-ray interactions in the interstellar medium alone, we show that the intensity, spectrum, and morphology of this excess are in good agreement with that predicted from the "TeV halos" which surround the Milky Way's pulsar population. These results support the conclusion that TeV halos dominate the ultra-high-energy sky, and that these objects convert $\sim 5\%$ of their total spindown power into very-high and ultra-high-energy photons.</description>

      <title>Direct detection of light dark matter charged under a $L_{\mu} - L_{\tau}$ symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03090v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A possible extension of the Standard Model able to explain the recent measurement of the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon consists in adding a gauged $U(1)_{L_{\mu}-L_{\tau}}$ symmetry. If the dark matter particle is charged under this symmetry, the kinetic mixing between the new gauge boson and the photon induces dark matter-electron interactions. We derive direct detection constraints on light dark matter charged under a $U(1)_{L_{\mu}-L_{\tau}}$ symmetry with electron recoil experiments, and explore prospects with XLZD and OSCURA to close in the parameter space able to explain simultaneously the recent measurement on the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon and the observed relic density of dark matter. We further discuss the spin-dependent scattering contribution arising in this model, which was ignored previously in the literature.</description>

      <title>Comparing sampling techniques to chart parameter space of 21 cm Global signal with Artificial Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15832v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the first billion years of the universe requires studying two critical epochs: the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) and Cosmic Dawn (CD). However, due to limited data, the properties of the Intergalactic Medium (IGM) during these periods remain poorly understood, leading to a vast parameter space for the global 21cm signal. Training an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) with a narrowly defined parameter space can result in biased inferences. To mitigate this, the training dataset must be uniformly drawn from the entire parameter space to cover all possible signal realizations. However, drawing all possible realizations is computationally challenging, necessitating the sampling of a representative subset of this space. This study aims to identify optimal sampling techniques for the extensive dimensionality and volume of the 21cm signal parameter space. The optimally sampled training set will be used to train the ANN to infer from the global signal experiment. We investigate three sampling techniques: random, Latin hypercube (stratified), and Hammersley sequence (quasi-Monte Carlo) sampling, and compare their outcomes. Our findings reveal that sufficient samples must be drawn for robust and accurate ANN model training, regardless of the sampling technique employed. The required sample size depends primarily on two factors: the complexity of the data and the number of free parameters. More free parameters necessitate drawing more realizations. Among the sampling techniques utilized, we find that ANN models trained with Hammersley sequence sampling demonstrate greater robustness compared to those trained with Latin hypercube and Random sampling.</description>

      <title>Evolution of coupled scalar perturbations through smooth reheating. I. Dissipative regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17074v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: If the inflaton is a heavy scalar field, it may equilibrate slower than some other degrees of freedom, e.g. non-Abelian gauge bosons. In this case, perturbations in the inflaton field and in a thermal plasma coexist from a given moment onwards. We derive a gauge-invariant set of three coupled equations governing the time evolution of such a system. Despite singular coefficients, a reliable numerical solution can be obtained for a long time period, starting from phase oscillations inside the Hubble horizon, and extending until acoustic oscillations in a radiation-dominated universe. Benchmarks are illustrated from a "weak regime", where perturbations have a quantum-mechanical origin but get dissipated by interactions with the plasma. Among applications of our formalism could be inhomogeneity-induced nucleations in post-inflationary phase transitions, and the production of scalar-induced gravitational waves.</description>
