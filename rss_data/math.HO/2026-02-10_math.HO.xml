      <title>Three Approaches to the Problem of Double Discontinuity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The gap between high school and university level mathematics has long been deemed problematic. Felix Klein referred to this gap as the ''double discontinuity'' meaning that students come to university unprepared for university courses and university level courses do not adequately prepare students to teach. In this paper we look at three possible solutions to the problem. The first, from Klein himself, involving logarithms, the second from Paul and Judith Sally involving lattice geometry, and the third from Dick Stanley involving an investigation of the box problem from high school calculus. We see that the first two examples proceed upon a vertical trajectory while the third example proceeds horizontally. This difference is key to reframing the century long debate about the ''double discontinuity''.</description>

      <title>Some Patterns of Research in Mathematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We partially update Grossman's 2005 survey of patterns in mathematical research using a sample of 401 mathematicians from MathSciNet. The mathematical landscape has changed substantially: single-paper authors have reduced from $43$ \% to $32$ \%, collaboration has intensified, more mathematicians have greater breadth of research areas, and the giant component of the co-authorship network has grown denser, with median Erd\H{o}s number dropping from $5$ to $4$. The data reveals the profession as markedly more collaborative, particularly among younger generations, although the tail of high productivity has also grown more extreme.</description>

      <title>Johann Heinrich Lambert's memoir "Theorie der Parallellinien": A review with commentary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review the memoir \emph{heorie der Parallellinien} by Johann Heinrich Lambert, written in 1766. Lambert, a victim of the prejudices of his time, conceived this memoir as an attempt to prove the so-called parallel postulate of Euclid's \emph{Elements}, and consequently, the non-existence of the geometry that we now call hyperbolic geometry. In fact, by developing the foundations of a geometry obtained by replacing the parallel postulate with its negation while keeping Euclid's other postulates unchanged, Lambert was hoping to arrive at a contradiction. Of course, he failed in his endeavor, but these attempts at proving the parallel postulate implicitly contain, without Lambert having foreseen it, fundamental results of hyperbolic geometry, the discovery of which, by Lobachevsky, Bolyai and Gauss, was not to take place until the following century. Thus, Lambert's memoir (which he did not intend to publish but which was eventually published in 1895) constitutes one of the founding texts of non-Euclidean geometry. Spherical geometry is one of the three geometries of constant curvature, the other two being Euclidean geometry and hyperbolic geometry. In this sense, along with hyperbolic geometry, spherical geometry constitutes one of the two non-Euclidean geometries. In fact, Lambert, like Lobachevsky and others after him, understood the deep relationships between the three geometries: Euclidean, spherical, and hyperbolic, in particular the formal and the more profound analogies between the trigonometric formulae, the properties of birectangular isosceles quadrilaterals and of trirectangular quadrilaterals, the monotonicity properties (which can be formulated in terms of convexity properties) which hold in opposite senses in spherical and hyperbolic geometry which at some points he calls a sphere of imaginary radius. It is for these reasons that we decided to include in this volume, dedicated to spherical geometry, a chapter on this important memoir by Lambert, trying to highlight its most important ideas. This paper will appear as a chapter in the book ``Spherical Geometry in the Eighteenth Century I: Euler, Lagrange and Lambert'', ed. R. Caddeo and A. Papadopoulos, Springer Nature Switzerland, 2026.</description>
