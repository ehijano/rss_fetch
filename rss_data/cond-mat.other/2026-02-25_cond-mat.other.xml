      <title>Transient Plastic Spin Labeling with Chlorine Dioxide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plastic waste, being one of the most important problems for humankind, poses severe threats to ecosystems, wildlife, and human health. Tracing, quantifying, and identifying types of plastic waste is of crucial importance to understand its environmental pathways and develop targeted strategies for reduction, recycling, and remediation. To contribute to addressing this global issue, we investigated the spin-labeling capabilities of aqueous chlorine dioxide (ClO$_2$) radicals upon introduction into poly(ethylene terephthalate) and utilized electron spin resonance spectroscopy for detection. The technique is capable of identifying plastic species as the unpaired electron of the radical molecule is strongly sensitive to its local environment through its coupling parameters. Temperature-dependent measurements revealed that the molecules are immobilized at low temperatures and exhibit well-resolved anisotropic and hyperfine spectra that are quantitatively described by a model spin Hamiltonian. Even above the melting point of water, some degrees of freedom remain blocked as a result of the polymer matrix. Furthermore, employing a time-series measurement at room temperature enabled us to determine the diffusion coefficient of the molecule in the polymer.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Lattice Disorder and Collective Dipole Coupling Give Rise to Dicke Physics in Perovskite Quantum Dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Halide perovskite quantum dots exhibit cooperative optical phenomena that are absent in conventional semiconductor nanocrystals, including exciton superradiance, superabsorption, and biexciton superradiance within individual dots. Here we develop a microscopic theory that identifies the physical origin of these Dicke effects and establishes how they can be controlled by materials parameters. The central result is that cooperative emission emerges from a competition between collective coupling of optical transition dipoles and lattice-induced disorder, with the balance governed by the Raman-derived phonon spectral density and the excitonic oscillator strength. At elevated temperature, strong Fr\"ohlich coupling and glassy lattice dynamics produce dynamic disorder that suppresses dipole synchronization and yields incoherent emission. Upon cooling, lattice fluctuations freeze and cooperative coherence emerges when the collective coupling exceeds residual static disorder, defining size- and composition-dependent crossover temperatures that we map as phase diagrams. Extending the framework to biexcitons, we show that a confined biexciton constitutes a single correlated charge distribution dressed by a shared lattice configuration, enabling pathway-indistinguishable decay and cooperative radiative enhancement. The theory quantitatively accounts for observed size, composition, and temperature trends in radiative-rate constant ratios and biexciton binding energies, while explaining why full Dicke saturation is not universal. More broadly, the results establish Raman spectral weight and oscillator strength as design parameters for engineering cooperative quantum-optical behavior in quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Generative Deep Learning for the Two-Dimensional Quantum Rotor Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advancement of diverse generative deep learning models and their variants has furnished substantial insights for investigating quantum many-body problems. In this work, we design two models based on the foundational architecture of generative adversarial networks (GANs) to investigate the ground-state properties and phase transition characteristics of the two-dimensional quantum rotor model (QRM). Within a semi-supervised learning framework, we incorporate multiple layers of transposed convolutions in the generator, enabling the conditional GAN to more efficiently extract low-dimensional encoded information. Analysis of one-dimensional latent variables associated with ground-state samples for different system sizes allows us to pinpoint the location of the critical point. In addition, we introduce dynamically adaptive weighting factors related to the distributional characteristics into the loss function of the deep convolutional GAN, and utilize upsampling techniques to enlarge the generated sample sizes. Comparisons of the optimization processes for mean magnetization and potential energy density across different magnetization regimes of QRM demonstrate that our model can efficiently generate valid ground-state samples, significantly reducing computational time. Our results highlight the promising potential of generative deep learning in quantum phase transition research, especially in critical point identification and the auxiliary generation of simulation data for quantum many-body models.</description>

      <title>Anomalous temperature dependence of the electrical resistivity in R$_3$Co$_4$Ge$_{13}$ (R = Y, Lu) single crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The presence of strong disorder can significantly impact electrical conduction in metallic systems. Here, we investigate the temperature dependence of the electrical resistivity, $\rho(T)$, in nonmagnetic single crystals of the Remeika-phase cage compounds R$_3$Co$_4$Ge$_{13}$ (R = Y, Lu). Contrary to the density of states (DOS) calculations in the literature, the experimentally measured $\rho(T)$ in both compounds exhibits semiconducting-like behavior, which we attribute to the strong structural disorder due to its unique crystal structure and low carrier-density. A detailed analysis of the electrical resistivity data reveals that neither the Arrhenius thermal activation law nor variable-range hopping (VRH) models can adequately describe their temperature dependence over the broad temperature range of 2-350 K. However, a model incorporating parallel conduction through both semiconducting and metallic channels provides an adequate explanation. In addition to a dominant metallic conduction below $\sim 10$~K, a negative temperature coefficient of the electrical resistivity ($d\rho/dT$) is found in both samples. In the absence of magnetic impurities, the observed $d\rho/dT &lt; 0$ is interpreted in terms of the structural Kondo mechanism.</description>
