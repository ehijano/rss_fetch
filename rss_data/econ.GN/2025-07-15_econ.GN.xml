      <title>Central Bank Digital Currencies: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the advancement of digital payment technologies, central banks worldwide have increasingly begun to explore the implementation of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs). This paper presents a comprehensive review of the latest developments in CBDC system design and implementation. By analyzing 135 research papers published between 2018 and 2025, the study provides an in-depth examination of CBDC design taxonomy and ecosystem frameworks. Grounded in the CBDC Design Pyramid, the paper refines and expands key architectural elements by thoroughly investigating innovations in ledger technologies, the selection of consensus mechanisms, and challenges associated with offline payments and digital wallet integration. Furthermore, it conceptualizes a CBDC ecosystem. A detailed comparative analysis of 26 existing CBDC systems is conducted across four dimensions: system architecture, ledger technology, access model, and application domain. The findings reveal that the most common configuration consists of a two-tier architecture, distributed ledger technology (DLT), and a token-based access model. However, no dominant trend has emerged regarding application domains. Notably, recent research shows a growing focus on leveraging CBDCs for cross-border payments to resolve inefficiencies and structural delays in current systems. Finally, the paper offers several forward-looking recommendations for future research.</description>

      <title>Comrades and Cause: Peer Influence on West Point Cadets' Civil War Allegiances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Do social networks and peer influence shape major life decisions in highly polarized settings? We explore this question by examining how peers influenced the allegiances of West Point cadets during the American Civil War. Leveraging quasi-random variations in the proportion of cadets from Free States, we analyze how these differences affected decisions about which army to join. We find that a higher proportion of classmates from Free States significantly increased the likelihood that cadets from Slave States joined the Union Army, while almost all cadets from Free States joined the Union Army (if they decided to join the war). We further examine how cadets' decisions affected their military rank and career outcomes. Our findings highlight that peers still influence choices even when they are life-altering and occur during periods of extreme polarization.</description>

      <title>Integrated Warehouse Location and Inventory Decisions in a Multi-location Newsvendor Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a supply chain network with a supplier and multiple retailers. The supplier can either take orders from retailers directly, or choose to build a warehouse somewhere in the network to centralize the ordering from retailers. Meanwhile, we take three modes of transportation cost into account, including distance-dependent, quantity-dependent, and distance-quantity-dependent costs, to formulate six models. For the three decentralized models, we provide closed-form solutions to compute the optimal order quantity of each retailer. For the centralized models, we develop closed-form solutions for the first two models as the transportation cost only depends on either distance or order quantity; but when it depends on both, the model becomes a non-linear programming problem. We develop a solution algorithm named Q-search to find a high-quality solution that includes the order quantity and the warehouse location. The experiment results show that the centralized model outperforms the decentralized model in large networks in terms of profit and service level.</description>

      <title>Selective Newsvendor Problem with Dependent Leadtime and Joint Marketing Decisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a joint decision-making pattern for a two-stage supply chain network, including a supplier, a company, and its customers. We investigate two types of demand patterns, associated with dependent lead time and service level considerations. We define two novel models, including all-or-nothing selective newsvendor problem (AON-SNP) and selective news Vendor Problem with Dependent Lead Time and Price Related Demands (DLSNP). The proposed models are applicable to numerous areas such as the fashion, furniture, and electronic industries. We develop an efficient solution algorithm, referred to as R-search, to identify an optimal solution for the DL-selectivity problem. We examine various responses of the system through parameter sensitivity analysis. Our model proves that if the total demand is lower than the upper limit of the order quantity, the best strategy for Q is to match that demand. If the market increases, more demand comes in, leading to a shortage, and forcing the company to find other local suppliers to fill the additional demand. The results demonstrate that our model well explains various behavior for all involved parties in the network, and provide guidance on intelligent decision making for the company.</description>

      <title>The Effects of Flipped Classrooms in Higher Education: A Causal Machine Learning Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study uses double/debiased machine learning to evaluate the impact of transitioning from lecture-based blended teaching to a flipped classroom concept in a cohort comparison of a large compulsory introductory statistics course at a German tuition-free university. Our findings indicate positive changes in students' self-conception and a reduction in procrastination behaviors. However, we also observe a decline in the enjoyment of classroom sessions. Contrary to theoretical expectations, we do not find significant positive effects on exam scores, passing rates, or knowledge retention. Unlike most studies, however, we can leverage detailed usage data from the flipped cohort, including the timeliness and completeness of pre-class video watching, as well as quiz participation patterns, to check how well students implemented each part of the curriculum. Our findings suggest that, on average, students in the flipped cohort implemented the instructional approach insufficiently, explaining the mechanism of our null results in exam performance and knowledge retention. This highlights the need for additional strategies to ensure that students actually benefit from a flipped curriculum.</description>

      <title>The Green Premium Puzzle: Empirical Evidence from Climate-Friendly Food Products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates whether climate-friendly food products command a price premium in consumer markets. Using product-level data from a supermarket in Sweden, we examine the relationship between front-of-package climate impact scores and retail prices, controlling for product size, nutritional content, and fixed effects. Contrary to the intuitive expectation of a positive green premium, we find no evidence that climate-friendly products are priced higher. In some product categories, products with better climate scores are in fact associated with lower prices, suggesting a negative premium, an outcome that gives rise to what we refer to as the green premium puzzle. We argue that market frictions such as competing consumer priorities, psychological distance from climate issues, and skepticism toward environmental labeling may suppress the price signals intended to reward sustainable consumption. These findings offer important insights for producers, retailers, and policymakers seeking to align climate goals with effective market incentives in the transition toward a more sustainable society.</description>

      <title>Intimate partner violence and women's economic preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One in three women globally experiences intimate partner violence (IPV), yet little is known about how such trauma affects economic decision-making. We provide causal evidence that IPV influences women's time preferences - a key parameter in models of savings, investment, and labor supply. We combine two empirical strategies using four distinct datasets. First, in two randomized recall experiments in Ethiopia, we randomly assigned women to recall specific acts of abuse before eliciting their intertemporal choices. Women with IPV experiences prompted to recall IPV display significantly greater impatience than otherwise similar women who are not prompted. Second, we exploit exogenous reductions in IPV generated by two randomized interventions - one involving cash transfers, the other psychotherapy - and use treatment assignment as an instrument for IPV exposure. Women who experience reduced IPV as a result of treatment exhibit more patient time preferences. Together, these results provide consistent, novel causal evidence that exposure to IPV induces individuals to discount the future more heavily. This evidence suggests a psychological channel through which violence can perpetuate economic disadvantage and constrain women's ability to take actions - such as saving, investing, or exiting abusive relationships - that require planning over time.</description>

      <title>What Matters Most? A Quantitative Meta-Analysis of AI-Based Predictors for Startup Success</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09675v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Background: Predicting startup success with machine learning is a rapidly growing field, yet findings on key predictors are often fragmented and context-specific. This makes it difficult to discern robust patterns and highlights a need for a systematic synthesis of the evidence.
  Methods: This study conducts a quantitative meta-analysis to synthesize the literature on predictor importance in AI-based startup evaluation. We performed a systematic review to identify a final sample of 13 empirical studies that report rankable feature importance. From these papers, we extracted and categorized 58 unique predictors, synthesizing their importance using a Weighted Importance Score (WIS) that balances a feature's average rank with its frequency of appearance. We also conducted a moderator analysis to investigate how predictor importance changes with context (e.g., success definition).
  Results: Our aggregate analysis reveals that the most consistently powerful predictors are a quartet of foundational attributes: Firm Characteristics (e.g., age, location), Investor Structure (e.g., investor quality), Digital and Social Traction (e.g., online momentum), and Funding History. The moderator analysis further reveals that this hierarchy is highly context-dependent. For instance, predicting near-term funding milestones elevates the importance of the deal's immediate context, while predicting long-term exits prioritizes fundamental firm and investor characteristics.
  Conclusion: The factors that best predict startup success are not universal but are contingent on the startup's goals, stage, and the data used for evaluation. Our findings point to a potential "convenience bias" in the literature, where predictor importance may be tied to data accessibility. We conclude by underscoring the need for standardized reporting practices to enable more robust, cumulative knowledge building in the field.</description>

      <title>A New Incentive Model For Content Trust</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper outlines an incentive-driven and decentralized approach to verifying the veracity of digital content at scale. Widespread misinformation, an explosion in AI-generated content and reduced reliance on traditional news sources demands a new approach for content authenticity and truth-seeking that is fit for a modern, digital world. By using smart contracts and digital identity to incorporate 'trust' into the reward function for published content, not just engagement, we believe that it could be possible to foster a self-propelling paradigm shift to combat misinformation through a community-based governance model. The approach described in this paper requires that content creators stake financial collateral on factual claims for an impartial jury to vet with a financial reward for contribution. We hypothesize that with the right financial and social incentive model users will be motivated to participate in crowdsourced fact-checking and content creators will place more care in their attestations. This is an exploratory paper and there are a number of open issues and questions that warrant further analysis and exploration.</description>

      <title>Analyzing the Crowding-Out Effect of Investment Herding on Consumption: An Optimal Control Theory Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Investment herding, a phenomenon where households mimic the decisions of others rather than relying on their own analysis, has significant effects on financial markets and household behavior. Excessive investment herding may reduce investments and lead to a depletion of household consumption, which is called the crowding-out effect. While existing research has qualitatively examined the impact of investment herding on consumption, quantitative studies in this area remain limited. In this work, we investigate the optimal investment and consumption decisions of households under the impact of investment herding. We formulate an optimization problem to model how investment herding influences household decisions over time. Based on the optimal control theory, we solve for the analytical solutions of optimal investment and consumption decisions. We theoretically analyze the impact of investment herding on household consumption decisions and demonstrate the existence of the crowding-out effect. We further explore how parameters, such as interest rate, excess return rate, and volatility, influence the crowding-out effect. Finally, we conduct a real data test to validate our theoretical analysis of the crowding-out effect. This study is crucial to understanding the impact of investment herding on household consumption and offering valuable insights for policymakers seeking to stimulate consumption and mitigate the negative effects of investment herding on economic growth.</description>

      <title>Estimation and Testing of Forecast Rationality with Many Moments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.09481v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We in this paper utilize P-GMM (Cheng and Liao, 2015) moment selection procedure to select valid and relevant moments for estimating and testing forecast rationality under the flexible loss proposed by Elliott et al. (2005). We motivate the moment selection in a large dimensional setting, explain the fundamental mechanism of P-GMM moment selection procedure, and elucidate how to implement it in the context of forecast rationality by allowing the existence of potentially invalid moment conditions. A set of Monte Carlo simulations is conducted to examine the finite sample performance of P-GMM estimation in integrating the information available in instruments into both the estimation and testing, and a real data analysis using data from the Survey of Professional Forecasters issued by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia is presented to further illustrate the practical value of the suggested methodology. The results indicate that the P-GMM post-selection estimator of forecaster's attitude is comparable to the oracle estimator by using the available information efficiently. The accompanying power of rationality and symmetry tests utilizing P-GMM estimation would be substantially increased through reducing the influence of uninformative instruments. When a forecast user estimates and tests for rationality of forecasts that have been produced by others such as Greenbook, P-GMM moment selection procedure can assist in achieving consistent and more efficient outcomes.</description>

      <title>Most Swiss-system tournaments are unfair: Evidence from chess</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19333v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Swiss-system is an increasingly popular tournament format as it provides an attractive trade-off between the number of matches and ranking accuracy. However, few research consider the optimal design of Swiss-system tournaments. We contribute to this topic by empirically investigating the fairness of 52 Swiss-system chess competitions containing an odd (9 or 11) number of rounds, where about half of the players have an extra game with the white pieces. It is verified that they often enjoy a significant advantage: they are expected to score more points and have higher chances of performing above certain thresholds. A potential solution could be to organise Swiss-system tournaments with an even number of rounds and guarantee a balanced colour assignment for all players using a recently proposed pairing mechanism.</description>

      <title>Modelling reliability under deep decarbonisation of the European electricity grid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23604v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new model able to characterise the relative costs of low-carbon generation mixes when subject to varying grid-reliability targets, which are evaluated using 43 years of historical weather data. The model can be used to develop cost-minimising strategies, and to assess the extent, duration, and frequency of outages under different technology mixes. For a 35-country subset of the European electricity grid, we show that reliably meeting the last 1% of demand accounts for about 36% of the entire system cost when only onshore wind, solar, and storage are used in the generation mix. We also show that by including small amounts of low-cost, dispatchable load-following generation (e.g., natural gas, hydro, or similar) the cost of a reliable, high-renewables grid can be drastically reduced. For example, the system cost can be reduced by 31% when just 1% of generation is allowed to come from natural gas.</description>

      <title>The Japanese Personnel Inquiry Records (PIR): Elite, Adoption, Family Composition in the 1900s</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18788v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a newly constructed individual-level dataset of prewar Japanese elites using the "Who's Who" directories published in 1903-1939. Covering approximately the top 0.1% of the population, the dataset contains rich information on social origin, education, occupation, and family structure. By reconstructing intergenerational links and family networks, we provide descriptive evidence on elite formation and persistence across geography, social groups, and education during institutional transitions. The dataset provides a foundational empirical resource for studying elite reproduction, intergenerational and intergroup mobility, and institutional development during Japan's transition to a modern society.</description>

Abstract: This paper establishes geopolitical relations as a first-order determinant of economic growth. We construct a novel event-based measure of bilateral geopolitical alignment by employing large language models with web search capabilities to analyze over 440,000 political events across 196 countries from 1960--2019. This comprehensive measure enables us to identify the precise timing and magnitude of geopolitical shifts within countries over time. Using local projections with country fixed effects, we find that a one-standard-deviation improvement in geopolitical relations increases GDP per capita by 9.6 log points over 25 years. These persistent effects operate through multiple reinforcing channels -- enhanced political stability, increased investment, expanded trade, and productivity gains. Across our sample, geopolitical factors generate GDP variations ranging from -35% to +30%, with developing nations facing particularly severe penalties from international isolation. Our findings reveal how geopolitical alignment shapes economic prosperity in an increasingly fragmented global economy.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we review modern approaches to building interpretable models of property markets using machine learning on the base of mass valuation of property in the Primorye region, Russia. The researcher, lacking expertise in this topic, encounters numerous difficulties in the effort to build a good model. The main source of this is the huge difference between noisy real market data and ideal data which is very common in all types of tutorials on machine learning. This paper covers all stages of modeling: the collection of initial data, identification of outliers, the search and analysis of patterns in the data, the formation and final choice of price factors, the building of the model, and the evaluation of its efficiency. For each stage, we highlight potential issues and describe sound methods for overcoming emerging difficulties on actual examples. We show that the combination of classical linear regression with interpolation methods of geostatistics allows to build an effective model for land parcels. For flats, when many objects are attributed to one spatial point the application of geostatistical methods is difficult. Therefore we suggest linear regression with automatic generation and selection of additional rules on the base of decision trees, so called the RuleFit method. Thus we show, that despite such a strong restriction as the requirement of interpretability which is important in practical aspects, for example, legal matters, it is still possible to build effective models of real property markets.</description>
