      <title>Normalized solutions for nonhomogeneous Chern-Simons-Schr\"odinger equations with critical exponential growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the existence of normalized solutions for the following Chern-Simons-Schr\"odinger equation: \begin{equation*}
  \left\{
  \begin{array}{ll}
  -\Delta u+\lambda u+\left(\frac{h^{2}(\vert x\vert)}{\vert x\vert^{2}}+\int_{\vert x\vert}^{\infty}\frac{h(s)}{s}u^{2}(s)\mathrm{d}s\right)u
  =\left(e^{u^2}-1\right)u+g(x), &amp; x\in \R^2,
  u\in H_r^1(\R^2),\ \int_{\R^2}u^2\mathrm{d}x=c,
  \end{array}
  \right.
  \end{equation*}
  where $c&gt;0$, $\lambda\in \R$ acts as a Lagrange multiplier and $g\in \mathcal {C}(\mathbb{R}^2,[0,+\infty))$ satisfies suitable assumptions. In addition to the loss of compactness caused by the nonlinearity with critical exponential growth, the intricate interactions among it, the nonlocal term, and the nonhomogeneous term significantly affect the geometric structure of the constrained functional, thereby making this research particularly challenging. By specifying explicit conditions on $c$, we subtly establish a structure of local minima of the constrained functional. Based on the structure, we employ new analytical techniques to prove the existence of two solutions: one being a local minimizer and one of mountain-pass type. Our results are entirely new, even for the Schr\"odinger equation that is when nonlocal terms are absent. We believe our methods may be adapted and modified to deal with more constrained problems with nonhomogeneous perturbation.</description>

      <title>Nonhomogeneous div-curl type estimates for system of complex vector fields on local Hardy spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present a nonhomogeneous version of the classical div-curl type estimates in the setup of elliptic system of complex vector fields with constant coefficients on local Hardy space $h^1$. As an application, we obtain a decomposition of the local $bmo$ space via a family of vector fields depending on div-curl terms.</description>

      <title>Regularity and classification of the free boundary for a Monge-Amp\`ere obstacle problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study convex solutions to the Monge-Amp\`ere obstacle problem \[ \operatorname{det} D^2 v=g v^q\chi_{\{v&gt;0\}}, \quad v \geq 0, \] where $q \in [0,n)$ is a constant and $g$ is a bounded positive function. This problem emerges from the $L_p$ Minkowski problem. We establish $C^{1, \alpha}$ regularity for the strictly convex part of the free boundary $\partial\{v=0\}$. Furthermore, when $g \in C^{\alpha}$, we prove a Schauder-type estimate. As a consequence, when $g\equiv 1$, we obtain a Liouville theorem for entire solutions with unbounded coincidence sets $\{v=0\}$. Combined with existing results, this provides a complete classification of entire solutions for the case $q=0$.</description>

      <title>On the uniqueness of the quasi-geostrophic equation with the fractional Laplacian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the uniqueness of the solution of the surface quasi-geostrophic equation with fractional Laplacian. We show that the uniqueness holds in non-homogeneous Besov spaces without any additional assumption which is supposed to constract solutions. When the power of the fractional Laplacian is close to 2, we prove that the uniqueness with the regularity index $s=-1/2$. We extract the least regularity $s=-1/2$ for the well-definedness of the nonlinear term of the equation.</description>

      <title>On a phase field model for binary mixtures of micropolar fluids with non-matched densities and moving contact lines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new phase field model for binary mixtures of incompressible micropolar fluids, which are among the simplest categories of fluids exhibiting internal rotations. The model fulfils local and global dissipation inequalities so that thermodynamic consistency is guaranteed. Our model consists of a Navier--Stokes--Cahn--Hilliard system for the fluid velocity, pressure, phase field variable and chemical potential, coupled to an additional system of Navier--Stokes type for the micro-rotation. Our model accounts for non-matched densities as well as moving contact line dynamics, and serve as a generalisation to earlier models for binary fluid flows based on a volume averaged velocity formulation. We also establish the existence of global weak solutions in three spatial dimensions for the model equipped with singular logarithmic and double obstacle potentials.</description>

      <title>A decomposition lemma in convex integration via classical algebraic geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a decomposition lemma that allows error terms to be expressed using fewer primitive matrices than $\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$ within the convex integration scheme of constructing flexible $C^{1,\alpha}$ solutions to a system of nonlinear PDEs in dimension $n\geq 2$, which can be viewed as a kind of truncation of the codimension one local isometric embedding equation in Nash-Kuiper Theorem. This leads to flexible solutions with higher H\"older regularity, and consequently, improved very weak solutions to certain induced equations for any $n$, including Monge-Amp\`ere systems and $2$-Hessian systems. The H\"older exponent of the solutions can be taken as any $\alpha &lt;(n^2+1)^{-1}$ for $n=2,4,8,16$, and any $\alpha&lt;(n^2+n-2\rho(\frac{n}{2})-1)^{-1}$ for other $n$, thereby improving the previously known bound $\alpha&lt;(n^2+n+1)^{-1}$ for $n\geq 3$. Here, $\rho(n)$ is the Radon-Hurwitz number, which exhibits an $8$-fold periodicity on $n$ that is related to Bott periodicity.
  Our arguments involve novel applications of several results from algebraic geometry and topology, including Adams' theorem on maximum linearly independent vector fields on spheres, the intersection of projective varieties, and projective duality. We also use an elliptic method ingeniously that avoids loss of differentiability.</description>

      <title>Self-sustaining traveling fronts for a model related to bushfires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article investigates a mathematical model for bushfire propagation, focusing on the existence and properties of translating solutions. We obtain quantitative bounds on the environmental diffusion coefficient and ignition kernels, identifying conditions under which fires either propagate across the entire region or naturally extinguish.
  Our analysis also reveals that vertically translating solutions do not exist, whereas traveling wave solutions with a front moving at any prescribed velocity always exist for kernels that are either of mild intensity or short range. These traveling waves exhibit unbounded profiles.
  Although evolutionary unstable, these traveling waves demonstrate stability under perturbations localized in a small region.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.21479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a semisimple, connected, and noncompact Lie group with a finite center. We consider the Laplace-Beltrami operator $\Delta$ on the homogeneous space $G/K=S$ by a maximal compact subgroup $K$. We obtain pointwise estimates for the kernel of an oscillating function $\exp( it\sqrt{|x|}) \psi(x) $ applied to the shifted Laplacian $\Delta+|\rho|^2$, a case not available before. We obtain a polynomial decay in time of the kernel, and of the $L^{p'}-L^p$ norms of the operator, for $2&lt;p&lt;\infty$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.21492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study rigidity/flexibility properties of global solutions to the thin obstacle problem. For solutions with bounded positive sets, we give a classification in terms of their expansions at infinity. For solutions with bounded contact sets, we show that the contact sets are highly flexible and can approximate arbitrary compact sets.
  These phenomena have no counterparts in the classical obstacle problem.</description>

      <title>Long time dynamics of the Cauchy problem for the predator-prey model with cross-diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with a predator-prey model in $N$-dimensional spaces ($N=1, 2, 3$), given by \begin{align*}\left\{\begin{aligned} &amp;\frac{\partial u}{\partial t}=\Delta u-\chi\nabla\cdot(u\nabla v),\\ &amp;\frac{\partial v}{\partial t}=\Delta v+\xi\nabla\cdot(v\nabla u), \end{aligned}\right. \end{align*} which describes random movement of both predator and prey species, as well as the spatial dynamics involving predators pursuing prey and prey attempting to evade predators. It is shown that any global strong solutions of the corresponding Cauchy problem converge to zero in the sense of $L^p$-norm for any $1&lt;p\le \infty$, and also converge to the heat kernel with respect to $L^p$-norm for any $1\le p\le \infty$. In particular, the decay rate thereof is optimal in the sense that it is consistent with that of the heat equation in $\mathbb R^N$ ($N=2, 3$). Undoubtedly, the global existence of solutions appears to be among the most challenging topic in the analysis of this model.
  Indeed even in the one-dimensional setting, only global weak solutions in a bounded domain have been successfully constructed by far. Nevertheless, to provide a comprehensive understanding of the main results, we append the conclusion on the global existence and asymptotic behavior of strong solutions, although certain smallness conditions on the initial data are required.</description>

      <title>Time periodic problem of compressible Euler equations with damping on the whole space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, time periodic problem of the compressible Euler equations with damping on the whole space is studied. It is well known that in the Euler system, long-time behavior of solutions is a more delicate problem due to lack of the viscosity. By virtue of a damping effect, time global solutions barely exist. Under such circumstances, existence of a time periodic solution is obtained for sufficiently small time periodic external force when the space dimension is greater than or equal to $3$. In addition, its stability is also obtained. The solution is asymptotically stable under sufficiently small initial perturbations and the $L^\infty$ norm of the perturbation decays as time goes to infinity. The potential theoretical estimates work well on a low frequency part of solutions, while a new energy estimate with weights is established to avoid derivative loss.</description>

      <title>Optimality and stability of the radial shapes for the Sobolev trace constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we establish the optimality and the stability of the ball for the Sobolev trace operator $W^{1,p}(\Omega)\hookrightarrow L^q(\partial\Omega)$ among convex sets of prescribed perimeter for any $1&lt; p &lt;+\infty$ and $1\le q\le p$. More precisely, we prove that the trace constant $\sigma_{p,q}$ is maximal for the ball and the deficit is estimated from below by the Hausdorff asymmetry. With similar arguments, we prove the optimality and the stability of the spherical shell for the Sobolev exterior trace operator $W^{1,p}(\Omega_0\setminus\overline{\Theta})\hookrightarrow L^q(\partial\Omega_0)$ among open sets obtained removing from a convex set $\Omega_0$ a suitably smooth open hole $\Theta\subset\subset\Omega_0$, with $\Omega_0\setminus\overline{\Theta}$ satisfying a volume and an outer perimeter constraint.</description>

      <title>ODE and PDE models for COVID-19, with reinfection and vaccination process for Cameroon and Germany</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goal of this work is to develop and analyze a reaction-diffusion model for the transmission dynamics of the Coronavirus (COVID-19) that accounts for reinfection and vaccination, as well as to compare it to the ODE model. After developing a time-dependent ODE model, we calculate the control reproduction number $\mathcal{R}_c$ and demonstrate the global stability of the COVID-19 free equilibrium for $\mathcal{R}_c&lt;1$. We also show that when $\mathcal{R}_c&gt;1$, the free equilibrium of COVID-19 becomes unstable and co-exists with at least one endemic equilibrium point. We then used data from Germany and Cameroon to calibrate our model and estimate some of its characteristics. We find $\mathcal{R}_c\approx 1.13$ for Germany and $\mathcal R_c \approx 1.2554$ for Cameroon, indicating that the disease persists in both populations. Following that, we modify the prior model into a reaction-diffusion PDE model to account for spatial mobility. We show that the solutions to the final initial value boundary problem (IVBP) exist and are nonnegative and unique. We also show that the disease-free equilibrium is stable locally, and globally when $\mathcal{R}_c&lt;1$. In contrast, when $\mathcal{R}_c&gt;1$, the DFE is unstable and coexists with at least one endemic equilibrium point. We ran multiple numerical simulations to validate our theoretical predictions. We then compare the ODE and the PDE models.</description>

      <title>On the justification of Koiter's model for elliptic membranes subjected to an interior normal compliance contact condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is twofold. First, we rigorously justify Koiter's model for linearly elastic elliptic membrane shells in the case where the shell is subject to a geometrical constraint modelled via a normal compliance contact condition defined in the interior of the shell. To achieve this, we establish a novel density result for non-empty, closed, and convex subsets of Lebesgue spaces, which are applicable to cases not covered by the ``density property'' established in [Ciarlet, Mardare \&amp; Piersanti, \emph{Math. Mech. Solids}, 2019].
  Second, we demonstrate that the solution to the two-dimensional obstacle problem for linearly elastic elliptic membrane shells, subjected to the interior normal compliance contact condition, exhibits higher regularity throughout its entire definition domain. A key feature of this result is that, while the transverse component of the solution is, in general, only of class $L^2$ and its trace is \emph{a priori} undefined, the methodology proposed here, partially based on [Ciarlet \&amp; Sanchez-Palencia, \emph{J. Math. Pures Appl.}, 1996], enables us to rigorously establish the well-posedness of the trace for the transverse component of the solution by means of an \emph{ad hoc} formula.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.21729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present paper, we study the diffusion limit of the strong solution to the one-species Vlasov-Maxwell-Boltzmann (VMB) system with initial data near a global Maxwellian. Based on spectral analysis techniques, we prove the convergence and establish the convergence rate of the classical solution to the VMB system towards the solution to the incompressible Navier--Stokes--Maxwell system with a precise estimation on the initial layer.</description>

      <title>Steklov eigenvalues of nearly circular area-normalized domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider Steklov eigenvalues of nearly circular domains in $\R^{2}$ of fixed unitary area. In \cite{viator2018}, the authors treated such domains as perturbations of the disk, and they computed the first-order term of the asymptotic expansions of the Steklov eigenvalues for reflection-symmetric perturbations; here, we expand these first-order results beyond reflection-symmetry. We also recover the second-order asymptotic expansions, which enable us to prove that no Steklov eigenvalue beyond the first positive one is locally shape-optimized by the disk.</description>

      <title>Existence of Large Boundary Layer Solutions to Inflow Problem of 1D Full Compressible Navier-Stokes Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the existence/non-existence criteria for large-amplitude boundary layer solutions to the inflow problem of the one-dimensional (1D) full compressible Navier-Stokes equations on a half line $\mathbb{R}_+$. Instead of the classical center manifold approach for the existence of small-amplitude boundary layer solutions in the previous results, the delicate global phase plane analysis, based on the qualitative theory of ODEs, is utilized to obtain the sufficient and necessary conditions for the existence/non-existence of large boundary layer solutions to the half-space inflow problem when the right end state belongs to the supersonic, transonic, and subsonic regions, respectively, which completely answers the existence/non-existence of boundary layer solutions to the half-space inflow problem of 1D full compressible Navier-Stokes equations.</description>

      <title>On feedback stabilisation for the Cahn-Hilliard equation and its numerical approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the stabilisation of solutions to the Cahn-Hilliard equation towards a given trajectory by means of a finite-dimensional static output feedback mechanism. Exponential stabilisation of the controlled state around the target trajectory is proven using careful energy estimates and a spectral condition which characterizes the strength of the feedback. The analysis is general enough to allow for pointwise and distributed measurements and actuation. The main results are derived via arguments that carry over to appropriate discretisation schemes which allows us to establish corresponding exponential stabilisation results also on the discrete level. The validity of our results and the importance of some of our assumptions are illustrated by numerical tests.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.21350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the ergodicity for stochastic 2D fractional magneto-hydrodynamic equations on the two-dimensional torus driven by a highly degenerate pure jump L\'{e}vy noise. We focus on the challenging case where the noise acts in as few as four directions, establishing new results for such high degeneracy. We first employ Malliavin calculus and anticipative stochastic calculus to demonstrate the equi-continuity of the semigroup (or so-called the e-property), and then verify the weak irreducibility of the solution process. Therefore, the uniqueness of invariant measure is proven.</description>

      <title>Square Root Operators and the Well-Posedness of Pseudodifferential Parabolic Models of Wave Phenomena</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pseudodifferential parabolic equations with an operator square root arise in wave propagation problems as a one-way counterpart of the Helmholtz equation. The expression under the square root usually involves a differential operator and a known function. We discuss a rigorous definition of such operator square roots and show well-posedness of the pseudodifferential parabolic equation by using the theory of strongly continuous semigroups. This provides a justification for a family of widely-used numerical methods for wavefield simulations in various areas of physics.</description>

      <title>Optimizing the ground state energy of the three-dimensional magnetic Dirichlet Laplacian with constant magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper concerns the shape optimization problem of minimizing the ground state energy of the magnetic Dirichlet Laplacian with constant magnetic field among three-dimensional domains of fixed volume. In contrast to the two-dimensional case, a generalized ''magnetic'' Faber-Krahn inequality does not hold and the minimizers are not expected to be balls when the magnetic field is turned on. An analysis of the problem among cylindrical domains reveals geometric constraints for general minimizers. In particular, minimizers must elongate with a certain rate along the direction of the magnetic field as the field strength increases. In addition to the theoretical analysis, we present numerical minimizers which confirm this prediction and give rise to further conjectures.</description>

      <title>Approximation and regularity results for the Heston model and related processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This Ph.D. thesis explores approximations and regularity for the Heston stochastic volatility model through three interconnected works.
  The first work focuses on developing high-order weak approximations for the Cox-Ingersoll-Ross (CIR) process, essential for financial modelling but challenging due to the square root diffusion term preventing standard methods. By employing the random grid technique (Alfonsi &amp; Bally, 2021) built upon Alfonsi's (2010) second-order scheme, the work proves that weak approximations of any order can be achieved for smooth test functions. This holds under a condition that is less restrictive than the famous Feller's one. Numerical results confirm convergence for both CIR and Heston models and show significant computational time improvements.
  The second work extends the random grid technique to the log-Heston process. Two second-order schemes are introduced (one using exact volatility simulation, another using Ninomiya-Victoir splitting under a the same restriction used above). Convergence to any desired order is rigorously proven. Numerical experiments validate the schemes' effectiveness for pricing European and Asian options and suggest potential applicability to multifactor/rough Heston models.
  The third work investigates the partial differential equation (PDE) associated with the log-Heston model. It extends classical solution results and establishes the existence and uniqueness of viscosity solutions without relying on the Feller condition. Uniqueness is proven even for certain discontinuous initial data, relevant for pricing instruments like digital options. Furthermore, the convergence of a hybrid numerical scheme to the viscosity solution is shown under relaxed regularity (continuity) for the initial data.
  An appendix includes supplementary results for the CIR process.</description>

Abstract: Given an area-minimizing integral $m$-current in $\Sigma$, we prove that the Hausdorff dimension of the interior singular set of $T$ cannot exceed $m-2$, provided that $\Sigma$ is an embedded $(m+\bar{n})$-submanifold of $\mathbb{R}^{m+n}$ of class $C^{2,\alpha}$, where $\alpha&gt;0$. This result establishes the complete counterpart, in the arbitrary codimension setting, of the interior regularity theory for area-minimizing integral hypercurrents within a Riemannian manifold of class $C^{2,\alpha}$.</description>

Abstract: Nematic surfaces are thin fluid structures, ideally two-dimensional, endowed with an in-plane nematic order. In 2012, two variational models have been introduced by Giomi [11] and by Napoli and Vergori [29,28]. Both penalize the area of the surface and the gradient of the director: in [11] the covariant derivative of the director is considered, while [28] deals with the surface gradient. In this paper, a complete variational analysis of the model proposed by Giomi is performed for revolution surfaces spanning two coaxial rings.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we show that, given a planar Reifenberg flat domain with small constant and a divergence form operator associated to a real (not necessarily symmetric) uniformly elliptic matrix with Lipschitz coefficients, the Hausdorff dimension of its elliptic measure is at most 1. More precisely, we prove that there exists a subset of the boundary with full elliptic measure and with $\sigma$-finite one-dimensional Hausdorff measure. For Reifenberg flat domains, this result extends a previous work of Thomas H. Wolff for the harmonic measure.</description>

      <title>Pointwise dispersive estimates for Schrodinger and wave equations in a conical singular space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16029v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the pointwise decay estimates for the Schr\"odinger and wave equations on a product cone $(X,g)$, where the metric $g=dr^2+r^2 h$ and $X=C(Y)=(0,\infty)\times Y$ is a product cone over the closed Riemannian manifold $(Y,h)$ with metric $h$. Under the assumption that the conjugate radius $\epsilon$ of $Y$ satisfies $\epsilon&gt;\pi$, we prove the pointwise dispersive estimates for the Schr\"odinger and half-wave propagator in this setting. The key ingredient is the modified Hadamard parametrix on $Y$ in which the role of the conjugate points does not come to play if $\epsilon&gt;\pi$. In a work in progress, we will further study the case that $\epsilon\leq\pi$ in which the role of conjugate points come. A new finding is that a threshold of the conjugate radius of $Y$ for $L^p$-estimates in this setting is the magical number $\pi$.</description>

      <title>Existence and multiplicity of solutions for a critical Kirchhoff type elliptic equation with a logarithmic perturbation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05083v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we are interested in the following critical Kirchhoff type elliptic equation with a logarithmic perturbation \begin{equation}\label{eq0} \begin{cases} -\left(1+b\int_{\Omega}|\nabla{u}|^2\mathrm{d}x\right) \Delta{u}=\lambda u+\mu u\log{u^2}+|u|^{2^{*}-2}u, &amp;x\in\Omega,\\ u=0,&amp;x\in\partial\Omega, \end{cases} \end{equation} where $\Omega$ is a bounded domain in $\mathbb{R}^{N}(N\geq3)$ with smooth boundary $\partial \Omega$, $b$, $\lambda$ and $\mu$ are parameters and $2^{*}=\frac{2N}{N-2}$ is the critical Sobolev exponent. The presence of a nonlocal term, together with a critical nonlinearity and a logarithmic term, prevents to apply in a straightforward way the classical critical point theory. Moreover, the geometry structure of the energy functional changes as the space dimension $N$ varies, which has a crucial influence on the existence of solutions to the problem. On the basis of some careful analysis on the structure of the energy functional, existence and (or) multiplicity results are obtained by using variational methods. More precisely, if $N=3$, problem (0.1) admits a local minimum solution, a ground state solution and a sequence of solutions with their $H_0^1(\Omega)$-norms converging to $0$. If $N=4$, the existence of infinitely many solutions is also obtained. When $N\geq5$, problem (0.1) admits a local minimum solution with negative energy. Sufficient conditions are also derived for the local minimum solution to be a ground state solution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03735v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Viscoelastic rate-type fluid models are essential for describing the behavior of a wide range of complex materials, with applications in fields such as engineering, biomaterials, and medicine. These models are particularly useful for understanding the rheological properties of materials that exhibit both elastic and viscous behavior under deformation. However, many real-world applications involve significant thermal effects, where heat conduction and the temperature dependence of material properties must also be considered. In this paper, we introduce a thermodynamically consistent model for heat-conducting viscoelastic rate-type fluids and establish the existence of a global weak solution in a two-dimensional setting. The result holds under the condition that the initial energy and entropy are controlled in appropriate natural norms.</description>

      <title>An Inverse Problem for symmetric hyperbolic Partial Differential Operators on Complete Riemannian Manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14676v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that a complete Riemannian manifold, as well as time independent smooth lower order terms appearing in a first order symmetric perturbation of a Riemannian wave operator can be uniquely recovered, up to the natural obstructions, from a local source to solution map of the respective hyperbolic initial value problem. Our proofs are based on an adaptation of the classical Boundary Control method (BC-method) originally developed by Belishev and Kurylev. The BC-method reduces the PDE-based problem to a purely geometric problem involving the so-called travel time data. For each point in the manifold the travel time data contains the distance function from this point to any point in a fixed \textit{a priori} known compact observation set. It is well known that this geometric problem is solvable. The main novelty of this paper lies in our strategy to recover the lower order terms via a further adaptation of the BC-method.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we study the two dimensional focusing finitely and infinitely coupled cubic nonlinear Schr\"odinger system when the mass is equal to the scattering threshold. For the focusing finitely coupled cubic nonlinear Schr\"odinger system, we present a complete classification of minimal-mass blowup solutions. Specifically, we demonstrate that all such solutions must be either solitons or their pseudo-conformal transformations. To prove this result, we develop a modulation analysis that accounts for multi-component interactions to overcome the multiply phase transformations caused by the multi-component. A long time Strichartz estimate for vector-valued solutions is established to solve the difficulty posed by the Galilean transformations and spatial translation, where a new vector-valued bilinear estimate is proven to address the challenges caused by the coupled nonlinear interaction. For the infinitely coupled focusing nonlinear Schr\"odinger system when the mass is equal or slightly above the scattering threshold in \cite{CGHY}, we show that scattering is the only dynamical behavior of the solutions to the infinitely coupled system.</description>

      <title>Non-uniqueness of (Stochastic) Lagrangian Trajectories for Euler Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16687v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We are concerned with the (stochastic) Lagrangian trajectories associated with Euler or Navier-Stokes equations. First, in the vanishing viscosity limit, we establish sharp non-uniqueness results for positive solutions to transport equations advected by weak solutions of the 3D Euler equations that exhibit kinetic energy dissipation with $C_{t,x}^{1/3-}$ regularity. As a corollary, in conjunction with the superposition principle, this yields the non-uniqueness of associated (deterministic) Lagrangian trajectories. Second, in dimension $d\geq2$, for any $\frac{1}{p}+\frac{1}{r}&gt;1$ or $p\in(1,2),r=\infty$, we construct solutions to the Euler or Navier-Stokes equations in the space $L_t^rL^p\cap L_t^1W^{1,1}$, demonstrating that the associated (stochastic) Lagrangian trajectories are not unique. Our result is sharp in 2D in the sense that: (1) in the stochastic case, for any vector field $v\in C_tL^p$ with $p&gt;2$, the associated stochastic Lagrangian trajectory associated with $v$ is unique (see \cite{KR05}); (2) in the deterministic case, the LPS condition guarantees that for any weak solution $v\in C_tL^p$ with $p&gt;2$ to the Navier-Stokes equations, the associated (deterministic) Lagrangian trajectory is unique. Our result is also sharp in dimension $d\geq2$ in the sense that for any divergence-free vector field $v\in L_t^1W^{1,s}$ with $s&gt;d$, the associated (deterministic) Lagrangian trajectory is unique (see \cite{CC21}).</description>

      <title>Vladimirov-Pearson Operators on $\zeta$-regular Ultrametric Cantor Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20753v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A new operator for certain types of ultrametric Cantor sets is constructed using the measure coming from the spectral triple associated with the Cantor set, as well as its zeta function. Under certain mild conditions on that measure, it is shown that it is an integral operator similar to the Vladimirov-Taibleson operator on the p-adic integers. Its spectral properties are studied, and the Markov property and kernel representation of the heat kernel generated by this so-called \emph{Vladimirov-Pearson} operator is shown, viewed as acting on a certain Sobolev space. A large class of these operators have a heat kernel and a Green function explicitly given by the ultrametric wavelets on the Cantor set, which are eigenfunctions of the operator.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1911.05562v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove the existence and uniqueness of Stochastic Lagrangian Flows and almost everywhere Stochastic Flows for non-degenearted SDEs with rough coefficients. As an application of our main result, we show that there exists a unique Stochastic Flow corresponding to each Leray-Hopf solution of 3D Navier-Stokes equation in the DiPerna-Lions sense.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the Anderson operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.04705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.04705v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the continuous Anderson operator $H=\Delta+\xi$ on a two dimensional closed Riemannian manifold $\mathcal{S}$. We provide a short self-contained functional analysis construction of the operator as an unbounded operator on $L^2(\mathcal{S})$ and give almost sure spectral gap estimates under mild geometric assumptions on the Riemannian manifold. We prove a sharp Gaussian small time asymptotic for the heat kernel of $H$ that leads amongst others to strong norm estimates for quasimodes. We introduce a new random field, called Anderson Gaussian free field, and prove that the law of its random partition function characterizes the law of the spectrum of $H$. We also give a simple and short construction of the polymer measure on path space and relate the Wick square of the Anderson Gaussian free field to the occupation measure of a Poisson process of loops of polymer paths. We further prove large deviation results for the polymer measure and its bridges.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of anisotropic stiffness tensors from partial data around one polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.03312v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study inverse problems in anisotropic elasticity using tools from algebraic geometry. The singularities of solutions to the elastic wave equation in dimension $n$ with an anisotropic stiffness tensor have propagation kinematics captured by so-called slowness surfaces, which are hypersurfaces in the cotangent bundle of $\mathbb{R}^n$ that turn out to be algebraic varieties. Leveraging the algebraic geometry of families of slowness surfaces we show that, for tensors in a dense open subset in a space of anisotropic two-dimensional stiffness tensors, a small amount of data around one polarization in an individual slowness surface uniquely determines the entire slowness surface and its stiffness tensor. In three dimensions, for generic orthorhombic and monoclinic stiffness tensors, a small number of anomalous companions give rise to the same slowness surface; nevertheless, we conjecture that in the most anisotropic setting (triclinic) the tensor is unique, as in two dimensions. The partial data needed to determine a tensor arises naturally from seismological measurements or geometrized versions of seismic inverse problems. Additionally, we explain how the reconstruction of the stiffness tensor can be carried out effectively, using Gr\"obner bases. Our uniqueness or finiteness results fail for symmetric materials (e.g., fully isotropic), evidencing the counterintuitive claim that inverse problems in elasticity can become more tractable with increasing asymmetry.</description>

      <title>Convergence Analysis of a Schrodinger Problem with Moving Boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08910v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we present the mathematical analysis of the convergence of the linearized Crank-Nicolson Galerkin method for a nonlinear Schrodinger problem related to a domain with a moving boundary. The convergence analysis of the numerical method is carried out for both semi-discrete and fully discrete problems. An optimal error estimate in the $L^2$-norm with order ${O}(\tau^2+ h^s),~ 2\leq s\leq r$, where $h$ is the finite element mesh size parameter, $\tau$ is the time step, and $r-1$ represents the degree of the finite element polynomial basis. Numerical simulations are provided to confirm the consistency between theoretical and numerical results, validating the method and the order of convergence for different degrees $p\geq 1$ of the Lagrange polynomials and also for Hermite polynomials (degree $p=3$), which form the basis of the approximate solution.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Clustering in Mean-Field Transformer Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14697v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The evolution of tokens through a deep transformer models can be modeled as an interacting particle system that has been shown to exhibit an asymptotic clustering behavior akin to the synchronization phenomenon in Kuramoto models. In this work, we investigate the long-time clustering of mean-field transformer models. More precisely, we establish exponential rates of contraction to a Dirac point mass for any suitably regular initialization under some assumptions on the parameters of transformer models, any suitably regular mean-field initialization synchronizes exponentially fast with some quantitative rates.</description>
