      <title>Bicomplex Mittag-Leffler Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Probability distribution theory helps in studying the impact of various dimensions in life while the Mittag-Leffler function and bicomplex are used in electromagnetism, quantum mechanics, and signal theory. Considering the importance of both, the purpose of this paper is to introduce bicomplex Mittag-Leffler distribution theory with the help of the bicomplex Mittag-Leffler function. Moreover, it also tells us about the moment-generating function, the first four moments, the mean, and the variance of this endeavor.</description>

      <title>High-degree cubature on Wiener space through unshuffle expansions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Utilising classical results on the structure of Hopf algebras, we develop a novel approach for the construction of cubature formulae on Wiener space based on unshuffle expansions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach by constructing the first explicit degree-7 cubature formula on $d$-dimensional Wiener space with drift, in the sense of Lyons and Victoir. The support of our degree-7 formula is significantly smaller than that of currently implemented or proposed constructions.</description>

      <title>Schr\"odinger Bridge Problem for Jump Diffusions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Schr\"odinger bridge problem (SBP) seeks to find the measure $\hat{\mathbf{P}}$ on a certain path space which interpolates between state-space distributions $\rho_0$ at time $0$ and $\rho_T$ at time $T$ while minimizing the KL divergence (relative entropy) to a reference path measure $\mathbf{R}$. In this work, we tackle the SBP in the case when $\mathbf{R}$ is the path measure of a jump diffusion. Under mild assumptions, with both the operator theory approach and the stochastic calculus techniques, we establish an $h$-transform theory for jump diffusions and devise an approximation method to achieve the jump-diffusion SBP solution $\hat{\mathbf{P}}$ as the strong-convergence limit of a sequence of harmonic $h$-transforms. To the best of our knowledge, these results are novel in the study of SBP. Moreover, the $h$-transform framework and the approximation method developed in this work are robust and applicable to a relatively general class of jump diffusions. In addition, we examine the SBP of particular types of jump diffusions under additional regularity conditions and extend the existing results on the SBP from the diffusion case to the jump-diffusion setting.</description>

      <title>Large deviations at the origin of random walk in random environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a random walk in an i.i.d. random environment on Zd and study properties of its large deviation rate function at the origin. It was proved by Comets, Gantert and Zeitouni in dimension d = 1 in 1999 and later by Varadhan in dimensions d &gt;= 2 in 2003 that, for uniformly elliptic i.i.d. random environments, the quenched and the averaged large deviation rate functions coincide at the origin. Here we provide a description of an atypical event realizing the correct quenched large deviation rate in the nestling and marginally nestling setting: the random walk seeks regions of space where the environment emulates the element in the convex hull of the support of the law of the environment at a site which minimizes the rate function. Periodic environments play a natural role in this description.</description>

      <title>Random walks on random walks: non-perturbative results in high dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider the dynamic environment governed by a Poissonian field of independent particles evolving as simple random walks on $\mathbb{Z}^d$. The random walk on random walks model refers to a particular stochastic process on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ whose evolution at time $t$ depends on the number of such particles at its location. We derive classical limit theorems for this instrumental model of a random walk in a dynamic random environment, applicable in sufficiently high dimensions. More precisely, for $d \geq 5$, we prove a strong law of large numbers and large deviation estimates. Further, for $d\geq 9$, we obtain a functional central limit theorem under the annealed law. These results are non-perturbative in the sense that they hold for any positive density of the Poissonian field. Under the aforementioned assumptions on the dimension they therefore improve on previous work on the model. Moreover, they stand in contrast to the anomalous behaviour predicted in low dimensions.</description>

      <title>Long-time analysis of a pair of on-lattice and continuous run-and-tumble particles with jamming interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Run-and-Tumble Particles (RTPs) are a key model of active matter. They are characterized by alternating phases of linear travel and random direction reshuffling. By this dynamic behavior, they break time reversibility and energy conservation at the microscopic level. It leads to complex out-of-equilibrium phenomena such as collective motion, pattern formation, and motility-induced phase separation (MIPS). In this work, we study two fundamental dynamical models of a pair of RTPs with jamming interactions and provide a rigorous link between their discrete- and continuous-space descriptions. We demonstrate that as the lattice spacing vanishes, the discrete models converge to a continuous RTP model on the torus, described by a Piecewise Deterministic Markov Process (PDMP). This establishes that the invariant measures of the discrete models converge to that of the continuous model, which reveals finite mass at jamming configurations and exponential decay away from them. This indicates effective attraction, which is consistent with MIPS. Furthermore, we quantitatively explore the convergence towards the invariant measure. Such convergence study is critical for understanding and characterizing how MIPS emerges over time. Because RTP systems are non-reversible, usual methods may fail or are limited to qualitative results. Instead, we adopt a coupling approach to obtain more accurate, non-asymptotic bounds on mixing times. The findings thus provide deeper theoretical insights into the mixing times of these RTP systems, revealing the presence of both persistent and diffusive regimes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We know from Ram{\'i}rez and Rider that the hard edge of the spectrum of the Beta-Laguerre ensemble converges, in the high-dimensional limit, to the bottom of the spectrum of the stochastic Bessel operator. Using stochastic analysis techniques, we show that, in the high temperatures limit, the rescaled eigenvalues point process of the stochastic Bessel operator converges to a limiting point process characterized with coupled stochastic dierential equations.</description>

      <title>Exponential Ergodicity in $\W_1$ for SDEs with Distribution Dependent Noise and Partially Dissipative Drifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a general result on exponential ergodicity via $L^1$-Wasserstein distance for McKean--Vlasov SDEs. The result is successfully applied in non-degenerate and multiplicative Brownian motion cases and degenerate second order systems, where the diffusion coefficients are allowed to be distribution dependent and the drifts are only assumed to be partially dissipative. Our approach overcomes the essential difficulty caused by the distribution dependent diffusion coefficient and our results considerably improve existing ones in which the diffusion coefficient is distribution-free.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous replica-symmetry breaking for vector spin glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider mean-field vector spin glasses with possibly non-convex interactions. Up to a small perturbation of the parameters defining the model, the asymptotic behavior of the Gibbs measure is described in terms of a critical point of an explicit functional. In this paper, we study some properties of these critical points. Under modest assumptions ensuring that different types of spins interact, we show that the replica-symmetry-breaking structures of the different types of spins are in one-to-one correspondence with one another. For instance, if some type of spins displays one level of replica-symmetry breaking, then so do all the other types of spins. This extends the recent results of [Electronic Journal of Probability, 27:1-75, 2022] and [Comm. Math. Phys., 394(3):1101-1152, 2022] that were obtained in the case of multi-species spherical spin glasses with convex interactions.</description>

      <title>Stochastic processes on preferential attachment models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In real life, networks are dynamic in nature; they grow over time and often exhibit power-law degree sequences. To model the evolving structure of the internet, Barab\'{a}si and Albert introduced a simple dynamic model with a power-law degree distribution. This model has since been generalised, leading to a broad class of affine preferential attachment models, where each new vertex connects to existing vertices with a probability proportional to the current degree of the vertex. While numerous studies have explored the global and local properties of these random graphs, their dynamic nature and the dependencies in edge-connection probabilities have posed significant analytical challenges. The first part of this thesis identifies the local limit of preferential attachment models in considerable generality. The second part focuses on stochastic processes on preferential attachment models, introducing an additional layer of randomness to the random graphs. Examples of such processes include bond and site percolation, random walks, the Ising and Potts models, and Gaussian processes on random graphs. In this thesis, we specifically examine percolation and the Ising model, exploring these processes using the local limit identified earlier.</description>

      <title>Invariant Sublinear Expectations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We first give a decomposition for a $T$-invariant sublinear expectation $\mathbb{E}=\sup_{P\in\Theta}\mathrm{E}_P$, and show that each component $\mathbb{E}^{(d)}=\sup_{P\in\Theta^{(d)}}\mathrm{E}_P$ of the decomposition has a finite period $p_d\in\mathbb{N}$, i.e., \[\mathbb{E}^{(d)}\left[f-f\circ T^{p_d}\right]=0, \quad f\in\mathcal{H}.\] Then we prove that a continuous invariant sublinear expectation that is strongly ergodic has a finite period $p_{\mathbb{E}}$, and each component $\Theta^{(d)}$ of its periodic decomposition is the convex hull of a finite set of $T^{p_d}$-ergodic probabilities.
  As an application of the characterization, we prove an ergodicity result which shows that the limit of the $p_{\mathbb{E}}$-step time means achieves the upper expectation.</description>

      <title>Size of chaos for Gibbs measures of mean field interacting diffusions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate Gibbs measures for diffusive particles interacting through a two-body mean field energy. By uncovering a gradient structure for the conditional law, we derive sharp bounds on the size of chaos, providing a quantitative characterization of particle independence. To handle unbounded interaction forces, we study the concentration of measure phenomenon for Gibbs measures via a defective Talagrand inequality, which may hold independent interest. Our approach provides a unified framework for both the flat semi-convex and displacement convex cases. Additionally, we establish sharp chaos bounds for the quartic Curie-Weiss model in the sub-critical regime, demonstrating the generality of this method.</description>

      <title>Finding the root in random nearest neighbor trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the inference of network archaeology in growing random geometric graphs. We consider the root finding problem for a random nearest neighbor tree in dimension $d \in \mathbb{N}$, generated by sequentially embedding vertices uniformly at random in the $d$-dimensional torus and connecting each new vertex to the nearest existing vertex. More precisely, given an error parameter $\varepsilon &gt; 0$ and the unlabeled tree, we want to efficiently find a small set of candidate vertices, such that the root is included in this set with probability at least $1 - \varepsilon$. We call such a candidate set a $\textit{confidence set}$. We define several variations of the root finding problem in geometric settings -- embedded, metric, and graph root finding -- which differ based on the nature of the type of metric information provided in addition to the graph structure (torus embedding, edge lengths, or no additional information, respectively).
  We show that there exist efficient root finding algorithms for embedded and metric root finding. For embedded root finding, we derive upper and lower bounds (uniformly bounded in $n$) on the size of the confidence set: the upper bound is subpolynomial in $1/\varepsilon$ and stems from an explicit efficient algorithm, and the information-theoretic lower bound is polylogarithmic in $1/\varepsilon$. In particular, in $d=1$, we obtain matching upper and lower bounds for a confidence set of size $\Theta\left(\frac{\log(1/\varepsilon)}{\log \log(1/\varepsilon)} \right)$.</description>

      <title>Randomized Geodesic Flow on Hyperbolic Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by Gromov's geodesic flow problem on hyperbolic groups $G$, we develop in this paper an analog using random walks. This leads to a notion of a harmonic analog $\Theta$ of the Bowen-Margulis-Sullivan measure on $\partial^2 G$. We provide three different but related constructions of $\Theta$: 1) by moving the base-point along a quasigeodesic ray 2) by moving the base-point along random walk trajectories 3) directly as a push-forward under the boundary map to $\partial^2 G$ of a measure inherited from studying all bi-infinite random walk trajectories (with no restriction on base-point) on $G^{\mathbb{Z}}$.
  Of these, the third construction is the most involved and needs new techniques. It relies on developing a framework where we can treat bi-infinite random walk trajectories as analogs of bi-infinite geodesics on complete simply connected negatively curved manifolds. Geodesic flow on a hyperbolic group is typically not well-defined due to non-uniqueness of geodesics. We circumvent this problem in the random walk setup by considering \emph{all} trajectories. We thus get a well-defined \emph{discrete flow} given by the $\mathbb{Z}-$shift on bi-infinite random walk trajectories. The $\mathbb{Z}-$shift is the random analog of the time one map of the geodesic flow. As an analog of ergodicity of the geodesic flow on a closed negatively curved manifold, we establish ergodicity of the $G$-action on $(\partial^2G, \Theta)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The relative arbitrage problem in Stochastic Portfolio Theory seeks to generate an investment strategy that almost surely outperforms a benchmark portfolio at the end of a certain time horizon. The highest relative return in relative arbitrage opportunities is related to the smallest nonnegative continuous solution of a Cauchy PDE. However, solving the PDE poses analytical and numerical challenges, due to the high dimensionality and its non-unique solutions. In this paper, we discuss numerical methods to address the relative arbitrage problem and the associated PDE in a volatility-stabilized market using time-changed Bessel bridges. We present a practical algorithm and demonstrate numerical results through an example in volatility-stabilized markets.</description>

      <title>The Brown Measure of Non-Hermitian Sums of Projections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13804v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the Brown measure of the non-normal operators $X = p + i q$, where $p$ and $q$ are Hermitian, freely independent, and have spectra consisting of $2$ atoms. The computation relies on the model of the non-trivial part of the von Neumann algebra generated by 2 projections as $2 \times 2$ random matrices. We observe that these measures are supported on hyperbolas and note some other properties related to their atoms and symmetries.</description>

      <title>Filtering and Statistical Properties of Unimodal Maps Perturbed by Heteroscedastic Noises</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13939v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a theory of unimodal maps perturbed by an heteroscedastic Markov chain noise and experiencing another heteroscedastic noise due to uncertain observation. We address and treat the filtering problem showing that by collecting more and more observations, one would predict the same distribution for the state of the underlying Markov chain no matter one's initial guess. Moreover we give other limit theorems, emphasizing in particular concentration inequalities and extreme value and Poisson distributions. Our results apply to a family of maps arising from a model of systemic risk in finance.</description>

      <title>Sharp Thresholds for Factors in Random Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $F$ be a graph on $r$ vertices and let $G$ be a graph on $n$ vertices. Then an $F$-factor in $G$ is a subgraph of $G$ composed of $n/r$ vertex-disjoint copies of $F$, if $r$ divides $n$. In other words, an $F$-factor yields a partition of the $n$ vertices of $G$. The study of such $F$-factors in the Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graph dates back to Erd\H{o}s himself. Decades later, in 2008, Johansson, Kahn and Vu established the thresholds for the existence of an $F$-factor for strictly 1-balanced $F$ -- up to the leading constant. The sharp thresholds, meaning the leading constants, were obtained only recently by Riordan and Heckel, but only for complete graphs $F=K_r$ and for so-called nice graphs. Their results rely on sophisticated couplings that utilize the recent, celebrated solution of Shamir's problem by Kahn.
  We extend the couplings by Riordan and Heckel to any strictly 1-balanced $F$ and thereby obtain the sharp threshold for the existence of an $F$-factor. In particular, we confirm the thirty year old conjecture by Ruc\'inski that this sharp threshold indeed coincides with the sharp threshold for the disappearance of the last vertices which are not contained in a copy of $F$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14181v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that the average size of a mixed character sum $$\sum_{1\le n \le x} \chi(n) e(n\theta) w(n/x)$$ (for a suitable smooth function $w$) is on the order of $\sqrt{x}$ for all irrational real $\theta$ satisfying a weak Diophantine condition, where $\chi$ is drawn from the family of Dirichlet characters modulo a large prime $r$ and where $x\le r$. In contrast, it was proved by Harper that the average size is $o(\sqrt{x})$ for rational $\theta$. Certain quadratic Diophantine equations play a key role in the present paper.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Propagation of Chaos for 2D Viscous Vortex Model with General Circulations on the Whole Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive the quantitative propagation of chaos in the sense of relative entropy for the 2D viscous vortex model with general circulations, approximating the vorticity formulation of the 2D Navier-Stokes equation on the whole Euclidean space, which is an extension of the previous works \cite{fournier2014propagation,jabin2018quantitative}. We improve our previous results in \cite{feng2023quantitative} to the more general case that the vorticity may change sign, allowing the circulations to be in different orientations. We also extend the results of \cite{wang2024sharp} to the whole space to obtain the sharp local propagation of chaos in the high viscosity regime. Both results of convergence rates are global-in-time on any finite time horizon and optimal among existing literature, thanks to the careful estimates using the Grigor'yan parabolic maximum principle and a new ODE hierarchy and iterated integral estimates.</description>

      <title>Model-free learning of probability flows: Elucidating the nonequilibrium dynamics of flocking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Active systems comprise a class of nonequilibrium dynamics in which individual components autonomously dissipate energy. Efforts towards understanding the role played by activity have centered on computation of the entropy production rate (EPR), which quantifies the breakdown of time reversal symmetry. A fundamental difficulty in this program is that high dimensionality of the phase space renders traditional computational techniques infeasible for estimating the EPR. Here, we overcome this challenge with a novel deep learning approach that estimates probability currents directly from stochastic system trajectories. We derive a new physical connection between the probability current and two local definitions of the EPR for inertial systems, which we apply to characterize the departure from equilibrium in a canonical model of flocking. Our results highlight that entropy is produced and consumed on the spatial interface of a flock as the interplay between alignment and fluctuation dynamically creates and annihilates order. By enabling the direct visualization of when and where a given system is out of equilibrium, we anticipate that our methodology will advance the understanding of a broad class of complex nonequilibrium dynamics.</description>

Abstract: We consider systems of interacting particles which are described by a second order Langevin equation, i.e., particles experiencing inertia. We introduce an associated equation of fluctuating hydrodynamics, which can be interpreted as stochastic version of a Vlasov-Fokker-Planck equation. We show that this stochastic partial differential equation exhibits the same dichotomy as the corresponding first order (inertial-free) equation, the so-called Dean-Kawasaki equation: Solutions exist only for suitable atomic initial data, but not for smooth initial data. The class of systems covered includes several models of active matter.</description>

Abstract: We study the long-time convergence of a Fleming-Viot process, in the case where the underlying process is a metastable diffusion killed when it reaches some level set. Through a coupling argument, we establish the long-time convergence of the Fleming-Viot process toward some stationary measure at an exponential rate independent of $N$, the size of the system, as well as uniform in time propagation of chaos estimates.</description>

Abstract: We prove the existence of a $B$-continuous viscosity solution for a class of infinite dimensional semilinear partial differential equations (PDEs) using probabilistic methods. Our approach also yields a stochastic representation formula for the solution in terms of a scalar-valued backward stochastic differential equation. The uniqueness is proved under additional assumptions using a comparison theorem for viscosity solutions. Our results constitute the first nonlinear Feynman-Kac formula using the notion of $B$-continuous viscosity solutions and thus introduces a framework allowing for generalizations to the case of fully nonlinear PDEs.</description>

      <title>A criterion for absolute continuity relative to the law of fractional Brownian motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.11824v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $X$ be the sum of a fractional Brownian motion with Hurst parameter $H$ and an absolutely continuous and adapted drift process. We establish a simple criterion that guarantees that the law of $X$ is absolutely continuous with respect to the law of the original fractional Brownian motion. For $H&lt;1/2$, the trajectories of the derivative of the drift need to be bounded by an almost surely finite random variable; for $H&gt;1/2$, they need to satisfy a H\"older condition with some exponent larger than $2H-1$. These are almost-sure conditions, and no expectation requirements are imposed. For the case in which $X$ arises as the solution of a nonlinear stochastic integral equation driven by fractional Brownian motion, we provide a simple criterion on the drift coefficient under which the law of $X$ is automatically equivalent to the one of fractional Brownian motion.</description>

      <title>Set-valued stochastic integrals for convoluted L\'{e}vy processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.01730v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study set-valued Volterra-type stochastic integrals driven by L\'{e}vy processes. Upon extending the classical definitions of set-valued stochastic integral functionals to convoluted integrals with square-integrable kernels, set-valued convoluted stochastic integrals are defined by taking the closed decomposable hull of the integral functionals for generic time. We show that, aside from well-established results for set-valued It\^{o} integrals, while set-valued stochastic integrals with respect to a finite-variation Poisson random measure are guaranteed to be integrably bounded for bounded integrands, this is not true when the random measure is of infinite variation. For indefinite integrals, we prove that it is a mutual effect of kernel singularity and jumps that the set-valued convoluted integrals are possibly explosive and take extended vector values. These results have some important implications on how set-valued fractional dynamical systems are to be constructed in general. Two classes of set-monotone processes are studied for practical interests in economic and financial modeling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00520v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The aim of this work is understanding the stretching mechanism of stochastic models of turbulence acting on a simple model of dilute polymers. We consider a turbulent model that is white noise in time and activates frequencies in a shell $N\leq |k|\leq 2N$ and investigate the scaling limit as $N\rightarrow \infty$, under suitable intensity assumption, such that the stretching term has a finite limit covariance. The polymer density equation, initially an SPDE, converges weakly to a limit deterministic equation with a new term. Stationary solutions can be computed and show power law decay in the polymer length.</description>

Abstract: We consider a large class of bullet models that contains, in particular, the colliding bullet model with creations and a new loop model. For this large class of bullet models, we give sufficient conditions on their parameter to be $\text{rot}(\pi)$-quasi-reversible and to be $\text{rot}(\pi/2)$-quasi-reversible. Moreover, those conditions assure them that one of their invariant measures is described by a Poisson Point Process. This result applied to the colliding bullet models with creations is a first step to study its property under its non-empty invariant measure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06571v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A recent paper of Tsai shows how the first few moments of a stochastic flow in the space of measures can completely determine its law. Here we give another proof of this result for the particular case of the one-dimensional multiplicative stochastic heat equation (mSHE), and then we investigate two corollaries. The first one recovers a recent result of Hairer on a ``variance blowup" problem related to the KPZ equation , albeit in a much weaker topology. The second one recovers a KPZ scaling limit result related to random walks in random environments, but in a weaker topology. In these two problems, we furthermore explain why it is hard to directly use the martingale characterization of the mSHE, the chaos expansion, or other known methods. Using the moment-based approach avoids technicalities, leading to a short proof.</description>

      <title>Approximation rates of entropic maps in semidiscrete optimal transport</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07947v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Entropic optimal transport offers a computationally tractable approximation to the classical problem. In this note, we study the approximation rate of the entropic optimal transport map (in approaching the Brenier map) when the regularization parameter $\varepsilon$ tends to zero in the semidiscrete setting, where the input measure is absolutely continuous while the output is finitely discrete. Previous work shows that the approximation rate is $O(\sqrt{\varepsilon})$ under the $L^2$-norm with respect to the input measure. In this work, we establish faster, $O(\varepsilon^2)$ rates up to polylogarithmic factors, under the dual Lipschitz norm, which is weaker than the $L^2$-norm. For the said dual norm, the $O(\varepsilon^2)$ rate is sharp. As a corollary, we derive a central limit theorem for the entropic estimator for the Brenier map in the dual Lipschitz space when the regularization parameter tends to zero as the sample size increases.</description>

Abstract: We examine here the effects of recurrent vaccination and waning immunity on the establishment of an endemic equilibrium in a population. An individual-based model that incorporates memory effects for transmission rate during infection and subsequent immunity is introduced, considering stochasticity at the individual level. By letting the population size going to infinity, we derive a set of equations describing the large scale behavior of the epidemic. The analysis of the model's equilibria reveals a criterion for the existence of an endemic equilibrium, which depends on the rate of immunity loss and the distribution of time between booster doses. The outcome of a vaccination policy in this context is influenced by the efficiency of the vaccine in blocking transmissions and the distribution pattern of booster doses within the population. Strategies with evenly spaced booster shots at the individual level prove to be more effective in preventing disease spread compared to irregularly spaced boosters, as longer intervals without vaccination increase susceptibility and facilitate more efficient disease transmission. We provide an expression for the critical fraction of the population required to adhere to the vaccination policy in order to eradicate the disease, that resembles a well-known threshold for preventing an outbreak with an imperfect vaccine. We also investigate the consequences of unequal vaccine access in a population and prove that, under reasonable assumptions, fair vaccine allocation is the optimal strategy to prevent endemicity.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Propagation of Non-Gaussian Uncertainties</title>

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach for propagating uncertainties in dynamical systems building on high-order Taylor expansions of the flow and moment-generating functions (MGFs). Unlike prior methods that focus on Gaussian distributions, our approach leverages the relationship between MGFs and distribution moments to extend high-order uncertainty propagation techniques to non-Gaussian scenarios. This significantly broadens the applicability of these methods to a wider range of problems and uncertainty types. High-order moment computations are performed one-off and symbolically, reducing the computational burden of the technique to the calculation of Taylor series coefficients around a nominal trajectory, achieved by efficiently integrating the system's variational equations. Furthermore, the use of the proposed approach in combination with event transition tensors, allows for accurate propagation of uncertainties at specific events, such as the landing surface of a celestial body, the crossing of a predefined Poincar\'e section, or the trigger of an arbitrary event during the propagation. Via numerical simulations we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in various astrodynamics applications, including the unperturbed and perturbed two-body problem, and the circular restricted three-body problem, showing that it accurately propagates non-Gaussian uncertainties both at future times and at event manifolds.</description>
