      <title>The Proj of the Rees algebra of a graded family of ideals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we investigate the condition that the Proj of a Rees algebra of a graded family of ideals in a Noetherian local ring $R$ is Noetherian. In many cases, the Proj will be Noetherian even when the Rees algebra is not. For instance, the Proj of the Rees algebra of a graded filtration of ideals will alway be Noetherian if the analytic spread of the filtration is zero.
  The Proj of a Rees algebra of a divisorial filtration on a two dimensional normal excellent local ring is always Noetherian, as was proven by Russo and later with a different proof by the author. We give examples in this paper of divisorial filtrations on three dimensional normal excellent local rings whose Proj is not Noetherian, showing that this theorem does not extend to higher dimensions.
  A consequence of the fact that the Proj of a divisorial filtration over a two dimensional excellent normal local ring is always Noetherian is that the preimage of the maximal ideal of $R$ in the Proj has only finitely many irreducible components. As a consequence, the fiber cone of such a filtration has only finitely many minimal primes. We give an example of a graded filtration of ideals in a two dimensional regular local ring such that the preimage of the maximal ideal in the Proj of the Rees algebra of the filtration has infinitely many irreducible components, so that the Proj is not Noetherian, and the fiber cone of the filtration has infinitely many minimal primes.</description>

      <title>The MacaulayPosets package for Macaulay2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the package MacaulayPosets written for the computational algebra system Macaulay2. This package utilized the poset data type introduced in the Posets package and offers functionality for studying the Macaulay property for posets, particularly those which arise as monomial posets of commutative rings. A Macaulay poset is characterized by a ranked structure and a total order that interacts harmoniously with the partial order, enabling the establishment of bounds on the sizes of subsets of a given rank within an order ideal.</description>

      <title>GBNL: Graded Betti Number Learning of Complex Biological Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While persistent homology is widely used for data shape analysis, persistent commutative algebra (PCA) has seen limited adoption in machine learning and data science. Unlike persistent homology, which delivers topological invariants in the form of Betti numbers, PCA provides both algebraic invariants and graded Betti numbers. However, graded Betti numbers have seldom been applied to real-world data. In this work, we introduce the first-of-its-kind application of commutative algebra graded Betti numbers in machine learning and data science. Specifically, we present Graded Betti Number Learning (GBNL) for protein-nucleic acid binding prediction. Protein-DNA/RNA interactions are fundamental to cellular processes such as replication, transcription, translation, and gene regulation, and their understanding and prediction remain challenging. GBNL represents each nucleic acid sequence as a family of $k$-mer-specific sets and derives persistent graded Betti invariants from PCA, generating multiscale topological representations of local nucleotide organization. To incorporate cross-molecule context, these graded Betti representations are paired with transformer-based protein embeddings, linking nucleotide-level signals with global protein patterns. The proposed graded Betti representations effectively detect single-site mutations and distinguish complete mutation patterns. Operating on primary sequences with minimal preprocessing, GBNL bridges commutative algebra, reduced algebraic topology, combinatorics, and machine learning, establishing a new paradigm for comparative sequence analysis. Numerical studies using three datasets highlight the success of GBNL in protein-nucleic acid binding prediction.</description>

      <title>Multiplier Modules of extended Rees algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a local ring $(R, \mathfrak{m})$ and an ideal $\mathfrak{a}$ of positive height, we give a way of computing multiplier module ${J}(\omega_{{T}}, t^{-\lambda})$ for the extended Rees algebra ${T} =R[\mathfrak{a} t, t^{-1}]$ for an ideal $\mathfrak{a}$ by proving a decomposition theorem for ${J}(\omega_{{T}}, t^{-\lambda})$, (also see the works of Budur, Musta\c{t}\u{a} and Saito). We compute the multiplier module ${J}(\omega_{{S}}, (\mathfrak{a} \cdot {S})^{\lambda})$ for the Rees algebra ${S} =R[\mathfrak{a} t]$ as well (also see the works of Hyry and Kotal-Kummini). We use these decompositions to understand relationships between associated graded rings, Rees and extended Rees algebras having rational singularities (also see the works of Hara, Watanabe, and Yoshida).</description>

      <title>The existence of valuative interpolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22244v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, using key tools including Zhou valuations, Tian functions and a convergence result for relative types, we establish necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of valuative interpolations on the rings of germs of holomorphic functions and real analytic functions at the origin in $\mathbb{C}^{n}$ and $\mathbb{R}^{n}$, respectively. For the cases of polynomial rings with complex and real coefficients, we establish separate necessary conditions and sufficient conditions, which become both necessary and sufficient when the intersection of the zero sets of the given polynomials is the set of the origin in $\mathbb{C}^{n}$.
  Furthermore, we obtain a necessary and sufficient condition for a valuation to be of the form given by a relative type with respect to a tame maximal weight. We demonstrate a result of Boucksom--Favre--Jonsson on quasimonomial valuations also holds for quasimonomial Zhou valuations. Finally, we obtain a relationship between Zhou valuations and the differentiable points of Tian functions.</description>

      <title>Abhyankar valuations, Pr\"ufer-Manis valuations, and perfectoid Tate algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let \(K\) be a perfectoid field. We describe all quotient fields of the perfectoid Tate algebra \begin{equation*}T_{n, K}^{\text{perfd}}=K\langle X_{1}^{1/p^{\infty}},\dots,
  X_{n}^{1/p^{\infty}}\rangle \end{equation*}in any number $n\geq1$ of variables in terms of (completed perfections of) the nonarchimedean fields $K_{r_1,\dots, r_l}$ occuring in Berkovich geometry. We prove that every quotient field \begin{equation*}L=T_{n, K}^{\text{perfd}}/\mathfrak{m}\end{equation*}is a so-called semi-immediate extension of $K_{r_1,\dots, r_l}^{\text{perfd}}$ for some \begin{equation*} l \leq \max(0, n-\text{ht}(\mathfrak{m}^{\flat} \cap (T_{n, K^{\flat}})^{\text{coperf}})-1), \end{equation*}which pins down the value groups and the residue fields of the possible quotient fields $L$.
  The main ingredient in our proof is a qualitative generalization of Berkovich's classification of points on the nonarchimedean closed unit ball. Namely, we introduce the notion of topologically simple valuations, which generalize type (IV) points in the classification of points on $\text{Spa}(K\langle T\rangle)$. We also consider Abhyankar valuations (i.e., those for which Abhyankar's inequality is an equality), which generalize type (II) and (III) points. We prove that, on an affinoid algebra in the sense of Tate which is not a field, the topologically simple valuations are never Abhyankar, and we derive our result on the perfectoid Tate algebra from this statement. Along the way, we also show that our topologically simple valuations are the same as Pr\"ufer-Manis valuations in the sense of \cite{Knebusch-Zhang}.
  Finally, we also show that all allowed possibilities for the quotient fields $L$ do indeed occur (i.e., the above bound on $l$ is optimal) by generalizing an example of Gleason in \cite{Gleason22N}.</description>

      <title>The derived $\infty$-category of Frobenius modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23267v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that for $X$ a quasi-compact $\mathbb{F}_p$-scheme with affine diagonal (e.g.\ $X$ quasi-compact
  and separated) there is a t-exact equivalence
  $\mathcal D(\mathrm{Frob}(\mathrm{QCoh}(X),F_*)) \to \mathrm{Frob}(\mathcal D(\mathrm{QCoh}(X)),\mathcal D(F_*))$
  of stable $\infty$-categories.
  Here, $\mathrm{Frob}(-,-)$ denotes the $\infty$-category of generalized Frobenius modules
  as introduced in arXiv:2410.17102.
  This generalizes our result from arXiv:2410.17102,
  where we proved the above for regular Noetherian $\mathbb{F}_p$-schemes.
  As a byproduct we prove that the derived $\infty$-category of Frobenius (and Cartier) modules
  satisfies Zariski descent.</description>

      <title>A note on $\mathbb{G}_a$-actions in positive characteristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12555v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Miyanishi proved that the ring of invariants of any $\mathbb{G}_a$ action on $\mathbb{A}^3$ is $\mathbb{A}^2$, when the field $k$ has zero characteristic. However, it is not known if this result holds when $k$ has positive characteristic. We provide a sufficient condition under which this result holds in positive characteristic. We also prove the following results related to the rigidity of the ring of invariants of an exponential map of a polynomial ring.
  (1) Let $B=R^{[n]}$, where $R$ is a $k$-domain and $\delta \in \mathrm{EXP}_R(B)$ is a triangular exponential map. Then $B^{\delta}$ is non-rigid. In particular, for any field $k$ of zero characteristic the kernel of any triangular $R$-derivation of $R^{[n]}$ is non-rigid.
  (2) Let $k$ be a field of zero characteristic and $R$ be a $k$-domain. Then the kernel of any linear locally nilpotent $R$-derivation of $R^{[n]}$ is non-rigid.
  When $k$ is an algebraically closed of zero characteristic, the commuting derivations conjecture for $k^{[3]}$ has been proved by Maubach and El Kahoui proved that the weak Abhyankar Sathaye conjecture is equivalent to the commuting derivations conjecture. By introducing the notion of commuting exponential maps and formulating the commuting exponential maps conjecture, we show that the weak Abhyankar-Sathaye conjecture is equivalent to the commuting exponential maps conjecture for any field of arbitrary characteristic. In particular, we prove the commuting derivations conjecture$(CD(3))$ for any field of zero characteristic.</description>

Abstract: We explain a derived version of the basic construction of localisations of module categories by means of idempotent ideals, which lie at the heart of Faltings' almost ring theory.

      <title>On modular invariants of the truncated polynomial ring in rank four</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11464v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove the rank-4 case of the conjecture of Ha-Hai-Nghia for the invariant subspace of the truncated polynomial ring $\mathcal{Q}_m(n)=\mathbb{F}_q[x_1,\dots,x_n]/(x_1^{q^m},\dots,x_n^{q^m}),$ under a new, explicit technical hypothesis. Our argument extends the determinant calculus for the delta operator by deriving crucial rank-4 identities governing its interaction with the Dickson algebra. We show that the proof of the conjecture reduces to a specific vanishing property, for which we introduce a sufficient condition, the "matching hypothesis" ($\mathrm{H_{match}}$), relating the degree structures of Dickson invariants. This condition is justified by theoretical arguments and verified computationally in many cases. Combining this approach with the normalized derivation approach from our prior work, we establish the conjecture. As a result, the Lewis-Reiner-Stanton Conjecture is also confirmed for rank four under the given hypothesis.</description>

Abstract: Flat modules play an important role in the study of the category of modules over rings and in the characterization of some classes of rings. We study the e-flatness for semimodules introduced by the first author using his new notion of exact sequences of semimodules and its relationships with other notions of flatness for semimodules over semirings. We also prove that a subtractive semiring over which every right (left) semimodule is e-flat is a von Neumann regular semiring.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02065v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a family of positive weighted well-covered graphs, which we call levelable graphs, that are related to a construction of level artinian rings in commutative algebra. A graph $G$ is levelable if there exists a weight function with positive integer values on the vertices of $G$ such that $G$ is well-covered with respect to this weight function. That is, the sum of the weights in any maximal independent set of vertices of $G$ is the same. We describe some of the basic properties of levelable graphs and classify the levelable graphs for some families of graphs, e.g., trees, cubic circulants, Cameron--Walker graphs. We also explain the connection between levelable graphs and a class of level artinian rings. Applying a result of Brown and Nowakowski about weighted well-covered graphs, we show that for most graphs, their edge ideals are not Cohen--Macaulay.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19907v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Our work begins by studying the vanishing of higher cohomology for the derived pushforward of a torsion free sheaf along a modification of integral Noetherian schemes. Leveraging this, we establish a relatively simple recipe for constructing varieties with (mild) rational or Du Bois singularities, some of which is applicable in both zero and nonzero characteristic. Furthermore, we explore notions of singularities that lie in the same cohomological veins of rational singularities for varieties in characteristic zero, including Bhatt's derived splinters and Kov\'{a}cs' birational derived splinters.</description>

      <title>Tilting theory for hypersurface singularities of dimension one</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12581v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Any $\mathbb{N}$-graded commutative Gorenstein ring $R$ of Krull dimension one with $R_0$ a field admits a standard silting object $V$ in the stable category $\underline{\mathrm{CM}}_0^{\mathbb{Z}}R$, and the object $V$ is tilting if and only if the $a$-invariant $a$ is non-negative, as shown by Buchweitz, the first author, and Yamaura. In this article, under the additional assumption that $R$ is a hypersurface singularity, we prove that endomorphism algebra of $V$ is Iwanaga-Gorenstein of self-injective dimension at most $2$, and we give its explicit presentation in terms of a quiver with relation. In the case of where $a$ is negative, we prove that the dg endomorphism algebra of $V$ is Gorenstein, and we give its explicit presentation in terms of a dg path algebra. We explain our results by several examples including numerical semigroup algebras generated by two elements. Moreover, for each finite and countable Cohen-Macaulay representation type, we include the Auslander-Reiten quiver of the category $\mathrm{CM}_0^{\mathbb{Z}}R$ with the position of the standard silting object. As a step of the proof of our results, we give a characterization of Gorensteinness of homologically finite dg algebras in terms of Serre functors.</description>
