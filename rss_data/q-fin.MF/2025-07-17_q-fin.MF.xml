      <title>Analytic estimation of parameters of stochastic volatility diffusion models with exponential-affine characteristic function for currency option pricing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This dissertation develops and justifies a novel method for deriving approximate formulas to estimate two parameters in stochastic volatility diffusion models with exponentially-affine characteristic functions and single- or two-factor variance. These formulas aim to improve the accuracy of option pricing and enhance the calibration process by providing reliable initial values for local minimization algorithms. The parameters relate to the volatility of the stochastic factor in instantaneous variance dynamics and the correlation between stochastic factors and asset price dynamics.
  The study comprises five chapters. Chapter one outlines the currency option market, pricing methods, and the general structure of stochastic volatility models. Chapter two derives the replication strategy dynamics and introduces a new two-factor volatility model: the OUOU model. Chapter three analyzes the distribution and surface dynamics of implied volatilities using principal component and common factor analysis. Chapter four discusses calibration methods for stochastic volatility models, particularly the Heston model, and presents the new Implied Central Moments method to estimate parameters in the Heston and Sch\"obel-Zhu models. Extensions to two-factor models, Bates and OUOU, are also explored. Chapter five evaluates the performance of the proposed formulas on the EURUSD options market, demonstrating the superior accuracy of the new method.
  The dissertation successfully meets its research objectives, expanding tools for derivative pricing and risk assessment. Key contributions include faster and more precise parameter estimation formulas and the introduction of the OUOU model - an extension of the Sch\"obel-Zhu model with a semi-analytical valuation formula for European options, previously unexamined in the literature.</description>

      <title>The Volterra Stein-Stein model with stochastic interest rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01716v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the Volterra Stein-Stein model with stochastic interest rates, where both volatility and interest rates are driven by correlated Gaussian Volterra processes. This framework unifies various well-known Markovian and non-Markovian models while preserving analytical tractability for pricing and hedging financial derivatives. We derive explicit formulas for pricing zero-coupon bond and interest rate cap or floor, along with a semi-explicit expression for the characteristic function of the log-forward index using Fredholm resolvents and determinants. This allows for fast and efficient derivative pricing and calibration via Fourier methods. We calibrate our model to market data and observe that our framework is flexible enough to capture key empirical features, such as the humped-shaped term structure of ATM implied volatilities for cap options and the concave ATM implied volatility skew term structure (in log-log scale) of the S&amp;P 500 options. Finally, we establish connections between our characteristic function formula and expressions that depend on infinite-dimensional Riccati equations, thereby making the link with conventional linear-quadratic models.</description>
