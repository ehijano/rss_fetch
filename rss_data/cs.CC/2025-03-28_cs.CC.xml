      <title>Lattice Based Crypto breaks in a Superposition of Spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the computational implications of a superposition of spacetimes, a phenomenon hypothesized in quantum gravity theories. This was initiated by Shmueli (2024) where the author introduced the complexity class $\mathbf{BQP^{OI}}$ consisting of promise problems decidable by quantum polynomial time algorithms with access to an oracle for computing order interference. In this work, it was shown that the Graph Isomorphism problem and the Gap Closest Vector Problem (with approximation factor $\mathcal{O}(n^{3/2})$) are in $\mathbf{BQP^{OI}}$. We extend this result by showing that the entire complexity class $\mathbf{SZK}$ (Statistical Zero Knowledge) is contained within $\mathbf{BQP^{OI}}$. This immediately implies that the security of numerous lattice based cryptography schemes will be compromised in a computational model based on superposition of spacetimes, since these often rely on the hardness of the Learning with Errors problem, which is in $\mathbf{SZK}$.</description>

      <title>Time hierarchies for sublogarithmic-space quantum computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present new results on the landscape of problems that can be solved by quantum Turing machines (QTM's) employing severely limited amounts of memory. In this context, we demonstrate two infinite time hierarchies of complexity classes within the ``small space'' regime: For all $i\geq 0$, there is a language that can be recognized by a constant-space machine in $2^{O(n^{1/2^i})}$ time, but not by any sublogarithmic-space QTM in $2^{O(n^{1/2^{i+1}})}$ time. For quantum machines operating within $o(\log \log n)$ space, there exists another hierarchy, each level of which corresponds to an expected runtime of $2^{O((\log n)^i)}$ for a different positive integer $i$. We also improve a quantum advantage result, demonstrating a language that can be recognized by a polynomial-time constant-space QTM, but not by any classical machine using $o(\log \log n)$ space, regardless of the time budget. The implications of our findings for quantum space-time tradeoffs are discussed.</description>

      <title>Matchgate signatures under variable permutations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we give a sufficient and necessary condition for determining whether a matchgate signature retains its property under a certain variable permutation, which can be checked in polynomial time. We also define the concept of permutable matchgate signatures, and use it to erase the gap between Pl-\#CSP and \#CSP on planar graphs in the previous study. We provide a detailed characterization of permutable matchgate signatures as well, by presenting their relation to symmetric matchgate signatures. In addition, we prove a dichotomy for Pl-$\#R_D$-CSP where $D\ge 3$ is an integer.</description>

      <title>On the formalization of the notion of a concurrent algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17821v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Previous papers give accounts of quests for satisfactory formalizations of the classical informal notion of an algorithm and the contemporary informal notion of an interactive algoritm. In this paper, an attempt is made to generalize the results of the former quest to the contemporary informal notion of a concurrent algorithm. The notion of a concurrent proto-algorithm is introduced. The thought is that concurrent algorithms are equivalence classes of concurrent proto-algorithms under an appropriate equivalence relation. Three equivalence relations are defined. Two of them are deemed to be bounds for an appropriate equivalence relation and the third is likely an appropriate one. The connection between concurrency and non-determinism in the presented setting is also addressed.</description>

      <title>Monotone Contractions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10107v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study functions $f : [0, 1]^d \rightarrow [0, 1]^d$ that are both monotone and contracting, and we consider the problem of finding an $\varepsilon$-approximate fixed point of $f$. We show that the problem lies in the complexity class UEOPL. We give an algorithm that finds an $\varepsilon$-approximate fixed point of a three-dimensional monotone contraction using $O(\log (1/\varepsilon))$ queries to $f$. We also give a decomposition theorem that allows us to use this result to obtain an algorithm that finds an $\varepsilon$-approximate fixed point of a $d$-dimensional monotone contraction using $O((c \cdot \log (1/\varepsilon))^{\lceil d / 3 \rceil})$ queries to $f$ for some constant $c$. Moreover, each step of both of our algorithms takes time that is polynomial in the representation of $f$. These results are strictly better than the best-known results for functions that are only monotone, or only contracting.
  All of our results also apply to Shapley stochastic games, which are known to be reducible to the monotone contraction problem. Thus we put Shapley games in UEOPL, and we give a faster algorithm for approximating the value of a Shapley game.</description>

      <title>Computing the Polytope Diameter is Even Harder than NP-hard (Already for Perfect Matchings)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16398v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The diameter of a polytope is a fundamental geometric parameter that plays a crucial role in understanding the efficiency of the simplex method. Despite its central nature, the computational complexity of computing the diameter of a given polytope is poorly understood. Already in 1994, Frieze and Teng [Comp. Compl.] recognized the possibility that this task could potentially be harder than NP-hard, and asked whether the corresponding decision problem is complete for the second stage of the polynomial hierarchy, i.e. $\Pi^p_2$-complete. In the following years, partial results could be obtained. In a cornerstone result, Frieze and Teng themselves proved weak NP-hardness for a family of custom defined polytopes. Sanit\`a [FOCS18] in a break-through result proved that already for the much simpler fractional matching polytope the problem is strongly NP-hard. Very recently, Steiner and N\"obel [SODA25] generalized this result to the even simpler bipartite perfect matching polytope and the circuit diameter. In this paper, we finally show that computing the diameter of the bipartite perfect matching polytope is $\Pi^p_2$-hard. Since the corresponding decision problem is also trivially contained in $\Pi^p_2$, this decidedly answers Frieze and Teng's 30 year old question. Our results also hold when the diameter is replaced by the circuit diameter. As our second main result, we prove that for some $\varepsilon &gt; 0$ the (circuit) diameter of the bipartite perfect matching polytope cannot be approximated by a factor better than $(1 + \varepsilon)$. This answers a recent question by N\"obel and Steiner. It is the first known inapproximability result for the circuit diameter, and extends Sanit\`a's inapproximability result of the diameter to the totally unimodular case.</description>

      <title>An Exponential Separation Between Quantum and Quantum-Inspired Classical Algorithms for Linear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02087v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Achieving a provable exponential quantum speedup for an important machine learning task has been a central research goal since the seminal HHL quantum algorithm for solving linear systems and the subsequent quantum recommender systems algorithm by Kerenidis and Prakash. These algorithms were initially believed to be strong candidates for exponential speedups, but a lower bound ruling out similar classical improvements remained absent. In breakthrough work by Tang, it was demonstrated that this lack of progress in classical lower bounds was for good reasons. Concretely, she gave a classical counterpart of the quantum recommender systems algorithm, reducing the quantum advantage to a mere polynomial. Her approach is quite general and was named quantum-inspired classical algorithms. Since then, almost all the initially exponential quantum machine learning speedups have been reduced to polynomial via new quantum-inspired classical algorithms. From the current state-of-affairs, it is unclear whether we can hope for exponential quantum speedups for any natural machine learning task.
  In this work, we present the first such provable exponential separation between quantum and quantum-inspired classical algorithms for the basic problem of solving a linear system when the input matrix is well-conditioned and has sparse rows and columns.</description>

      <title>Time and Memory Trade-off of KV-Cache Compression in Tensor Transformer Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11108v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The key-value (KV) cache in the tensor version of transformers presents a significant bottleneck during inference. While previous work analyzes the fundamental space complexity barriers in standard attention mechanisms [Haris and Onak, 2025], our work generalizes the space complexity barriers result to tensor attention version. Our theoretical contributions rely on a reduction from communication complexity and deduce the memory lower bound for tensor-structured attention mechanisms when $d = \Omega(\log n)$. Furthermore, we introduce two types of tensor attention cache and present a trade-off between time and memory for two scenarios. Overall, our work provides a theoretical foundation for us to understand the time-memory tradeoff of KV-Cache compression in tensor attention decoding and offers more perspectives in developing more memory-efficient tensor attention Transformer architectures.</description>
