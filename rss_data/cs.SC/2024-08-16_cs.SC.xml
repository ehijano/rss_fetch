      <title>Algebraic Representations for Faster Predictions in Convolutional Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are a popular choice of model for tasks in computer vision. When CNNs are made with many layers, resulting in a deep neural network, skip connections may be added to create an easier gradient optimization problem while retaining model expressiveness. In this paper, we show that arbitrarily complex, trained, linear CNNs with skip connections can be simplified into a single-layer model, resulting in greatly reduced computational requirements during prediction time. We also present a method for training nonlinear models with skip connections that are gradually removed throughout training, giving the benefits of skip connections without requiring computational overhead during during prediction time. These results are demonstrated with practical examples on Residual Networks (ResNet) architecture.</description>

      <title>ONSEP: A Novel Online Neural-Symbolic Framework for Event Prediction Based on Large Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07840v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the realm of event prediction, temporal knowledge graph forecasting (TKGF) stands as a pivotal technique. Previous approaches face the challenges of not utilizing experience during testing and relying on a single short-term history, which limits adaptation to evolving data. In this paper, we introduce the Online Neural-Symbolic Event Prediction (ONSEP) framework, which innovates by integrating dynamic causal rule mining (DCRM) and dual history augmented generation (DHAG). DCRM dynamically constructs causal rules from real-time data, allowing for swift adaptation to new causal relationships. In parallel, DHAG merges short-term and long-term historical contexts, leveraging a bi-branch approach to enrich event prediction. Our framework demonstrates notable performance enhancements across diverse datasets, with significant Hit@k (k=1,3,10) improvements, showcasing its ability to augment large language models (LLMs) for event prediction without necessitating extensive retraining. The ONSEP framework not only advances the field of TKGF but also underscores the potential of neural-symbolic approaches in adapting to dynamic data environments.</description>
