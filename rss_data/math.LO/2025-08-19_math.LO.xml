      <title>Filling in the semantics for intuitionistic conditional logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove completeness results for a wide variety of intuitionistic conditional logics. We do so by first using a duality to transfer algebraic completeness to completeness with respect to conditional Esakia spaces, a topologised version of a conditional Kripke frame. We then use so-called fill-ins to obtain completeness results with respect to classes conditional of Kripke frames. The fill-ins close the gap between conditional Esakia spaces, which do not have a canonical underlying frame, and conditional Kripke frames.</description>

      <title>Dominating numbers at singular cardinals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the generalized dominating number $\mathfrak{d}_{\mu}$ at a singular cardinal $\mu$ of cofinality $\kappa$. We show two lower bounds: in ZFC, $\mathrm{cf}([\mu]^\kappa,\subseteq) \leq \mathfrak{d}_{\mu}$, and under mild cardinal-arithmetic assumptions, $2^{&lt;\mu} \leq \mathfrak{d}_{\mu}$. We also clarify when $\mathfrak{d}_{\mu}$ can differ from $2^{\mu}$: assuming GCH and $\kappa = \mathrm{cf}(\mu) &gt; \omega$, a finite-support iteration of Cohen forcing of length $\mu^{++}$ yields $\mathfrak{d}_{\mu} &lt; 2^{\mu}$. On the other hand, for $\kappa = \mathrm{cf}(\mu) = \omega$, natural $\mu$-cc posets force $\mathfrak{d}_{\mu} = 2^{\mu}$.</description>

      <title>A Logic of Stability: Formalizing Similarity in Counterfactual Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Counterfactual reasoning is a foundational topic in both philosophical and logical studies \cite{Stalnaker1968-STAATO-5, Lewis1973-LEWC-2}. A pivotal component of counterfactual analysis is the concept of similarity between possible worlds \cite{CORR_A_2022, ESTEVA1997235, Lewis1979-LEWCDA, Makinson94, Pollock1976-POLTPW}. In this paper, we propose the introdutcion of a metric to quantify the degree of similarity between possible worlds, where two worlds are the more similar the longer they share a common history, drawing on a similarity framework influenced by \cite{Lewis1979-LEWCDA}. We prove that this metric satisfies the properties of an ultra-metric, offering a mathematically robust foundation for a corresponding graded notion of hierarchical similarity. We develop and axiomatize a multi-modal logic of similarity, \( L_{\square_\varepsilon} \), and demonstrate its soundness and completeness with respect to the class of ultra-metric spaces. Finally, we explore modal definability, establishing connections between ultra-metric semantics and the broader theory of counterfactuals.</description>

      <title>The Uniform Functional Interpretation with Informative Types</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss a new approach to functional interpretations based on uniform quantification and relativization. The uniform quantification in the background permits a more penetrating analysis of principles related to collection and contra-collection. Relativization comes from a computationally informative notion of being an element of a given type. The approach is flexible. When the information takes the shape of bounds, we can recapture a form of the combination of G\"odel's functional dialectica interpretation with majorizability. When the information is "canonical" in function types, we obtain new functional interpretations and new models of G\"odel's theory T.</description>

      <title>A robust family of residually finite groups; spectra of residual finiteness growth, computability properties, and other applications (with an appendix by Arman Darbinyan and Emmanuel Rauzy)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11973v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a family of residually finite groups that helps us to systematically study the residual finiteness growth function (RFG) from various perspectives.
  First, by strengthening results of Bou-Rabee and Seward and also of Bradford, we show that any non-decreasing function $f: \nn \rightarrow \nn$ that satisfies $f(n) &gt; \exp{(\varepsilon n\log{n})}$ for some $\varepsilon&gt;0$ can be realized (up to the standard equivalence) as RFG function of a two-generated residually finite group. Moreover, such a group can be found among solvable groups of derived length $3$; due to what, in a strengthened way, we extend a theorem of Kharlampovich, Miasnikov and Sapir.
  {Next, we consider computability aspects related to those growth functions. In particular, we characterize the decidability of the word problem in residually finite groups with respect to \emph{individual residual finiteness depth} functions. Then, we give a full description of sufficiently fast {growing} functions that are realizable as RFG for some group \emph{with decidable word problem} in terms of \emph{left-computable functions.} We also show that a Turing degree can be realized via RFG of a group with decidable word problem if and only if it is recursively enumerable.
  Finally, applying the introduced theoretical framework, we answer several open questions and extend known results. For example, answering a question of Minasyan, by providing a construction, we show the existence of conjugacy separable groups with decidable word problem and undecidable conjugacy problem. Two more applications, including an answer to a question by Nies, can be found in the appendix coauthored with Rauzy.}</description>

Abstract: Let M be the generic poset, defined as the Fra\"iss\'e limit of the class of finite posets. We show that every countably infinite poset A can be embedded with coinfinite image into M so that each automorphism of the image of A extends uniquely to an automorphism of M.</description>

      <title>Uniform Lyndon interpolation for the pure logic of necessitation with a modal reduction principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10176v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove the uniform Lyndon interpolation property (ULIP) of some extensions of the pure logic of necessitation $\mathbf{N}$. For any $m, n \in \mathbb{N}$, $\mathbf{N}^+\mathbf{A}_{m,n}$ is the logic obtained from $\mathbf{N}$ by adding a single axiom $\Box^n \varphi \to \Box^m \varphi$, $\Diamond$-free modal reduction principle, together with a rule $\frac{\neg \Box \varphi}{\neg \Box \Box \varphi}$, required to make the logic complete with respect to its Kripke-like semantics. We first introduce a sequent calculus $\mathbf{GN}^+\mathbf{A}_{m,n}$ for $\mathbf{N}^+\mathbf{A}_{m,n}$ and show that it enjoys cut elimination, proving Craig and Lyndon interpolation properties as a consequence. We then introduce a general method, called propositionalization, that enables one to reduce ULIP of a logic to some weaker logic. Lastly, we construct a propositionalization of $\mathbf{N}^+\mathbf{A}_{m,n}$ into classical propositional logic $\mathbf{Cl}$, proving ULIP as a corollary. We also prove ULIP of $\mathbf{NA}_{m,n} = \mathbf{N} + \Box^n \varphi \to \Box^m \varphi$ and $\mathbf{NRA}_{m,n} = \mathbf{N} + \Box^n \varphi \to \Box^m \varphi + \frac{\neg \varphi}{\neg \Box \varphi}$ in the same manner.</description>

      <title>Extensive embeddings into Fra\"iss\'e structures and stationary weak independence relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06370v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $M$ be a Fra\"iss\'e structure (a countably infinite ultrahomogeneous structure). We call an embedding $f : A \to M$ extensive if each automorphism of its image extends to an automorphism of $M$, where the extension map respects composition, and we say that $M$ has extensible $\omega$-age if each substructure admits an extensive embedding into $M$.
  We investigate the relationship between the following two properties: the presence of a stationary weak independence relation (SWIR) on $M$, and extensibility of the $\omega$-age of $M$. We show that linearly ordered Fra\"iss\'e structures with a SWIR have extensible $\omega$-age, but also we give examples of Fra\"iss\'e structures where only one of the two properties holds. Finally, we consider whether a wide range of examples of Fra\"iss\'e structures have extensible $\omega$-age or a finite SWIR expansion, including all countably infinite ultrahomogeneous oriented graphs (with one exception).</description>

      <title>Ext groups in Homotopy Type Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.09639v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ext groups are fundamental homological invariants which have important applications in homotopy theory and algebra. In particular, they appear in the classical universal coefficient theorem, a key computational tool in homotopy theory. Motivated by the goal of extending such tools to synethetic homotopy theory, we develop the theory of Yoneda Ext groups [Yon54] over a ring in homotopy type theory (HoTT) and describe their interpretation into an $\infty$-topos. The Yoneda approach to Ext groups does not require projective or injective resolutions, which is a crucial in HoTT since we do not know that such resolutions exist. While it produces group objects that are a priori, we show that the $\mathrm{Ext}^1$ groups are equivalent to small groups, leaving open the question of whether the higher Ext groups are essentially small as well. We also show that the $\mathrm{Ext}^1$ groups take on the usual form as a product of cyclic groups whenever the input modules are finitely presented and the ring is a PID (in the constructive sense).
  When interpreted into an $\infty$-topos of sheaves on a 1-category, our Ext groups recover (and give a resolution-free approach to) sheaf Ext groups, which arise in algebraic geometry [Gro57]. (These are also called "local" Ext groups.) We may therefore interpret results about Ext from HoTT and apply them to sheaf Ext. To show this, we prove that injectivity of modules in HoTT interprets to internal injectivity in these models. It follows, for example, that sheaf Ext can be computed using resolutions which are projective or injective in the sense of HoTT, when they exist, and we give an example of this in the projective case. We also discuss the relation between internal $\mathbb{Z} G$-modules (for a $0$-truncated group object $G$) and abelian groups in the slice over $BG$, and study the interpretation of our Ext groups in both settings.</description>

      <title>Twenty years of Ne\v{s}et\v{r}il's classification programme of Ramsey classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17293v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the 1970s, structural Ramsey theory emerged as a new branch of combinatorics. This development came with the isolation of the concepts of the $\mathbf{A}$-Ramsey property and Ramsey class. Following the influential Ne\v{s}et\v{r}il-R\"odl theorem, several Ramsey classes have been identified. In the 1980s, Ne\v{s}et\v{r}il, inspired by a seminar of Lachlan, discovered a crucial connection between Ramsey classes and Fra\"iss\'e classes, and, in his 1989 paper, connected the classification programme of homogeneous structures to structural Ramsey theory. In 2005, Kechris, Pestov, and Todor\v{c}evi\'c revitalized the field by connecting Ramsey classes to topological dynamics. This breakthrough motivated Ne\v{s}et\v{r}il to propose a program for classifying Ramsey classes. We review the progress made on this program in the past two decades, list open problems, and discuss recent extensions to new areas, namely the extension property for partial automorphisms (EPPA), and big Ramsey structures.</description>

      <title>Encoding Argumentation Frameworks to Propositional Logic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07351v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper generalizes the encoding of argumentation frameworks beyond the classical 2-valued propositional logic system ($PL_2$) to 3-valued propositional logic systems ($PL_3$s) and fuzzy propositional logic systems ($PL_{[0,1]}s$), employing two key encodings: normal encoding ($ec_1$) and regular encoding ($ec_2$). Specifically, via $ec_1$ and $ec_2$, we establish model relationships between Dung's classical semantics (stable and complete semantics) and the encoded semantics associated with Kleene's $PL_3$ and {\L}ukasiewicz's $PL_3$. Through $ec_1$, we also explore connections between Gabbay's real equational semantics and the encoded semantics of $PL_{[0,1]}s$, including showing that Gabbay's $Eq_{\text{max}}^R$ and $Eq_{\text{inverse}}^R$ correspond to the fuzzy encoded semantics of $PL_{[0,1]}^G$ and $PL_{[0,1]}^P$ respectively. Additionally, we propose a new fuzzy encoded semantics ($Eq^L$) associated with {\L}ukasiewicz's $PL_{[0,1]}$ and investigate interactions between complete semantics and fuzzy encoded semantics. This work strengthens the links between argumentation frameworks and propositional logic systems, providing a framework for constructing new argumentation semantics.</description>
