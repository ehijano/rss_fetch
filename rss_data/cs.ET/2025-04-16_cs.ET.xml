      <title>Heating reduction as collective action: Impact on attitudes, behavior and energy consumption in a Polish field experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heating and hot water usage account for nearly 80% of household energy consumption in the European Union. In order to reach the EU New Deal goals, new policies to reduce heat energy consumption are indispensable. However, research targeting reductions concentrates either on technical building interventions without considerations of people's behavior, or psychological interventions with no technical interference. Such interventions can be promising, but their true potential for scaling up can only be realized by testing approaches that integrate behavioral and technical solutions in tandem rather than in isolation. In this research, we study a mix of psychological and technical interventions targeting heating and hot water demand among students in Polish university dormitories. We evaluate effects on building energy consumption, behavioral spillovers and on social beliefs and attitudes in a pre-post quasi-experimental mixed-method field study in three student dormitories. Our findings reveal that the most effective approaches to yield energy savings were a direct, collectively framed request to students to reduce thermostat settings for the environment, and an automated technical adjustment of the heating curve temperature. Conversely, interventions targeting domestic hot water had unintended effects, including increased energy use and negative spillovers, such as higher water consumption. Further, we find that informing students about their active, collective participation had a positive impact on perceived social norms. Our findings highlight the importance of trialing interventions in controlled real-world settings to understand the interplay between technical systems, behaviors, and social impacts to enable scalable, evidence-based policies driving an effective and sustainable energy transition.</description>

      <title>Assessing the Elephant in the Room in Scheduling for Current Hybrid HPC-QC Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing resources are among the most promising candidates for extending the computational capabilities of High-Performance Computing (HPC) systems. As a result, HPC-quantum integration has become an increasingly active area of research. While much of the existing literature has focused on software stack integration and quantum circuit compilation, key challenges such as hybrid resource allocation and job scheduling-especially relevant in the current Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum era-have received less attention. In this work, we highlight these critical issues in the context of integrating quantum computers with operational HPC environments, taking into account the current maturity and heterogeneity of quantum technologies. We then propose a set of conceptual strategies aimed at addressing these challenges and paving the way for practical HPC-QC integration in the near future.</description>

      <title>Lattice Surgery Compilation Beyond the Surface Code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large-scale fault-tolerant quantum computation requires compiling logical circuits into physical operations tailored to a given architecture. Prior work addressing this challenge has mostly focused on the surface code and lattice surgery schemes. In this work, we broaden the scope by considering lattice surgery compilation for topological codes beyond the surface code. We begin by defining a code substrate - a blueprint for implementing topological codes and lattice surgery. We then abstract from the microscopic details and rephrase the compilation task as a mapping and routing problem on a macroscopic routing graph, potentially subject to substrate-specific constraints. We explore specific substrates and codes, including the color code and the folded surface code, providing detailed microscopic constructions. For the color code, we present numerical simulations analyzing how design choices at the microscopic and macroscopic levels affect the depth of compiled logical $\mathrm{CNOT}+\mathrm{T}$ circuits. An open-source code is available on GitHub https://github.com/cda-tum/mqt-qecc.</description>

      <title>Ride-pool Assignment Algorithms: Modern Implementation and Swapping Heuristics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On-demand ride-pooling has emerged as a popular urban transportation solution, addressing the efficiency limitations of traditional ride-hailing services by grouping multiple riding requests with spatiotemporal proximity into a single vehicle. Although numerous algorithms have been developed for the Ride-pool Assignment Problem (RAP) -- a core component of ride-pooling systems, there is a lack of open-source implementations, making it difficult to benchmark these algorithms on a common dataset and objective. In this paper, we present the implementation details of a ride-pool simulator that encompasses several key ride-pool assignment algorithms, along with associated components such as vehicle routing and rebalancing. We also open-source a highly optimized and modular C++ codebase, designed to facilitate the extension of new algorithms and features. Additionally, we introduce a family of swapping-based local-search heuristics to enhance existing ride-pool assignment algorithms, achieving a better balance between performance and computational efficiency. Extensive experiments on a large-scale, real-world dataset from Manhattan, NYC reveal that while all selected algorithms perform comparably, the newly proposed Multi-Round Linear Assignment with Cyclic Exchange (LA-MR-CE) algorithm achieves a state-of-the-art service rate with significantly reduced computational time. Furthermore, an in-depth analysis suggests that a performance barrier exists for all myopic ride-pool assignment algorithms due to the system's capacity bottleneck, and incorporating future information could be key to overcoming this limitation.</description>

      <title>The Art of Audience Engagement: LLM-Based Thin-Slicing of Scientific Talks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper examines the thin-slicing approach - the ability to make accurate judgments based on minimal information - in the context of scientific presentations. Drawing on research from nonverbal communication and personality psychology, we show that brief excerpts (thin slices) reliably predict overall presentation quality. Using a novel corpus of over one hundred real-life science talks, we employ Large Language Models (LLMs) to evaluate transcripts of full presentations and their thin slices. By correlating LLM-based evaluations of short excerpts with full-talk assessments, we determine how much information is needed for accurate predictions. Our results demonstrate that LLM-based evaluations align closely with human ratings, proving their validity, reliability, and efficiency. Critically, even very short excerpts (less than 10 percent of a talk) strongly predict overall evaluations. This suggests that the first moments of a presentation convey relevant information that is used in quality evaluations and can shape lasting impressions. The findings are robust across different LLMs and prompting strategies. This work extends thin-slicing research to public speaking and connects theories of impression formation to LLMs and current research on AI communication. We discuss implications for communication and social cognition research on message reception. Lastly, we suggest an LLM-based thin-slicing framework as a scalable feedback tool to enhance human communication.</description>

      <title>Simon's Period Finding on a Quantum Annealer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10771v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dating to 1994, Simon's period-finding algorithm is among the earliest and most fragile of quantum algorithms. The algorithm's fragility arises from the requirement that, to solve an n qubit problem, one must fault-tolerantly sample O(n) linearly independent values from a solution space. In this paper, we study an adiabatic implementation of Simon's algorithm that requires a constant number of successful samples regardless of problem size. We implement this algorithm on D-Wave hardware and solve problems with up to 298 qubits. We compare the runtime of classical algorithms to the D-Wave solution to analyze any potential advantage.</description>

      <title>Evaluating DAO Sustainability and Longevity Through On-Chain Governance Metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decentralised Autonomous Organisations (DAOs) automate governance and resource allocation through smart contracts, aiming to shift decision-making to distributed token holders. However, many DAOs face sustainability challenges linked to limited user participation, concentrated voting power, and technical design constraints. This paper addresses these issues by identifying research gaps in DAO evaluation and introducing a framework of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) that capture governance efficiency, financial robustness, decentralisation, and community engagement. We apply the framework to a custom-built dataset of real-world DAOs constructed from on-chain data and analysed using non-parametric methods. The results reveal recurring governance patterns, including low participation rates and high proposer concentration, which may undermine long-term viability. The proposed KPIs offer a replicable, data-driven method for assessing DAO governance structures and identifying potential areas for improvement. These findings support a multidimensional approach to evaluating decentralised systems and provide practical tools for researchers and practitioners working to improve the resilience and effectiveness of DAO-based governance models.</description>

      <title>Molecular Signal Reception in Complex Vessel Networks: The Role of the Network Topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15943v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The notion of synthetic molecular communication (MC) refers to the transmission of information via molecules and is largely foreseen for use within the human body, where traditional electromagnetic wave (EM)-based communication is impractical. MC is anticipated to enable innovative medical applications, such as early-stage tumor detection, targeted drug delivery, and holistic approaches like the Internet of Bio-Nano Things (IoBNT). Many of these applications involve parts of the human cardiovascular system (CVS), here referred to as networks, posing challenges for MC due to their complex, highly branched vessel structures. To gain a better understanding of how the topology of such branched vessel networks affects the reception of a molecular signal at a target location, e.g., the network outlet, we present a generic analytical end-to-end model that characterizes molecule propagation and reception in linear branched vessel networks (LBVNs). We specialize this generic model to any MC system employing superparamagnetic iron-oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) as signaling molecules and a planar coil as receiver (RX). By considering components that have been previously established in testbeds, we effectively isolate the impact of the network topology and validate our theoretical model with testbed data. Additionally, we propose two metrics, namely the molecule delay and the multi-path spread, that relate the LBVN topology to the molecule dispersion induced by the network, thereby linking the network structure to the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the target location. This allows the characterization of the SNR at any point in the network solely based on the network topology. Consequently, our framework can, e.g., be exploited for optimal sensor placement in the CVS or identification of suitable testbed topologies for given SNR requirements.</description>

      <title>Evolving Hard Maximum Cut Instances for Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12012v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms, such as the Recursive Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (RQAOA), have become increasingly popular, offering promising avenues for employing Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum devices to address challenging combinatorial optimization tasks like the maximum cut problem. In this study, we utilize an evolutionary algorithm equipped with a unique fitness function. This approach targets hard maximum cut instances within the latent space of a Graph Autoencoder, identifying those that pose significant challenges or are particularly tractable for RQAOA, in contrast to the classic Goemans and Williamson algorithm. Our findings not only delineate the distinct capabilities and limitations of each algorithm but also expand our understanding of RQAOA's operational limits. Furthermore, the diverse set of graphs we have generated serves as a crucial benchmarking asset, emphasizing the need for more advanced algorithms to tackle combinatorial optimization challenges. Additionally, our results pave the way for new avenues in graph generation research, offering exciting opportunities for future explorations.</description>
