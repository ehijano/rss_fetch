      <title>Wild knots embedded in the Menger Sponge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove that there exist infinitely many non-equivalent wild knots embedded in the Menger sponge, each with its set of wild points being a subset of a tame Cantor set. Even more, any wild knot of dynamically defined type obtained as the inverse limit of a sequence of nested pearl chain necklaces constructed via the action of a Kleinian group is isotopic to a wild knot contained in the Menger sponge. As a consequence, there are infinitely many wild knots contained in the Sierpi\'nski 2-dimensional carpet.</description>

      <title>An algorithm for Seifert surfaces in 3-manifolds via surgery presentations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classical Seifert algorithm provides an explicit construction of a Seifert surface for any link in $S^3$. Alegria and Menasco extended this construction to integral homology $3$-spheres using Heegaard splittings. In this paper, we extend the Seifert algorithm to null-homologous links in arbitrary $3$-manifolds via surgery on framed links in $S^3$.</description>

      <title>The fundamental quandle of ribbon concordances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20841v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe the fundamental quandle of a properly embedded surface $F$ (possibly with boundary) in $\mathbb{R} ^{3}\times I$, and derive its presentation in terms of a motion picture diagram or a CH-diagram of $F$. Our study is based on the topological definition of the fundamental quandle. We prove that a ribbon concordance $C$ from a classical knot $K_1$ to $K_0$ gives rise to an injective quandle homomorphism $Q(K_0)\to Q(C)$ and a surjective quandle homomorphism $Q(K_1)\to Q(C)$.</description>

      <title>Ribbon concordance and fibered predecessors, II: the general case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The first and third authors recently proved that for each knot $K\subset S^3$ there are only finitely many hyperbolic fibered knots which are ribbon concordant to $K$. In this paper, we remove the hyperbolic constraint, proving that every knot in $S^3$ has only finitely many fibered predecessors under ribbon concordance. The key new input is an inequality relating the knot Floer homology of a generalized satellite knot with that of its companion, proved via the immersed curves formulation of bordered Heegaard Floer homology, which should be of independent interest. Our work, together with results of Kojima--McShane, also leads to an explicit upper bound on the Gromov norm of the complement of any fibered predecessor of a knot $K \subset S^3$, in terms of the arc index and genus of $K$.</description>

      <title>Realizing groups as symmetries of infinite translation surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.00158v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a complete classification of groups that can be realized as isometry groups of a translation surface $M$ with non-finitely generated fundamental group and no planar ends. Furthermore, we demonstrate that if $S$ has no non-displaceable subsurfaces and its space of ends is self-similar, then every countable subgroup of $\operatorname{GL}^+(2,\mathbb{R})$ can be realized as the Veech group of a translation surface $M$ homeomorphic to $S$. The latter result generalizes and improves upon the previous findings of Przytycki-Valdez-Weitze-Schmith\"{u}sen and Maluendas-Valdez. To prove these results, we adapt ideas from the work of Aougab-Patel-Vlamis, which focused on hyperbolic surfaces, to translation surfaces.</description>

      <title>Quantitative PL bordism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16389v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study PL bordism theories from a quantitative perspective. Such theories include those of PL manifolds, ordinary homology theory, as well as various more exotic theories such as bordism of Witt spaces. In all these cases we show that a null-bordant cycle of bounded geometry and $V$ simplices has a filling of bounded geometry whose number of simplices is slightly superlinear in $V$. This bound is similar to that found in our previous work on smooth cobordism.</description>

      <title>Maps between Boundaries of Relatively Hyperbolic Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14863v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: F. Paulin proved that if the Gromov boundaries of two hyperbolic groups are quasi-Mobius equivalent, then the groups themselves are quasi-isometric. The goal of this article is to extend Paulin's result to the setting of relatively hyperbolic groups by introducing the notion of relative quasi-Mobius maps between the Bowditch boundaries of relatively hyperbolic groups. We show that any coarsely cusp-preserving quasi-isometry between two relatively hyperbolic groups induces a homeomorphism between their Bowditch boundaries, and that this induced homeomorphism is relative quasi-Mobius and linearly distorts the exit points of bi-infinite geodesics into combinatorial horoballs. Conversely, we prove that if a homeomorphism between the Bowditch boundaries of two relatively hyperbolic groups preserves parabolic fixed points and is either relative quasi-Mobius or linearly distorts the exit points of bi-infinite geodesics into combinatorial horoballs, then it arises from a coarsely cusp-preserving quasi-isometry between the groups.</description>

      <title>Diamonds: Homology and the Central Series of Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.08283v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish an analog of a theorem of Stallings which asserts the homomorphisms between the universal nilpotent quotients induced by a homomorphism $G \to H$ of groups are isomorphisms provided a pair of homological conditions are satisfied. Our analogy does not have a homomorphism between $G$ and $H$ but instead $G,H \leq G_0$ that satisfies a similar homological condition. We derive a few applications of this result. First, we show that there exist pairs of non-isomorphic number fields whose absolute Galois groups have isomorphic universal nilpotent quotients. We show that there exists pairs of non-isometric hyperbolic $n$-manifolds whose fundamental groups are residually nilpotent and have isomorphic universal nilpotent quotients. These are the first examples of residually nilpotent Kleinian groups with arbitrarily large nilpotent genus. Complex hyperbolic 2-manifold examples are given as well. Considering Riemann surfaces and complex hyperbolic 2-manifolds as projective curves and surfaces defined over a number field, we show the (outer) action of the absolute Galois group of the field of definition on the universal nilpotent quotients of the geometric fundamental groups are equivalent. This is in contrast to fact that the (outer) Galois action on the geometric fundamental group of a projective hyperbolic curve determines the curve by work of Mochizuki. In particular, the nilpotent representation theory of the geometric fundamental group is not anabelian.</description>

      <title>Perverse schobers, stability conditions and quadratic differentials II: relative graded Brauer graph algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00154v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a class of dg-algebras which generalize the classical Brauer graph algebras. They are constructed from mixed-angulations of surfaces and often admit a (relative) Calabi--Yau structure. We discovered these algebras through two very distinct routes, one involving perverse schobers whose stalks are cyclic quotients of the derived categories of relative Ginzburg algebras, and another involving deformations of partially wrapped Fukaya categories of surfaces. Applying the results of our previous work arXiv:2303.18249, we describe the spaces of stability conditions on the derived categories of these algebras in terms of spaces of quadratic differentials.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Dehn Twists in the Outer Automorphism Group of a Free Group</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.15063v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study Dehn twists in the outer automorphism group of a finitely generated non-abelian free group. Our main result states that, under certain compatibility conditions, sufficiently large powers of finitely many Dehn twists generate a right-angled Artin group. The proof proceeds by analyzing the geometry of spheres, tori, and simple closed curves in a doubled handlebody. Along the way, we establish the bigon--bihedron criterion and an equivalent condition for commuting Dehn twists. Furthermore, we construct a compact topological space on which every Dehn twist acts parabolically.</description>

      <title>Quantum modularity of signatures in TQFT and generalized Dedekind sums</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16159v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove the quantum modularity of the signature of $ \mathrm{SU}(2) $-TQFT for a genus 2 surface, which was conjectured by March\'{e}--Masbaum in 2025. Our approach is based on a quantum modularity of generalized Dedekind sums associated with general modular forms. In the case of Eisenstein series for $ \Gamma(N) $, these generalized Dedekind sums admit trigonometric sum expressions, which coincide with the formula for the $ \mathrm{SU}(2) $-TQFT signature. Furthermore, we express both the $ \mathrm{SU}(2) $-TQFT and generalized Dedekind sums as radial limits of Eichler integrals.</description>
