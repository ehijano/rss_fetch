      <title>BarcodeMamba: State Space Models for Biodiversity Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11084</link>

Abstract: DNA barcodes are crucial in biodiversity analysis for building automatic identification systems that recognize known species and discover unseen species. Unlike human genome modeling, barcode-based invertebrate identification poses challenges in the vast diversity of species and taxonomic complexity. Among Transformer-based foundation models, BarcodeBERT excelled in species-level identification of invertebrates, highlighting the effectiveness of self-supervised pretraining on barcode-specific datasets. Recently, structured state space models (SSMs) have emerged, with a time complexity that scales sub-quadratically with the context length. SSMs provide an efficient parameterization of sequence modeling relative to attention-based architectures. Given the success of Mamba and Mamba-2 in natural language, we designed BarcodeMamba, a performant and efficient foundation model for DNA barcodes in biodiversity analysis. We conducted a comprehensive ablation study on the impacts of self-supervised training and tokenization methods, and compared both versions of Mamba layers in terms of expressiveness and their capacity to identify "unseen" species held back from training. Our study shows that BarcodeMamba has better performance than BarcodeBERT even when using only 8.3% as many parameters, and improves accuracy to 99.2% on species-level accuracy in linear probing without fine-tuning for "seen" species. In our scaling study, BarcodeMamba with 63.6% of BarcodeBERT's parameters achieved 70.2% genus-level accuracy in 1-nearest neighbor (1-NN) probing for unseen species. The code repository to reproduce our experiments is available at https://github.com/bioscan-ml/BarcodeMamba.</description>

      <title>BioKlustering: a web app for semi-supervised learning of maximally imbalanced genomic data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.11730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.11730v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Summary: Accurate phenotype prediction from genomic sequences is a highly coveted task in biological and medical research. While machine-learning holds the key to accurate prediction in a variety of fields, the complexity of biological data can render many methodologies inapplicable. We introduce BioKlustering, a user-friendly open-source and publicly available web app for unsupervised and semi-supervised learning specialized for cases when sequence alignment and/or experimental phenotyping of all classes are not possible. Among its main advantages, BioKlustering 1) allows for maximally imbalanced settings of partially observed labels including cases when only one class is observed, which is currently prohibited in most semi-supervised methods, 2) takes unaligned sequences as input and thus, allows learning for widely diverse sequences (impossible to align) such as virus and bacteria, 3) is easy to use for anyone with little or no programming expertise, and 4) works well with small sample sizes.
  Availability and Implementation: BioKlustering (https://bioklustering.wid.wisc.edu) is a freely available web app implemented with Django, a Python-based framework, with all major browsers supported. The web app does not need any installation, and it is publicly available and open-source (https://github.com/solislemuslab/bioklustering).</description>

      <title>PRAGA: Prototype-aware Graph Adaptive Aggregation for Spatial Multi-modal Omics Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12728v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spatial multi-modal omics technology, highlighted by Nature Methods as an advanced biological technique in 2023, plays a critical role in resolving biological regulatory processes with spatial context. Recently, graph neural networks based on K-nearest neighbor (KNN) graphs have gained prominence in spatial multi-modal omics methods due to their ability to model semantic relations between sequencing spots. However, the fixed KNN graph fails to capture the latent semantic relations hidden by the inevitable data perturbations during the biological sequencing process, resulting in the loss of semantic information. In addition, the common lack of spot annotation and class number priors in practice further hinders the optimization of spatial multi-modal omics models. Here, we propose a novel spatial multi-modal omics resolved framework, termed PRototype-Aware Graph Adaptative Aggregation for Spatial Multi-modal Omics Analysis (PRAGA). PRAGA constructs a dynamic graph to capture latent semantic relations and comprehensively integrate spatial information and feature semantics. The learnable graph structure can also denoise perturbations by learning cross-modal knowledge. Moreover, a dynamic prototype contrastive learning is proposed based on the dynamic adaptability of Bayesian Gaussian Mixture Models to optimize the multi-modal omics representations for unknown biological priors. Quantitative and qualitative experiments on simulated and real datasets with 7 competing methods demonstrate the superior performance of PRAGA. Code is available at https://github.com/Xubin-s-Lab/PRAGA.</description>
