      <title>Exceptional Topology on Nonorientable Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We classify gapped and gapless phases of non-Hermitian band structures on two-dimensional nonorientable parameter spaces. Such spaces arise in a wide range of physical systems in the presence of non-symmorphic parameter space symmetries. For gapped phases, we find that nonorientable spaces provide a natural setting for exploring fundamental structural problems in braid group theory, such as torsion and conjugacy. Gapless phases, which host exceptional points (EPs), explicitly violate the fermion doubling theorem, even in two-band models. We demonstrate that EPs traversing the nonorientable parameter space exhibit non-Abelian charge inversion. These braided phases and their transitions leave distinct signatures in the form of bulk Fermi arc degeneracies, offering a concrete route toward experimental realization and verification.</description>

      <title>Revealing Quantum Geometry in Nonlinear Quantum Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Berry curvature-related topological phenomena have been a central topic in condensed matter physics. Yet, until recently other quantum geometric quantities such as the metric and connection received only little attention due to the relatively few effects which have been documented for them. This review gives a modern perspective how quantum geometric quantities naturally enter the nonlinear responses of quantum materials and demonstrate their deep connection with excitation energy, lifetimes, symmetry, and corresponding physical processes. The multitude of nonlinear responses can be subdivided into nonlinear optical effects, subgap responses, and nonlinear transport phenomena. Such a distinction by energy scales facilitates an intuitive understanding of the underlying electronic transitions, giving rise to a unified picture of the electron motion beyond linear order. The well-known injection and shift currents constitute the main resonances in the optical regime. Exploiting their respective lifetime and symmetry dependencies, this review elucidates how these resonances can be distinguished by a corresponding quantum geometric quantity that shares the same symmetry. This is followed by a brief exposition of the role of quasiparticle lifetimes for nonlinear subgap responses, which presents a window into the microscopic short-term dynamics as well as the ground state correlation and localization. We conclude with an account of the anomalous motion due to the Berry curvature dipole and quantum metric dipole in nonlinear transport, clarifying the correspondence between physical observables and the underlying mechanisms. This review highlights the close relationship between quantum geometry and nonlinear response, showing the way towards promising probes of quantum geometry and enabling novel avenues to characterize complex materials.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Spin Transport in a Topological Insulator Thin Film</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological insulators (TIs) are intriguing materials for advanced computing applications based on spintronics because they can host robust spin effects. For instance, TIs have intrinsically large spin generation enabled by their large spin-orbit coupling. Furthermore, topological surface states (TSS) with spin-momentum locking and Dirac dispersion lead to long spin diffusion. Future spintronic device technology will require scalable film growth of high-quality material. We grow epitaxial films of Bi$_{1-x}$Sb$_x$Te$_{3-y}$Se$_y$ (BSTS, $x = 0.58, y = 1$) and confirm the gapless band structure with optimal doping using angle-resolved photoelectron spectra. The temperature dependence of longitudinal resistivity shows bulk transport is suppressed as temperature is decreased, and at low temperature surface transport dominates. We evaluate the spin transport properties in BSTS without using ferromagnetic tunnel contacts via a non-local resistance experiment as a function of temperature and applied charge current. As expected, these experiments reveal the necessity of decreasing the bulk conduction to best enhance the spin transport. In the TSS, we find high efficiency of charge-to-spin conversion (spin Hall angle, $\theta_{SH} \approx 1$) and spin diffusion over several microns. Further development of high-quality TIs will make them viable candidates for efficient and lossless spintronics.pment of high-quality TIs will make them viable candidates for efficient and lossless spintronics.</description>

      <title>The singlet-triplet and exchange-only flopping-mode spin qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semiconductor-based spin qubits embedded into a superconducting microwave cavity constitute a fast-progressing and promising platform for realizing fast and fault-tolerant qubit control with long-range two-qubit coupling. The flopping-mode spin qubit consists of a single electron in a double quantum dot; it combines a charge qubit with a spin qubit. With its strong and tunable cavity coupling, the flopping-mode qubit is proven to be well-suited for low-power qubit control and cavity-mediated long-range quantum gates. The singlet-triplet (ST) and exchange-only (EO) qubits are multi-electron realizations that go without broadband control and are protected from some types of noise, but are challenging to couple to each other and to microwave cavities. We combine the flopping-mode concept with the ST and EO qubits and propose two new flopping-mode qubits that consist of three (four) quantum dots, occupied by two (three) electrons near the (1,0,1) - (0,1,1) [(1,0,1,1) -- (0,1,1,1)] charge transition. The two-electron system augments the $ST_0$ spin qubit with a charge qubit that interacts transversally and longitudinally with a cavity. Both couplings are highly tunable, and the longitudinal coupling distinguishes the flopping-mode ST qubit from the regular flopping-mode qubit. The longitudinal coupling allows for non-dissipative universal control similar to superconducting transmon qubits. The EO flopping-mode qubit comprises four dots occupied by three electrons and opens a new possibility to perform two-qubit gates for EO qubits that are challenging to perform directly with the exchange coupling. We use input-output theory to provide means of extracting the coupling strengths from cavity transmission data.</description>

      <title>Thermal boundary conductance in standalone and non-standalone GaN/AlN heterostructures predicted using machine learning interatomic potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: GaN/AlN interfaces are essential in advanced high-power and high-frequency electronic devices, where effective thermal management is crucial for optimal performance and reliability. This work investigates the thermal boundary conductance (TBC) of standalone and non-standalone GaN/AlN heterostructures using non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) driven by accurate machine learning interatomic potentials trained from density-functional theory calculations. For the standalone interface, the TBC is found to be ~600 MW m-2 K-1 at room temperature after quantum correction, with possible ~60% elastic and ~40% inelastic contributions. The result revises previous NEMD predictions (400 - 2000 MW m-2 K-1) using empirical interatomic potentials. When a second GaN/AlN interface is brought close to the original interface, the TBC of the original interface can increase to 1000 MW m-2 K-1, and this value gradually decreases with increasing distance between the two interfaces. When multiple interfaces are introduced in proximity, the first interface's TBC can be further enhanced to above 1150 MW m-2 K-1. After comparing double interfaces, superlattices, and random multilayers, it is concluded that such enhancement of TBC is not caused by the emergence of coherent superlattice modes but rather by the ballistic transport of the original bulk phonon modes of each material. Additionally, a "critical separation distance" (l_cs) is defined as the threshold beyond which the two interfaces no longer influence each other and behave independently. l_cs is determined by the mean free path of the phonons that traverse the interfaces and transport in the middle layer between two interfaces. Our findings provide insights into the thermal transport mechanisms that may aid the design of future electronic devices.</description>

      <title>Centrifugation theory revisited: Understanding and modelling the centrifugation of 2D nanosheets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Size selection of liquid-dispersed 2D nanomaterials is a prerequisite for size-dependent studies in earlier stage research and for their targeted application in commercial settings. Centrifugation is the most widespread method for reliably sorting suspensions of polydisperse 2D nanosheets according to size. However, whilst centrifugation is effective, no a priori models are available to predict the outcome of centrifugation, making time consuming iterative experiments necessary. Here we present a simple model for the behaviour of 2D nanosheets during centrifugation and benchmark its predictions against experiments. This model uses simple expressions, specific to 2D particles, for the hydrodynamic radius, effective density and viscous resistance to generate the equation of motion of individual nanosheet during centrifugation. Critically, the equation of motion is then used to predict nanosheet size distributions within centrifugation products. This in turn leads to equations for easily measurable properties such as mean and maximum nanosheet sizes obtained during centrifugation-based fractionation. Comparison with experimental data demonstrates the robustness of this model for a range of 2D materials and solvent systems, and its ability to describe quite subtle effects. These results will enable more tailored size selection of nanosheets for specific applications and offer new mechanistic insights to optimise exfoliation conditions.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium electron distribution function in a voltage-biased metal wire: A nonequilibrium Green's function approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a theoretical framework to determine distribution functions in nonequilibrium systems coupled to equilibrium reservoirs, by using the nonequilibrium Green's function technique. As a paradigmatic example, we consider the nonequilibrium distribution function in a metal wire under a bias voltage. We model the system as a tight-binding chain connected to reservoirs with different electrochemical potentials at both ends. For electron scattering processes in the wire, we consider both elastic scattering from impurities and inelastic scattering from phonons within the self-consistent Born approximation. We demonstrate that the nonequilibrium distribution functions, as well as the electrostatic potential profiles, in various scattering regimes are well described within our framework. This scheme will contribute to advancing our understanding of quantum many-body phenomena driven by nonequilibrium distribution functions that have different functional forms from the equilibrium ones.</description>

      <title>Flux-tunable parity-protected qubit based on a single full-shell nanowire Josephson junction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Leveraging the higher harmonics content of the Josephson potential in a superconducting circuit offers a promising route in the search for new qubits with increased protection against decoherence. In this work, we demonstrate how the flux tunability of a hybrid semiconductor-superconductor Josephson junction based on a single full-shell nanowire enables this possibility. Near one flux quantum, $\Phi\approx \Phi_0=h/2e$, we find that the qubit system can be tuned from a gatemon regime to a parity-protected regime with qubit eigenstates localized in phase space in the $0$ and $\pi$ minima of the Josephson potential ($\cos 2\varphi_0$). Estimates of qubit coherence and relaxation times due to different noise sources are presented.</description>

      <title>Separating the bulk and interface contribution of spin-orbit torque in ferromagnet-Heavy metal bilayers tuned by variation of resistivity of heavy metal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Harmonic Hall measurements were conducted on a series of Ferromagnetic metal/Heavy metal (FM/HM) bilayers with beta-Tungsten (W) as the HM and in-plane magnetized permalloy (Py) as the FM and the efficiencies of the two orthogonal components of the spin orbit-torque were extracted. Two sets of Hall bar-shaped devices were considered where the HM resistivity systematically varied over a wide range (sim150-1000 muOmega-cm) while the FM layer remained the same and each set having a different aspect ratio of voltage pickup line width and Hall bar width. Using numerical simulations of current distribution at the region between voltage pickup lines we have normalised the SOT efficiencies and examined their dependence. The current-induced spin-orbit torque efficiency in ferromagnetic metal (FM)/heavy metal (HM) bilayers is quantitatively investigated in this study.beta-W, known for its high spin-orbit coupling, served as the HM layer, while Py, an FM with an in-plane magnetic anisotropy, comprised the other layer. We performed a thorough analysis of the second harmonic Hall resistance (R_{xy}^{2\omega}) obtained from Py/beta-W bilayer devices, systematically varying the resistivity (rho_W) of the beta-W layer within the range of 200 to 1000 \mu\Omega-cm by employing a fixed current density (J_W\sim0.8\times10^{11} A/m^2) through beta-W. Through this analysis, we derived the Slonczewski-like efficiency (xi_{SL}) and field-like efficiency (\xi_{FL}) as a function of rho_W. Notably, the device with a resistivity of 980 muOmega-cm exhibited the highest xi_{SL}, yielding a value of -0.42 0.09. These results highlight the promising potential of highly resistiv beta-W as a material of interest in spintronics research.</description>

      <title>Optical pumping and initialization of a hole spin in site-controlled InGaAs pyramidal quantum dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate site-controlled In$_{0.25}$Ga$_{0.75}$As quantum dots in (111)B GaAs pyramidal recesses as spin qubits. Combining scanning confocal cryomicroscopy, magneto-photoluminescence studies and resonant excitation, we identify and isolate a positively charged exciton with a hole-spin in its ground state. Application of a strong 5 T magnetic field parallel to the growth axis, induces a fourfold splitting of the energy levels of the positively charged exciton creating an optically addressable double-lambda system. We combine weak above-band and resonant excitation to demonstrate spin pumping and high-fidelity spin initialization through all four optical transitions and study the system behavior as a function of the resonant driving strength showing the existence of a robust spin that can be optically pumped and initialized. These results demonstrate the potential of these quantum dots for precise spin manipulation and their relevance for future quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>The dynamics of skyrmion shrinking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When magnetic skyrmions decay, their size in real space decreases in a finite time before they eventually collapse. We construct an effective continuum model and use its dynamics to describe the shrinking behavior of skyrmions before they collapse. Using the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation and the time derivative of the vector field, we find a set of coupled nonlinear ordinary differential equation for the time dependent effective skyrmion radius and its helicity. In particular, we use a triangular-shaped skyrmion profile of its polar angle. Contrary to the commonly expected simple exponential decrease in size, we reveal a more complicated time dependence, in which the time-dependent radius crosses over from an exponential decay towards a square root decrease, $\sim (t - t_c)^{1/2}$, near a critical time $t_c$ at which it collapses. This critical time is found to depend logarithmically on the lattice constant. In addition, we examine the interplay between the shrinking dynamics and an accompanying transformation through different skyrmion configurations, depending on the various system parameters. The findings are verified by numerical studies on the lattice, supporting the predictions from the theoretical continuum model.</description>

      <title>The open driven two-level system at conical intersections of quasienergies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the stationary state of an ac-driven two-level system under particle exchange with a fermionic environment. A particular question addressed is whether there exist limits in which the populations of the Floquet states are determined by their quasienergies or their mean energies, respectively. The focus lies on parameters in the vicinity of conical intersections of quasienergies, because there the two kinds of energies behave rather differently, such that the characteristics of the two intuitive limits are most pronounced. A main finding is a crossover from a Floquet-Gibbs state at low temperatures to a mean-energy dominated state at intermediate temperatures. Analytical estimates are confirmed by numerical calculations.</description>

      <title>Optical control of the spin-Hall effect in a two-dimensional hole gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Relativistic effects influence the motion of charged particles in solids by intertwining spin and momentum. The resulting phenomena exhibit rich and intriguing properties that can unveil radically new quantum devices. In this context, the two-dimensional hole gas formed in group IV heterostructures is a particularly promising platform, owning to a notable spin-orbit coupling. However, the exploitation of spin-momentum locking and precise manipulation of spin currents has remained elusive thus far. Here we use the modulation-doping technique to break inversion symmetry at novel Ge1-xSnx/Ge interfaces and explore spin-orbit phenomena in the emergent Rashba-coupled hole gases. Magneto-optical investigations demonstrate the unusual establishment of a staggered band alignment with carrier lifetime in the ns range. Optical spin orientation is then leveraged to directly inject spin-polarized currents in the Rashba-split 2D gas. Spin-to-charge conversion is shown to genuinely occur at the staggered gap through the inverse spin-Hall effect. This provides unprecedented access to low-order contributions of the spin-orbit Hamiltonian. Moreover, it leads to the startling demonstration that the spin Hall angle can be optically controlled by modifying the Rashba coupling through the photoexcitation density. Ge1-xSnx quantum wells thus offer innovative solutions and functionalities stemming from their unique spin-dependent properties and intriguing quantum phenomena at the crossroad between transport and photonic realms.</description>

      <title>Effects of phonon confinement on electron transport in Si nanowire and armchair-edge graphene nanoribbon transistors: A dissipative quantum-transport study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electronic transport in low-dimensional structures, such as thin bodies, nanosheets, nanoribbons and nanowires, is strongly affected by electron and phonon confinement, in addition to interface roughness. Here we use a quantum-transport formulation based on empirical pseudopotentials and the Master equation to study the effect of the phonon boundary conditions on the electron transport in field effect transistors (FETs) based on a small cross-section (3$\times$3 cells) Si nanowire (NW) and a 10 armchair graphene nanoribbon (10-aGNR). For the dispersion of the confined phonons we employ a simple empirical model based on the folding of the bulk phonon dispersion that approximates the results of the elastic-continuum model at long wavelengths. We consider two extreme cases for their boundary conditions: clamped boundary conditions (CBCs) or free-standing (FSBCs). We find that phonon confinement affects more severely the Si nanowires than graphene nanoribbons. In particular, for 3$\times$3 SiNW-FETs, CBCs result in a higher room-temperature electron mobility than FSBCs, a result consistent with what previously reported. On the contrary, in the off-equilibrium conditions seen in gate-all-around (GAA) 3$\times$3 SiNW-FETs with 7~nm gate-length, FSBCs yield a higher on-current than what is obtained assuming CBCs. However, for 10-aGNR-FETs, both the electron mobility and the on-current are higher when assuming FSBCs.</description>

      <title>The route of shear to Ising superconductivity in bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the sheared graphene bilayers can be tuned to have flat low-energy bands for sufficiently large size of their moir\'e supercell. In this regime, the interacting system becomes prone to develop broken-symmetry phases, with valley symmetry breaking as the dominant pattern. The strong signal of symmetry breaking favors the onset of a pairing instability in which the electrons with opposite spin projection in the Cooper pairs live in different valleys. The Fermi lines become distorted due to the repulsive Coulomb interaction, which makes the screening highly anisotropic, leading easily to attraction in some of the interaction channels. We also show that the sheared graphene bilayers offer the possibility to realize the combined breakdown of parity and valley symmetry, making them very suitable to study the interplay between correlations and topology in a two-dimensional electron system.</description>

      <title>Medusa 84 SiH -- A novel high Selectivity Electron Beam Resist for Diamond Quantum Technologies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04845v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the novel electron beam resist Medusa 84 SiH by Allresist GmbH (Germany) for nanostructuring of single crystal diamond and its effects on the spin properties of nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in nanopillars as prototypes for photonic structures. We find contrast curves comparable to those of resists previously used for this task (Hydrogensilsequioxane FOx). We present a minimum selectivity for diamond etching of 6$\pm$1. Using an adhesion-promoting silicon interlayer enables fabrication yields of up to 98\%. We measure $T_2$ times of up to $\sim$25 $\mu$s before and after processing, demonstrating that the manufactured structures are usable for diamond-based quantum sensing.</description>

      <title>Lateral Exchange Bias for N\'eel-Vector Control in Atomically Thin Antiferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atomically thin van der Waals (vdW) magnets have emerged as a fascinating platform for the exploration of novel physical phenomena arising from their reduced dimensionality and exceptional material properties. Their single-crystalline nature and ultimate miniaturization position them as leading candidates for next-generation spintronic applications. Antiferromagnetic (AF) vdW magnets are of particular interest, as they combine the advantages of vdW magnets with the functionality of AF spintronics, offering unique opportunities for ultrafast and robust spintronic devices. However, the lack of approaches to locally and deterministically manipulate their order parameter -- the N\'eel-vector -- remains a key limitation. Here, we introduce a fundamentally new paradigm in nanomagnetism, which we term lateral exchange bias (LEB), to achieve N\'eel vector control in bilayers of the vdW AF CrSBr. We exploit the single-crystalline registry formed by terraced CrSBr samples, where the bilayer N\'eel vector is controlled by LEB from neighboring, odd-layered flakes, whose nonzero magnetization we manipulate using magnetic fields. Using this control, we achieve nonvolatile manipulation of magnetic domains and domain walls (DWs) in AF CrSBr bilayers, establishing a powerful toolkit for controlling atomically thin AFs at the nanoscale. Our results challenge conventional views on exchange bias and provide a previously unexplored mechanism for achieving atomic-scale control of AFic order. Our findings pave the way for the development of advanced spintronic architectures and quantum technologies based on vdW magnets.</description>

      <title>Red Emission from Strain-Relaxed Bulk InGaN Active Region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-In-content InGaN quantum wells (QWs) in red light-emitting diodes (LEDs) are typically grown at low temperatures to ensure effective In incorporation. In this study, red LEDs based on bulk InGaN active region were demonstrated. The growth temperature of bulk InGaN was ~800C, which is over 100C higher than the typical growth temperature of red QWs. By introducing high-density trench structures in the underlying green multi-quantum wells (MQWs), the compressive strain in bulk InGaN was relaxed by ~96%. With strain relaxation, phase separation occurred in the bulk InGaN, forming low-In-content (blue) and high-In-content (red) phases. The red phase acted as carrier localization centers, enabling red light emission under electrical injection. The red LEDs based on bulk InGaN exhibited a peak wavelength of 645 nm at 20 mA, with on-wafer peak external quantum efficiency of 0.32%. This study presents a new epitaxial strategy for red InGaN LEDs.</description>

      <title>Neutral but Impactful: Gallium Cluster-Induced Nanopores from Beam-Blanked Gallium Ion Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05199v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutral atoms emitted from liquid metal ion sources are an often-overlooked source of contamination and damage in focused ion beam microscopy. Beyond ions and single atoms, these sources also emit atom clusters. While most studies have investigated charged clusters, here we demonstrate that neutral clusters are also emitted. These neutral clusters bypass the electrostatic beam blanking system, allowing them to impinge on samples even when the ion beam is blanked. We investigate this phenomenon using thin (&lt;20 nm) freestanding membranes of hexagonal boron nitride, silicon, and silicon nitride as targets. Randomly dispersed nanopores that form upon neutral cluster exposure are revealed. The average nanopore diameter is ~2 nm with a narrow size distribution, suggesting that the atom clusters emitted from the source have a preferred size. Various electron microscopy techniques are used to characterize the nanopores, including high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, multislice ptychography, and electron energy-loss spectroscopy. Finally, we show how electron irradiation in the transmission electron microscope can be used to both remove any amorphous material that may clog the pores and to controllably grow the pores to specific sizes. Tunable nanopores such as these are interesting for nanofluidic applications involving size-selective membranes.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of tortuosity: A radical tessellation-based method in porous spherical particle packing systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Estimating the tortuosity of porous electrodes is important for understanding the performance of lithium-ion batteries and optimizing the design of electrode microstructures. In this work, a new method for estimating the tortuosity of porous electrodes is proposed based on radical tessellation, and the results agree well with those calculated by empirical formulas and finite element simulations. Compared with empirical formulas, the proposed method can estimate tortuosity for more complicated microstructures, regardless of particle distribution and size dispersity; compared with finite element simulations, the proposed method offers a significant advantage in computational efficiency. Based on the method, the influence of different microstructure characters on the tortuosity is discussed. It is found that in addition to the porosity, the particle size and particle aggregation morphology are all critical in influencing the tortuosity of the porous electrode. Finally, the tortuosity obtained by this method is integrated into the Pseudo-2-dimensional (P2D) model for the calculation of effective properties, and the results show that this method offers an efficient way in improving the prediction accuracy of P2D models.</description>

      <title>Raman Forbidden Layer-Breathing Modes in Layered Semiconductor Materials Activated by Phonon and Optical Cavity Effects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report Raman forbidden layer-breathing modes (LBMs) in layered semiconductor materials (LSMs). The intensity distribution of all observed LBMs depends on layer number, incident light wavelength and refractive index mismatch between LSM and underlying substrate. These results are understood by a Raman scattering theory via the proposed spatial interference model, where the naturally occurring optical and phonon cavities in LSMs enable spatially coherent photon-phonon coupling mediated by the corresponding one-dimensional periodic electronic states. Our work reveals the spatial coherence of photon and phonon fields on the phonon excitation via photon/phonon cavity engineering.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05391v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the synchronization of propagating spin waves in a novel spin torque oscillator device layout using micromagnetic simulations. This design enables individual probing of the dc current in each oscillator, allowing precise control over the synchronization state and providing direct phase measurement. Our findings reveal that two adjacent oscillators achieve phase locking when they maintain a constant phase difference, either in phase or anti-phase, depending on their separation distance. This work offers new insights into STO synchronization mechanisms and paves the way for improved control and functionality in spintronic devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A tunable magnetic field at low temperatures is essential for numerous applications, including spintronics, magnetic resonance imaging, and condensed matter physics. While commercial superconducting vector magnets are available, they are complex, expensive, and often not adaptable to specific experimental needs. As a result, simple in-house designs are often being used in research environments. However, no comprehensive step-by-step guide for their construction currently exists. In this work, we provide a detailed manual for designing and building a cryogenically compatible three-axis vector magnet. The system is tested at the mixing chamber of a dilution refrigerator at temperatures ranging from 15 mK to 4 K, with no significant increase in base temperature. Safety measures are implemented to mitigate heating from quenching. The coils are successfully driven with DC currents as high as 3 A, generating magnetic fields of up to 2.5 T. Magnetic field measurements using Hall sensors demonstrate good agreement with the predictions of the designed performance.</description>

      <title>Metrological symmetries in singular quantum multi-parameter estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05483v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The theoretical foundation of quantum sensing is rooted in the Cram\'er-Rao formalism, which establishes quantitative precision bounds for a given quantum probe. In many practical scenarios, where more than one parameter is unknown, the multi-parameter Cram\'er-Rao bound (CRB) applies. Since this is a matrix inequality involving the inverse of the quantum Fisher information matrix (QFIM), the formalism breaks down when the QFIM is singular. In this paper, we examine the physical origins of such singularities, showing that they result from an over-parametrization on the metrological level. This is itself caused by emergent metrological symmetries, whereby the same set of measurement outcomes are obtained for different combinations of system parameters. Although the number of effective parameters is equal to the number of non-zero QFIM eigenvalues, the Cram\'er-Rao formalism typically does not provide information about the effective parameter encoding. Instead, we demonstrate through a series of concrete examples that Bayesian estimation can provide deep insights. In particular, the metrological symmetries appear in the Bayesian posterior distribution as lines of persistent likelihood running through the space of unknown parameters. These lines are contour lines of the effective parameters which, through suitable parameter transformations, can be estimated and follow their own effective CRBs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05637v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We developed a facile and scalable 3-step hydrothermal, electrodeposition, and annealing technique to synthesize a variety of nanowire heterostructures. The heterojunction catalysts of CP-ZnO-MoS2 and CP-ZnO-ZnS-MoS2 both saw an increase in catalytic activity in the acidic regime, with overpotentials to reach 10 mA/cm2 of 181 mV and 154 mV respectively, over their constituent materials. The CP-ZnO-ZnS-MoS2 catalysts also saw an increase in catalytic activity in the alkaline conditions, requiring only 209 mV to reach 10 mA/cm2. This has been attributed primarily to the synergistic properties of the band alignment structure and the increased surface area afforded by the nanowire structure. The 1T phase was also noted in the CP-ZnO-MoS2 sample, suggesting that this also played a role in increasing the catalytic activity of the sample. Overall, the synthesized nanowire heterostructures were found to be high-performing and gives insight into how the changing band alignment and morphology can play a significant role in increasing the catalytic performance towards HER.</description>

      <title>All-optical stochastic switching of magnetization textures in Fe$_3$Sn$_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The all-optical control of magnetization at room temperature broadens the scope of applications of spin degrees-of-freedom in data storage, spintronics, and quantum computing. Topological magnetic spin structures, such as skyrmions, are of particular interest due to their particle-like properties, small size and inherent stability. Controlling skyrmion states without strong magnetic fields or large current densities would create new possibilities for their application. In this work, we utilize femtosecond optical pulses to alter the helicity of the spin configuration in dipolar skyrmions formed in the kagome magnet Fe$_3$Sn$_2$ in the absence of an external magnetic field and at room temperature. In situ Lorentz transmission electron microscopy is used to visualize the stochastic, light-induced switching process of chiral N\'eel caps, while the internal Bloch component of the dipolar skyrmions remain unchanged. In addition to this switching process, we observe the interconversion between type I skyrmionic and type II bubble configurations depending on the external magnetic field and illumination conditions. To corroborate the spin states and the light-induced magnetization dynamics, micromagnetic modelling and simulations of the resulting electron phase shift maps are conducted to elucidate the spin rearrangement induced by individual femtosecond optical pulses.</description>

      <title>How pairing mechanism dictates topology in valley-polarized superconductors with Berry curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05697v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate how the pairing mechanism influences topological superconductivity in valley-polarized systems with Berry curvature. We demonstrate that short-range attractive interactions, such as those mediated by phonons, favor superconducting states where the Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) Chern number has the same sign as the Berry curvature. In contrast, overscreened repulsive interactions, as in the Kohn-Luttinger mechanism, favor superconducting states where the BdG Chern number has the opposite sign as the Berry curvature. We establish these trends in a fully controlled limit and apply them to a recently reported chiral superconductor in rhombohedral multilayer graphene. Our theory provides a concrete experimental criterion for distinguishing between different pairing mechanisms in valley-polarized topological superconductors.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Dynamic Majorana Hybridization for Universal Quantum Computing</title>

Abstract: Qubits built out of Majorana zero modes (MZMs) have long been theorized as a potential pathway toward fault-tolerant topological quantum computation. Almost unavoidable in these processes is Majorana wavefunction overlap, known as hybridization, which arise throughout the process when Majorana modes get close to each other. This breaks the ground state degeneracy, leading to qubit errors in the braiding process. This work presents a simple but precise method to predict qubit errors for dynamic hybridization which varies in space and time. This includes hybridization between four or more MZMs through topological or trivial regions, or both of them. As an illustration, we characterize qubit-errors for an X-gate. We demonstrate how to utilize the hybridization to implement not only arbitrary one-qubit rotations but also a two-qubit controlled variable phase gate, providing a demonstration of universal quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Optical signatures of spin symmetries in unconventional magnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19842v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The concept of spin symmetries has gained renewed interest as a valuable tool for classifying unconventional magnetic phases, including altermagnets and recently identified p-wave magnets. In this work, we show that in compounds with weak spin-orbit coupling, the dominant spin and charge photoresponse is determined by spin group rather than the conventional magnetic group symmetry. As a concrete realization we consider the nonlinear shift photocurrent in Mn$_5$Si$_3$, a material that features the two possible classes of unconventional p-wave magnetism in the form of two competing spin structures, a coplanar and non-coplanar one. While both are predicted to generate shift currents based on magnetic symmetry considerations, only the non-coplanar configuration survives the spin symmetry requirements. This is numerically confirmed by our $\textit{ab-initio}$ calculations, providing a protocol to experimentally identify the spin configuration of this promising material in photogalvanic or transport measurements.</description>

      <title>Quantum Geometry Probed by Chiral Excitonic Optical Response of Chern Insulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03317v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically derive the sum rule for the negative first moment of the absorptive optical conductivity with excitonic effects and establish its connection to the quantum weight $K$ and Chern number $C$ of the ground state. Applying this framework, we investigate the excitonic optical response of the Chern insulator at hole filling factor $\nu=1$ in twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$. A single chiral exciton state, which selectively absorbs circularly polarized light of a specific handedness, dominates the optical sum rule. The chiral exciton state comprises two types of interlayer electron-hole transitions, which cancel out the total out-of-plane dipole moment. The absorption spectrum shows nearly perfect magnetic circular dichroism, which can be attributed to the nearly saturated bound $K \ge |C|$ of the Chern insulator under study. Our work illustrates the potential of using excitonic optical responses to probe quantum geometry encoded by $K$ and $C$ of Chern insulators in moir\'e superlattices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14167v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the minimal requirements that induce a nonreciprocal response to temperature differences in a mesoscopic electronic conductor. We identify two distinct mechanisms due electron-electron interactions, namely inelastic scattering and screening, to locally affect the internal temperature and potential of the device, leading to thermal and thermoelectric rectification effects in the presence of an inversion symmetry breaking. We propose resonant tunneling samples to efficiently exploit these effects, and find configurations acting as bipolar thermoelectric diodes whose current flows in the same direction irrespective of the sign of the temperature difference, either due to thermalization or to screening controlled quantum interference.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12190v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a generalization of the theory of magnetic Skyrmions in chiral magnets in two dimensions to a higher-dimensional theory with magnetic Skyrmions in three dimensions and an $S^3$ target space, requiring a 4-dimensional magnetization vector. A physical realization of our theory could be made using a synthetic dimension, recently promoted and realized in condensed matter physics. In the simplest incarnation of the theory, we find a Skyrmion and a sphaleron - the latter being an unstable soliton. Including also the Skyrme term in the theory enriches the spectrum to a small metastable Skyrmion, an unstable sphaleron and a large stable Skyrmion.</description>

      <title>Quantum transport of Dirac fermions in selected graphene nanosystems away from the charge-neutrality point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16032v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Peculiar electronic properties of graphene, including the universal dc conductivity and the pseudodiffusive shot noise, are usually attributed to a small vicinity of the charge-neutrality point, away from which electron's effective mass raises, and nanostructures in graphene start to behave similarly to familiar Sharvin contacts in semiconducting heterostructures hosting two-dimensional electron gas. Using the effective Dirac equation for low-energy excitations it can be shown that, as long as abrupt potential steps separate the sample area from the leads, graphene-specific features can be identified even relatively far from the charge-neutrality point. Namely, the conductance is reduced, comparing to the standard Sharvin value, whereas the shot noise is amplified. Here, we confront the results of earlier analytic considerations with numerical simulations of quantum transport on the honeycomb lattice, for selected systems for which considerations starting from the Dirac equation cannot be directly adapted. For a wedge-shape constriction with zigzag edges and approximately square shape of the narrowest section, the transport characteristics can be tuned from graphene-specific sub-Sharvin values to standard Sharvin values, depending on whether the electrostatic potential profile in the narrowest section is rectangular or smooth. The half-Corbino disk with rectangular potential profile exhibits both the conductance and the noise close to the sub-Sharvin values. For a circular quantum dot with two narrow openings and irregular edges, the conductance is close to the Sharvin value, and the Fano factor approaches the value of $F=1/4$. This suggests that, in experimental attempt to verify the predictions for sub-Sharvin transport regime, one should focus rather on nanosystems, for which the scatterings on edges are insignificant next to the scatterings on sample-lead interfaces.</description>

      <title>Impact of phonon lifetimes on the single-photon indistinguishability in quantum emitters based on 2D materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14656v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Localized excitons in two-dimensional (2D) materials are considered as promising sources of single photons on demand. The photon indistinguishability as key figure of merit for quantum information processing is strongly influenced by the coupling of charge excitations to lattice vibrations of the surrounding semiconductor material. Here, we quantify the impact of exciton-acoustic-phonon-interaction and cavity QED effects on photon indistinguishability in a Hong-Ou-Mandel setup by solving fully quantum mechanical equations for the coupled QD-cavity-phonon system including non-Markovian effects. We find a strong reduction of indistinguishability compared to 3D systems due to increased exciton-phonon coupling efficiency. Moreover, we show that the coherence properties of photons are significantly influenced by the finite phonon lifetime in the surrounding material giving rise to pure dephasing. Only if these limitations are overcome, localized excitons in 2D semiconductors can become a new avenue for quantum light sources.</description>

      <title>Minimizing sensor-sample distances in scanning nitrogen-vacancy magnetometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04244v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scanning magnetometry with nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond has led to significant advances in the sensitive imaging of magnetic systems. The spatial resolution of the technique, however, remains limited to tens to hundreds of nanometers, even for probes where NV centers are engineered within 10 nm from the tip apex. Here, we present a correlated investigation of the crucial parameters that determine the spatial resolution: the mechanical and magnetic stand-off distances, as well as the sub-surface NV center depth in diamond. We study their contributions using mechanical approach curves, photoluminescence measurements, magnetometry scans, and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy of surface adsorbates. We first show that the stand-off distance is mainly limited by features on the surface of the diamond tip, hindering mechanical access. Next, we demonstrate that frequency-modulated atomic force microscopy (FM-AFM) feedback partially overcomes this issue, leading to closer and more consistent magnetic stand-off distances (26-87 nm) compared to the more common amplitude-modulated (AM-AFM) feedback (43-128 nm). FM operation thus permits improved magnetic imaging of sub-100-nm spin textures, shown for the spin cycloid in BFO and domain walls in a CoFeB synthetic antiferromagnet. Finally, by examining 1H and 19F NMR signals in soft contact with a polytetrafluoroethylene surface, we demonstrate a minimum NV-to-sample distance of 7.9+/-0.4 nm.</description>

      <title>Surface-dominant transport in Weyl semimetal NbAs nanowires for next-generation interconnects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04621v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ongoing demands for smaller and more energy efficient electronic devices necessitate alternative interconnect materials with lower electrical resistivity at reduced dimensions. Despite the emergence of many promising candidates, synthesizing high quality nanostructures remains a major bottleneck in evaluating their performance. Here, we report the successful synthesis of Weyl semimetal NbAs nanowires via thermomechanical nanomolding, achieving single crystallinity and controlled diameters as small as 40 nm. Our NbAs nanowires exhibit a remarkably low room-temperature resistivity of 9.7 +/- 1.6 microOhm-cm, which is three to four times lower than their bulk counterpart. Theoretical calculations corroborate the experimental observations, attributing this exceptional resistivity reduction to surface dominant conduction with long carrier lifetime at finite temperatures. Further characterization of NbAs nanowires and bulk single crystals reveals high breakdown current density, robust stability, and superior thermal conductivity. Collectively, these properties highlight the strong potential of NbAs nanowires as next-generation interconnects, which can surpass the limitations of current copper-based interconnects. Technologically, our findings present a practical application of topological materials, while scientifically showcasing the fundamental properties uniquely accessible in nanoscale platforms.</description>

Abstract: In two-dimensional (2D) spin systems, the augmentation of spin fluctuations gives rise to quasi-long-range order; however, how they manifest in spin transport remains unclear. Here we investigate the spin Seebeck effect (SSE) in a quasi-2D antiferromagnet, BaNi$_2$V$_2$O$_8$, which has been reported to exhibit the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition owing to its distinct 2D nature. We found that the SSE in Pt / BaNi$_2$V$_2$O$_8$ persists well above the N\'eel temperature, significantly different from the behavior of 3D ordered magnets. Our numerical analysis for a 2D microscopic spin model supports the hypothesis that the observed SSE is linked to strong magnetic correlations in the BKT-like phase.</description>

Abstract: We study the nonequilibrium steady state thermodynamics of a photodevice which can operate as a solar cell or a photoconductor, depending on the degree of asymmetry of the junction. The thermodynamic efficiency is captured by a single coefficient of performance. Using a minimal model based on a two-level system, we show that when the Coulomb interaction energy matches the transport gap of the junction, the photoconductor displays maximal response, performance, and signal-to-noise ratio, while the same regime is always detrimental for the solar cell. Nevertheless, we find that the Coulomb interaction is beneficial for the solar cell performance if it lies below the transport gap. Our work sheds important light on design principles for thermodynamically efficient photodevices in the presence of Coulomb interactions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13157v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive theoretical framework for calculating the linear and nonlinear optical responses of time-periodic quantum systems. Using density matrix evolution in the Floquet basis and adopting the length gauge, our approach incorporates both interband and intraband contributions of the position operator, enabling detailed insights into photon-assisted transitions and their associated optical phenomena. Notably, we identify a divergent ac response to dc fields in Floquet systems, reminiscent of a Drude peak at finite frequencies. This framework generalizes to optical tensor conductivity calculations at arbitrary perturbation orders and captures various DC photocurrents, including shift current, injection current, and Berry dipole contributions, under specific limits. To demonstrate the versatility of our method, we compute linear and nonlinear optical conductivities for one- and two-dimensional systems, revealing phenomena such as band inversions, j-photon-assisted transitions, and high harmonic generation. These results highlight the interplay between periodic driving and nonlinear optical effects, offering different avenues for exploring dynamical topological properties and their applications in ultrafast spintronics, optoelectronics, and strongly correlated systems. Our findings provide a robust platform for analyzing the complex optical behavior of driven quantum systems and guiding experimental investigations in this rapidly evolving field.</description>

      <title>Cove-edged Chiral Graphene Nanoribbons with Chirality-Dependent Bandgap and Carrier Mobility</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13232v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) have garnered significant interest due to their highly customizable physicochemical properties and potential utility in nanoelectronics. Besides controlling widths and edge structures, the inclusion of chirality in GNRs brings another dimension for fine-tuning their optoelectronic properties, but related studies remain elusive owing to the absence of feasible synthetic strategies. Here, we demonstrate a novel class of cove-edged chiral GNRs (CcGNRs) with a tunable chiral vector (n,m). Notably, the bandgap and effective mass of (n,2)- CcGNR show a distinct positive correlation with the increasing value of n, as indicated by theory. Within this GNR family, two representative members, namely, (4,2)- CcGNR and (6,2)-CcGNR, are successfully synthesized. Both CcGNRs exhibit prominently curved geometries arising from the incorporated [4]helicene motifs along their peripheries, as also evidenced by the single-crystal structures of the two respective model compounds (1 and 2). The chemical identities and optoelectronic properties of (4,2)- and (6,2)-CcGNRs are comprehensively investigated via a combination of IR, Raman, solid-state NMR, UV-vis, and THz spectroscopies as well as theoretical calculations. In line with theoretical expectation, the obtained (6,2)-CcGNR possesses a low optical bandgap of 1.37 eV along with charge carrier mobility of 8 cm2/Vs, whereas (4,2)-CcGNR exhibits a narrower bandgap of 1.26 eV with increased mobility of 14 cm2/Vs. This work opens up a new avenue to precisely engineer the bandgap and carrier mobility of GNRs by manipulating their chiral vector.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18312v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The development of spectroscopic techniques in the extreme ultraviolet (XUV) spectral range has significantly advanced the understanding of ultrafast interactions in magnetic systems triggered by optical excitation. In this work, we introduce a previously missing geometry that facilitates the observation of the ultrafast magnetization dynamics of magnetic systems with an out-of-plane magnetization grown on XUV opaque substrates. This novel approach to probe ultrafast magnetization dynamics combines the magneto-optical Kerr effect with the strong dependence of a sample's reflectance near its Brewster angle. It therefore works with linearly polarized light and does not require any additional polarizing optics. We provide a comprehensive analysis of the technique by presenting both simulations and experimental data as a function of the energy and the polarization of the XUV probe radiation as well as of the delay time after optical excitation.</description>
