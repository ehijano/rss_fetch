      <title>Energy Spectrum of Primary Knock-on Atoms and Atomic Displacement Calculations in Metallic Alloys Under Neutron Irradiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Materials subjected to neutron irradiation experience damage due to displacement cascades triggered by nuclear reactions. This paper presents a practical method to calculate primary atomic recoil events (PKAs), which lead to cascade damage, based on energy and recoiling species. We developed a custom code to identify PKAs and extract their properties using MCNPX and SRIM. This code determines the specifications of recoil atoms from the data provided by the PTRAC card in MCNPX. Consequently, the energy spectrum of PKAs generated through various reaction channels, including elastic/inelastic scattering and transmutations such as (n, {\alpha}), (n, p), and (n, {\gamma}), is calculated. This PKA spectrum is then input into SRIM, which calculates the total number of atomic displacements using the binary collision approximation (BCA) and provides crucial information about the spatial distribution of defects within the irradiated material. Our results indicate that elastic scattering is the predominant reaction, producing most PKAs with energies in the range of several keV. In contrast, inelastic scattering becomes the dominant interaction for generating high-energy PKAs (~EPKA&gt;1 MeV). Additionally, we observed that the number of Frenkel pairs versus ion energy curves for light particle ion implantation (such as H and He) is significantly smaller than for heavier ions.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning of Structural Morphology Imaged by Scanning X-ray Diffraction Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07761v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scanning X-ray nanodiffraction microscopy is a powerful technique for spatially resolving nanoscale structural morphologies by diffraction contrast. One of the critical challenges in experimental nanodiffraction data analysis is posed by the convergence angle of nanoscale focusing optics which creates simultaneous dependency of the far-field scattering data on three independent components of the local strain tensor - corresponding to dilation and two potential rigid body rotations of the unit cell. All three components are in principle resolvable through a spatially mapped sample tilt series however traditional data analysis is computationally expensive and prone to artifacts. In this study, we implement NanobeamNN, a convolutional neural network specifically tailored to the analysis of scanning probe X-ray microscopy data. NanobeamNN learns lattice strain and rotation angles from simulated diffraction of a focused X-ray nanobeam by an epitaxial thin film and can directly make reasonable predictions on experimental data without the need for additional fine-tuning. We demonstrate that this approach represents a significant advancement in computational speed over conventional methods, as well as a potential improvement in accuracy over the current standard.</description>

      <title>Quantum embedding study of strain and charge induced Stark effects on the NV$^{-}$ center in diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The NV$^{-}$ color center in diamond has been demonstrated as a powerful nanosensor for quantum metrology, due to the sensitivity of its optical and spin properties to external electric, magnetic, and strain fields. In view of these applications, we use quantum embedding to derive a many-body description of strain and charge induced Stark effects on the NV$^{-}$ center. We quantify how strain longitudinal to the axis of NV$^{-}$ shifts the excited states in energy, while strain with a component transverse to the NV axis splits the degeneracies of the $^{3}E$ and $^{1}E$ states. The largest effects are for the optically relevant $^{3}E$ manifold, which splits into $E_{x}$ and $E_{y}$ with transverse strain. From these responses we extract strain susceptibilities for the $E_{x/y}$ states within the quasi-linear regime. Additionally, we study the many-body dipole matrix elements of the NV$^{-}$ and find a permanent dipole 1.64 D at zero strain, which is $\sim 30 \%$ smaller than that obtained from recent density functional theory calculations. We also determine the transition dipole between the $E_{x}$ and $E_{y}$ and how it evolves with strain.</description>

      <title>Dilute suspensions of Janus rods: the role of bond and shape anisotropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08083v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nanometer-sized clusters are often targeted due to their potential applications as nanoreactors or storage/delivery devices. One route to assemble and stabilize finite structures consists in imparting directional bonding patterns between the nanoparticles. When only a portion of the particle surface is able to form an inter-particle bond, finite-size aggregates such as micelles and vesicles may form. Building on this approach, we combine particle shape anisotropy with the directionality of the bonding patterns and investigate the combined effect of particle elongation and surface patchiness on the low density assembly scenario. To this aim, we study the assembly of tip-functionalised Janus hard spherocylinder by means of Monte Carlo simulations. By exploring the effects of changing the interaction strength and range at different packing fractions, we highlight the role played by shape and bond anisotropy on the emerging aggregates (micelles, vesicles, elongated micelles and lamellae). We observe that shape anisotropy plays a crucial role in suppressing phases that are typical to spherical Janus nanoparticles and that a careful tuning of the interaction parameters allows to promote the formation of spherical micelles. These finite-size spherical clusters composed of elongated particles might offer more interstitials and larger surface areas than those offered by micelles of spherical or almost-spherical units, thus enhancing their storage and catalytic properties.</description>

      <title>GPU-accelerated Auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo with multi-Slater determinant trial states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08314v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The accuracy of phaseless auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (ph-AFQMC) can be systematically improved with better trial states. Using multi-Slater determinant trial states, ph-AFQMC has the potential to faithfully treat strongly correlated systems, while balancing the static and dynamical correlations on an equal footing. This preprint presents an implementation and application of graphics processing unit-accelerated ph-AFQMC, for multi-Slater determinant trial wavefunctions (GPU-accelerated MSD-AFQMC), to enable efficient simulation of large-scale, strongly correlated systems. This approach allows for nearly-exact computation of ground state energies in multi-reference systems. Our GPU-accelerated MSD-AFQMC is implemented in the open-source code \texttt{ipie}, a Python-based AFQMC package [\textit{J. Chem. Theory Comput.}, 2022, 19(1): 109-121]. We benchmark the performance of the GPU code on transition-metal clusters like [Cu$_2$O$_2$]$^{2+}$ and [Fe$_2$S$_2$(SCH$_3$)]$^{2-}$. The GPU code achieves at least sixfold speedup in both cases, comparing the timings of a single A100 GPU to that of a 32-CPU node. For [Fe$_2$S$_2$(SCH$_3$)]$^{2-}$, we demonstrate that our GPU MSD-AFQMC can recover the dynamical correlation necessary for chemical accuracy with an MSD trial, despite the large number of determinants required ($&gt;10^5$). Our work significantly enhances the efficiency of MSD-AFQMC calculations for large, strongly correlated molecules by utilizing GPUs, offering a promising path for exploring the electronic structure of transition metal complexes.</description>

      <title>Overcoming the chemical complexity bottleneck in on-the-fly machine learned molecular dynamics simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07961v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a framework for on-the-fly machine learned force field molecular dynamics simulations based on the multipole featurization scheme that overcomes the bottleneck with the number of chemical elements. Considering bulk systems with up to 6 elements, we demonstrate that the number of density functional theory calls remains approximately independent of the number of chemical elements, in contrast to the increase in the smooth overlap of atomic positions scheme.</description>

      <title>Meta-GGAs vs. Hybrid Functionals for Point Defects: The Best of Both Worlds Applied to Layered MnO$_2$, NiO$_2$ and KCoO$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14317v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Defects in a material can significantly tune properties and enhance utility. Hybrid functionals like HSE06 are often used to describe solids with such defects. However, geometry optimization (including accounting for effects such as Jahn-Teller distortion) using hybrid functionals is challenging for the large supercells needed for defect study. The proposed r$^2$SCAN+rVV10+U+$\mathrm{U_d}$ method, which is computationally much cheaper and faster than hybrid functionals, can successfully describe defects in materials with the proper choice of U (for the d orbitals of the host atom) and $\mathrm{U_d}$ (for those of the defect atom), as shown here for small polaron defects in layered transition-metal oxides. We use a literature value of U or $\mathrm{U_d}$ appropriate to a given transition-metal ion and its oxidation state. The layered materials birnessite ($\mathrm{K_nMnO_2}, n=0.03 $) and $\mathrm{K_nNiO_2},n=0.03$, with one K atom intercalated between layers in a supercell, are found to have one localized occupied $\mathrm{e_g}$ polaronic state on the transition metal ion reduced by the insertion of the K atom, when the geometry is calculated as above using published U values. The expected Jahn-Teller distortion is not observed when U=$\mathrm{U_d}$=0. Layered cobalt oxide with additional potassium ions intercalated ($\mathrm{K_nCoO_2},n=1.03$) is different, due to a dramatic difference in electronic configuration of the defected Co(II) ion: A single extra K atom in the supercell leads to four localized electrons in the band gap, using standard U values, and even for U=$\mathrm{U_d}$=0.</description>

      <title>General-purpose machine-learned potential for 16 elemental metals and their alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.04732v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine-learned potentials (MLPs) have exhibited remarkable accuracy, yet the lack of general-purpose MLPs for a broad spectrum of elements and their alloys limits their applicability. Here, we present a feasible approach for constructing a unified general-purpose MLP for numerous elements, demonstrated through a model (UNEP-v1) for 16 elemental metals and their alloys. To achieve a complete representation of the chemical space, we show, via principal component analysis and diverse test datasets, that employing one-component and two-component systems suffices. Our unified UNEP-v1 model exhibits superior performance across various physical properties compared to a widely used embedded-atom method potential, while maintaining remarkable efficiency. We demonstrate our approach's effectiveness through reproducing experimentally observed chemical order and stable phases, and large-scale simulations of plasticity and primary radiation damage in MoTaVW alloys. This work represents a significant leap towards a unified general-purpose MLP encompassing the periodic table, with profound implications for materials science.</description>

      <title>Bang-bang preparation of quantum many-body ground states in two dimensions: optimization of the algorithm with a two-dimensional tensor network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09158v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A bang-bang (BB) algorithm prepares the ground state of a two-dimensional (2D) quantum many-body Hamiltonian $H=H_1+H_2$ by evolving an initial product state alternating between $H_1$ and $H_2$. We use the neighborhood tensor update to simulate the BB evolution with an infinite pair-entangled projected state (iPEPS). The alternating sequence is optimized with the final energy as a cost function. The energy is calculated with the tangent space methods for the sake of their stability.
  The method is benchmarked in the 2D transverse field quantum Ising model near its quantum critical point against a ground state obtained by variational optimization of the iPEPS. The optimal BB sequence differs non-perturbatively from a sequence simulating quantum annealing or adiabatic preparation (AP) of the ground state. The optimal BB energy converges with the number of bangs much faster than the optimal AP energy.</description>
