      <title>An Analogue of Heyde's Theorem for Discrete Torsion Abelian Groups with Cyclic $p$-Components</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: According to the well-known Heyde theorem, the Gaussian distribution on the real line is characterized by the symmetry of the conditional distribution of one linear form of $n$ independent random variables given another. In the article, we prove an analogue of this theorem for two independent random variables taking values in a discrete torsion Abelian group $X$ with cyclic $p$-components. In doing so, we do not impose any restrictions on coefficients of the linear forms and the characteristic functions of random variables. The proof uses methods of abstract harmonic analysis and is based on the solution some functional equation on the character group of the group $X$.</description>

      <title>Long Time Asymptotics for the Stochastic Follow-the-Leader System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and analyze a class of interacting particle systems on the real line that combine features of the stochastic rat race and (deterministic) follow-the-leader models. The particle system evolves as a continuous-time pure jump process: the leading particle moves independently, at Exponential jump times, with constant jump rate and iid jump sizes distributed according to a law $\theta$, while each of the remaining particles jumps forward, at Exponential times, at rate equal to its distance from the particle immediately ahead, with jump sizes drawn uniformly from the corresponding gap. The dynamics thus encode competition for leadership together with distance-dependent stochastic interactions. Our main focus is the associated gap process, representing the vector of inter-particle distances. We establish the existence of a unique stationary distribution for the gap process and prove uniform geometric ergodicity. Further, when the leader's jump sizes follow an Exponential distribution, we identify the stationary law explicitly as a product of independent Exponential laws, and show that the associated mixing time scales between $\Theta(n)$ and $O(n(\log n)^2)$ for an $n$-particle system. As an application of the mixing time results we establish a functional limit theorem that characterizes fluctuations of particle states at large time, under a suitable spatial and temporal scaling and large particle limit. Finally, when the leader's jumps have heavy but integrable tails, we show that each gap has at least one additional finite moment under stationarity than that of the leader's jump size distribution. The model offers a tractable setting for exploring ergodicity, explicit invariant laws, and mixing behavior in non-diffusive particle systems.</description>

      <title>Lamperti scaling for fractional Gaussian processes with non-stationary increments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Lamperti transform offers a powerful bridge between self-similar processes and stationary dynamics, making it especially useful for analyzing anomalous diffusion models that lack stationary increments. In this paper we examine the Lamperti transforms of scaled sub-fractional and bi-fractional Brownian motions, deriving explicit covariance formulas, asymptotic behaviour, and precise exponential mixing rates. We also introduce Langevin type integral processes driven by these Gaussian fields, identify their self-similarity exponents, and show that their Lamperti images again form stationary Gaussian processes with rapid decorrelation. Through inverse Lamperti relations and Birkhoff's theorem, we establish rigorous single trajectory reconstruction of ensemble quantities for the original non-stationary processes. The results extend the scope of the scaled Lamperti framework to Gaussian processes with non-stationary increments and richer dependence structures.</description>

      <title>Local Asymptotic Normality for Mixed Fractional Brownian Motion Under High-Frequency Observation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02622v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we will consider the LAN property for both the Hurst parameter $H&gt;3/4$ and the variance of the fractional Brownian motion plus an independent standard Brownian motion (called mixed fractional Brownian motion) with high-frequency observation. We will first remove the $H$-score linear term and orthogonalize the remainder through two non-diagonal transformations, then we can construct the CLT for the quadratic form base on $\| \cdot \|_{\mathrm{op}}/\|\cdot\|_F\to0$. At last we obtain a diagonal Gaussian LAN expansion with an explicit information matrix. Beyond the case of $H&gt;3/4$, we also present that the $\| \cdot \|_{\mathrm{op}}/\|\cdot\|_F\to0$ method is also useful for the case of $H&lt;3/4$ and the proof will be concise compared with the Whittle translation method. We consider that this method can be applied to this type of problem, including the fractional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model and mixed fractional O-U process.</description>

      <title>Diffusion limit for the stationary distribution of a history-dependent two-level M/M/1 queue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, Atar and Miyazawa [2] introduced a multi-level GI/G/1 queue with a finite number of levels, where both the arrival and service rates depend on the level corresponding to the current queue length. For this model, they proved that the diffusion limit of its queue length process in heavy traffic is the level-dependent reflected Brownian motion of [6]. In a subsequent study, Kobayashi et al. [4] derived the corresponding diffusion limit of the stationary distribution. These studies are motivated by the control of service capacity depending on the queue length. We are interested in the more general case where this control may also depend on the history of the queue length. As the first step toward such a generalization, we specialize the multi-level GI/G/1 queue to a two-level M/M/1 queue. We then extend the dynamics of this model so that its arrival and service rates depend not only on the current queue length but also on the recent history of queue lengths. Under the stability condition for this model, we first compute its stationary distribution in closed form, then derive its diffusion limit in heavy traffic. Finally, using this diffusion limit, we derive approximation formulas for the stationary distribution and then numerically assess their accuracy.</description>

      <title>Sampling non-log-concave densities via Hessian-free high-resolution dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of sampling from a target distribution $\pi(q)\propto e^{-U(q)}$ on $\mathbb{R}^d$, where $U$ can be non-convex, via the Hessian-free high-resolution (HFHR) dynamics, which is a second-order Langevin-type process that has $e^{-U(q)-\frac12|p|^2}$ as its unique invariant distribution, and it reduces to kinetic Langevin dynamics (KLD) as the resolution parameter $\alpha\to0$. The existing theory for HFHR dynamics in the literature is restricted to strongly-convex $U$, although numerical experiments are promising for non-convex settings as well. We focus on studying the convergence of HFHR dynamics when $U$ can be non-convex, which bridges a gap between theory and practice. Under a standard assumption of dissipativity and smoothness on $U$, we adopt the reflection/synchronous coupling method. This yields a Lyapunov-weighted Wasserstein distance in which the HFHR semigroup is exponentially contractive for all sufficiently small $\alpha&gt;0$ whenever KLD is. We further show that, under an additional assumption that asymptotically $\nabla U$ has linear growth at infinity, the contraction rate for HFHR dynamics is strictly better than that of KLD, with an explicit gain. As a case study, we verify the assumptions and the resulting acceleration for three examples: a multi-well potential, Bayesian linear regression with $L^p$ regularizer and Bayesian binary classification. We conduct numerical experiments based on these examples, as well as an additional example of Bayesian logistic regression with real data processed by the neural networks, which illustrates the efficiency of the algorithms based on HFHR dynamics and verifies the acceleration and superior performance compared to KLD.</description>

      <title>Diffusion on homogeneous ultrametric spaces: the contributions of Alessandro Fig\`a-Talamanca</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Alessandro Fig\`a-Talamanca (1938-2023) was an influential Italian mathematician, scientific leader of the Italian group of harmonic analysis for many years. Since the late 1970ies, his interest focussed on harmonic analysis on free groups and trees. In the later years of his scientific work he became also interested in diffusion processes on homogeneous ultrametric spaces such as local fields and totally disconnected Abelian groups. This is related with the close connection of those spaces with trees and their boundaries and concerns, in particular, the construction of such processes via discrete-time walks on trees. The present notes provide rather detailed comments on this part of his work and the related, quite abundant literature. This is intended to become part of a volume of selected papers by Fig\`a-Talamanca, accompanied by comments such as the present text.</description>

      <title>Varadhan Functions, Variances, and Means on Compact Riemannian Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by Varadhan's theorem, we introduce Varadhan functions, variances, and means on compact Riemannian manifolds as smooth approximations to their Fr\'echet counterparts. Given independent and identically distributed samples, we prove uniform laws of large numbers for their empirical versions. Furthermore, we prove central limit theorems for Varadhan functions and variances for each fixed $t\ge0$, and for Varadhan means for each fixed $t&gt;0$. By studying small time asymptotics of gradients and Hessians of Varadhan functions, we build a strong connection to the central limit theorem for Fr\'echet means, without assumptions on the geometry of the cut locus.</description>

      <title>With what probability does an inscribed triangle contain a given point?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Three points uniformly selected on the unit circle form a triangle containing a point $X$ at distance $r \in [0; 1]$ from its center with probability $P(r) = \frac{1}{4} - \frac{3}{2 \pi^2}\textrm{Li}_2(r^2)$, where $\textrm{Li}_2$ is the dilogarithm function (Jeremy Tan Jie Rui, 2018). In this paper we present an alternative proof of this fact. We also discuss a couple of other geometric probability problems where the dilogarithm function arises.</description>

      <title>Dimension-decaying diffusion processes as the scaling limit of condensing zero-range processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we prove that, on the diffusive time scale, condensing zero-range processes converge to a dimension-decaying diffusion process on the simplex \[ \Sigma = \{(x_1,\dots,x_S) : x_i \ge 0,\; \sum_{i\in S} x_i = 1\}, \] where $S$ is a finite set. This limiting diffusion has the distinctive feature of being absorbed at the boundary of the simplex. More precisely, once the process reaches a face \[ \Sigma_A = \{(x_1,\dots,x_S) : x_i \ge 0,\; \sum_{i\in A} x_i = 1\}, \qquad A \subset S, \] it remains confined to this set and evolves in the corresponding lower-dimensional simplex according to a new diffusion whose parameters depend on the subset $A$. This mechanism repeats itself, leading to successive reductions of the dimension, until one of the vertices of the simplex is reached in finite time. At that point, the process becomes permanently trapped.
  The proof relies on a method to extend the domain of the associated martingale problem, which may be of independent interest and useful in other contexts.</description>

      <title>Coupling Brownian loop soups and random walk loop soups at all polynomial scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lawler and Trujillo Ferreras constructed a well-known coupling between the Brownian loop soups in $\mathbb{R}^2$ and the random walk loop soups on $\mathbb{Z}^2$ (one rescales the random walk loops by $1/N$, their time parametrizations by $1/(2N^2)$, and let $N\to \infty$), which led to numerous applications. It nevertheless only holds for loops with time length at least $N^{\theta-2}$ for $\theta \in(2/3,2)$. In particular, there is no control on mesoscopic loops with time length less than $N^{-4/3}$ (i.e.\ roughly diameter less than $N^{-2/3}$).
  In this paper, we find a simple way to remove the restriction $\theta&gt;2/3$, so that such a coupling works for all $\theta\in (0,2)$, i.e. for loops at all polynomial scales. We also establish this coupling in any dimension $d\ge 1$ (i.e. for random walk loop soups on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ and Brownian loop soups on $\mathbb{R}^d$).</description>

      <title>Similarity-Sensitive Entropy: Induced Kernels and Data-Processing Inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study an entropy functional $H_K$ that is sensitive to a prescribed similarity structure on a state space. For finite spaces, $H_K$ coincides with the order-1 similarity-sensitive entropy of Leinster and Cobbold. We work in the general measure-theoretic setting of kernelled probability spaces $(\Omega,\mu,K)$ introduced by Leinster and Roff, and develop basic structural properties of $H_K$.
  Our main results concern the behavior of $H_K$ under coarse-graining. For a measurable map $f:\Omega\to Y$ and input law $\mu$, we define a law-induced kernel on $Y$ whose pullback minimally dominates $K$, and show that it yields a coarse-graining inequality and a data-processing inequality for $H_K$, for both deterministic maps and general Markov kernels. We also introduce conditional similarity-sensitive entropy and an associated mutual information, and compare their behavior to the classical Shannon case.</description>

      <title>First passage times for decoupled random walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by a connection to the infinite Ginibre point process, decoupled random walks were introduced in a recent article Alsmeyer, Iksanov and Kabluchko (2025). The decoupled random walk is a sequence of independent random variables, in which the $n$th variable has the same distribution as the position at time $n$ of a standard random walk with nonnegative increments. We prove distributional convergence in the Skorokhod space equipped with the $J_1$-topology of the running maxima and the first passage times of decoupled random walks. We show that there exist five different regimes, in which distinct limit theorems arise. Rather different functional limit theorems for the number of visits of decoupled standard random walk to the interval $[0,t]$ as $t\to\infty$ were earlier obtained in the aforementioned paper Alsmeyer, Iksanov and Kabluchko (2025). While the limit processes for the first passage times are inverse extremal-like processes, the limit processes for the number of visits are stationary Gaussian.</description>

Abstract: We obtain infinitely many boundary operators in the Brownian loop soup in the subcritical phase by analyzing the conformal block expansion of the two-point function that computes the probability of having two marked points on the upper half-plane being separated by Brownian loops. The resulting boundary operators are primary operators in a 2D CFT with central charge $c\leq1$ and have conformal dimensions that are non-negative integers. By comparing the above-mentioned conformal block expansion with probabilities in the Brownian loop soup, we provide a physical interpretation of the boundary operators of even dimensions as operators that insert multiple outer boundaries of Brownian loops at points on the real axis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.02781v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Based on the recent works of Radziwill-Soundararajan and Roberts, we establish a rate of convergence in Bourgade's central limit theorem for shifted Dirichlet $L$-functions. Our results also indicate that the dependence structure in the components of a random vector could have a dramatic impact on the rate of convergence in such a multivariate central limit theorem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.17997v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the long-time behavior of an additive functional that takes into account the jumps of a symmetric Markov process. This process is assumed to be observed through a biased observation scheme that includes the survival to events of extinction and the Feynman-Kac weight by another similar additive functional. Under conditioning for the convergence to a quasi-stationary distribution and for two-sided estimates of the Feynmac-Kac semigroup to be obtained, we shall discuss general assumptions on the symmetric Markov process. For the law of additive functionals, we will prove a quasi-ergodic theorem, namely a conditional version of the ergodic theorem and a conditional functional weak law of large numbers. As an application, we also establish a large deviation principle for the mean ratio of additive functionals.</description>

      <title>A Method For Bounding Tail Probabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13662v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a method for upper and lower bounding the right and the left tail probabilities of continuous random variables (RVs). For the right tail probability of RV $X$ with probability density function $f (x)$, this method requires first setting a continuous, positive, and strictly decreasing function $g (x)$ such that $-f (x)/g' (x)$ is a decreasing and increasing function, $\forall x&gt;x_0$, which results in upper and lower bounds, respectively, given in the form $-f (x) g (x)/g' (x)$, $\forall x&gt;x_0$, where $x_0$ is some point. Similarly, for the upper and lower bounds on the left tail probability of $X$, this method requires first setting a continuous, positive, and strictly increasing function $g (x)$ such that $f (x)/g' (x)$ is an increasing and decreasing function, $\forall x&lt;x_0$, which results in upper and lower bounds, respectively, given in the form $f (x) g (x)/g' (x)$, $\forall x&lt;x_0$. We provide some examples of good candidates for the function $g (x)$. We also establish connections between the new bounds and Markov's inequality and Chernoff's bound. In addition, we provide an iterative method for obtaining ever tighter lower and upper bounds, under certain conditions. As an application, we use the proposed method to derive a novel closed-form asymptotic expression of the converse bound on the capacity of the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel in the finite-blocklength regime, which is tighter than the closed-form asymptotic expression by Polyanskiy-Poor-Verd\'u. Finally, we provide numerical examples where we show the tightness of the bounds obtained by the proposed method.</description>

      <title>The leftmost particle of branching subordinators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16617v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define a family of continuous-time branching particle systems on the non-negative real line, called branching subordinators, where particles move as independent subordinators. Each particle can also split (at possibly infinite rate) into several children (possibly infinitely many) whose positions relative to the position of the parent are random. These particle systems are in the continuity of branching L\'evy processes introduced by Bertoin and Mallein [Ann. Probab. 47(3): 1619-1652 (2019)]. We pay a particular attention to the asymptotic behavior of the leftmost particle of branching subordinators. It turns out that, under some assumptions, the rate of growth of the position of the leftmost particle is of order $t^{\gamma}$ where $\gamma \in (0,1)$ depends explicitly on the parameters. This sub-linear growth is significantly different from the classical linear growth observed for regular branching random walks with non-negative displacements.</description>

      <title>Global law of conjugate kernel random matrices with heavy-tailed weights</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18428v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the asymptotic spectral distribution of the conjugate kernel random matrix $YY^\top$, where $Y= f(WX)$ arises from a two-layer neural network model. We consider the setting where $W$ and $X$ are random rectangular matrices with i.i.d.\ entries, where the entries of $W$ follow a heavy-tailed distribution, while those of $X$ have light tails. Our assumptions on $W$ include a broad class of heavy-tailed distributions, such as symmetric $\alpha$-stable laws with $\alpha \in ]0,2[$ and sparse matrices with $\mathcal{O}(1)$ nonzero entries per row. The activation function $f$, applied entrywise, is bounded, smooth, odd, and nonlinear. We compute the limiting eigenvalue distribution of $YY^\top$ through its moments and show that heavy-tailed weights induce strong correlations between the entries of $Y$, resulting in richer and fundamentally different spectral behavior compared to the light-tailed case.</description>

Abstract: We consider equations of nonlinear transport on the circle with regular self interactions appearing in aggregation models and deterministic mean field dynamics. We introduce a random perturbation of such systems through a stochastic orientation preserving flow, which is given as an integrated infinite dimensional periodic Ornstein- Uhlenbeck process with reflection. As our main result we show that the induced stochastic dynamics yields a measure valued Markov process on a class of regular measures. Moreover, we show that this process is strong Feller in the corresponding topology. This is interpreted as a qualitative regularisation by noise phenomenon.</description>

Abstract: While classical concentration inequalities are typically restricted to two special cases -- independence and martingale difference sequences -- we extend concentration inequalities to a much broader class of stochastic processes by relaxing these foundational conditions. %\vspace{0.2\baselineskip} Specifically, heuristically and in the language of calculus, while independence and the martingale difference property correspond to \[ \displaystyle \frac { \partial y } {\partial t}= \text{constant},
  \quad \displaystyle \frac { \partial y } {\partial t} = 0 \] respectively, %\vspace{0.3\baselineskip} we relax these conditions to %\[ \left| \frac { \partial^2 y } {\partial u_i \, \partial t} \right| \le L, \] %thereby allowing the drift $\displaystyle\frac { \partial y } {\partial t}$ to vary with past state $u_i$. \vspace{0.3\baselineskip} a general setting that requires only the existence of a drift $\displaystyle\frac { \partial y } {\partial t}$ which is allowed to vary with the past state. \vspace{0.3\baselineskip} Furthermore, concentration inequalities are established for branching random walks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.20492v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For the Gaussian free field on the metric graph of $\mathbb{Z}^d$ ($d\ge 3$), we consider the heterochromatic two-arm probability, i.e., the probability that two points $v$ and $v'$ are contained in distinct clusters of opposite signs with diameter at least $N$. For all $d\ge 3$ except the critical dimension $d_c=6$, we prove that this probability is asymptotically proportional to $N^{-[(\frac{d}{2}+1)\land 4]}$. Furthermore, we prove that conditioned on this two-arm event, the volume growth of each involved cluster is comparable to that of a typical (unconditioned) cluster; precisely, each cluster has a volume of order $M^{(\frac{d}{2}+1)\land 4}$ within a box of size $M$.</description>

      <title>Separation and cut edge in macroscopic clusters for metric graph Gaussian free fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20516v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that for the Gaussian free field (GFF) on the metric graph of $\mathbb{Z}^d$ (for all $d\ge 3$ except the critical dimension $d_c=6$), with uniformly positive probability there exist two distinct sign clusters of diameter at least $cN$ within a box of size $N$ such that their graph distance is less than $N^{-[(d-2)\vee (2d-8)]}$. This phenomenon contrasts sharply with the two-dimensional case, where the distance between two macroscopic clusters is typically on the order of their diameters, following from the basic property of the scaling limit ``conformal loop ensembles'' $\mathrm{CLE}_4$ (Sheffield-Werner'2001).
  As a byproduct, we derive that the number of pivotal edges for the one-arm event (i.e., the sign cluster containing the origin has diameter at least $N$) is typically of order $N^{(\frac{d}{2}-1)\land 2}$. This immediately implies that for the incipient infinite cluster (IIC) of the metric graph GFF, the dimension of cut edges (i.e., edges whose removal disconnects the IIC) equals $(\frac{d}{2}-1)\land 2$. Translated in the language of critical loop soups (whose clusters, by the isomorphism theorem, have the same distribution as GFF sign clusters), this leads to the analogous estimates where the counterpart of a pivotal edge is a pivotal loop at scale $1$. This result hints at the new and possibly surprising idea that already in dimension $3$, microscopic loops (even those at scale $1$) play a crucial role in the construction of macroscopic loop clusters.</description>

Abstract: The question of understanding the scaling limit of metric graph critical loop soup clusters and its relation to loop soups in the continuum appears to be one of the subtle cases that reveal interesting new scenarios about scaling limits, with a mixture of macroscopic and microscopic randomness. In the present paper, we show that in three dimensions, scaling limits of the metric graph clusters are strictly larger than the clusters of the limiting continuum Brownian loop soup. We actually show that the upper box counting dimension of the latter clusters is strictly smaller than $5/2$, while that of the former is $5/2$.</description>

Abstract: In this note, we show the following feature of the relation between Brownian loop-soups on cable-graphs and their total occupation time-field $\Lambda$: When conditioned on $\Lambda$, the conditional law of individual loops becomes singular with respect to that of unconditioned loops. The idea of the proof is to see that some type of fast points on the curve $\Lambda$ impose an exceptional behaviour of all the loops when they go through these points.</description>

      <title>Critical behaviour of the fully packed loop-$O(n)$ model on planar triangulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05867v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the fully packed loop-$O(n)$ model on planar triangulations. This model is also bijectively equivalent to the Fortuin--Kasteleyn model of planar maps with parameter $q\in (0,4)$ at its self-dual point. These have been traditionally studied using either techniques from analytic combinatorics (based in particular on the gasket decomposition of Borot, Bouttier and Guitter arXiv:1106.0153) or probabilistic arguments (based on Sheffield's hamburger-cheeseburger bijection arXiv:1108.2241). In this paper we establish a dictionary relating quantities of interest in both approaches. This has several consequences. First, we derive an exact expression for the partition function of the fully packed loop-$O(n)$ model on triangulations, as a function of the outer boundary length. This confirms predictions by Gaudin and Kostov. In particular, this model exhibits critical behaviour, in the sense that the partition function exhibits a power-law decay characteristic of the critical regime at this self-dual point. Finally, we derive precise asymptotics for geometric features of the FK model of planar maps when $0 &lt; q &lt;4$, such as the exact tail behaviour of the perimeters of clusters and loops. This sharpens previous results of arXiv:1502.00450 and arXiv:1502.00546. A key step is to use the above dictionary and the probabilistic results to justify rigorously an ansatz commonly assumed in the analytic combinatorics literature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23309v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study nonlinear wave equations perturbed by transport noise acting either on the displacement or on the velocity. Such noise models random advection and, under suitable scaling of space covariance, may generate an effective dissipative term. We establish well-posedness in both cases and analyse the associated scaling limits. When the noise acts on the displacement, the system preserves its original structure and converges to the deterministic nonlinear wave equation, whereas if it acts on the velocity, the rescaled dynamics produce an additional Laplacian damping term, leading to a stochastic derivation of a Westervelt-type acoustic model.</description>

      <title>Active operator learning with predictive uncertainty quantification for partial differential equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03178v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the increased prevalence of neural operators being used to provide rapid solutions to partial differential equations (PDEs), understanding the accuracy of model predictions and the associated error levels is necessary for deploying reliable surrogate models in scientific applications. Existing uncertainty quantification (UQ) frameworks employ ensembles or Bayesian methods, which can incur substantial computational costs during both training and inference. We propose a lightweight predictive UQ method tailored for Deep operator networks (DeepONets) that also generalizes to other operator networks. Numerical experiments on linear and nonlinear PDEs demonstrate that the framework's uncertainty estimates are unbiased and provide accurate out-of-distribution uncertainty predictions with a sufficiently large training dataset. Our framework provides fast inference and uncertainty estimates that can efficiently drive outer-loop analyses that would be prohibitively expensive with conventional solvers. We demonstrate how predictive uncertainties can be used in the context of Bayesian optimization and active learning problems to yield improvements in accuracy and data-efficiency for outer-loop optimization procedures. In the active learning setup, we extend the framework to Fourier Neural Operators (FNO) and describe a generalized method for other operator networks. To enable real-time deployment, we introduce an inference strategy based on precomputed trunk outputs and a sparse placement matrix, reducing evaluation time by more than a factor of five. Our method provides a practical route to uncertainty-aware operator learning in time-sensitive settings.</description>

Abstract: The \emph{signed series} problem in the $\ell_2$ norm asks, given set of vectors $v_1,\ldots,v_n\in \mathbf{R}^d$ having at most unit $\ell_2$ norm, does there always exist a series $(\varepsilon_i)_{i\in [n]}$ of $\pm 1$ signs such that for all $i\in [n]$, $\max_{i\in [n]} \|\sum_{j=1}^i \varepsilon_i v_i\|_2 = O(\sqrt{d})$. A result of Banaszczyk [2012, \emph{Rand. Struct. Alg.}] states that there exist signs $\varepsilon_i\in \{-1,1\},\; i\in [n]$ such that $\max_{i\in [n]} \|\sum_{j=1}^i \varepsilon_i v_i\|_2 = O(\sqrt{d+\log n})$. The best constructive bound known so far is of $O(\sqrt{d\log n})$, by Bansal and Garg [2017, \emph{STOC.}, 2019, \emph{SIAM J. Comput.}]. We give a polynomial-time randomized algorithm to find signs $x(i) \in \{-1,1\},\; i\in [n]$ such that \[ \max_{i\in [n]} \|\sum_{j=1}^i x(i)v_i\|_2 = O(\sqrt{d + \log^2 n}) = O(\sqrt{d}+\log n).\] By the constructive reduction of Harvey and Samadi [\emph{COLT}, 2014], this also yields a constructive bound of $O(\sqrt{d}+\log n)$ for the Steinitz problem in the $\ell_2$-norm. Thus, we algorithmically achieve Banaszczyk's bounds for both problems when $d \geq \log^2n$, which also matches the conjectured bounds. Our algorithm is based on the framework on Bansal and Garg, together with a new analysis involving $(i)$ additional linear and spectral orthogonality constraints during the construction of the covariance matrix of the random walk steps, which allow us to control the quadratic variation in the linear as well as the quadratic components of the discrepancy increment vector, alongwith $(ii)$ a ``Freedman-like" version of the Hanson-Wright concentration inequality, for filtration-dependent sums of subgaussian chaoses.</description>

      <title>Arithmetic Properties of Several Generalized-Constant Sequences, with Implications for $\Gamma^{\left(n\right)}\left(1\right)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01849</link>

Abstract: Neither the Euler-Mascheroni constant, $\gamma=0.577215...$, nor the Euler-Gompertz constant, $\delta=0.596347...$, is currently known to be irrational. However, it has been proved that at least one of them is transcendental. The two constants are related by a well-known equation of Hardy, equivalent to $\gamma+\delta/e=\mathrm{Ein}(1)$, which recently has been generalized to $\gamma^{(n)}+\delta^{(n)}/e=\eta^{(n)}$, $n\ge0$ for sequences of constants $\gamma^{(n)}$, $\delta^{(n)}$, and $\eta^{(n)}$ (given respectively by raw, conditional, and partial moments of the Gumbel(0,1) probability distribution). Investigating the $\gamma^{(n)}$ through recurrence relations (where $\gamma^{(0)}=1$ and $\gamma^{(1)}=\gamma$), we find that at least one of the pair {$\gamma,\gamma^{(2)}$} and -- conditional on a realistic conjecture verified for $2\leq n\leq26$ -- at least two of each set {$\gamma,\gamma^{(n)},\gamma^{(n+1)},\ldots,\gamma^{(2n)}$} are transcendental, implying that the $\gamma^{(n)}$ are transcendental infinitely often (with analogous results for the sequence $\Gamma^{(n)}(1)=\left(-1\right)^{n}\gamma^{\left(n\right)}$). We then show, via a theorem of Shidlovskii, that the $\eta^{(n)}$ are algebraically independent, and therefore transcendental, for all $n\ge0$, implying that at least one of each pair, {$\gamma^{(n)},\delta^{(n)}/e$} and {$\gamma^{(n)},\delta^{(n)}$}, and at least two of the triple {$\gamma^{(n)},\delta^{(n)}/e,\delta^{(n)}$}, are transcendental for all $n\ge1$. Further analysis of the $\gamma^{(n)}$ and $\eta^{(n)}$ reveals that the values $\delta^{(n)}/e$ are transcendental infinitely often with positive asymptotic density. Finally, we provide parallel results for the sequences $\tilde{\delta}^{(n)}$ and $\tilde{\eta}^{(n)}$ satisfying the "non-alternating analogue" equation $\gamma^{(n)}+\tilde{\delta}^{(n)}/e=\tilde{\eta}^{(n)}$.</description>

      <title>Determining subgroups via stationary measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12966v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider random walks on the isometry groups of general metric spaces. Under some mild conditions, we show that if two non-elementary random walks on a discrete subgroup of the isometry group have non-singular stationary measures, then subgroups generated by the random walks are commensurable. This result in particular applies to separable Gromov hyperbolic spaces and Teichm\"uller spaces. As a specific application, we prove singularity between stationary measures associated to random walks on different fiber subgroups of the fundamental group of a hyperbolic 3-manifold fibering over the circle.</description>

      <title>Exact inference via quasi-conjugacy in two-parameter Poisson-Dirichlet hidden Markov models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22098v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a nonparametric model for time-evolving, unobserved probability distributions from discrete-time data consisting of unlabelled partitions. The latent process is a two-parameter Poisson-Dirichlet diffusion, and observations arise via exchangeable sampling. Applications include social and genetic data where only aggregate clustering summaries are observed. To address the intractable likelihood, we develop a tractable inferential framework that avoids label enumeration and direct simulation of the latent state. We exploit a duality between the diffusion and a pure-death process on partitions, together with coagulation operators that encode the effect of new data. These yield closed-form, recursive updates for forward and backward inference. We compute exact posterior distributions of the latent state at arbitrary times and predictive distributions of future or interpolated partitions. This enables online and offline inference and forecasting with full uncertainty quantification, bypassing MCMC and sequential Monte Carlo. Compared to particle filtering, our method achieves higher accuracy, lower variance, and substantial computational gains. We illustrate the methodology with synthetic experiments and a social network application, recovering interpretable patterns in time-varying heterozygosity.</description>

      <title>A UCB Bandit Algorithm for General ML-Based Estimators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01061v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present ML-UCB, a generalized upper confidence bound algorithm that integrates arbitrary machine learning models into multi-armed bandit frameworks. A fundamental challenge in deploying sophisticated ML models for sequential decision-making is the lack of tractable concentration inequalities required for principled exploration. We overcome this limitation by directly modeling the learning curve behavior of the underlying estimator. Specifically, assuming the Mean Squared Error decreases as a power law in the number of training samples, we derive a generalized concentration inequality and prove that ML-UCB achieves sublinear regret. This framework enables the principled integration of any ML model whose learning curve can be empirically characterized, eliminating the need for model-specific theoretical analysis. We validate our approach through experiments on a collaborative filtering recommendation system using online matrix factorization with synthetic data designed to simulate a simplified two-tower model, demonstrating substantial improvements over LinUCB</description>
