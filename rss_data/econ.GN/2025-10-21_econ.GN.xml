      <title>Comparison of Tax and Cap-and-Trade Carbon Pricing Schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Carbon pricing has become a central pillar of modern climate policy, with carbon taxes and emissions trading systems (ETS) serving as the two dominant approaches. Although economic theory suggests these instruments are equivalent under idealized assumptions, their performance diverges in practice due to real-world market imperfections. A particularly less explored dimension of this divergence concerns the role of financial intermediaries in emissions trading markets. This paper develops a unified framework to compare the economic and environmental performance of tax- and market-based schemes, explicitly incorporating the involvement of financial intermediaries. By calibrating both instruments to deliver identical aggregate emission reduction targets, we assess their economic performance across alternative market structures. Our results suggest that although the two schemes are equivalent under perfect competition, the presence of intermediaries in ETS reduces both regulatory wealth and the aggregate wealth of economic agents relative to carbon taxation. These effects stem from intermediaries' influence on price formation and their appropriation of part of the revenue stream. The findings underscore the importance of accounting for intermediaries' behavior in the design of carbon markets and highlight the need for further empirical research on the evolving institutional structure of emissions trading systems.</description>

      <title>Data for Inclusion: The Redistributive Power of Data Economics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper evaluates the redistributive and efficiency impacts of expanding access to positive credit information in a financially excluded economy. Using microdata from Uruguay's 2021 household survey, we simulate three data regimes negative only, partial positive (Score+), and synthetic full visibility and assess their effects on access to credit, interest burden, and inequality. Our findings reveal that enabling broader data sharing substantially reduces financial costs, compresses interest rate dispersion, and lowers the Gini coefficient of credit burden. While partial visibility benefits a subset of the population, full synthetic access delivers the most equitable and efficient outcomes. The analysis positions credit data as a non-rival public asset with transformative implications for financial inclusion and poverty reduction.</description>

      <title>Development finance institutions (DFIs), political conditions, and foreign direct investment (FDI) in Sub-Saharan Africa</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the dynamic relationship between development finance institutions (DFIs), foreign direct investment (FDI), and economic development in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) from 1990 to 2018, using a quantitative panel dataset of annual data for five SSA countries (Nigeria, Ghana, Kenya, South Africa, and Zimbabwe) and a fixed-effects model estimated in STATA. Specifically, the analysis examines whether DFIs enhance FDI inflows, thereby promoting economic growth and contributing to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The findings indicate that although DFIs have a theoretically positive impact on FDI, this relationship is not statistically significant across the sample, suggesting contextual dependencies influenced by regional economic variations. The study also analyzes how economic growth, trade openness, inflation, political stability, and the rule of law influence this nexus, elucidating their roles in shaping investment climates. A sectoral analysis indicates that DFI investments in infrastructure, agribusiness, and finance significantly affect FDI, with infrastructure having the greatest impact owing to its foundational role in economic systems. This research contributes by linking DFIs with FDI in SSA in a panel setting, thus providing a framework for policymakers to strengthen institutional and macroeconomic conditions to optimize the impact of DFIs on FDI and, ultimately, on sustainable development. The findings underscore the need for targeted policies to address regional disparities and enhance DFI effectiveness in fostering sustainable growth.</description>

      <title>Income Taxes, Gross Hourly Wages, and the Anatomy of Behavioral Responses: Evidence from a Danish Tax Reform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper provides quasi-experimental evidence on how income taxes affect gross hourly wages, utilizing Danish administrative data and a tax reform that introduced joint taxation. Exploiting spousal income for identification, we present nonparametric, difference-in-differences graphical evidence among husbands. For low-income workers, taxes have negative and dynamic effects on wages; their wage elasticity with respect to net-of-marginal-tax rates is 0.4. For medium-income workers, the effects are smaller and insignificant. Wages respond to taxes through promotions or job-to-job transitions. Neither daily nor annual hours worked respond significantly; consequently, annual earnings respond to taxes primarily through hourly wages, rather than through labor supply.</description>

      <title>The Crisis Simulator for Bolivia (KISr-p): An Empirically Grounded Modeling Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This document presents a detailed technical report of the ``Crisis Simulator for Bolivia (KISr-p),'' a quarterly stochastic model designed to evaluate the impact of various macroeconomic policy strategies in an environment of high uncertainty and structural constraints. Unlike standard general equilibrium frameworks, this simulator is grounded in the consolidated empirical findings of a vast collection of meta-analyses, adopting the theoretical architecture of a Keynesian Intertemporal Synthesis (KIS) with a Constant Elasticity of Substitution (KIS-CES) production function. The calibration of each model block -- real, fiscal, monetary, external, labor, and distributional -- is described in detail, with parameters justified by quantitative evidence on the hierarchy of fiscal multipliers (Gechert and Rannenberg, 2018), the complementarity of production factors (Gechert et al., 2022), monopsony power in the labor market (Sokolova and S{\o}rensen, 2021), and the dynamics of exchange rate and interest-rate pass-through. The model integrates these empirical regularities to generate non-linear dynamics such as state-dependent multipliers, asymmetric responses to shocks, and business-cycle phase interactions. Simulation results highlight the trade-offs between fiscal adjustment, external financing, debt restructuring, and structural reforms -- such as aggressive spending reallocation and targeted public investment. Scenarios show that pragmatic policy approaches that prioritize the \textit{composition} of spending over its aggregate level and that recognize institutional frictions yield superior macroeconomic and welfare outcomes compared to doctrinaire, one-size-fits-all prescriptions.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the Public Pay Gap: A Comparison of Public and Private Sector Wages in France</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper resolves the empirical puzzle in the public-private wage literature: why studies using similar data reach contradictory conclusions about wage premiums and penalties. Utilizing rich French administrative panel data (2012-2019), this study has two main contributions: first, it presents a set of new, intuitive yet previously undocumented stylized facts about wage dynamics, sectoral mobility, and gender differences across sectors. The results reveal that the modest hourly wage gaps conceal substantial disparities in lifetime earnings and employment stability. Women, in particular, gain a significant lifetime earnings advantage in the public sector, driven by higher retention, better-compensated part-time work, and more equitable annual hours compared to the private sector, where gender gaps remain larger, especially for those with higher education. In contrast, highly educated men experience a lifetime penalty in public employment due to rigid wage structures. By flexibly modeling sectoral transitions, transitions into and out of employment, and earnings heterogeneity using an Expectation-Maximization algorithm, this study shows that both premiums and penalties depend systematically on gender, education, and labor market experience. The analysis reveals that significant unobserved heterogeneity remains in wage dynamics. These findings unify prevailing narratives by providing a comprehensive, descriptive account of sectoral differences in transitions, part-time work and wages by gender.</description>

      <title>New Demand Economics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a theory of demand economics for an era of material abundance. The binding constraint on growth has shifted from insufficient aggregate demand to inadequate demand-tier upgrading. Our result is that, the new engine of growth lies in upgrading the demand hierarchy: higher-tier demands generate larger value-creation multipliers. The key mechanism is education-driven utility management. Education transforms the social utility function, raises the utility of higher-tier goods, and directs resources toward higher-value domains; this warrants a policy reorientation away from short-run aggregate stimulus toward education-centered, long-horizon investments in human capital. Methodologically, we build an estimable general-equilibrium framework.</description>

      <title>Universalization and the Origins of Fiscal Capacity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a model of tax compliance and fiscal capacity grounded in universalization reasoning. Citizens partially internalize the consequences of concealment by imagining a world in which everyone acted similarly, linking their compliance decisions to the perceived effectiveness of public spending. A selfish elite chooses between public goods and private rents, taking compliance as given. In equilibrium, citizens' moral internalization expands the feasible tax base and induces elites to allocate resources toward provision rather than appropriation. When the value of public spending is uncertain, morality enables credible reform: high-value elites can signal their type through provision, prompting citizens to increase compliance and raising fiscal capacity within the same period. The analysis thus identifies a moral channel through which states may escape low-capacity traps even under weak institutions.</description>

      <title>Are penalty shootouts better than a coin toss? Evidence from European football</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Penalty shootouts play an important role in the knockout stage of major football tournaments, especially since the 2021/22 season, when the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) scrapped the away goals rule in its club competitions. Inspired by this rule change, our paper examines whether the outcome of a penalty shootout can be predicted in UEFA club competitions. Based on all shootouts between 2000 and 2025, we find no evidence for the effect of the kicking order, the field of the match, and psychological momentum. In contrast to previous results, stronger teams, defined first by Elo ratings, do not perform better than their weaker opponents. Consequently, penalty shootouts are equivalent to a perfect lottery in top European football.</description>

      <title>A study about who is interested in stock splitting and why: considering companies, shareholders or managers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There are many misconceptions around stock prices, stock splits, shareholders, investors, and managers behaviour about such informations due to a number of confounding factors. This paper tests hypotheses with a selected database, about the question ''is stock split attractive for companies?'' in another words, ''why companies split their stock?'', ''why managers split their stock?'', sometimes for no benefit, and ''why shareholders agree with such decisions?''. We contribute to the existing knowledge through a discussion of nine events in recent (selectively chosen) years, observing the role of information asymmetries, the returns and traded volumes before and after the event. Therefore, calculating the beta for each sample, it is found that stock splits (i) affect the market and slightly enhance the trading volume in a short-term, (ii) increase the shareholder base for its firm, (iii) have a positive effect on the liquidity of the market. We concur that stock split announcements can reduce the level of information asymmetric. Investors readjust their beliefs in the firm, although most of the firms are mispriced in the stock split year.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Arrow--Debreu: A New Framework for Exchange, Time, and Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16003v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper revisits the Arrow-Debreu general equilibrium framework through the lens of effective trade, emphasizing the distinction between theoretical and realizable market interactions. We develop the Effective Trade Model (ETM), where transactions arise from bilateral feasibility rather than aggregate supply and demand desires. Within this framework, we establish the main properties of the price-demand correspondence and prove the existence of Nash equilibria, incorporating production, money, and network topology. The analysis extends to time, uncertainty, and open economies, revealing how loanable funds and exchange rates emerge endogenously. Our results show that equilibrium is shaped by transaction constraints, subjective pricing, and decentralized negotiation, rather than by universal market-clearing conditions, and thereby call into question the foundations of welfare theory. Anticipation is modeled via the conditional mode, capturing bounded rationality and information limitations in contrast to the rational expectations hypothesis. The ETM thus offers a behaviorally and structurally grounded alternative to classical general equilibrium, bridging microfoundations, monetary dynamics, and temporal consistency within a unified framework.</description>

      <title>Feature-driven reinforcement learning for photovoltaic in continuous intraday trading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16021v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photovoltaic (PV) operators face substantial uncertainty in generation and short-term electricity prices. Continuous intraday markets enable producers to adjust their positions in real time, potentially improving revenues and reducing imbalance costs. We propose a feature-driven reinforcement learning (RL) approach for PV intraday trading that integrates data-driven features into the state and learns bidding policies in a sequential decision framework. The problem is cast as a Markov Decision Process with a reward that balances trading profit and imbalance penalties and is solved with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) using a predominantly linear, interpretable policy. Trained on historical market data and evaluated out-of-sample, the strategy consistently outperforms benchmark baselines across diverse scenarios. Extensive validation shows rapid convergence, real-time inference, and transparent decision rules. Learned weights highlight the central role of market microstructure and historical features. Taken together, these results indicate that feature-driven RL offers a practical, data-efficient, and operationally deployable pathway for active intraday participation by PV producers.</description>

      <title>Do Determinants of EV Purchase Intent vary across the Spectrum? Evidence from Bayesian Analysis of US Survey Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09854v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While electric vehicle (EV) adoption has been widely studied, most research focuses on the average effects of predictors on purchase intent, overlooking variation across the distribution of EV purchase intent. This paper makes a threefold contribution by analyzing four unique explanatory variables, leveraging large-scale US survey data from 2021 to 2023, and employing Bayesian ordinal probit and Bayesian ordinal quantile modeling to evaluate the effects of these variables-while controlling for other commonly used covariates-on EV purchase intent, both on average and across its full distribution. By modeling purchase intent as an ordered outcome-from "not at all likely" to "very likely"-we reveal how covariate effects differ across levels of interest. This is the first application of ordinal quantile modeling in the EV adoption literature, uncovering heterogeneity in how potential buyers respond to key factors. For instance, confidence in development of charging infrastructure and belief in environmental benefits are linked not only to higher interest among likely adopters but also to reduced resistance among more skeptical respondents. Notably, we identify a gap between the prevalence and influence of key predictors: although few respondents report strong infrastructure confidence or frequent EV information exposure, both factors are strongly associated with increased intent across the spectrum. These findings suggest clear opportunities for targeted communication and outreach, alongside infrastructure investment, to support widespread EV adoption.</description>

      <title>Cost-benefit analysis of an AI-driven operational digital platform for integrated electric mobility, renewable energy, and grid management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20631v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Integrating electric mobility, such as electric vehicles (EVs), electric trucks (ETs), and renewable energy sources (RES) with the power grid is paramount for decarbonization, efficiency, and stability. Two gaps remain: the need for digital platforms that coordinate operations across sectors and borders, and the lack of a rigorous framework on their cost-benefit profile. This paper presents a comprehensive cost-benefit analysis (CBA) of an AI-driven operational digital platform (ODP) designed for holistic, cross-sectoral and cross-border optimization. The ODP targets improvements in energy efficiency, grid reliability, and environmental sustainability. We develop a seven-step CBA framework that links each benefit stream to the platform's architecture and quantifies incremental gains relative to the existing system, while accounting for investment and operating costs. The framework is demonstrated with case studies for Austria, Hungary, and Slovenia. Results indicate a benefit-cost ratio (BCR) of about 1.41 and a net present value (NPV) exceeding euro 356 million over 2026-2035. Robustness is examined through extensive sensitivity analyses that vary discount rates, cost components, and adoption trajectories, as well as through Monte Carlo simulations that capture uncertainty in BCR, NPV, data availability, and AI accuracy. The findings support the viability of investing in digital platforms for cross-sectoral and cross-border integration, and highlight the role of ODPs in advancing decarbonization and efficiency in the mobility-power nexus.</description>

Abstract: The application of Reinforcement Learning (RL) to economic modeling reveals a fundamental conflict between the assumptions of equilibrium theory and the emergent behavior of learning agents. While canonical economic models assume atomistic agents act as `takers' of aggregate market conditions, a naive single-agent RL simulation incentivizes the agent to become a `manipulator' of its environment. This paper first demonstrates this discrepancy within a search-and-matching model with concave production, showing that a standard RL agent learns a non-equilibrium, monopsonistic policy. Additionally, we identify a parametric bias arising from the mismatch between economic discounting and RL's treatment of intertemporal costs. To address both issues, we propose a calibrated Mean-Field Reinforcement Learning framework that embeds a representative agent in a fixed macroeconomic field and adjusts the cost function to reflect economic opportunity costs. Our iterative algorithm converges to a self-consistent fixed point where the agent's policy aligns with the competitive equilibrium. This approach provides a tractable and theoretically sound methodology for modeling learning agents in economic systems within the broader domain of computational social science.</description>

      <title>Working with AI: Measuring the Applicability of Generative AI to Occupations</title>

Abstract: Given the rapid adoption of generative AI and its potential to impact a wide range of tasks, understanding the effects of AI on the economy is one of society's most important questions. In this work, we take a step toward that goal by analyzing the work activities people do with AI, how successfully and broadly those activities are done, and combine that with data on what occupations do those activities. We analyze a dataset of 200k anonymized and privacy-scrubbed conversations between users and Microsoft Bing Copilot, a publicly available generative AI system. We find the most common work activities people seek AI assistance for involve gathering information and writing, while the most common activities that AI itself is performing are providing information and assistance, writing, teaching, and advising. Combining these activity classifications with measurements of task success and scope of impact, we compute an AI applicability score for each occupation. We find the highest AI applicability scores for knowledge work occupation groups such as computer and mathematical, and office and administrative support, as well as occupations such as sales whose work activities involve providing and communicating information. Additionally, we characterize the types of work activities performed most successfully, how wage and education correlate with AI applicability, and how real-world usage compares to predictions of occupational AI impact.</description>

      <title>Spatial and Temporal Boundaries in Difference-in-Differences: A Framework from Navier-Stokes Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11013v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper develops a unified framework for identifying spatial and temporal boundaries of treatment effects in difference-in-differences designs. Starting from fundamental fluid dynamics equations (Navier-Stokes), we derive conditions under which treatment effects decay exponentially in space and time, enabling researchers to calculate explicit boundaries beyond which effects become undetectable. The framework encompasses both linear (pure diffusion) and nonlinear (advection-diffusion with chemical reactions) regimes, with testable scope conditions based on dimensionless numbers from physics (P\'eclet and Reynolds numbers). We demonstrate the framework's diagnostic capability using air pollution from coal-fired power plants. Analyzing 791 ground-based PM$_{2.5}$ monitors and 189,564 satellite-based NO$_2$ grid cells in the Western United States over 2019-2021, we find striking regional heterogeneity: within 100 km of coal plants, both pollutants show positive spatial decay (PM$_{2.5}$: $\kappa_s = 0.00200$, $d^* = 1,153$ km; NO$_2$: $\kappa_s = 0.00112$, $d^* = 2,062$ km), validating the framework. Beyond 100 km, negative decay parameters correctly signal that urban sources dominate and diffusion assumptions fail. Ground-level PM$_{2.5}$ decays approximately twice as fast as satellite column NO$_2$, consistent with atmospheric transport physics. The framework successfully diagnoses its own validity in four of eight analyzed regions, providing researchers with physics-based tools to assess whether their spatial difference-in-differences setting satisfies diffusion assumptions before applying the estimator. Our results demonstrate that rigorous boundary detection requires both theoretical derivation from first principles and empirical validation of underlying physical assumptions.</description>
