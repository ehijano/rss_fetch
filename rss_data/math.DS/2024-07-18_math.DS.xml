      <title>Proof of Wojtkowski's Falling Particle Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we present an unconditional proof of Wojtkowski's Ergodicity Conjecture for almost every system of 1D perfectly elastic balls falling down in a half line under constant gravitational acceleration. Namely, by introducing a new algebraic approach, we prove that almost every such system is (completely hyperbolic and) ergodic.</description>

      <title>Proportions of Incommensurate, Resonant, and Chaotic Orbits for Torus Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on distinguishing classes of dynamical behavior for one- and two-dimensional torus maps, in particular between orbits that are incommensurate, resonant, periodic, or chaotic. We first consider Arnold's circle map, for which there is a universal power law for the fraction of nonresonant orbits as a function of the amplitude of the nonlinearity. Our methods give a more precise calculation of the coefficients for this power law. For two-dimensional torus maps, we show that there is no such universal law for any of the classes of orbits. However, we find different categories of maps with qualitatively similar behavior. Our results are obtained using three fast and high precision numerical methods: weighted Birkhoff averages, Farey trees, and resonance orders.</description>

      <title>Polynomial convergence rate at infinity for the cusp winding spectrum of generalized Schottky groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the convergence rate of the cusp winding spectrum to the Hausdorff dimension of the limit set of a generalized Schottky group with one parabolic generator is polynomial. Our main theorem provides the new phenomenon in which differences in the Hausdorff dimension of the limit set generated by a Markov system cause essentially different results on multifractal analysis. This paper also provides a new characterization of the geodesic flow on the Poinca\'re disc model of two-dimensional hyperbolic space and the limit set of a generalized Schottky group. To prove our main theorem we use thermodynamic formalism on a countable Markov shift, gamma function, and zeta function.</description>

      <title>Global bifurcations organizing weak chimeras in three symmetrically coupled Kuramoto oscillators with inertia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Frequency desynchronized attractors cannot appear in identically coupled symmetric phase oscillators because "overtaking" of phases cannot occur. This restriction no longer applies for more general identically coupled oscillators. Hence, it is interesting to understand precisely how frequency synchrony is lost and how invariant sets such as attracting weak chimeras are generated at torus breakup, where the phase description breaks down. Maistrenko et al (2016) found numerical evidence of an organizing center for weak chimeras in a system of $N=3$ coupled identical Kuramoto oscillators with inertia. This paper identifies this organizing center and shows that it corresponds to a particular type of non-transverse heteroclinic bifurcation that is generic in the context of symmetry. At this codimension two bifurcation there is a splitting of connecting orbits between the in-phase (fully synchronized) state. This generates a wide variety of associated bifurcations to weak chimeras. We further highlight a second organizing center associated with a codimension two symmetry-breaking heteroclinic connection.</description>

      <title>Random ordinate method for mitigating the ray effect in radiative transport equation simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Discrete Ordinates Method (DOM) is the most widely used velocity discretization method for simulating the radiative transport equation. The ray effect stands as a long-standing drawback of DOM. In benchmark tests displaying the ray effect, we observe low regularity in velocity within the solution. To address this issue, we propose a random ordinate method (ROM) to mitigate the ray effect. Compared with other strategies proposed in the literature for mitigating the ray effect, ROM offers several advantages: 1) the computational cost is comparable to DOM; 2) it is simple and requires minimal changes to existing code based on DOM; 3) it is easily parallelizable and independent of the problem setup. Analytical results are presented for the convergence orders of the error and bias, and numerical tests demonstrate its effectiveness in mitigating the ray effect.</description>

      <title>Effective equidistribution of orbits under semisimple groups on congruence quotients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove an effective equidistribution result for periodic orbits of semisimple groups on congruence quotients of an ambient semisimple group. This extends previous work of Einsiedler, Margulis and Venkatesh. The main new feature is that we allow for periodic orbits of semisimple groups with nontrivial centralizer in the ambient group. Our proof uses crucially an effective closing lemma from work with Lindenstrauss, Margulis, Mohammadi, and Shah.</description>

      <title>A Scalable Real-Time Data Assimilation Framework for Predicting Turbulent Atmosphere Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12168v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The weather and climate domains are undergoing a significant transformation thanks to advances in AI-based foundation models such as FourCastNet, GraphCast, ClimaX and Pangu-Weather. While these models show considerable potential, they are not ready yet for operational use in weather forecasting or climate prediction. This is due to the lack of a data assimilation method as part of their workflow to enable the assimilation of incoming Earth system observations in real time. This limitation affects their effectiveness in predicting complex atmospheric phenomena such as tropical cyclones and atmospheric rivers. To overcome these obstacles, we introduce a generic real-time data assimilation framework and demonstrate its end-to-end performance on the Frontier supercomputer. This framework comprises two primary modules: an ensemble score filter (EnSF), which significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art data assimilation method, namely, the Local Ensemble Transform Kalman Filter (LETKF); and a vision transformer-based surrogate capable of real-time adaptation through the integration of observational data. The ViT surrogate can represent either physics-based models or AI-based foundation models. We demonstrate both the strong and weak scaling of our framework up to 1024 GPUs on the Exascale supercomputer, Frontier. Our results not only illustrate the framework's exceptional scalability on high-performance computing systems, but also demonstrate the importance of supercomputers in real-time data assimilation for weather and climate predictions. Even though the proposed framework is tested only on a benchmark surface quasi-geostrophic (SQG) turbulence system, it has the potential to be combined with existing AI-based foundation models, making it suitable for future operational implementations.</description>

      <title>Multi evolutional deep neural networks (Multi-EDNN)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12293v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Evolutional deep neural networks (EDNN) solve partial differential equations (PDEs) by marching the network representation of the solution fields, using the governing equations. Use of a single network to solve coupled PDEs on large domains requires a large number of network parameters and incurs a significant computational cost. We introduce coupled EDNN (C-EDNN) to solve systems of PDEs by using independent networks for each state variable, which are only coupled through the governing equations. We also introduce distributed EDNN (D-EDNN) by spatially partitioning the global domain into several elements and assigning individual EDNNs to each element to solve the local evolution of the PDE. The networks then exchange the solution and fluxes at their interfaces, similar to flux-reconstruction methods, and ensure that the PDE dynamics are accurately preserved between neighboring elements. Together C-EDNN and D-EDNN form the general class of Multi-EDNN methods. We demonstrate these methods with aid of canonical problems including linear advection, the heat equation, and the compressible Navier-Stokes equations in Couette and Taylor-Green flows.</description>

      <title>The shortest experiment for linear system identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12509v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the following problem: given an upper bound of the state-space dimension and lag of a linear time-invariant system, design a sequence of inputs so that the system dynamics can be recovered from the resulting input-output data. As our main result we propose a new online experiment design method, meaning that the selection of the inputs is iterative and guided by data samples collected in the past. We show that this approach leads to the shortest possible experiments for linear system identification. In terms of sample complexity, the proposed method outperforms offline methods based on persistency of excitation as well as existing online experiment design methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12540v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modified Patankar schemes are linearly implicit time integration methods designed to be unconditionally positive and conservative. In the present work we extend the Patankar-type approach to linear multistep methods and prove that the resulting discretizations retain, with no restrictions on the step size, the positivity of the solution and the linear invariant of the continuous-time system. Moreover, we provide results on arbitrarily high order of convergence and we introduce an embedding technique for the Patankar weight denominators to achieve it.</description>

      <title>Estimate Epidemiological Parameters given Partial Observations based on Algebraically Observable PINNs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12598v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we considered the problem of estimating epidemiological parameters based on physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). In practice, not all trajectory data corresponding to the population estimated by epidemic models can be obtained, and some observed trajectories are noisy. Learning PINNs to estimate unknown epidemiological parameters using such partial observations is challenging. Accordingly, we introduce the concept of algebraic observability into PINNs. The validity of the proposed PINN, named as an algebraically observable PINNs, in terms of estimation parameters and prediction of unobserved variables, is demonstrated through numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>A SageMath Package for Elementary and Sign Vectors with Applications to Chemical Reaction Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present our SageMath package elementary_vectors for computing elementary and sign vectors of real subspaces. In this setting, elementary vectors are support-minimal vectors that can be determined from maximal minors of a real matrix representing a subspace. By applying the sign function, we obtain the cocircuits of the corresponding oriented matroid, which in turn allow the computation of all sign vectors of a real subspace.
  As an application, we discuss sign vector conditions for existence and uniqueness of complex-balanced equilibria of chemical reaction networks with generalized mass-action kinetics. The conditions are formulated in terms of sign vectors of two subspaces arising from the stoichiometric coefficients and the kinetic orders of the reactions. We discuss how these conditions can be checked algorithmically, and we demonstrate the functionality of our package sign_vector_conditions in several examples.</description>

      <title>Flow views and infinite interval exchange transformations for recognizable substitutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.07997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2103.07997v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A flow view is the graph of a measurable conjugacy $\Phi$ between a substitution or S-adic subshift $(\Sigma,\sigma, \mu)$ and an exchange of infinitely many intervals in $([0,1], F, m)$, where $m$ is Lebesgue measure. A natural refining sequence of partitions of $\Sigma$ is transferred to $([0,1],m)$ using a canonical addressing scheme, a fixed dual substitution, and a shift-invariant probability measure $\mu$. On the flow view, $T \in \Sigma$ is shown horizontally at a height of $\Phi(T)$ using colored unit intervals to represent the letters.
  The infinite interval exchange transformation $F$ is well approximated by exchanges of finitely many intervals, making numeric and graphic methods possible. We prove that in certain cases a choice of dual substitution guarantees that $F$ is self-similar. We discuss why the spectral type of $\Phi \in L^2(\Sigma, \mu),$ is of particular interest. As an example of utility, some spectral results for constant-length substitutions are included.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2109.12478v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Poincar\'{e}-Bendixson theorem is one of the most fundamental tools to capture the limit behaviors of orbits of flows. It was generalized and applied to various phenomena in dynamical systems, differential equations, foliations, group actions, translation lines, and semi-dynamical systems. On the other hand, though the no-slip boundary condition is a fundamental condition in differential equations and appears in various fluid phenomena, and Lakes of Wada attractors naturally occur in discrete and continuous real dynamical systems and complex dynamics, no generalizations of the Poincar\'{e}-Bendixson theorem can be applied to any differential equations with no-slip boundary condition on surfaces with boundary and flows with Lakes of Wada attractors. To analyze them, we generalize the Poincar\'{e}-Bendixson theorem into one for flows with arbitrarily many singular points on possibly non-compact surfaces by introducing some concepts to describe limit behaviors and using methods of foliation theory and general topology.</description>

Abstract: We determine the Hausdorff dimension of sets of irrationals in $(0,1)$ whose partial quotients in semi-regular continued fractions obey certain restrictions and growth conditions. This result substantially generalizes that of the second author [Proc. Amer. Math. Soc. {\bf 151} (2023), 3645--3653] and the solution of Hirst's conjecture [B.-W. Wang and J. Wu, Bull. London Math. Soc. {\bf 40} (2008), 18--22], both previously obtained for the regular continued fraction. To prove the result, we construct non-autonomous iterated function systems well-adapted to the given restrictions and growth conditions on partial quotients, estimate the associated pressure functions, and then apply Bowen's formula.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning for the identification of phase-transitions in interacting agent-based systems: a Desai-Zwanzig example</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.19039v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deriving closed-form, analytical expressions for reduced-order models, and judiciously choosing the closures leading to them, has long been the strategy of choice for studying phase- and noise-induced transitions for agent-based models (ABMs). In this paper, we propose a data-driven framework that pinpoints phase transitions for an ABM- the Desai-Zwanzig model in its mean-field limit, using a smaller number of variables than traditional closed-form models. To this end, we use the manifold learning algorithm Diffusion Maps to identify a parsimonious set of data-driven latent variables, and show that they are in one-to-one correspondence with the expected theoretical order parameter of the ABM. We then utilize a deep learning framework to obtain a conformal reparametrization of the data-driven coordinates that facilitates, in our example, the identification of a single parameter-dependent ODE in these coordinates. We identify this ODE through a residual neural network inspired by a numerical integration scheme (forward Euler). We then use the identified ODE - enabled through an odd symmetry transformation - to construct the bifurcation diagram exhibiting the phase transition.</description>

      <title>A novel comparison framework for epidemiological strategies applied to age-based restrictions versus horizontal lockdowns</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.01517v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: During an epidemic, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, policy-makers are faced with the decision of implementing effective, yet socioeconomically costly intervention strategies, such as school and workplace closure, physical distancing, etc. In this study, we propose a rigorous definition of epidemiological strategies. In addition, we develop a scheme for comparing certain epidemiological strategies, with the goal of providing policy-makers with a tool for their systematic comparison. Then, we put the suggested scheme to the test by employing an age-based epidemiological compartment model introduced in Bitsouni et al. (2024), coupled with data from the literature, in order to compare the effectiveness of age-based and horizontal interventions. In general, our findings suggest that these two are comparable, mainly at a low or medium level of intensity.</description>

      <title>Variational principles of relative weighted topological pressures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03679v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, M. Tsukamoto (New approach to weighted topological entropy and pressure, Ergod. Theory Dyn. Syst. 43 (2023) 1004-1034) used a new approach to define the weighted topological entropy and pressure. Inspired by his ideas, we introduce the relative weighted topological entropy and pressure for factor maps and establish several variational principles. One of these results involves a question raised by D. Feng and W. Huang (Variational principle for weighted topological pressure, J. Math. Pures Appl. 106 (2016) 411-452), whether there is a relative version of the weighted variation principle. In this paper, we try to establish such variational principle. Furthermore, we generalize the Ledrappier and Walters' type relative variational principle to the weighted version.</description>

      <title>Multifractal Analysis of F-exponents for Finitely Irreducible Conformal Graph Directed Markov Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09348v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\Phi = \{\phi_e\}_{e\in E}$ be a finitely irreducible conformal graph directed Markov system (CGDMS) with symbolic representation $E_A^{\infty}$ and limit set $J$. Under a mild condition on the system, we give a multifractal analysis of level sets of Birkhoff averages with respect to Hausdorff dimension for a large family of functions. We then apply these results to a few examples in the case of both $E$ finite and $E$ countably infinite.</description>

      <title>Graphes dans les surfaces et ergodicit\'e topologique</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.00516v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The simplest way to make a dynamical system out of a finite connected graph $G$ is to give it a polarization, that is to say a cyclic ordering of the edges incident to a vertex, for each vertex. The phase space $\mathcal{P}(G)$ then consists of all pairs $(v,e)$ where $v$ is a vertex and $e$ is an edge incident to $v$. Such an initial condition gives a position and a momentum. The data $(v,e)$ is of course equivalent to an edge endowed with an orientation $e_{\mathcal O}$. With the polarization, each initial data leads to a leftward walk defined by turning left at each vertex, or making a rebound if there is no other edge. A leftward walk is called complete if it goes through all edges of $G$, not necessarily in both directions. As usual, we define the valence of a vertex as the number of edges incident to it, and we define the valence of a graph as the average of the valences of its vertices. In this article, we prove that if a graph which is embedded in a closed oriented surface of genus $g$ admits a complete leftward walk, then its valence is at most $1 + \sqrt{6g+1}$. We prove furthermore that this result is sharp for infinitely many genera $g$, and that it is asymptotically optimal as $g \to + \infty$. This leads to obstructions for the embeddability of graphs on a surface in a way which admits a complete leftward walk. Since checking that a polarized graph admits a complete leftward walk or not is done in time $4N$, where $N$ is the cardinality of the edges, this obstruction is particularly efficient in terms of computability. This problem has its origins in interesting consequences for what we will call here the topological ergodicity of conservative systems, especially Hamiltonian systems $H$ in two dimensions where the existence of a complete leftward walk corresponds to a topologically ergodic orbit of the system, i.e. an orbit of $H$ visiting all the topology of the surface.</description>

      <title>Good functions, measures, and the Kleinbock-Tomanov conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.10456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.10456v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we prove a conjecture of Kleinbock and Tomanov \cite[Conjecture~FP]{KT} on Diophantine properties of a large class of fractal measures on $\mathbb{Q}_p^n$. More generally, we establish the $p$-adic analogues of the influential results of Kleinbock, Lindenstrauss, and Weiss \cite{KLW} on Diophantine properties of friendly measures. We further prove the $p$-adic analogue of one of the main results in \cite{Kleinbock-exponent} due to Kleinbock concerning Diophantine inheritance of affine subspaces, which answers a question of Kleinbock. One of the key ingredients in the proofs of \cite{KLW} is a result on $(C, \alpha)$-good functions whose proof crucially uses the mean value theorem. Our main technical innovation is an alternative approach to establishing that certain functions are $(C, \alpha)$-good in the $p$-adic setting. We believe this result will be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Irregular Fixation II: The orbits of irregular satellites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05123v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Irregular satellites (IS) are believed to have been captured during the Solar system's dynamical history and provide clues for the Solar system's formation and evolution. IS occupy a large fraction of the Hill sphere of their host planet and their orbits are highly perturbed by the Sun. We use a novel formalism developed in paper I to characterise their orbits in terms of an effective secular Hamiltonian (the Brown Hamiltonian) that accounts for their large orbital separations. We find that prograde satellites generally follow the Brown Hamiltonian, while retrograde satellites (which extend further) deviate more significantly. Nevertheless, the phase portrait is much better described by the Brown Hamiltonian for all satellites. We construct a semi-analytic criterion that predicts the librating orbit based on the effective energy due to the Brown Hamiltonian. We also check our results with highly accurate N-body integrations of satellite orbits, where initial conditions are loaded directly from the updated ephemeris from the NASA Horizons database. Although the retrograde librating orbits occupy more area in the parameter space, the vast majority of librating IS are prograde. Using our method we find $13$ librating satellites, $8$ of them previously known to librate, and the rest shown to librate for the first time. Further observations of existing and new satellites could shed more light on the dynamical history of the Solar system and satellite formation and test our results.</description>
