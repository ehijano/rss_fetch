      <title>Complete asymptotic analysis of low energy scattering for Schrodinger operators with a short-range potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent work by Hintz--Vasy provides a partial asymptotic analysis of the low-energy limit of scattering for Schrodinger operators with a short-range potential. Using a slight refinement of Hintz's algorithm, we complete the asymptotic analysis by providing full asymptotic expansions in every possible asymptotic regime. Moreover, the analysis is done in any dimension $d\geq 3$, for any asymptotically conic manifold, and we keep track of partial multipole expansions.</description>

      <title>Intelligent acceleration adaptive control of linear $2\times2$ hyperbolic PDE systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional approaches to stabilizing hyperbolic PDEs, such as PDE backstepping, often encounter challenges when dealing with high-dimensional or complex nonlinear problems. Their solutions require high computational and analytical costs. Recently, neural operators (NOs) for the backstepping design of first-order hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs) have been introduced, which rapidly generate gain kernel without requiring online numerical solution. In this paper we apply neural operators to a more complex class of $2\times2$ hyperbolic PDE systems for adaptive stability control. Once the NO has been well-trained offline on a sufficient training set obtained using a numerical solver, the kernel equation no longer needs to be solved again, thereby avoiding the high computational cost during online operations.Specifically, we introduce the deep operator network (DeepONet), a neural network framework, to learn the nonlinear operator of the system parameters to the kernel gain. The approximate backstepping kernel is obtained by utilizing the network after learning, instead of numerically solving the kernel equations in the form of PDEs, to further derive the approximate controller and the target system. We analyze the existence and approximation of DeepONet operators and provide stability and convergence proofs for the closed-loop systems with NOs. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed NN-adaptive control scheme is verified by comparative simulation, which shows that the NN operator achieved up to three orders of magnitude faster compared to conventional PDE solvers, significantly improving real-time control performance.</description>

      <title>Increasing stability for inverse acoustic source problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we show the increasing stability of the inverse source problems for the acoustic wave equation in the full space R3.The goal is to understand increasing stability for wave equation in the time domain. If the time and spatial variables of the source term can be separated with compact support, the increasing stability estimates of the $L^2$-norm of the acoustic source function can be established. The stability estimates consist of two parts: the Lipschitz type data discrepancy and the high time tail of the source functions. As the time increases, the latter decreases and thus becomes negligible.</description>

      <title>Well-Posedness and Regularity of the Heat Equation with Robin Boundary Conditions in the Two-Dimensional Wedge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Well-posedness and higher regularity of the heat equation with Robin boundary conditions in an unbounded two-dimensional wedge is established in an $L^{2}$-setting of monomially weighted spaces. A mathematical framework is developed which allows to obtain arbitrarily high regularity without a smallness assumption on the opening angle of the wedge. The challenging aspect is that the resolvent problem exhibits two breakings of the scaling invariance, one in the equation and one in the boundary condition.</description>

      <title>Sharp extinction rates for positive solutions of fast diffusion equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $s \in (0, 1]$ and $N &gt; 2s$. It is known that positive solutions to the (fractional) fast diffusion equation $\partial_t u + (-\Delta)^s (u^\frac{N-2s}{N+2s}) = 0$ on $(0, \infty) \times \mathbb R^N$ with regular enough initial datum extinguish after some finite time $T_* &gt; 0$. More precisely, one has $\frac{u(t,\cdot)}{U_{T_*, z, \lambda}(t,\cdot)} - 1 =o(1)$ as $t \to T_*^-$ for a certain extinction profile $U_{T_*, z, \lambda}$, uniformly on $\mathbb R^N$. In this paper, we prove the quantitative bound $ \frac{u(t,\cdot)}{U_{T_*, z, \lambda}(t,\cdot)} - 1 = \mathcal O( (T_*-t)^\frac{N+2s}{N-2s+2})$, in a natural weighted energy norm. The main point here is that the exponent $\frac{N+2s}{N-2s+2}$ is sharp. This is the analogue of a recent result by Bonforte and Figalli (CPAM, 2021) valid for $s = 1$ and bounded domains $\Omega \subset \mathbb R^N$. Our result is new also in the local case $s = 1$. The main obstacle we overcome is the degeneracy of an associated linearized operator, which generically does not occur in the bounded domain setting.
  For a smooth bounded domain $\Omega \subset \mathbb R^N$, we prove similar results for positive solutions to $\partial_t u + (-\Delta)^s (u^m) = 0$ on $(0, \infty) \times \Omega$ with Dirichlet boundary conditions when $s \in (0,1)$ and $m \in (\frac{N-2s}{N+2s}, 1)$, under a non-degeneracy assumption on the stationary solution. An important step here is to prove the convergence of the relative error, which is new for this case.</description>

      <title>Energy Dissipation and Regularity in Quaternionic Fluid Dynamics using Sobolev-Besov Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the dynamics of incompressible fluid flows through quaternionic variables integrated within Sobolev-Besov spaces. Traditional mathematical models for fluid dynamics often employ Sobolev spaces to analyze the regularity of the solution to the Navier-Stokes equations. However, with the unique ability of Besov spaces to provide localized frequency analysis and handle high-frequency behaviors, these spaces offer a refined approach to address complex fluid phenomena such as turbulence and bifurcation. Quaternionic analysis further enhances this approach by representing three-dimensional rotations directly within the mathematical framework. The author presents two new theorems to advance the study of regularity and energy dissipation in fluid systems. The first theorem demonstrates that energy dissipation in quaternionic fluid systems is dominated by the higher-frequency component in Besov spaces, with contributions decaying at a rate proportional to the frequency of the quaternionic component. The second theorem provides conditions for regularity and existence of solutions in quaternionic fluid systems with external forces. By integrating these hypercomplex structures with Sobolev-Besov spaces, our work offers a new mathematically rigorous framework capable of addressing frequency-specific dissipation patterns and rotational symmetries in turbulent flows. The findings contribute to fundamental questions in fluid dynamics, particularly by improving our understanding of high Reynolds number flows, energy cascade behaviors, and quaternionic bifurcation. This framework therefore paves the way for future research on regularity in complex fluid dynamics.</description>

      <title>Gluing methods for quantitative stability of optimal transport maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish quantitative stability bounds for the quadratic optimal transport map $T_\mu$ between a fixed probability density $\rho$ and a probability measure $\mu$ on $\mathbb{R}^d$. Under general assumptions on $\rho$, we prove that the map $\mu\mapsto T_\mu$ is bi-H\"older continuous, with dimension-free H\"older exponents. The linearized optimal transport metric $W_{2,\rho}(\mu,\nu)=\|T_\mu-T_\nu\|_{L^2(\rho)}$ is therefore bi-H\"older equivalent to the $2$-Wasserstein distance, which justifies its use in applications.
  We show this property in the following cases: (i) for any log-concave density $\rho$ with full support in $\mathbb{R}^d$, and any log-bounded perturbation thereof; (ii) for $\rho$ bounded away from $0$ and $+\infty$ on a John domain (e.g., on a bounded Lipschitz domain), while the only previously known result of this type assumed convexity of the domain; (iii) for some important families of probability densities on bounded domains which decay or blow-up polynomially near the boundary. Concerning the sharpness of point (ii), we also provide examples of non-John domains for which the Brenier potentials do not satisfy any H\"older stability estimate.
  Our proofs rely on local variance inequalities for the Brenier potentials in small convex subsets of the support of $\rho$, which are glued together to deduce a global variance inequality. This gluing argument is based on two different strategies of independent interest: one of them leverages the properties of the Whitney decomposition in bounded domains, the other one relies on spectral graph theory.</description>

      <title>A non-homogeneous generalization of Burgers equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we study generalizations of the inhomogeneous Burgers equation. First at the operator level, in the sense that we replace classical differential derivations by operators with certain properties, and then we increase the spatial dimensions of the Burgers equation, which is usually studied in one spatial dimension. This allows us, in one dimension, to find mathematical relationships between solutions of hyperbolic Brownian motion and the Burgers equations, which usually study the behaviour of mechanical fluids, and also, through appropriate transformations, to obtain in some cases exact solutions that depend on Hermite polynomials composed of appropriate functions. In the multi-dimensional case, this generalization allows us, by means of the method of invariant spaces, to find exact solutions on Riemannian and pseudo-Riemannian varieties, such as Schwarzschild and Ricci Solitons space, with time dictated by fractional derivatives, such as a Caputo-type operator of fractional evolution.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Approaches to The Energy Equality in Forced Surface Quasi-Geostrophic Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04500v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore probabilistic approaches to the deterministic energy equality for the forced Surface Quasi-Geostrophic (SQG) equation on a torus. First, we prove the zero-noise dynamical large deviations for a corresponding stochastic SQG equation, where the lower bound matches the upper bound on a certain closure of the weak-strong uniqueness class for the deterministic forced SQG equation. Furthermore, we show that the energy equality for the deterministic SQG equation holds on arbitrary time-reversible subsets of the domain, where we match the upper bound and the lower bound. Conversely, the violation of the deterministic energy equality breaks the lower bound of large deviations. These results extend the existing techniques in Gess, Heydecker, and the second author \cite{arXiv:2311.02223} to generalized Sobolev spaces with negative indices. Finally, we provide an analysis of the restricted quasi-potential and prove a conditional equivalence compared to the rate function of large deviations for the Gaussian distribution. This suggests a potential connection between non-Gaussian large deviations in equilibrium for the stochastic SQG equation and the open problem regarding the uniqueness of the deterministic SQG equation.</description>

      <title>Peregrine solitons and resonant radiation in cubic and quadratic media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the fascinating phenomena of resonant radiation emitted by transient rogue waves in cubic and quadratic nonlinear media, particularly those shed from Peregrine solitons, one of the main wavepackets used today to model real-world rogue waves. In cubic media, it turns out that the emission of radiation from a Peregrine soliton can be attributed to the presence of higher-order dispersion, but is affected by the intrinsic local longitudinal variation of the soliton wavenumber. In quadratic media, we reveal that a two-color Peregrine rogue wave can resonantly radiate dispersive waves even in the absence of higher-order dispersion, subjected to a phase-matching mechanism that involves the second harmonic wave, and to a concomitant difference-frequency generation process. In both cubic and quadratic media, we provide simple analytic criteria for calculating the radiated frequencies in terms of material parameters, showing excellent agreement with numerical simulations.</description>

Abstract: In this research, we define two concepts; random matrix and mean square stability. Studying the stability of solutions for perturbed random differential systems is included. Partial moments of the second order were verified, which determines the stability conditions of the studied systems, ensuring stability through Lyapunov functions. The differential equations that determine Lyapunov functions were obtained. The necessary conditions for Lyapunov matrices to ensure asymptotic stability were established.</description>

      <title>Clustering in Causal Attention Masking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04990v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents a modification of the self-attention dynamics proposed by Geshkovski et al. (arXiv:2312.10794) to better reflect the practically relevant, causally masked attention used in transformer architectures for generative AI. This modification translates into an interacting particle system that cannot be interpreted as a mean-field gradient flow. Despite this loss of structure, we significantly strengthen the results of Geshkovski et al. (arXiv:2312.10794) in this context: While previous rigorous results focused on cases where all three matrices (Key, Query, and Value) were scaled identities, we prove asymptotic convergence to a single cluster for arbitrary key-query matrices and a value matrix equal to the identity. Additionally, we establish a connection to the classical R\'enyi parking problem from combinatorial geometry to make initial theoretical steps towards demonstrating the existence of meta-stable states.</description>

Abstract: Our goal is to compute excited states for the nonlinear Schr{\"o}dinger equation in the radial setting. We introduce a new technique based on the Nehari manifold approach and give a comparison with the classical shooting method. We observe that the Nehari method allows to accurately compute excited states on large domains but is relatively slow compared to the shooting method.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we consider different versions of the classical Hopf's boundary lemma in the setting of the fractional $p-$Laplacian for $p \geq 2$. We start by providing for a new proof to a Hopf's lemma based on comparison principles. Afterwards, we give a Hopf's result for sign-changing potential describing the behavior of the fractional normal derivative of solutions around boundary points. The main contribution here is that we do not need to impose a global condition on the sign of the solution. Applications of the main results to boundary point lemmas and non-local non-linear overdetermined problems are also provided.</description>

Abstract: We establish the existence and uniqueness of some smooth accelerating transonic flows governed by the three dimensional steady compressible Euler equations with an external force in cylinders with arbitrary cross sections, which include both irrotational flows and Beltrami flows with nonuniform proportionality factors. One of the key ingredients in the analysis of smooth transonic irrotational flows is the well-posedness theory of classical solutions in $H^4$ to a linear elliptic-hyperbolic mixed second order differential equation of Keldysh type in cylinders with mixed boundary conditions. This is achieved by extending the problem to an auxiliary linear elliptic-hyberbolic-elliptic mixed problem in a longer cylinder where the governing equation becomes elliptic at the exit of the new cylinder, so that one can use the multiplier method and the cut-off techniques to derive the $H^2$ and higher order estimates in transonic regions. It is further shown that the energy estimate can be closed in the $H^4$ framework. For smooth transonic Beltrami flows, we solve a transport equation for the proportionality factor and a type-changing enlarged deformation-curl system with mixed boundary conditions. The compatibility conditions for the $H^4$ estimate to the enlarged deformation-curl system near the intersection between the entrance and the cylinder wall play a crucial role in the analysis.</description>

      <title>Measures in the dual of $BV$: perimeter bounds and relations with divergence-measure fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06224v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze some properties of the measures in the dual of the space $BV$, by considering (signed) Radon measures satisfying a perimeter bound condition, which means that the absolute value of the measure of a set is controlled by the perimeter of the set itself, and whose total variations also belong to the dual of $BV$. We exploit and refine the results of [25](Phuc, Torres 2017), in particular exploring the relation with divergence-measure fields and proving the stability of the perimeter bound from sets to $BV$ functions under a suitable approximation of the given measure. As an important tool, we obtain a refinement of Anzellotti-Giaquinta approximation for $BV$ functions, which is of separate interest in itself and, in the context of Anzellotti's pairing theory for divergence-measure fields, implies a new way of approximating $\lambda$-pairings, as well as new bounds for their total variation. These results are also relevant due to their application in the study of weak solutions to the non-parametric prescribed mean curvature equation with measure data, which is explored in a subsequent work.</description>

      <title>Solvability of the Neumann problem for elliptic equations in chord-arc domains with very big pieces of good superdomains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20385v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ be a bounded chord-arc domain, let $\mathcal L=-{\rm div} A\nabla$ be an elliptic operator in $\Omega$ associated with a matrix $A$ having Dini mean oscillation coefficients, and let $1&lt;p\leq 2$. In this paper we show that if the regularity problem for $\mathcal L$ is solvable in $L^q$ for some $q&gt;p$ in $\Omega$, $\partial \Omega$ supports a weak $p$-Poincar\'e inequality, and $\Omega$ has very big pieces of superdomains for which the Neumann problem for $\mathcal L$ is solvable uniformly in $L^q$, then the Neumann problem for $\mathcal L$ is solvable in $L^p$ in $\Omega$.</description>

      <title>Scale-Dependent Poincar\'{e} inequalities and the stability of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle on the hyperbolic space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21039v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish a general scale-dependent Poincar\'{e}-Hardy type identity involving a vector field on the hyperbolic space. By choosing suitable parameter, potential and vector field in this identity, we can recover, as well as derive new versions of several Poincar\'{e} type, Hardy type and Poincar\'{e}-Hardy type inequalities in the literature. We also investigate weighted Poincar\'{e} inequalities on hyperbolic space, where the weight functions depend on a scaling parameter. This leads to a new family of scale-dependent Poincar\'{e} inequalities with Gaussian type measure on the hyperbolic space which is of independent interest. As a result, we derive both scale-dependent and scale-invariant $L^{2}$-stability results for the Heisenberg uncertainty principle in this setting.</description>

      <title>On the rotational invariance and hyperbolicity of shallow water moment equations in two dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.07202v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the two-dimensional extension of a recently introduced set of shallow water models based on a regularized moment expansion of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations \cite{kowalski2017moment,koellermeier2020analysis}. We show the rotational invariance of the proposed moment models with two different approaches. The first proof involves the split of the coefficient matrix into the conservative and non-conservative parts and proves the rotational invariance for each part, while the second one relies on the special block structure of the coefficient matrices. With the aid of rotational invariance, the analysis of the hyperbolicity for the moment model in 2D is reduced to the real diagonalizability of the coefficient matrix in 1D. Then we analyze the real diagonalizability by deriving the analytical form of the characteristic polynomial. We find that the moment model in 2D is hyperbolic in most cases and weakly hyperbolic in a degenerate edge case. With a simple modification to the coefficient matrices, we fix this weakly hyperbolicity and propose a new global hyperbolic model. Furthermore, we extend the model to include a more general class of closure relations than the original model and establish that this set of general closure relations retains both rotational invariance and hyperbolicity.</description>

      <title>QGLAB: A MATLAB Package for Computations on Quantum Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00561v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe QGLAB, a new MATLAB package for analyzing partial differential equations on quantum graphs. The software is built on the existing, object-oriented MATLAB directed-graph class, inheriting its structure and adding additional easy-to-use features. The package allows one to construct a quantum graph and accurately compute the spectrum of elliptic operators, solutions to Poisson problems, the linear and nonlinear time evolution of a variety of PDEs, the continuation of branches of steady states (including locating and switching branches at bifurcations) and more. It overcomes the major challenge of discretizing quantum graphs -- the enforcement of vertex conditions -- using non-square differentiation matrices. It uses a unified framework to implement finite-difference and Chebyshev discretizations of differential operators on a quantum graph. For simplicity, the package overloads many built-in MATLAB functions to work on the class.</description>

      <title>Improved polynomial decay for unbounded semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09323v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We obtain polynomial decay rates for $C_{0}$-semigroups, assuming that the resolvent grows polynomially at infinity in the complex right half-plane. Our results do not require the semigroup to be uniformly bounded, and for unbounded semigroups we improve upon previous results by, for example, removing a logarithmic loss on non-Hilbertian Banach spaces.</description>

      <title>The supercooled Stefan problem with transport noise: weak solutions and blow-up</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20421v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive two weak formulations for the supercooled Stefan problem with transport noise on a half-line: one captures a continuously evolving system, while the other resolves blow-ups by allowing for jump discontinuities in the evolution of the temperature profile and the freezing front. For the first formulation, we establish a probabilistic representation in terms of a conditional McKean--Vlasov problem, and we then show that there is finite time blow-up with positive probability when part of the initial temperature profile exceeds a critical value. On the other hand, the system is shown to evolve continuously when the initial profile is everywhere below this value. In the presence of blow-ups, we show that the conditional McKean--Vlasov problem provides global solutions of the second weak formulation. Finally, we identify a solution of minimal temperature increase over time and we show that its discontinuities are characterized by a natural resolution of emerging instabilities with respect to an infinitesimal external heat transfer.</description>
