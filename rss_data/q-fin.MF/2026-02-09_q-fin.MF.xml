      <title>Joint survival annuity derivative valuation in the linear-rational Wishart mortality model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study proposes a linear-rational joint survival mortality model based on the Wishart process. The Wishart process, which is a stochastic continuous matrix affine process, allows for a general dependency between the mortality intensities that are constructed to be positive. Using the linear-rational framework along with the Wishart process as state variable, we derive a closed-form expression for the joint survival annuity, as well as the guaranteed joint survival annuity option. Exploiting our parameterisation of the Wishart process, we explicit the distribution of the mortality intensities and their dependency. We provide the distribution (density and cumulative distribution) of the joint survival annuity. We also develop some polynomial expansions for the underlying state variable that lead to fast and accurate approximations for the guaranteed joint survival annuity option. These polynomial expansions also significantly simplify the implementation of the model. Overall, the linear-rational Wishart mortality model provides a flexible and unified framework for modelling and managing joint mortality risk.</description>

      <title>Wishart conditional tail risk measures: An analytic approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study introduces a new analytical framework for quantifying multivariate risk measures. Using the Wishart process, which is a stochastic process with values in the space of positive definite matrices, we derive several conditional tail risk measures which, thanks to the remarkable analytical properties of the Wishart process, can be explicitly computed up to a one- or two-dimensional integration. These quantities can also be used to solve analytically a capital allocation problem based on conditional moments. Exploiting the stochastic differential equation property of the Wishart process, we show how an intertemporal (i.e., time-lagged) view of these risk measures can be embedded in the proposed framework. Several numerical examples show that the framework is versatile and operational, thus providing a useful tool for risk management.</description>

      <title>Single- and Multi-Level Fourier-RQMC Methods for Multivariate Shortfall Risk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06424v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multivariate shortfall risk measures provide a principled framework for quantifying systemic risk and determining capital allocations prior to aggregation in interconnected financial systems. Despite their well established theoretical properties, the numerical estimation of multivariate shortfall risk and the corresponding optimal allocations remains computationally challenging, as existing Monte Carlo based approaches can be numerically expensive due to slow convergence.
  In this work, we develop a new class of single and multilevel numerical algorithms for estimating multivariate shortfall risk and the associated optimal allocations, based on a combination of Fourier inversion techniques and randomized quasi Monte Carlo (RQMC) sampling. Rather than operating in physical space, our approach evaluates the relevant expectations appearing in the risk constraint and its optimization in the frequency domain, where the integrands exhibit enhanced smoothness properties that are well suited for RQMC integration. We establish a rigorous mathematical framework for the resulting Fourier RQMC estimators, including convergence analysis and computational complexity bounds. Beyond the single level method, we introduce a multilevel RQMC scheme that exploits the geometric convergence of the underlying deterministic optimization algorithm to reduce computational cost while preserving accuracy.
  Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed Fourier RQMC methods outperform sample average approximation and stochastic optimization benchmarks in terms of accuracy and computational cost across a range of models for the risk factors and loss structures. Consistent with the theoretical analysis, these results demonstrate improved asymptotic convergence and complexity rates relative to the benchmark methods, with additional savings achieved through the proposed multilevel RQMC construction.</description>
