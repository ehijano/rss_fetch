      <title>Modeling spectral filtering effects on color-matching functions: Implications for observer variability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the impact of spectral filtering on color-matching functions (CMFs) and its implications for observer variability modeling. We conducted color matching experiments with a single observer, both with and without a spectral filter in front of a bipartite field. Using a novel computational approach, we estimated the filter transmittance and transformation matrix necessary to convert unfiltered CMFs to filtered CMFs. Statistical analysis revealed good agreement between estimated and measured filter characteristics, particularly in central wavelength regions. Applying this methodology to compare between Stiles and Burch 1955 (SB1955) mean observer CMFs and our previously published "ICVIO" mean observer CMFs, we identified a "yellow" (short-wavelength suppressing) filter that effectively transforms between these datasets. This finding aligns with our hypothesis that observed differences between the CMF sets are attributable to age-related lens yellowing (average observer age: 49 years in ICVIO versus 30 years in SB1955). Our approach enables efficient representation of observer variability through a single filter rather than three separate functions, offering potentially reduced experimental overhead while maintaining accuracy in characterizing individual color vision differences.</description>

      <title>STCTM: a forward modeling and retrieval framework for stellar contamination and stellar spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transmission spectroscopy is a key avenue for the near-term study of small-planet atmospheres and the most promising method when it comes to searching for atmospheres on temperate rocky worlds, which are often too cold for planetary emission to be detectable. At the same time, the small planets that are most amenable for such atmospheric probes orbit small and cool M dwarf stars. As the field becomes increasingly ambitious in the search for signs of even thin atmospheres on small exoplanets, the transit light source effect (TLSE), caused by unocculted stellar surface heterogeneities, is becoming a limiting factor: it is imperative to develop robust inference methods to disentangle planetary and stellar contributions to the observed spectra. Here, I present STCTM, the STellar ConTamination Modeling framework, a flexible Bayesian retrieval framework to model the impact of the TLSE on any exoplanet transmission spectrum, and infer the range of stellar surface parameters that are compatible with the observations in the absence of any planetary contribution. With the "exotune" sub-module, users can also perform retrievals directly on out-of-transit stellar spectra in order to place data-driven priors on the extent to which the TLSE can impact any planet's transmission spectrum. The input data formats, stellar models, and fitted parameters are easily tunable using human-readable files and the code is fully parallelized to enable fast inferences.

      <title>Identification of Strongly Lensed Gravitational Wave Events Using Squeeze-and-Excitation Multilayer Perceptron Data-efficient Image Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the advancement of third-generation gravitational wave detectors, the identification of strongly lensed gravitational wave (GW) events is expected to play an increasingly vital role in cosmology and fundamental physics. However, traditional Bayesian inference methods suffer from combinatorial computational overhead as the number of events grows, making real-time analysis infeasible. To address this, we propose a deep learning model named Squeeze-and-Excitation Multilayer Perceptron Data-efficient Image Transformer (SEMD), based on Vision Transformers, which classifies strongly lensed GW events by modeling morphological similarity between time-frequency spectrogram pairs. By integrating Squeeze-and-Excitation attention mechanisms and multilayer perceptrons , SEMD achieves strong feature extraction and discrimination. Trained and evaluated on simulated datasets using Advanced LIGO and Einstein Telescope noise, the model demonstrates robustness and generalization across different detector sensitivities and physical conditions, highlighting the promise of deep learning for rapid identification of strongly lensed GW signals.</description>

      <title>Stages of commissioning alignment for three-mirror anastigmat (TMA) telescopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reliable, autonomously, deployment of telescopes enables a wide range of possible science cases. In this paper, we present a method for multi-stage telescope alignment with a simple commercial imaging sensor. For these studies, we use a design of an example three mirror anastigmat telescope and consider how the average spot size across the detector changes as a function of primary and secondary mirror positioning. This multi-stage alignment procedure will consist of three subprocesses, starting with a coarse alignment and converging down to a finer alignment before moving on to a stage where the telescope will refine its misalignments for data acquisition. This alignment strategy has been tested and meets diffraction limited requirements on a subset of misalignment cases from a statistical Monte Carlo simulation given misalignment tolerances on the telescope.</description>

      <title>Polarization aberration modeling of internal occulters for coronagraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) is a flagship mission concept proposing to characterize earth-like exoplanets at high contrast with a coronagraph instrument. The most in-depth, validated contrast error budgets made to date have been at the $10^{-9}$ planet-to-star contrast levels for the Roman Space Telescope. To obtain the raw contrast levels of $\leq 10^{-10}$ contrast needed for HWO, more modeling is needed of the vector diffraction effects within a coronagraph instrument. Several coronagraph architectures are based on the Lyot coronagraph, which utilizes a small occulting spot to block most of the on-axis starlight at a focal plane. In this paper, we present a study of the polarization aberrations generated by internal occulting spots. First, we use finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) modeling to produce the complex transmission of the occulter in each polarization state, and then we separately run those through a closed-loop wavefront control model in FALCO\cite{rigss2018falco} to determine the degradation in achievable contrast. We perform sweeps of such parameters as spot diameter, spot thickness, and angle of incidence to inform the HWO instrument design.</description>

      <title>Prototyping of 6.2-mm-Pitch Fiber Positioner Modules for Stage-V Telescope Instrumentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Small-pitch populated focal planes are a critical enabling technology for the next generation of highly multiplexed astronomical instruments. This work reports on ongoing prototyping activities for 6.2 mm-pitch alpha-beta (theta-phi) fiber positioner modules. Following a concise review of the underlying concept, the performance of trillium-based and independently actuated robotic designs is compared. Key operational parameters including XY positioning repeatability, non-linearity, backlash, and tilt are quantitatively assessed, with emphasis on their implications for overall instrument performance. Initial prototyping results are highly encouraging, indicating performance levels approaching the preliminary design specifications.</description>

      <title>Communicating astrobiology and the search for life elsewhere: speculations and promises of a developing scientific field in newspapers, press releases and papers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines the communication of astrobiology and the Search for Life Elsewhere (SLE) in academic papers, press releases, and news articles over three decades. Through a quantitative content analysis, it investigates the prevalence of speculations and promises/expectations in these sources, aiming to understand how research results are portrayed and their potential impact on public perception and future research directions. Findings reveal that speculations and promises/expectations are more frequent in news articles and press releases compared to academic papers. Speculations about conditions for life and the existence of life beyond Earth are common, particularly in news articles covering exoplanet research, while promises of life detection are rare. Press releases tend to emphasize the significance of research findings and the progress of the field. Speculations and promises/expectations in news articles often occur without attribution to scientists and in quotes of authors of the studies, and slightly less so in quotes of outside experts. The study highlights the complex dynamics of science communication in astrobiology, where speculations and promises can generate public excitement and influence research funding, but also risk misrepresenting scientific uncertainty and creating unrealistic expectations. It underscores the need for responsible communication practices that acknowledge the speculative dimension of the field while fostering public engagement and informed decision-making.</description>

      <title>Temperature induced optical scatter changes in titania-germania coatings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Titania doped with tantala is the high index material (high n) for the optical coatings used in LIGO and Virgo and its thermal noise limits LIGO/Virgo observations of astrophysical sources. In this paper, we study temperature induced changes to optical scatter of a multilayer highly reflective coating comprised of silica (low n) and titania doped with germania (high n) as a potential candidate to reduce coating thermal noise in ground-based observatories operating at room temperature. We observe that the scatter measured at 8 degree in a small region is low, with a median starting BRDF of $1.1 \times 10^{-7}\,\mathrm{str}^{-1}$ increasing to $1.2 \times 10^{-6}\,\mathrm{str}^{-1}$ through annealing. The results presented here show the potential of adopting titania doped with germania coatings for future upgrades to LIGO and Virgo and as a pathfinder coating for Cosmic Explorer, a next-generation detector.</description>

      <title>Experimental validation of photonic lantern imaging and wavefront sensing performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photonic lanterns (PLs) are fiber-based waveguides that are capable of focal-plane wavefront sensing while simultaneously directing light to downstream science instruments. The optimal choice of wavefront reconstruction algorithm has yet to be determined, and likely depends on the particular observing scenario under consideration. Previous work in simulation suggests that PLs can be used for nonlinear wavefront sensing for several applications, including sensing the low-wind effect and correcting large-amplitude aberrations. We present the design of muirSEAL (miniature IR SEAL), a testbed designed to test PL wavefront reconstruction over Zernike modes and segmented-mirror offsets. We demonstrate throughput and linear wavefront reconstruction at multiple f-numbers. We further present initial laboratory imaging of a new photonic lantern fabricated at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.</description>

Abstract: We present GammaPBHPlotter, a public Python code for calculating and plotting the Hawking radiation gamma-ray spectra of primordial black holes in the mass range of $10^{14}$ to $10^{18}$ grams. This tool allows users to compute the monochromatic and mass-averaged spectra of black holes over a range of parameters. We include the primary/direct Hawking emission, the secondary emission from the decay and hadronization of unstable particles, the final state radiation, and the in-flight annihilation gamma-ray emission components.</description>

      <title>Numerical simulations of oscillations for axisymmetric solar backgrounds with differential rotation and gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Local helioseismology comprises of imaging and inversion techniques employed to reconstruct the dynamic and interior of the Sun from correlations of oscillations observed on the surface, all of which require modeling solar oscillations and computing Green's kernels. In this context, we implement and investigate the robustness of the Hybridizable Discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) method in solving the equation modeling stellar oscillations for realistic solar backgrounds containing gravity and differential rotation. While a common choice for modeling stellar oscillations is the Galbrun's equation, our working equations are derived from an equivalent variant, involving less regularity in its coefficients, working with Lagrangian displacement and pressure perturbation as unknowns. Under differential rotation and axisymmetric assumption, the system is solved in azimuthal decomposition with the HDG method. Compared to no-gravity approximations, the mathematical nature of the wave operator is now linked to the profile of the solar buoyancy frequency N which encodes gravity, and leads to distinction into regions of elliptic or hyperbolic behavior of the wave operator at zero attenuation. While small attenuation is systematically included to guarantee theoretical well-posedness, the above phenomenon affects the numerical solutions in terms of amplitude and oscillation pattern, and requires a judicious choice of stabilization. We investigate the stabilization of the HDG discretization scheme, and demonstrate its importance to ensure the accuracy of numerical results, which is shown to depend on frequencies relative to N, and on the position of the Dirac source. As validations, the numerical power spectra reproduce accurately the observed effects of the solar rotation on acoustic waves.</description>

      <title>A Linearly Polarized Merger Shock Down to 550 MHz: A uGMRT Study of the Merging Cluster Abell 746</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19516v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radio relics, arc-like polarized sources with highly aligned magnetic fields, are typically found on the outskirts of merging galaxy clusters. The magneto-ionic media responsible for the significant coherence observed in radio relics remain poorly understood. Low-frequency measurements of radio relics are essential for constraining depolarization models, which provide crucial insights into the magnetic field distribution. However, these measurements are challenging due to the emission properties and interferometer systematics. We have detected polarization signals from the northwest radio relic in Abell 746 at 650 MHz with the upgraded Giant Meterwave Radio Telescope, marking the first-ever detection of polarisation from radio relics below 1 GHz. At this frequency, the average Rotation Measure (RM) corrected magnetic fields align well with shock radio emission, typical of radio relics. The fractional polarization at 650 MHz is $\sim 18\pm4 \%$. Our results indicate that a single internal depolarization model cannot explain the observed depolarization spectra, suggesting a non-uniform magnetic field distribution or complex contribution of different polarized regions in the radio relic. Our detection of polarization signals at 650 MHz reveals critical insights into radio relic magnetic field structures, offering a low-frequency approach to understanding ICM magnetic fields in merging galaxy clusters.</description>

      <title>Modeling Orbital Decay of Low-Earth Orbit Satellites due to Atmospheric Drag: A Simplified Analytical Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites are crucial for communications, navigation, and Earth observation. However, their operational lifetimes are strongly influenced by orbital decay due to atmospheric drag. This work presents a simplified analytical model of orbital decay in LEO, incorporating atmospheric density variations and satellite parameters. Using standard drag force equations and density models, we explore how altitude, satellite mass, and cross-sectional area affect decay timescales. Comparisons are made with existing NASA models and previous literature. The results highlight the importance of accurate atmospheric density representation and solar activity in predicting satellite lifetimes, especially relevant in the context of increasing space debris and mega-constellations.</description>

      <title>Testing a Computed Tomography Imaging Spectrometer for Earth Observations on the HEIMDAL Stratospheric Balloon Mission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19693v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stratospheric High Altitude Balloons (HABs) have great potential as a remote sensing platform for Earth Observations that complements orbiting satellites and low flying drones. At altitudes between 20-35 kms, HABs operate significantly closer to ground than orbiting satellites, but significantly higher than most drones. HABs therefore offer a unique potential to deliver high spatial resolution imaging with large area coverage. Another two imaging parameters that are important for Earth Observation applications are spectral resolution and spectral range. In this paper, we therefore present the development and testing of a hyperspectral imaging system, able to record near-video-rate images in narrow contiguous spectral bands, from a HAB platform. In particular, we present the first stratospheric environmental tests and HAB flight of a snapshot hyperspectral camera, based on Computed Tomography Imaging Spectroscopy (CTIS), which is well suited to cope with the challenges posed by the motion of the HAB platform and the stratospheric environment. We have successfully acquired images with the system under both simulated stratospheric conditions in the Mars Simulation Laboratory at Aarhus University and during a 5 hour HAB flight mission named HEIMDAL from Kiruna in October 2024 as part of the REXUS/BEXUS 34/35 2024 campaign organized by DLR-SNSA. The study represents a step towards deploying the HAB platform for high quality land cover classification.</description>

      <title>Using normal to find abnormal: AI-based anomaly detection in gravitational wave data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The detection and classification of anomalies in gravitational wave data plays a critical role in improving the sensitivity of searches for signals of astrophysical origins. We present ABNORMAL (AI Based Nonstationarity Observer for Resectioning and Marking AnomaLies), a deep neural network (DNN) model for anomaly detection that is trained exclusively on simulated Gaussian noise. By removing dependence on real data for training, the method resolves a circular paradox in anomaly detection: training on real data implicitly involves prior segregation of stationary from non-stationary data but this is not possible unless all anomalies are detected first. ABNORMAL is an autoencoder-based DNN, commonly used in anomaly detection, with the key innovation that it is trained to predict statistical features of noise rather than reconstructing the noise time series themselves. The statistical features are obtained by applying Gabor and Wavelet filter banks, which implement time-frequency analysis, and are subsequently combined through multi-view fusion using a dual-path architecture. We quantify the performance of our method on simulated and real LIGO data. Application to data from the O1 to O3b observational runs uncovers a rich landscape of anomalies over different timescales, including many that do not fit within known classes.</description>

      <title>A Dual One-way Doppler Cancellation Scheme for Enhanced Gravitational Redshift Tests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational redshift is an important prediction of General Relativity (GR). We propose a novel dual one-way frequency comparison scheme for gravitational redshift tests in satellite-ground clock experiments. Unlike conventional triple-link Doppler cancellation methods, our approach requires only two optical links, an uplink and a downlink, with Doppler data recorded independently at the satellite and ground station, respectively. Crucially, coherent combination of these measurements suppresses first-order Doppler frequency shift to second order while doubling the gravitational redshift signal. This scheme reduced engineering complexity (50$\%$ fewer links) and amplified redshift sensitivity with a factor of 2 for satellite-ground clock comparison. The scheme's viability hinges on high-precision clock synchronization ($\leq$ 0.1 ns for $10^{-18}$ clock comparison), which is potentially achievable via state-of-the-art time-transfer techniques. Systematic error analysis confirms residual Doppler, atmospheric, and Shapiro shifts remain below $10^{-17}$ for optimized orbits, establishing this scheme as a useful tool for probing fundamental physics beyond GR.</description>

      <title>Estimating the dense gas mass of molecular clouds using spatially unresolved 3 mm line observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10145v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We aim to develop a new method to infer the sub-beam probability density function (PDF) of H2 column densities and the dense gas mass within molecular clouds using spatially unresolved observations of molecular emission lines in the 3 mm band. We model spatially unresolved line integrated intensity measurements as the average of an emission function weighted by the sub-beam column density PDF. The emission function, which expresses the line integrated intensity as a function of the gas column density, is an empirical fit to high resolution (&lt; 0.05 pc) multi-line observations of the Orion B molecular cloud. The column density PDF is assumed to be parametric, composed of a lognormal distribution at moderate column densities and a power law distribution at higher column densities. To estimate the sub-beam column density PDF, the emission model is combined with a Bayesian inversion algorithm (the Beetroots code), which takes account of thermal noise and calibration errors. We validate our method by demonstrating that it recovers the true column density PDF of the Orion B cloud, reproducing the observed emission line integrated intensities. We apply the method to 12CO(J=1-0), 13CO(J=1-0), C18O(J=1-0), HCN(J=1-0), HCO+(J=1-0) and N2H+(J=1-0) observations of a 700 x 700 pc2 field of view (FoV) in the nearby galaxy M51. On average, the model reproduces the observed intensities within 30%. The column density PDFs obtained for the spiral arm region within our test FoV are dominated by a power-law tail at high column densities, with slopes that are consistent with gravitational collapse. Outside the spiral arm, the column density PDFs are predominantly lognormal, consistent with supersonic isothermal turbulence. We calculate the mass associated with the powerlaw tail of the column density PDFs and observe a strong, linear correlation between this mass and the 24$\mu$m surface brightness.</description>

      <title>Multilevel neural simulation-based inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06087v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural simulation-based inference (SBI) is a popular set of methods for Bayesian inference when models are only available in the form of a simulator. These methods are widely used in the sciences and engineering, where writing down a likelihood can be significantly more challenging than constructing a simulator. However, the performance of neural SBI can suffer when simulators are computationally expensive, thereby limiting the number of simulations that can be performed. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to neural SBI which leverages multilevel Monte Carlo techniques for settings where several simulators of varying cost and fidelity are available. We demonstrate through both theoretical analysis and extensive experiments that our method can significantly enhance the accuracy of SBI methods given a fixed computational budget.</description>

      <title>Error dependencies in the space-based CNEOS fireball database</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01454v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We evaluate the reliability of CNEOS-derived ephemerides of fireball events given the absence of the underlying data. We analyzed 18 events that have both (i) sufficient satellite information to derive orbits and (ii) ground-based observational counterparts. We quantify the uncertainties on these calibrated events using the orbital similarity criterion $D_D$. We also examine the velocity components imbalance and identify discriminants that can indicate the accuracy of an event. We identify two groups in the CNEOS database. CNEOS data produces ephemeris determinations with $D_D$&lt;0.1 for fireballs reported either (i) after late 2017 or (ii) with impact energies above 0.45 kt with 74-78% of events having $D_D$=0.03$\pm$0.02, while ~11% show $D_D$&lt;0.008. Our statistical test confirms these two parameters as the only reliable discriminants that, when combined, explain the two accuracy groups. Daylight, z-velocity component, low altitude, long duration, and latitude might also indicate errors, although the limited dataset may obscure correlations. No clear discriminants are identified for more restrictive $D_D$ cut-offs. We provide estimates of orbital uncertainties for calibrated events. The hyperbolic fireball subset in the CNEOS database appears as an outlier in the velocity imbalance test. Our results confirm that the fidelity of CNEOS fireball data improved significantly from 2018, likely due to the deployment of next-generation space sensors, and show a growing number of high-velocity events. Hyperbolic candidates should be interpreted with caution, as their velocities and inclinations likely reflect measurement errors. Accuracy constraints remain limited by the dataset size, as evidenced by the lack of statistically significant dependence on duration, preventing strong conclusions from being drawn.</description>
