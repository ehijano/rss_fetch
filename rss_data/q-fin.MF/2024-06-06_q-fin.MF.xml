      <title>Mean-variance portfolio selection in jump-diffusion model under no-shorting constraint: A viscosity solution approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper concerns a continuous time mean-variance (MV) portfolio selection problem in a jump-diffusion financial model with no-shorting trading constraint. The problem is reduced to two subproblems: solving a stochastic linear-quadratic (LQ) control problem under control constraint, and finding a maximal point of a real function. Based on a two-dimensional fully coupled ordinary differential equation (ODE), we construct an explicit viscosity solution to the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation of the constrained LQ problem. Together with the Meyer-It\^o formula and a verification procedure, we obtain the optimal feedback controls of the constrained LQ problem and the original MV problem, which corrects the flawed results in some existing literatures. In addition, closed-form efficient portfolio and efficient frontier are derived. In the end, we present several examples where the two-dimensional ODE is decoupled.</description>

      <title>Geometric Martingale Benamou-Brenier transport and geometric Bass martingales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce and study geometric Bass martingales. Bass martingales were introduced in \cite{Ba83} and studied recently in a series of works, including \cite{BaBeHuKa20,BaBeScTs23}, where they appear as solutions to the martingale version of the Benamou-Brenier optimal transport formulation. These arithmetic, as well as our novel geometric, Bass martingales are continuous martingale on $[0,1]$ with prescribed initial and terminal distributions. An arithmetic Bass martingale is the one closest to Brownian motion: its quadratic variation is as close as possible to being linear in the averaged $L^2$ sense. Its geometric counterpart we develop here, is the one closest to a geometric Brownian motion: the quadratic variation of its logarithm is as close as possible to being linear. By analogy between Bachelier and Black-Scholes models in mathematical finance, the newly obtained geometric Bass martingales} have the potential to be of more practical importance in a number of applications.
  Our main contribution is to exhibit an explicit bijection between geometric Bass martingales and their arithmetic counterparts. This allows us, in particular, to translate fine properties of the latter into the new geometric setting. We obtain an explicit representation for a geometric Bass martingale for given initial and terminal marginals, we characterise it as a solution to an SDE, and we show that geometric Brownian motion is the only process which is both an arithmetic and a geometric Bass martingale. Finally, we deduce a dual formulation for our geometric martingale Benamou-Brenier problem. Our main proof is probabilistic in nature and uses a suitable change of measure, but we also provide PDE arguments relying on the dual formulation of the problem, which offer a rigorous proof under suitable regularity assumptions.</description>

      <title>Efficient Wrong-Way Risk Modelling for Funding Valuation Adjustments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.12222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.12222v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Wrong-Way Risk (WWR) is an important component in Funding Valuation Adjustment (FVA) modelling. Yet, the standard assumption is independence between market risks and the counterparty defaults and funding costs. This typical industrial setting is our point of departure, where we aim to assess the impact of WWR without running a full Monte Carlo simulation with all credit and funding processes. We propose to split the exposure profile into two parts: an independent and a WWR-driven part. For the former, exposures can be re-used from the standard xVA calculation. We express the second part of the exposure profile in terms of the stochastic drivers and approximate these by a common Gaussian stochastic factor. Within the affine setting, the proposed approximation is generic, is an add-on to the existing xVA calculations and provides an efficient and robust way to include WWR in FVA modelling. Case studies for an interest rate swap and a representative multi-currency portfolio of swaps illustrate that the approximation method is applicable in a practical setting. We analyze the approximation error and use the approximation to compute WWR sensitivities, which are needed for risk management. The approach is equally applicable to other metrics such as Credit Valuation Adjustment.</description>
