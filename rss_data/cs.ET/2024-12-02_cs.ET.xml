      <title>A spiking photonic neural network of 40.000 neurons, trained with rank-order coding for leveraging sparsity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, the hardware implementation of neural networks, leveraging physical coupling and analog neurons has substantially increased in relevance. Such nonlinear and complex physical networks provide significant advantages in speed and energy efficiency, but are potentially susceptible to internal noise when compared to digital emulations of such networks. In this work, we consider how additive and multiplicative Gaussian white noise on the neuronal level can affect the accuracy of the network when applied for specific tasks and including a softmax function in the readout layer. We adapt several noise reduction techniques to the essential setting of classification tasks, which represent a large fraction of neural network computing. We find that these adjusted concepts are highly effective in mitigating the detrimental impact of noise.</description>

      <title>Fused-MemBrain: a spiking processor combining CMOS and self-assembled memristive networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In an era characterized by the rapid growth of data processing, developing new and efficient data processing technologies has become a priority. We address this by proposing a novel type of neuromorphic technology we call Fused-MemBrain. Our proposal is inspired by Golgi's theory modeling the brain as a syncytial continuum, in contrast to Cajal's theory of neurons and synapses being discrete elements. While Cajal's theory has long been the dominant and experimentally validated view of the nervous system, recent discoveries showed that a species of marine invertebrate (ctenophore Mnemiopsis leidyi) may be better described by Golgi's theory. The core idea is to develop hardware that functions analogously to a syncytial network, exploiting self-assembled memristive systems and combining them with CMOS technologies, interfacing with the silicon back-end-of-line. In this way, a memristive self-assembled material can cheaply and efficiently replace the synaptic connections between CMOS neuron implementations in neuromorphic hardware, enhancing the capability of massively parallel computation. The fusion of CMOS circuits with a memristive ``plexus'' allows information transfer without requiring engineered synapses, which typically consume significant area. As the first step toward this ambitious goal, we present a simulation of a memristive network interfaced with spiking neural networks. Additionally, we describe the potential benefits of such a system, along with key technical aspects it should incorporate.</description>

      <title>Towards Supporting QIR: Thoughts on Adopting the Quantum Intermediate Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18682v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: New records in the number of qubits and the fidelity of quantum computers continue to be set. Additionally, the quantum computing community is eager to leverage this immense computational power. However, to execute an application on hardware, it has to be translated into a sequence of hardware-specific instructions. To this end, intermediate representations play a crucial role in the software stack for a quantum computer to facilitate efficient optimizations. One of those intermediate representations is the Quantum Intermediate Representation (QIR), proposed by Microsoft. In this article, we provide food for thought on how QIR can be adopted in different software tools. We discuss the advantages and disadvantages of various approaches and outline related challenges. Finally, we conclude with an outlook on future directions using QIR.</description>

      <title>On the Ethical Considerations of Generative Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Generative Agents framework recently developed by Park et al. has enabled numerous new technical solutions and problem-solving approaches. Academic and industrial interest in generative agents has been explosive as a result of the effectiveness of generative agents toward emulating human behaviour. However, it is necessary to consider the ethical challenges and concerns posed by this technique and its usage. In this position paper, we discuss the extant literature that evaluate the ethical considerations regarding generative agents and similar generative tools, and identify additional concerns of significant importance. We also suggest guidelines and necessary future research on how to mitigate some of the ethical issues and systemic risks associated with generative agents.</description>

      <title>Stoch-IMC: A Bit-Parallel Stochastic In-Memory Computing Architecture Based on STT-MRAM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In-memory computing (IMC) offloads parts of the computations to memory to fulfill the performance and energy demands of applications such as neuromorphic computing, machine learning, and image processing. Fortunately, the main features that stochastic computing (SC) and IMC share, which are low computation complexity and high bit-parallel computation capability, promise great potential for integrating SC and IMC. In this paper, we exploit this potential by using stochastic computation as an approximation method to present effective in-memory computations with a good trade-off among design parameters. To this end, first, commonly used stochastic arithmetic operations of applications are effectively implemented using the primitive logic gates of the IMC method. Next, the in-memory scheduling and mapping of applications are obtained efficiently by a proposed algorithm. This algorithm reduces the computation latency by enabling intra-subarray parallelism while considering the IMC method constraints. Subsequently, a bit-parallel stochastic IMC architecture, Stoch-IMC, is presented that enables bit parallelization of stochastic computations over memory subarrays/banks. To evaluate Stoch-IMC's effectiveness, various analyses were conducted. Results show average performance improvements of 135.7X and 124.2X across applications compared to binary IMC and related in-memory SC methods, respectively. The results also demonstrate an average energy reduction of 1.5X compared to binary IMC, with limited energy overhead relative to the in-memory SC method. Furthermore, the results reveal average lifetime improvements of 4.9X and 216.3X over binary IMC and in-memory SC methods, respectively, along with high bitflip tolerance.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Content Verification System for ensuring Digital Integrity in the Age of Deep Fakes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In an era marked by the widespread sharing of digital content, the need for a robust content-integrity verification goes beyond the confines of individual social media platforms. While verified profiles (such as blue ticks on platforms like Instagram and X) have become synonymous with credibility, the content they share often traverses a complex network of interconnected platforms, by means of re-sharing, re-posting, etc., leaving a void in the authentication process of the content itself. With the advent of easily accessible AI tools (like DALL-E, Sora, and the tools that are explicitly built for generating deepfakes &amp; face swaps), the risk of misinformation through social media platforms is growing exponentially. This paper discusses a solution, a Content Verification System, designed to authenticate images and videos shared as posts or stories across the digital landscape. Going beyond the limitations of blue ticks, this system empowers individuals and influencers to validate the authenticity of their digital footprint, safeguarding their reputation in an interconnected world.</description>

      <title>Integrated Artificial Neurons from Metal Halide Perovskites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hardware neural networks could perform certain computational tasks orders of magnitude more energy-efficiently than conventional computers. Artificial neurons are a key component of these networks and are currently implemented with electronic circuits based on capacitors and transistors. However, artificial neurons based on memristive devices are a promising alternative, owing to their potentially smaller size and inherent stochasticity. But despite their promise, demonstrations of memristive artificial neurons have so far been limited. Here we demonstrate a fully on-chip artificial neuron based on microscale electrodes and halide perovskite semiconductors as the active layer. By connecting a halide perovskite memristive device in series with a capacitor, the device demonstrates stochastic leaky integrate-and-fire behavior, with an energy consumption of 20 to 60 pJ per spike, lower than that of a biological neuron. We simulate populations of our neuron and show that the stochastic firing allows the detection of sub-threshold inputs. The neuron can easily be integrated with previously-demonstrated halide perovskite artificial synapses in energy-efficient neural networks.</description>

      <title>mmWave Radar for Sit-to-Stand Analysis: A Comparative Study with Wearables and Kinect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14656v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study explores a novel approach for analyzing Sit-to-Stand (STS) movements using millimeter-wave (mmWave) radar technology. The goal is to develop a non-contact sensing, privacy-preserving, and all-day operational method for healthcare applications, including fall risk assessment. We used a 60GHz mmWave radar system to collect radar point cloud data, capturing STS motions from 45 participants. By employing a deep learning pose estimation model, we learned the human skeleton from Kinect built-in body tracking and applied Inverse Kinematics (IK) to calculate joint angles, segment STS motions, and extract commonly used features in fall risk assessment. Radar extracted features were then compared with those obtained from Kinect and wearable sensors. The results demonstrated the effectiveness of mmWave radar in capturing general motion patterns and large joint movements (e.g., trunk). Additionally, the study highlights the advantages and disadvantages of individual sensors and suggests the potential of integrated sensor technologies to improve the accuracy and reliability of motion analysis in clinical and biomedical research settings.</description>
