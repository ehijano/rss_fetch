      <title>Impact of Altitude, Bandwidth, and NLOS Bias on TDOA-Based 3D UAV Localization: Experimental Results and CRLB Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) localization using time difference of arrival (TDOA) measurements under mixed line-of-sight (LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) conditions. A 3D TDOA Cram\'er-Rao lower bound (CRLB) model is developed accounting for varying altitudes and signal bandwidths. The model is compared to five real-world UAV flight experiments conducted at different altitudes (40 m, 70 m, 100 m) and bandwidths (1.25 MHz, 2.5 MHz, 5 MHz) using Keysight N6841A radio frequency (RF) sensors of the NSF AERPAW platform. Results show that altitude, bandwidth, and NLOS obstructions significantly impact localization accuracy. Higher bandwidths enhance signal time resolution, while increased altitudes mitigate multipath and NLOS biases, both contributing to improved performance. However, hovering close to RF sensors degrades accuracy due to antenna pattern misalignment and geometric dilution of precision. These findings emphasize the inadequacy of traditional LOS-based models in NLOS environments and highlight the importance of adaptive approaches for accurate localization in challenging scenarios.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Model for Multiple Antenna Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The potential of applying diffusion models (DMs) for multiple antenna communications is discussed. A unified framework of applying DM for multiple antenna tasks is first proposed. Then, the tasks are innovatively divided into two categories, i.e., decision-making tasks and generation tasks, depending on whether an optimization of system parameters is involved. For each category, it is conceived 1) how the framework can be used for each task and 2) why the DM is superior to traditional artificial intelligence (TAI) and conventional optimization tasks. It is highlighted that the DMs are well-suited for scenarios with strong interference and noise, excelling in modeling complex data distribution and exploring better actions. A case study of learning beamforming with a DM is then provided, to demonstrate the superiority of the DMs with simulation results. Finally, the applications of DM for emerging multiple antenna technologies and promising research directions are discussed.</description>

      <title>ISAC MIMO Systems with OTFS Waveforms and Virtual Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel Integrated Sensing-Communication (ISAC) system is proposed that can accommodate high mobility scenarios while making efficient use of bandwidth for both communication and sensing. The system comprises a monostatic multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar that transmits orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) waveforms. Bandwidth efficiency is achieved by making Doppler-delay (DD) domain bins available for shared use by the transmit antennas. For maximum communication rate, all DD-domain bins are used as shared, but in this case, the target resolution is limited by the aperture of the receive array. A low-complexity method is proposed for obtaining coarse estimates of the radar targets parameters in that case. A novel approach is also proposed to construct a virtual array (VA) for achieving a target resolution higher than that allowed by the receive array. The VA is formed by enforcing zeros on certain time-frequency (TF) domain bins, thereby creating private bins assigned to specific transmit antennas. The TF signals received on these private bins are orthogonal, enabling the synthesis of a VA. When combined with coarse target estimates, this approach provides high-accuracy target estimation. To preserve DD-domain information, the introduction of private bins requires reducing the number of DD-domain symbols, resulting in a trade-off between communication rate and sensing performance. However, even a small number of private bins is sufficient to achieve significant sensing gains with minimal communication rate loss. The proposed system is robust to Doppler frequency shifts that arise in high mobility scenarios.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous Beamforming and Anti-Jamming With Intelligent Omni-Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wireless transmission is vulnerable to malicious jamming attacks due to the openness of wireless channels, posing a severe threat to wireless communications. Current anti-jamming studies primarily focus on either enhancing desired signals or mitigating jamming, resulting in limited performance. To address this issue, intelligent omni-surface (IOS) is a promising solution. By jointly designing its reflective and refractive properties, the IOS can simultaneously nullify jamming and enhance desired signals. In this paper, we consider an IOS-aided multi-user anti-jamming communication system, aiming to improve desired signals and nullify jamming by optimizing IOS phase shifts and transmit beamforming. However, this is challenging due to the coupled and discrete IOS reflection and refraction phase shifts, the unknown jammer's beamformer, and imperfect jammer-related channel state information. To tackle this, we relax IOS phase shifts to continuous states and optimize with a coupling-aware algorithm using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality and S-procedure, followed by a local search to recover discrete states. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme significantly improves the sum rate amid jamming attacks.</description>

      <title>Intelligent Reflecting Surface Based Localization of Mixed Near-Field and Far-Field Targets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-assisted bi-static localization architecture for the sixth-generation (6G) integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) network. The system consists of a transmit user, a receive base station (BS), an IRS, and multiple targets in either the far-field or near-field region of the IRS. In particular, we focus on the challenging scenario where the line-of-sight (LOS) paths between targets and the BS are blocked, such that the emitted orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) signals from the user reach the BS merely via the user-target-IRS-BS path. Based on the signals received by the BS, our goal is to localize the targets by estimating their relative positions to the IRS, instead of to the BS. We show that subspace-based methods, such as the multiple signal classification (MUSIC) algorithm, can be applied onto the BS's received signals to estimate the relative states from the targets to the IRS. To this end, we create a virtual signal via combining user-target-IRS-BS channels over various time slots. By applying MUSIC on such a virtual signal, we are able to detect the far-field targets and the near-field targets, and estimate the angle-of-arrivals (AOAs) and/or ranges from the targets to the IRS. Furthermore, we theoretically verify that the proposed method can perfectly estimate the relative states from the targets to the IRS in the ideal case with infinite coherence blocks. Numerical results verify the effectiveness of our proposed IRS-assisted localization scheme. Our paper demonstrates the potential of employing passive anchors, i.e., IRSs, to improve the sensing coverage of the active anchors, i.e., BSs.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Fingerprint-based Positioning in Cell-Free Massive MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, there has been an increasing interest in 6G technology for integrated sensing and communications, where positioning stands out as a key application. In the realm of 6G, cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, featuring distributed base stations equipped with a large number of antennas, present an abundant source of angle-of-arrival (AOA) information that could be exploited for positioning applications. In this paper we leverage this AOA information at the base stations using the multiple signal classification (MUSIC) algorithm, in conjunction with received signal strength (RSS) for positioning through Gaussian process regression (GPR). An AOA fingerprint database is constructed by capturing the angle data from multiple locations across the network area and is combined with RSS data from the same locations to form a hybrid fingerprint which is then used to train a GPR model employing a squared exponential kernel. The trained regression model is subsequently utilized to estimate the location of a user equipment. Simulations demonstrate that the GPR model with hybrid input achieves better positioning accuracy than traditional GPR models utilizing RSS-only and AOA-only inputs.</description>

      <title>LEAD: Large Foundation Model for EEG-Based Alzheimer's Disease Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electroencephalogram (EEG) provides a non-invasive, highly accessible, and cost-effective solution for Alzheimer's Disease (AD) detection. However, existing methods, whether based on manual feature extraction or deep learning, face two major challenges: the lack of large-scale datasets for robust feature learning and evaluation, and poor detection performance due to inter-subject variations. To address these challenges, we curate an EEG-AD corpus containing 813 subjects, which forms the world's largest EEG-AD dataset to the best of our knowledge. Using this unique dataset, we propose LEAD, the first large foundation model for EEG-based AD detection. Our method encompasses an entire pipeline, from data selection and preprocessing to self-supervised contrastive pretraining, fine-tuning, and key setups such as subject-independent evaluation and majority voting for subject-level detection. We pre-train the model on 11 EEG datasets and unified fine-tune it on 5 AD datasets. Our self-supervised pre-training design includes sample-level and subject-level contrasting to extract useful general EEG features. Fine-tuning is performed on 5 channel-aligned datasets together. The backbone encoder incorporates temporal and channel embeddings to capture features across both temporal and spatial dimensions. Our method demonstrates outstanding AD detection performance, achieving up to a 9.86% increase in F1 score at the sample-level and up to a 9.31% at the subject-level compared to state-of-the-art methods. The results of our model strongly confirm the effectiveness of contrastive pre-training and channel-aligned unified fine-tuning for addressing inter-subject variation.

      <title>How to warm-start your unfolding network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new ensemble framework for boosting the performance of overparameterized unfolding networks solving the compressed sensing problem. We combine a state-of-the-art overparameterized unfolding network with a continuation technique, to warm-start a crucial quantity of the said network's architecture; we coin the resulting continued network C-DEC. Moreover, for training and evaluating C-DEC, we incorporate the log-cosh loss function, which enjoys both linear and quadratic behavior. Finally, we numerically assess C-DEC's performance on real-world images. Results showcase that the combination of continuation with the overparameterized unfolded architecture, trained and evaluated with the chosen loss function, yields smoother loss landscapes and improved reconstruction and generalization performance of C-DEC, consistently for all datasets.</description>

      <title>Efficient Covering Using Reed--Solomon Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an efficient algorithm to find a Reed-Solomon (RS) codeword at a distance within the covering radius of the code from any point in its ambient Hamming space. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first attempt of its kind to solve the covering problem for RS codes. The proposed algorithm leverages off-the-shelf decoding methods for RS codes, including the Berlekamp-Welch algorithm for unique decoding and the Guruswami-Sudan algorithm for list decoding. We also present theoretical and numerical results on the capabilities of the proposed algorithm and, in particular, the average covering radius resulting from it. Our numerical results suggest that the overlapping Hamming spheres of radius close to the Guruswami-Sudan decoding radius centered at the codewords cover most of the ambient Hamming space.</description>

      <title>Improving Wireless Federated Learning via Joint Downlink-Uplink Beamforming over Analog Transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02034v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) over wireless networks using analog transmission can efficiently utilize the communication resource but is susceptible to errors caused by noisy wireless links. In this paper, assuming a multi-antenna base station, we jointly design downlink-uplink beamforming to maximize FL training convergence over time-varying wireless channels. We derive the round-trip model updating equation and use it to analyze the FL training convergence to capture the effects of downlink and uplink beamforming and the local model training on the global model update. Aiming to maximize the FL training convergence rate, we propose a low-complexity joint downlink-uplink beamforming (JDUBF) algorithm, which adopts a greedy approach to decompose the multi-round joint optimization and convert it into per-round online joint optimization problems. The per-round problem is further decomposed into three subproblems over a block coordinate descent framework, where we show that each subproblem can be efficiently solved by projected gradient descent with fast closed-form updates. An efficient initialization method that leads to a closed-form initial point is also proposed to accelerate the convergence of JDUBF. Simulation demonstrates that JDUBF substantially outperforms the conventional separate-link beamforming design.</description>

      <title>Sum of Squared Extended {\eta}-{\mu} and {\kappa}-{\mu} RVs: A New Framework Applied to FR3 and Sub-THz Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The analysis of systems operating in future frequency ranges calls for a proper statistical channel characterization through generalized fading models. In this paper, we adopt the Extended {\eta}-{\mu} and {\kappa}-{\mu} models to characterize the propagation in FR3 and the sub-THz band, respectively. For these models, we develop a new exact representation of the sum of squared independent and identically distributed random variables, which can be used to express the power of the received signal in multi-antenna systems. Unlike existing ones, the proposed analytical framework is remarkably tractable and computationally efficient, and thus can be conveniently employed to analyze systems with massive antenna arrays. For both the Extended {\eta}-{\mu} and {\kappa}-{\mu} distributions, we derive novel expressions for the probability density function and cumulative distribution function, we analyze their convergence and truncation error, and we discuss the computational complexity and implementation aspects. Moreover, we derive expressions for the outage and coverage probability, bit error probability for coherent binary modulations, and symbol error probability for M-ary phase-shift keying and quadrature amplitude modulation. Lastly, we provide an extensive performance evaluation of FR3 and sub-THz systems focusing on a downlink scenario where a single-antenna user is served by a base station employing maximum ratio transmission.</description>

      <title>Digital Fairness Algorithms for Satellite Uplink NOMA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02218v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Achieving digital fairness by using NOMA is one of the more pressing issues in modern wireless communication systems for 5G/6G networks. This is particularly true in the case of satellite uplink systems supporting a population of IoT wireless devices scattered in a wide coverage area. In this scenario, the variability of the link budget across space and time increases the challenges of preventing a situation where only a subset of network users can transmit while others are left unable to do so. This work investigates the characteristics of an uplink NOMA system with the goal of equalizing the achievable rate of the IoT network subscribers. Within the context of single-slot NOMA, two key outcomes are achieved: the determination of the optimal SIC ordering at the receiver and the exploration of power moderation, coordinated by the receiver, to maximize the minimum user rate. In the context of multi-slot NOMA, which is particularly relevant to the satellite scenario under consideration, a user rate equalization algorithm is proposed and its performance is analyzed numerically. The trade-off between network performance, measured in terms of user rates, and complexity, determined by the number of SIC steps implemented at the receiver, is thoroughly evaluated for the satellite scenario under consideration.</description>

      <title>Incorporating Cyclic Group Equivariance into Deep Learning for Reliable Reconstruction of Rotationally Symmetric Tomography Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02418v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rotational symmetry is a defining feature of many tomography systems, including computed tomography (CT) and emission computed tomography (ECT), where detectors are arranged in a circular or periodically rotating configuration. This study revisits the image reconstruction process from the perspective of hardware-induced rotational symmetry and introduces a cyclic group equivariance framework for deep learning-based reconstruction. Specifically, we derive a mathematical correspondence that couples cyclic rotations in the projection domain to discrete rotations in the image domain, both arising from the same cyclic group inherent in the hardware design. This insight also reveals the uniformly distributed circular structure of the projection space. Building on this principle, we provide a cyclic rotation equivariant convolution design method to preserve projection domain symmetry and a cyclic group equivariance regularization approach that enforces consistent rotational transformations across the entire network. We further integrate these modules into a domain transform reconstruction framework and validate them using digital brain phantoms, training on discrete models and testing on more complex and realistic fuzzy variants. Results indicate markedly improved generalization and stability, with fewer artifacts and better detail preservation, especially under data distribution deviation. These findings highlight the potential of cyclic group equivariance as a unifying principle for tomographic reconstruction in rotationally symmetric systems, offering a flexible and interpretable solution for scenarios with limited data.</description>

Abstract: In this survey paper, we present an extensive review of the use of RIS in 6G radio localization, highlighting their pivotal role as a low-cost, energy-efficient technology that reshapes wireless communication and localization landscapes. Investigating the versatile capabilities of RIS, we explore their dynamic control over electromagnetic wave manipulation, including reflection, refraction, and transmission, which opens new horizons in diverse applications ranging from IOT connectivity to advanced mobile communication, and various innovative applications in Industry 4.0. Our comprehensive review provides an overview of RIS use in 6G radio localization, highlighting recent progress in RIS technology assisted localization. It focuses on key aspects, including network scenarios, transmission bands, deployment environments, and near-field operations. We discuss studies to examine the state-of-the-art RIS-assisted localization and optimization techniques and their performance evaluation matrices. In addition, we present a detailed taxonomy of RIS-assisted radio localization, emphasizing the rapid evolution and potential of RIS technology in non-line-of-sight scenarios as an alternative to traditional base stations. Based on the careful investigation of the reviewed studies, the survey also sheds light on future research directions, technical challenges, and limitations, offering a clear perspective on the integration and optimization of RIS in 6G networks for enhanced localization capabilities.</description>

      <title>Adapting to Reality: Over-the-Air Validation of AI-Based Receivers Trained with Simulated Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04182v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent research shows that integrating artificial intelligence (AI) into wireless communication systems can significantly improve spectral efficiency. However, most AI-based receiver studies rely on simulated radio channel data for both training and validation, raising concerns about real-world generalization, which is vital for ensuring reliable field performance. In this study, we train DeepRx, a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based OFDM receiver, under various simulated channel scenarios and validate its performance over-the-air (OTA) using software-defined radio (SDR) technology in a small cell-type setup. To enhance receiver training, we investigate a randomized 3GPP TS38.901 channel model to diversify the training data, thereby improving performance over conventional receivers and matching or exceeding the performance of receivers trained on narrowly targeted channel models. These results demonstrate DeepRx's robust generalization capability and suggest that narrowly scoped, individual TS38.901 models can compromise both training and validation, underscoring the need for tailored channel models, careful training strategies, and OTA testing in learned receiver development.</description>

      <title>EEG-based 90-Degree Turn Intention Detection for Brain-Computer Interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11339v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG)--based turn intention prediction for lower limb movement is important to build an efficient brain-computer interface (BCI) system. This study investigates the feasibility of intention detection of left-turn, right-turn, and straight walk by utilizing EEG signals obtained before the event occurrence. Synchronous data was collected using 31-channel EEG and IMU-based motion capture systems for nine healthy participants while performing left-turn, right-turn, and straight walk movements. EEG data was preprocessed with steps including Artifact Subspace Reconstruction (ASR), re-referencing, and Independent Component Analysis (ICA) to remove data noise. Feature extraction from the preprocessed EEG data involved computing various statistical measures (mean, median, standard deviation, skew, and kurtosis), and Hjorth parameters (activity, mobility, and complexity). Further, the feature selection was performed using the Random forest algorithm for the dimensionality reduction. The feature set obtained was utilized for 3-class classification using XG boost, gradient boosting, and support vector machine (SVM) with RBF kernel classifiers in a five-fold cross-validation scheme. Using the proposed intention detection methodology, the SVM classifier using an EEG window of 1.5 s and 0 s time-lag has the best decoding performance with mean accuracy, precision, and recall of 81.23%, 85.35%, and 83.92%, respectively, across the nine participants. The decoding analysis shows the feasibility of turn intention prediction for lower limb movement using the EEG signal before the event onset.</description>

      <title>Segmented GRAND: Complexity Reduction through Sub-Pattern Combination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.14892v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ordered-reliability bits (ORB) variant of guessing random additive noise decoding (GRAND), known as ORBGRAND, achieves remarkably low time complexity at high code rates compared to other GRAND variants. However, its computational complexity remains higher than other near-ML universal decoders like ordered-statistics decoding (OSD). To address this, we propose segmented ORBGRAND, which partitions the error pattern search space based on code properties, generates syndrome-consistent sub-patterns (reducing invalid error patterns), and combines them in a near-ML order using sub-weights derived from two-level integer partitions of logistic weight. Numerical results show that segmented ORBGRAND reduces the average number of queries by at least 66\% across all SNRs and cuts basic operations by over an order of magnitude, depending on segmentation and code rate. Further efficiency gains come from leveraging pre-generated shared sub-patterns, reducing average decoding time. Furthermore, with abandonment ($b=10^{5}$ or smaller), segmented ORBGRAND provides a 0.2 dB power gain over ORBGRAND. Additionally, we provide an analytical justification for why the logistic weight-based ordering of error patterns in ORBGRAND closely approximates the ML order and discuss the underlying assumptions of ORBGRAND.</description>

      <title>Physical Layer Location Privacy in SIMO Communication Using Fake Path Injection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01198v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fake path injection is an emerging paradigm for inducing privacy over wireless networks. In this paper, fake paths are injected by the transmitters into a single-input multiple-output (SIMO) communication channel to obscure their physical location from an eavesdropper. The case where the receiver (Bob) and the eavesdropper (Eve) use a linear uniform array to locate the transmitter's (Alice) position is considered. A novel statistical privacy metric is defined as the ratio between the smallest (resp. largest) eigenvalues of Eve's (resp. Bob's) Cram\'er-Rao lower bound (CRB) on the SIMO channel parameters to assess the privacy enhancements. Leveraging the spectral properties of generalized Vandermonde matrices, bounds on the privacy margin of the proposed scheme are derived. Specifically, it is shown that the privacy margin increases quadratically in the inverse of the angular separation between the true and the fake paths under Eve's perspective. Numerical simulations validate the theoretical findings on CRBs and showcase the approach's benefit in terms of bit error rates achievable by Bob and Eve.</description>

      <title>Iterative Inversion of Ill-Conditioned MIMO Channels Using Symmetric Rank-$1$ Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15334v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While iterative matrix inversion methods excel in computational efficiency, memory optimization, and support for parallel and distributed computing when managing large matrices, their limitations are also evident in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) fading channels. These methods encounter challenges related to slow convergence and diminished accuracy, especially in ill-conditioned scenarios, hindering their application in future MIMO networks such as extra-large aperture array. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel matrix regularization method termed symmetric rank-1 regularization (SR-1R). The proposed method functions by augmenting the channel matrix with a symmetric rank-1 matrix, with the primary goal of minimizing the condition number of the resultant regularized matrix. This significantly improves the matrix condition, enabling fast and accurate iterative inversion of the regularized matrix. Then, the inverse of the original channel matrix is obtained by applying the Sherman-Morrison transform on the outcome of iterative inversions. Our eigenvalue analysis unveils the best channel condition that can be achieved by an optimized SR-1R matrix. Moreover, a power iteration-assisted (PIA) approach is proposed to find the optimum SR-$1$R matrix without need of eigenvalue decomposition. The proposed approach exhibits logarithmic algorithm-depth in parallel computing for MIMO precoding. Finally, computer simulations demonstrate that SR-1R has the potential to reduce the required iteration by up to 35% while achieving the performance of regularized zero-forcing.</description>

      <title>ViolinDiff: Enhancing Expressive Violin Synthesis with Pitch Bend Conditioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12477v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modeling the natural contour of fundamental frequency (F0) plays a critical role in music audio synthesis. However, transcribing and managing multiple F0 contours in polyphonic music is challenging, and explicit F0 contour modeling has not yet been explored for polyphonic instrumental synthesis. In this paper, we present ViolinDiff, a two-stage diffusion-based synthesis framework. For a given violin MIDI file, the first stage estimates the F0 contour as pitch bend information, and the second stage generates mel spectrogram incorporating these expressive details. The quantitative metrics and listening test results show that the proposed model generates more realistic violin sounds than the model without explicit pitch bend modeling. Audio samples are available online: daewoung.github.io/ViolinDiff-Demo.</description>

      <title>Posterior-Mean Rectified Flow: Towards Minimum MSE Photo-Realistic Image Restoration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00418v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Photo-realistic image restoration algorithms are typically evaluated by distortion measures (e.g., PSNR, SSIM) and by perceptual quality measures (e.g., FID, NIQE), where the desire is to attain the lowest possible distortion without compromising on perceptual quality. To achieve this goal, current methods commonly attempt to sample from the posterior distribution, or to optimize a weighted sum of a distortion loss (e.g., MSE) and a perceptual quality loss (e.g., GAN). Unlike previous works, this paper is concerned specifically with the optimal estimator that minimizes the MSE under a constraint of perfect perceptual index, namely where the distribution of the reconstructed images is equal to that of the ground-truth ones. A recent theoretical result shows that such an estimator can be constructed by optimally transporting the posterior mean prediction (MMSE estimate) to the distribution of the ground-truth images. Inspired by this result, we introduce Posterior-Mean Rectified Flow (PMRF), a simple yet highly effective algorithm that approximates this optimal estimator. In particular, PMRF first predicts the posterior mean, and then transports the result to a high-quality image using a rectified flow model that approximates the desired optimal transport map. We investigate the theoretical utility of PMRF and demonstrate that it consistently outperforms previous methods on a variety of image restoration tasks.</description>

      <title>Compressed Image Generation with Denoising Diffusion Codebook Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01189v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel generative approach based on Denoising Diffusion Models (DDMs), which produces high-quality image samples along with their losslessly compressed bit-stream representations. This is obtained by replacing the standard Gaussian noise sampling in the reverse diffusion with a selection of noise samples from pre-defined codebooks of fixed iid Gaussian vectors. Surprisingly, we find that our method, termed Denoising Diffusion Codebook Model (DDCM), retains sample quality and diversity of standard DDMs, even for extremely small codebooks. We leverage DDCM and pick the noises from the codebooks that best match a given image, converting our generative model into a highly effective lossy image codec achieving state-of-the-art perceptual image compression results. More generally, by setting other noise selections rules, we extend our compression method to any conditional image generation task (e.g., image restoration), where the generated images are produced jointly with their condensed bit-stream representations. Our work is accompanied by a mathematical interpretation of the proposed compressed conditional generation schemes, establishing a connection with score-based approximations of posterior samplers for the tasks considered.</description>
