      <title>A Survey of Code Review Benchmarks and Evaluation Practices in Pre-LLM and LLM Era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Code review is a critical practice in modern software engineering, helping developers detect defects early, improve code quality, and facilitate knowledge sharing. With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), a growing body of work has explored automated support for code review. However, progress in this area is hindered by the lack of a systematic understanding of existing benchmarks and evaluation practices. Current code review datasets are scattered, vary widely in design, and provide limited insight into what review capabilities are actually being assessed. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of code review benchmarks spanning both the Pre-LLM and LLM eras (2015--2025). We analyze 99 research papers (58 Pre-LLM era and 41 LLM era) and extract key metadata, including datasets, evaluation metrics, data sources, and target tasks. Based on this analysis, we propose a multi-level taxonomy that organizes code review research into five domains and 18 fine-grained tasks. Our study reveals a clear shift toward end-to-end generative peer review, increasing multilingual coverage, and a decline in standalone change understanding tasks. We further identify limitations of current benchmarks and outline future directions, including broader task coverage, dynamic runtime evaluation, and taxonomy-guided fine-grained assessment. This survey provides a structured foundation for developing more realistic and comprehensive benchmarks for LLM-based code review.</description>

      <title>InEx-Bug: A Human Annotated Dataset of Intrinsic and Extrinsic Bugs in the NPM Ecosystem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the causes of software defects is essential for reliable software maintenance and ecosystem stability. However, existing bug datasets do not distinguish between issues originating within a project from those caused by external dependencies or environmental factors. In this paper we present InEx-Bug, a manually annotated dataset of 377 GitHub issues from 103 NPM repositories, categorizing issues as Intrinsic (internal defect), Extrinsic (dependency/environment issue), Not-a-Bug, or Unknown. Beyond labels, the dataset includes rich temporal and behavioral metadata such as maintainer participation, code changes, and reopening patterns. Analyses show Intrinsic bugs resolve faster (median 8.9 vs 10.2 days), are close more often (92% vs 78%), and require code changes more frequently (57% vs 28%) compared to Extrinsic bugs. While Extrinsic bugs exhibit higher reopen rates (12% vs 4%) and delayed recurrence (median 157 vs 87 days). The dataset provides a foundation for further studying Intrinsic and Extrinsic defects in the NPM ecosystem.</description>

      <title>Execution-State-Aware LLM Reasoning for Automated Proof-of-Vulnerability Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Proof-of-Vulnerability (PoV) generation is a critical task in software security, serving as a cornerstone for vulnerability validation, false positive reduction, and patch verification. While directed fuzzing effectively drives path exploration, satisfying complex semantic constraints remains a persistent bottleneck in automated exploit generation. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising alternative with their semantic reasoning capabilities; however, existing LLM-based approaches lack sufficient grounding in concrete execution behavior, limiting their ability to generate precise PoVs.
  In this paper, we present DrillAgent, an agentic framework that reformulates PoV generation as an iterative hypothesis-verification-refinement process. To bridge the gap between static reasoning and dynamic execution, DrillAgent synergizes LLM-based semantic inference with feedback from concrete program states. The agent analyzes the target code to hypothesize inputs, observes execution behavior, and employs a novel mechanism to translate low-level execution traces into source-level constraints. This closed-loop design enables the agent to incrementally align its input generation with the precise requirements of the vulnerability. We evaluate DrillAgent on SEC-bench, a large-scale benchmark of real-world C/C++ vulnerabilities. Experimental results show that DrillAgent substantially outperforms state-of-the-art LLM agent baselines under fixed budget constraints, solving up to 52.8% more CVE tasks than the best-performing baseline. These results highlight the necessity of execution-state-aware reasoning for reliable PoV generation in complex software systems.</description>

      <title>From What to How: Bridging User Requirements with Software Development Using Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, large language models (LLMs) are extensively utilized to enhance development efficiency, leading to numerous benchmarks for evaluating their performance. However, these benchmarks predominantly focus on implementation, overlooking the equally critical aspect of software design. This gap raises two pivotal questions: (1) Can LLMs handle software design? (2) Can LLMs write code following the specific designs? To investigate these questions, this paper proposes DesBench, a design-aware benchmark for evaluating LLMs on three software design-related tasks: design-aware code generation, object-oriented modeling, and the design of acceptance test cases. DesBench comprises 30 manually crafted Java projects that include requirement documents, design models, implementations, and acceptance tests, amounting to a total of 30 design models, 194 Java classes, and 737 test cases. We evaluated seven state-of-the-art LLMs, including three DeepSeek R1, two Qwen2.5, and two GPT models, using DesBench. The results reveal that LLMs remain significantly challenged by the intricacies of software design: (1) For code generation, LLMs struggle to produce correct implementations when provided with only high-level or no designs. (2) In object-oriented modeling, while LLMs can accurately identify objects and classes, they face challenges in defining operations and inter-class relationships. (3) Acceptance test cases generated by LLMs from functional requirements achieve code coverage quality comparable to those written by humans. Our research highlights the current limitations of LLMs in managing software design and calls for further investigation into new design methodologies and languages suitable for LLM-based development.</description>

      <title>VeriSBOM: Secure and Verifiable SBOM Sharing Via Zero-Knowledge Proofs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) is a key component for the transparency of software supply chain; it is a structured inventory of the components, dependencies, and associated metadata of a software artifact. However, an SBOM often contain sensitive information that organizations are unwilling to disclose in full to anyone, for two main concerns: technological risks deriving from exposing proprietary dependencies or unpatched vulnerabilities, and business risks, deriving from exposing architectural strategies. Therefore, delivering a plaintext SBOM may result in the disruption of the intellectual property of a company. To address this, we present VeriSBOM, a trustless, selectively disclosed SBOM framework that provides cryptographic verifiability of SBOMs using zero-knowledge proofs. Within VeriSBOM, third parties can validate specific statements about a delivered software. Respectively, VeriSBOM allows independent third parties to verify if a software contains authentic dependencies distributed by official package managers and that the same dependencies satisfy rigorous policy constraints such as the absence of vulnerable dependencies or the adherence with specific licenses models. VeriSBOM leverages a scalable vector commitment scheme together with folding-based proof aggregation to produce succinct zero-knowledge proofs that attest to security and compliance properties while preserving confidentiality. Crucially, the verification process requires no trust in the SBOM publisher beyond the soundness of the underlying primitives, and third parties can independently check proofs against the public cryptographic commitments. We implement VeriSBOM, analyze its security, and evaluate its performance on real-world package registries. The results show that our method enables scalable, privacy-preserving, and verifiable SBOM sharing and validation.</description>

      <title>ARC: Compiling Hundreds of Requirement Scenarios into A Runnable Web System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have improved programming efficiency, but their performance degrades significantly as requirements scale; when faced with multi-modal documents containing hundreds of scenarios, LLMs often produce incorrect implementations or omit constraints. We propose Agentic Requirement Compilation (ARC), a technique that moves beyond simple code generation to requirement compilation, enabling the creation of runnable web systems directly from multi-modal DSL documents. ARC generates not only source code but also modular designs for UI, API, and database layers, enriched test suites (unit, modular, and integration), and detailed traceability for software maintenance. Our approach employs a bidirectional test-driven agentic loop: a top-down architecture phase decomposes requirements into verifiable interfaces, followed by a bottom-up implementation phase where agents generate code to satisfy those tests. ARC maintains strict traceability across requirements, design, and code to facilitate intelligent asset reuse. We evaluated ARC by generating six runnable web systems from documents spanning 50-200 multi-modal scenarios. Compared to state-of-the-art baselines, ARC-generated systems pass 50.6% more GUI tests on average. A user study with 21 participants showed that novice users can successfully write DSL documents for complex systems, such as a 10K-line ticket-booking system, in an average of 5.6 hours. These results demonstrate that ARC effectively transforms non-trivial requirement specifications into maintainable, runnable software.</description>

      <title>Impacts of Generative AI on Agile Teams' Productivity: A Multi-Case Longitudinal Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context: Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) tools, such as GitHub Copilot and GPT tools, represent a paradigm shift in software engineering. While their impact is clear, most studies are short-term, focused on individual experiments. The sustained, team-level effects on productivity within industrial agile environments remain largely uncharacterized. Goal: This study aims to provide a longitudinal evaluation of GenAI's impact on agile software teams. We characterize its effect on developers' productivity by applying the multi-dimensional SPACE framework. Method: We conducted a multi-case longitudinal study involving 3 agile teams at a large technology consulting firm for around 13 months. We collected and compared quantitative telemetry (Jira, SonarQube, Git) and qualitative survey data from historical (pre-adoption) and research (post-adoption) sprints. Conclusion: GenAI tools can significantly improve team performance and well-being. Our key finding is a sharp increase in Performance and perceived Efficiency concurrent with flat developer Activity. This suggests GenAI increases the value density of development work, not its volume. This finding validates the necessity of multi-dimensional frameworks like SPACE to capture the true, nuanced impact of GenAI in situ, which would be invisible to studies measuring Activity alone.</description>

      <title>Impostor Phenomenon as Human Debt: A Challenge to the Future of Software Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Impostor Phenomenon (IP) impacts a significant portion of the Software Engineering workforce, yet it is often viewed primarily through an internal individual lens. In this position paper, we propose framing the prevalence of IP as a form of Human Debt and discuss the relation with the ICSE2026 Pre Survey on the Future of Software Engineering results. Similar to technical debt, which arises when short-term goals are prioritized over long-term structural integrity, Human Debt accumulates due to gaps in psychological safety and inclusive support within socio-technical ecosystems. We observe that this debt is not distributed equally, it weighs heavier on underrepresented engineers and researchers, who face compounded challenges within traditional hierarchical structures and academic environments. We propose cultural refactoring, transparency and active maintenance through allyship, suggesting that leaders and institutions must address the environmental factors that exacerbate these feelings, ensuring a sustainable ecosystem for all professionals.</description>

      <title>A Quasi-Experimental Evaluation of Coaching to Mitigate the Impostor Phenomenon in Early-Career Software Engineers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context: The Impostor Phenomenon (IP), the persistent belief of being a fraud despite evident competence, is common in Software Engineering (SE), where high expectations for expertise and innovation prevail. Although coaching and similar interventions are proposed to mitigate IP, empirical evidence in SE remains underexplored.
  Objective: This study examines the impact of a structured group coaching intervention on reducing IP feelings among early-career software engineers.
  Method: We conducted a quasi-experiment with 20 participants distributed across two project teams using a wait-list control design, complemented by non-participant observation. The treatment group received a three-session coaching intervention, while the control group received it after an observation phase. IP was assessed using the Clance Impostor Phenomenon Scale (CIPS), alongside evaluated measures of well-being (WHO-5), life satisfaction (SWLS), and affect (PANAS).
  Results: The coaching resulted in modest reductions in CIPS scores, whereas the control group also improved during the observation phase, suggesting that contextual and temporal factors may have exerted a stronger influence than the formal intervention.
  Conclusion: These results suggest that coaching may support reflection and awareness related to IP, yet other contextual aspects of team collaboration and project work might also contribute to these changes. This study offers a novel empirical step toward understanding how structured IP interventions operate within SE environments.</description>

      <title>Constructive Patterns for Human-Centered Tech Hiring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: [Context] Online Recruitment and Selection (R&amp;S) processes are often the first point of contact between early-career software engineers and the tech industry. Yet many candidates experience these processes as opaque, inefficient, or even discouraging. While prior research has extensively documented the flaws and biases in online tech hiring, little is known about the practices that create positive candidate experiences. [Objective &amp; Method] This paper explores such practices, referred to as Constructive Patterns (CPs), from the perspective of early-career software engineers. Guided by Applicant Attribution-Reaction Theory, we conducted 22 semi-structured interviews in which participants collectively described over 470 online R&amp;S experiences. [Results] Through thematic analysis, we identified 22 CPs that reflect positive practices such as comprehensive and transparent job advertisements (CP01), specific and developmental feedback (CP03), humanized and respectful interaction (CP06), and framing the process as a two-way street (CP18). [Conclusion] Our findings extend the conversation on tech hiring beyond diagnosing dysfunctions toward designing for human-centered and growth-oriented candidate experiences. The resulting catalog of CPs provides a concrete and empirically grounded resource for organizations seeking to attract and support early-career software engineers more effectively.</description>

      <title>Evaluating LLM-Generated ACSL Annotations for Formal Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Formal specifications are crucial for building verifiable and dependable software systems, yet generating accurate and verifiable specifications for real-world C programs remains challenging. This paper empirically evaluates the extent to which formal-analysis tools can automatically generate and verify ACSL specifications without human or learning-based assistance. We conduct a controlled study on a recently released dataset of 506 C programs, repurposing it from interactive, developer-driven workflows to an automated evaluation setting. Five ACSL generation systems are compared: a rule-based Python script, Frama-C's RTE plugin, and three large language models--DeepSeek-V3.2, GPT-5.2, and OLMo 3.1 32B Instruct. All generated specifications are verified under identical conditions using the Frama-C WP plugin powered by multiple SMT solvers, allowing a direct comparison of annotation quality, solver sensitivity, and proof stability. Our results provide new empirical evidence on the capabilities and limitations of automated ACSL generation, complementing prior survey-based work.</description>

      <title>CodeGlance: Understanding Code Reasoning Challenges in LLMs through Multi-Dimensional Feature Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In modern software development, developers frequently need to understand code behavior at a glance -- whether reviewing pull requests, debugging issues, or navigating unfamiliar codebases. This ability to reason about dynamic program behavior is fundamental to effective software engineering and increasingly supported by Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing studies on code reasoning focus primarily on isolated code snippets, overlooking the complexity of real-world scenarios involving external API interactions and unfamiliar functions. This gap hinders our understanding of what truly makes code reasoning challenging for LLMs across diverse programming contexts.
  We present CodeGlance, a multi-dimensional benchmark investigating code reasoning challenges across three realistic scenarios: intrinsic logic reasoning, API interaction reasoning, and unseen function reasoning. Through systematic evaluation of 7 state-of-the-art LLMs, we reveal that unseen function reasoning poses significant challenges especially for smaller models, with Qwen2.5-3b achieving only 6.0\% accuracy on unseen functions compared to 37.5\% on familiar APIs. We identify critical code complexity features -- including execution trace length, API invocation count, and control flow complexity -- that significantly impact code reasoning difficulty across scenarios. We further investigate how common augmentation strategies, including CoT, document retrieval, and code search, can improve reasoning performance, finding that their effectiveness varies substantially depending on whether challenges stem from logical complexity or knowledge gaps. These findings provide actionable guidance for developing more capable code reasoning systems and deploying LLM-based programming assistants in real-world software development.</description>

      <title>ATTest: Agent-Driven Tensor Testing for Deep Learning Library Modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The unit testing of Deep Learning (DL) libraries is challenging due to complex numerical semantics and implicit tensor constraints. Traditional Search-Based Software Testing (SBST) often suffers from semantic blindness, failing to satisfy the constraints of high-dimensional tensors, whereas Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle with cross-file context and unstable code modifications. This paper proposes ATTest, an agent-driven tensor testing framework for module-level unit test generation. ATTest orchestrates a seven-stage pipeline, which encompasses constraint extraction and an iterative "generation-validation-repair" loop, to maintain testing stability and mitigate context-window saturation. An evaluation on PyTorch and TensorFlow demonstrates that ATTest significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines such as PynguinML, achieving an average branch coverage of 55.60% and 54.77%, respectively. The results illustrate how agent-driven workflows bridge the semantic gap in numerical libraries while ensuring auditable test synthesis.

      <title>Every Maintenance Has Its Exemplar: The Future of Software Maintenance through Migration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Maintenance is a critical stage in the software lifecycle, ensuring that post-release systems remain reliable, efficient, and adaptable. However, manual software maintenance is labor-intensive, time-consuming, and error-prone, which highlights the urgent need for automation. Learning from maintenance activities conducted on other software systems offers an effective way to improve efficiency. In particular, recent research has demonstrated that migration-based approaches transfer knowledge, artifacts, or solutions from one system to another and show strong potential in tasks such as API evolution adaptation, software testing, and migrating patches for fault correction. This makes migration-based maintenance a valuable research direction for advancing automated maintenance.
  This paper takes a step further by presenting the first systematic research agenda on migration-based approaches to software maintenance. We characterize the migration-based maintenance lifecycle through four key stages: \ding{182} identifying a maintenance task that can be addressed through migration, \ding{183} selecting suitable migration sources for the target project,\ding{184} matching relevant data across systems and adapting the migrated data to the target context, and \ding{185} validating the correctness of the migration. We also analyze the challenges that may arise at each stage. Our goal is to encourage the community to explore migration-based approaches more thoroughly and to tackle the key challenges that must be solved to advance automated software maintenance.</description>

      <title>LongCLI-Bench: A Preliminary Benchmark and Study for Long-horizon Agentic Programming in Command-Line Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in AI-assisted programming have empowered agents to execute complex workflows via command-line interfaces, however, existing benchmarks are limited by short task horizons, data contamination from GitHub scraping, and a lack of fine-grained evaluation metrics, fail to rigorously evaluate the long-horizon planning and execution capabilities essential for realistic software engineering. To address these gaps, we introduce LongCLI-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate agentic capabilities across long-horizon, realistic tasks. We curated 20 high-quality, long-horizon tasks from over 1,000 computer science assignments and real-world workflows, covering four engineering categories: from scratch, feature addition, bug fixing, and refactoring. We propose a dual-set testing protocol for LongCLI-Bench, which measures requirement fulfillment (fail-to-pass) and regression avoidance (pass-to-pass), and incorporates step-level scoring to pinpoint execution failures. Extensive experiments reveal that even state-of-the-art agents achieve pass rates below 20% in LongCLI-Bench. Step-level analysis further indicates that the majority of tasks stall at less than 30% completion, highlighting that critical failures often occur in the early stages. Although self-correction offers marginal gains, human-agent collaboration through plan injection and interactive guidance yields significantly higher improvements. These results highlight that future research must emphasize the development of synergistic human-agent workflows alongside advances in agents' planning and execution capabilities to overcome key challenges in long-horizon task performance.</description>

      <title>An Empirical Study of the Evolution of GitHub Actions Workflows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: CI/CD practices play a significant role during collaborative software development by automating time-consuming and repetitive tasks such as testing, building, quality checking, dependency and security management. GitHub Actions, the CI/CD tool integrated into GitHub, allows repository maintainers to automate development workflows. We conducted a mixed methods analysis of GitHub Actions workflow changes over time. Through a preliminary qualitative analysis of 439 modified workflow files we identified seven types of conceptual changes to workflows. Next, we performed a quantitative analysis over 49K+ GitHub repositories totaling 267K+ workflow change histories and 3.4M+ workflow file versions from November 2019 to August 2025. This analysis revealed that repositories contain a median of three workflow files, and 7.3% of all workflow files are being changed every week. The changes made to workflows tend to be small, with about three-quarters containing only a single change. The large majority of the observed changes have to do with task configuration and task specification in workflow jobs. We did not find any conclusive evidence of the effect of LLM coding tools or other major technological changes on workflow creation and workflow maintenance frequency. Our findings highlight the need for improved tooling to support fine-grained maintenance tasks, such as a broader adoption of dependency management and AI-based support for ensuring and sustaining workflow security and quality.</description>

      <title>Automated Classification of Source Code Changes Based on Metrics Clustering in the Software Development Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an automated method for classifying source code changes during the software development process based on clustering of change metrics. The method consists of two steps: clustering of metric vectors computed for each code change, followed by expert mapping of the resulting clusters to predefined change classes. The distribution of changes into clusters is performed automatically, while the mapping of clusters to classes is carried out by an expert. Automation of the distribution step substantially reduces the time required for code change review. The k-means algorithm with a cosine similarity measure between metric vectors is used for clustering. Eleven source code metrics are employed, covering lines of code, cyclomatic complexity, file counts, interface changes, and structural changes. The method was validated on five software systems, including two open-source projects (Subversion and NHibernate), and demonstrated classification purity of P_C = 0.75 +/- 0.05 and entropy of E_C = 0.37 +/- 0.06 at a significance level of 0.05.</description>

      <title>Consistent or Sensitive? Automated Code Revision Tools Against Semantics-Preserving Perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automated Code Revision (ACR) tools aim to reduce manual effort by automatically generating code revisions based on reviewer feedback. While ACR tools have shown promising performance on historical data, their real-world utility depends on their ability to handle similar code variants expressing the same issue - a property we define as consistency. However, the probabilistic nature of ACR tools often compromises consistency, which may lead to divergent revisions even for semantically equivalent code variants. In this paper, we investigate the extent to which ACR tools maintain consistency when presented with semantically equivalent code variants. To do so, we first designed nine types of semantics-preserving perturbations (SPP) and applied them to 2032 Java methods from real-world GitHub projects, generating over 10K perturbed variants for evaluation. Then we used these perturbations to evaluate the consistency of five state-of-the-art transformer-based ACR tools. We found that the ACR tools' ability to generate correct revisions can drop by up to 45.3%, when presented with semantically equivalent code. The closer the perturbation is to this targeted region, the more likely an ACR tool is to fail to generate the correct revision. We explored potential mitigation strategies that modify the input representation, but found that these attention-guiding heuristics yielded only marginal improvements, thus leaving the solution to this problem as an open research question.</description>

      <title>The Value of Effective Pull Request Description</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the pull-based development model, code contributions are submitted as pull requests (PRs) to undergo reviews and approval by other developers with the goal of being merged into the code base. A PR can be supported by a description, whose role has not yet been systematically investigated. To fill in this gap, we conducted a mixed-methods empirical study of PR descriptions. We conducted a grey literature review of guidelines on writing PR descriptions and derived a taxonomy of eight recommended elements. Using this taxonomy, we analyzed 80K GitHub PRs across 156 projects and five programming languages to assess associations between these elements and code review outcomes (e.g., merge decision, latency, first response time, review comments, and review iteration cycles). To complement these results, we surveyed 64 developers about the perceived importance of each element. Finally, we analyzed which submission-time factors predict whether PRs include a description and which elements they contain. We found that developers view PR descriptions as important, but their elements matter differently: purpose and code explanations are valued by developers for preserving the rationale and history of changes, while stating the desired feedback type best predicts change acceptance and reviewer engagement. PR descriptions are also more common in mature projects and complex changes, suggesting they are written when most useful rather than as a formality.</description>

      <title>Configuring Agentic AI Coding Tools: An Exploratory Study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.14690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Agentic AI coding tools with autonomous capabilities beyond conversational content generation increasingly automate repetitive and time-consuming software development tasks. Developers can configure these tools through versioned repository-level artifacts such as Markdown and JSON files. In this paper, we present a systematic analysis of configuration mechanisms for agentic AI coding tools, covering Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Gemini, and Codex. We identify eight configuration mechanisms and, in an empirical study of 2,926 GitHub repositories, examine whether and how they are adopted. We then explore Context Files, Skills, and Subagents, that is, three mechanisms available across tools, in more detail. Our findings reveal three trends. First, Context Files dominate the configuration landscape and are often the sole mechanism in a repository, with AGENTS$.$md emerging as an interoperable standard across tools. Second, advanced mechanisms such as Skills and Subagents are only shallowly adopted: most repositories define only one or two artifacts, and Skills predominantly rely on static instructions rather than executable workflows. Third, distinct configuration cultures are forming around different tools, with Claude Code users employing the broadest range of mechanisms. These findings establish an empirical baseline for longitudinal and experimental research on how configuration strategies evolve and affect agent performance as agentic AI coding tools mature.</description>

      <title>Model Context Protocol (MCP) Tool Descriptions Are Smelly! Towards Improving AI Agent Efficiency with Augmented MCP Tool Descriptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Model Context Protocol (MCP) standardizes how Foundation Model (FM)-based agents interact with external systems by invoking tools. However, to understand a tool's purpose and features, FMs rely on natural-language tool descriptions, making these descriptions a critical component in guiding FMs to select the optimal tool for a given (sub)task and to pass the right arguments to the tool. While defects or smells in these descriptions can misguide FM-based agents, their prevalence and consequences in the MCP ecosystem remain unclear.
  To address this, we conduct the first large-scale empirical study of 856 tools spread across 103 MCP servers, assessing their description quality and their impact on agent performance. We identify six components of tool descriptions from the literature, develop a scoring rubric utilizing these components, then formalize tool description smells based on this rubric. By operationalizing this rubric through an FM-based scanner, we find that 97.1% of the analyzed tool descriptions contain at least one smell, with 56% failing to state their purpose clearly. While augmenting these descriptions for all components improves task success rates by a median of 5.85 percentage points and improves partial goal completion by 15.12%, it also increases the number of execution steps by 67.46% and regresses performance in 16.67% of cases. These findings highlight a trade-off between agent performance and cost, as well as the context sensitivity of the performance gain. Furthermore, component ablations show that compact variants of different component combinations often preserve behavioral reliability while reducing unnecessary token overhead, enabling more efficient use of the FM context window and lower execution costs.</description>

      <title>PlotChain: Deterministic Checkpointed Evaluation of Multimodal LLMs on Engineering Plot Reading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13232v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present PlotChain, a deterministic, generator-based benchmark for evaluating multimodal large language models (MLLMs) on engineering plot reading-recovering quantitative values from classic plots (e.g., Bode/FFT, step response, stress-strain, pump curves) rather than OCR-only extraction or free-form captioning. PlotChain contains 15 plot families with 450 rendered plots (30 per family), where every item is produced from known parameters and paired with exact ground truth computed directly from the generating process. A central contribution is checkpoint-based diagnostic evaluation: in addition to final targets, each item includes intermediate 'cp_' fields that isolate sub-skills (e.g., reading cutoff frequency or peak magnitude) and enable failure localization within a plot family. We evaluate four state-of-the-art MLLMs under a standardized, deterministic protocol (temperature = 0 and a strict JSON-only numeric output schema) and score predictions using per-field tolerances designed to reflect human plot-reading precision. Under the 'plotread' tolerance policy, the top models achieve 80.42% (Gemini 2.5 Pro), 79.84% (GPT-4.1), and 78.21% (Claude Sonnet 4.5) overall field-level pass rates, while GPT-4o trails at 61.59%. Despite strong performance on many families, frequency-domain tasks remain brittle: bandpass response stays low (&lt;= 23%), and FFT spectrum remains challenging. We release the generator, dataset, raw model outputs, scoring code, and manifests with checksums to support fully reproducible runs and retrospective rescoring under alternative tolerance policies.</description>

      <title>AST-PAC: AST-guided Membership Inference for Code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Code Large Language Models are frequently trained on massive datasets containing restrictively licensed source code. This creates urgent data governance and copyright challenges. Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) can serve as an auditing mechanism to detect unauthorized data usage in models. While attacks like the Loss Attack provide a baseline, more involved methods like Polarized Augment Calibration (PAC) remain underexplored in the code domain. This paper presents an exploratory study evaluating these methods on 3B--7B parameter code models. We find that while PAC generally outperforms the Loss baseline, its effectiveness relies on augmentation strategies that disregard the rigid syntax of code, leading to performance degradation on larger, complex files. To address this, we introduce AST-PAC, a domain-specific adaptation that utilizes Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) based perturbations to generate syntactically valid calibration samples. Preliminary results indicate that AST-PAC improves as syntactic size grows, where PAC degrades, but under-mutates small files and underperforms on alphanumeric-rich code. Overall, the findings motivate future work on syntax-aware and size-adaptive calibration as a prerequisite for reliable provenance auditing of code language models.</description>

      <title>Unsafer in Many Turns: Benchmarking and Defending Multi-Turn Safety Risks in Tool-Using Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13379v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: LLM-based agents are becoming increasingly capable, yet their safety lags behind. This creates a gap between what agents can do and should do. This gap widens as agents engage in multi-turn interactions and employ diverse tools, introducing new risks overlooked by existing benchmarks. To systematically scale safety testing into multi-turn, tool-realistic settings, we propose a principled taxonomy that transforms single-turn harmful tasks into multi-turn attack sequences. Using this taxonomy, we construct MT-AgentRisk (Multi-Turn Agent Risk Benchmark), the first benchmark to evaluate multi-turn tool-using agent safety. Our experiments reveal substantial safety degradation: the Attack Success Rate (ASR) increases by 16% on average across open and closed models in multi-turn settings. To close this gap, we propose ToolShield, a training-free, tool-agnostic, self-exploration defense: when encountering a new tool, the agent autonomously generates test cases, executes them to observe downstream effects, and distills safety experiences for deployment. Experiments show that ToolShield effectively reduces ASR by 30% on average in multi-turn interactions. Our code is available at https://github.com/CHATS-lab/ToolShield.</description>

      <title>An end-to-end agentic pipeline for smart contract translation and quality evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an end-to-end framework for systematic evaluation of LLM-generated smart contracts from natural-language specifications. The system parses contractual text into structured schemas, generates Solidity code, and performs automated quality assessment through compilation and security checks. Using CrewAI-style agent teams with iterative refinement, the pipeline produces structured artifacts with full provenance metadata. Quality is measured across five dimensions, including functional completeness, variable fidelity, state-machine correctness, business-logic fidelity, and code quality aggregated into composite scores. The framework supports paired evaluation against ground-truth implementations, quantifying alignment and identifying systematic error modes such as logic omissions and state transition inconsistencies. This provides a reproducible benchmark for empirical research on smart contract synthesis quality and supports extensions to formal verification and compliance checking.</description>

      <title>Twenty-five years of J-DSP Online Labs for Signal Processing Classes and Workforce Development Programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the history of the online simulation program Java-DSP (J-DSP) and the most recent function development and deployment. J-DSP was created to support online laboratories in DSP classes and was first deployed in our ASU DSP class in 2000. The development of the program and its extensions was supported by several NSF grants including CCLI and IUSE. The web-based software was developed by our team in Java and later transitioned to the more secure HTML5 environment. J-DSP supports laboratory exercises on: digital filters and their design, the FFT and its utility in spectral analysis, machine learning for signal classification, and more recently online simulations with the Quantum Fourier Transform. Throughout the J-DSP development and deployment of this tool and its associated laboratory exercises, we documented evaluations. Mobile versions of the program for iOS and Android were also developed. J-DSP is used to this day in several universities, and specific functions of the program have been used in NSF REU, IRES and RET workforce development and high school outreach.</description>

      <title>GREPO: A Benchmark for Graph Neural Networks on Repository-Level Bug Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Repository-level bug localization-the task of identifying where code must be modified to fix a bug-is a critical software engineering challenge. Standard Large Language Modles (LLMs) are often unsuitable for this task due to context window limitations that prevent them from processing entire code repositories. As a result, various retrieval methods are commonly used, including keyword matching, text similarity, and simple graph-based heuristics such as Breadth-First Search. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) offer a promising alternative due to their ability to model complex, repository-wide dependencies; however, their application has been hindered by the lack of a dedicated benchmark. To address this gap, we introduce GREPO, the first GNN benchmark for repository-scale bug localization tasks. GREPO comprises 86 Python repositories and 47294 bug-fixing tasks, providing graph-based data structures ready for direct GNN processing. Our evaluation of various GNN architectures shows outstanding performance compared to established information retrieval baselines. This work highlights the potential of GNNs for bug localization and established GREPO as a foundation resource for future research, The code is available at https://github.com/qingpingmo/GREPO.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Agent Framework for Code-Guided, Modular, and Verifiable Automated Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) has revolutionized the development of data-driven solutions; however, traditional frameworks often function as "black boxes", lacking the flexibility and transparency required for complex, real-world engineering tasks. Recent Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have shifted toward code-driven approaches. However, they frequently suffer from hallucinated logic and logic entanglement, where monolithic code generation leads to unrecoverable runtime failures. In this paper, we present iML, a novel multi-agent framework designed to shift AutoML from black-box prompting to a code-guided, modular, and verifiable architectural paradigm. iML introduces three main ideas: (1) Code-Guided Planning, which synthesizes a strategic blueprint grounded in autonomous empirical profiling to eliminate hallucination; (2) Code-Modular Implementation, which decouples preprocessing and modeling into specialized components governed by strict interface contracts; and (3) Code-Verifiable Integration, which enforces physical feasibility through dynamic contract verification and iterative self-correction. We evaluate iML across MLE-BENCH and the newly introduced iML-BENCH, comprising a diverse range of real-world Kaggle competitions. The experimental results show iML's superiority over state-of-the-art agents, achieving a valid submission rate of 85% and a competitive medal rate of 45% on MLE-BENCH, with an average standardized performance score (APS) of 0.77. On iML-BENCH, iML significantly outperforms the other approaches by 38%-163% in APS. Furthermore, iML maintains a robust 70% success rate even under stripped task descriptions, effectively filling information gaps through empirical profiling. These results highlight iML's potential to bridge the gap between stochastic generation and reliable engineering, marking a meaningful step toward truly AutoML.</description>

      <title>From SFT to RL: Demystifying the Post-Training Pipeline for LLM-based Vulnerability Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of LLMs into vulnerability detection (VD) has shifted the field toward interpretable and context-aware analysis. While post-training methods have shown promise in general coding tasks, their systematic application to VD remains underexplored. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive investigation into the post-training pipeline for LLM-based VD, spanning from cold-start SFT to off-policy preference optimization and on-policy RL, uncovering how data curation, stage interactions, reward mechanisms, and evaluation protocols collectively dictate the efficacy of model training and assessment. Our study identifies practical guidelines and insights: (1) SFT based on rejection sampling greatly outperforms rationalization-based supervision, which can introduce hallucinations due to ground-truth leakage. (2) While increased SFT epochs constantly benefit preference optimization, excessive SFT inhibits self-exploration during RL, ultimately limiting performance gains. (3) Coarse-grained reward signals often mislead RL, whereas fine-grained root-cause judgments ensure reliable credit assignment. Specification-based rewards offer further benefits but incur significant effort in specification generation. (4) Although filtering extremely hard-to-detect vulnerability samples improves RL training efficiency, the cost of performance loss should be considered in practical applications. (5) Models trained under GRPO significantly outperform those using SFT and preference optimization (i.e., DPO and ORPO), as well as a series of zero-shot SOTA LLMs, underscoring the significant potential of on-policy RL for LLM-based VD. (6) In contrast to binary matching that tends to overestimate performance, LLM-as-a-Judge based on root-cause analysis provides a more robust evaluation protocol, although its accuracy varies across judge models with different levels of security expertise.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.14256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This chapter provides an introduction to the foundations of digital twins and makes the case for employing them in smart grids. As engineered systems become more complex and autonomous, digital twin technology gains importance as the unified technological platform for design, testing, operation, and maintenance. Smart grids are prime examples of such complex systems, in which unique design and operation challenges arise from the combination of physical and software components. As high-fidelity in-silico replicas of physical components, digital twins provide safe and cost-efficient experimentation facilities in the design and verification phase of smart grids. In the operation phase of smart grids, digital twins enable automated load balancing of grids through real-time simulation and decision-making. These, and an array of similar benefits, position digital twins as crucial technological components in smart grids.</description>

      <title>AutoWebWorld: Synthesizing Infinite Verifiable Web Environments via Finite State Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14296v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The performance of autonomous Web GUI agents heavily relies on the quality and quantity of their training data. However, a fundamental bottleneck persists: collecting interaction trajectories from real-world websites is expensive and difficult to verify. The underlying state transitions are hidden, leading to reliance on inconsistent and costly external verifiers to evaluate step-level correctness. To address this, we propose AutoWebWorld, a novel framework for synthesizing controllable and verifiable web environments by modeling them as Finite State Machines (FSMs) and use coding agents to translate FSMs into interactive websites. Unlike real websites, where state transitions are implicit, AutoWebWorld explicitly defines all states, actions, and transition rules. This enables programmatic verification: action correctness is checked against predefined rules, and task success is confirmed by reaching a goal state in the FSM graph. AutoWebWorld enables a fully automated search-and-verify pipeline, generating over 11,663 verified trajectories from 29 diverse web environments at only $0.04 per trajectory. Training on this synthetic data significantly boosts real-world performance. Our 7B Web GUI agent outperforms all baselines within 15 steps on WebVoyager. Furthermore, we observe a clear scaling law: as the synthetic data volume increases, performance on WebVoyager and Online-Mind2Web consistently improves.</description>

      <title>When Security Meets Usability: An Empirical Investigation of Post-Quantum Cryptography APIs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advances in quantum computing increasingly threaten the security and privacy of data protected by current cryptosystems, particularly those relying on public-key cryptography. In response, the international cybersecurity community has prioritized the implementation of Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC), a new cryptographic standard designed to resist quantum attacks while operating on classical computers. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has already standardized several PQC algorithms and plans to deprecate classical asymmetric schemes, such as RSA and ECDSA, by 2035. Despite this urgency, PQC adoption remains slow, often due to limited developer expertise. Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) are intended to bridge this gap, yet prior research on classical security APIs demonstrates that poor usability of cryptographic APIs can lead developers to introduce vulnerabilities during implementation of the applications, a risk amplified by the novelty and complexity of PQC. To date, the usability of PQC APIs has not been systematically studied. This research presents an empirical evaluation of the usability of the PQC APIs, observing how developers interact with APIs and documentation during software development tasks. The study identifies cognitive factors that influence the developer's performance when working with PQC primitives with minimal onboarding. The findings highlight opportunities across the PQC ecosystem to improve developer-facing guidance, terminology alignment, and workflow examples to better support non-specialists.</description>

      <title>EmbeWebAgent: Embedding Web Agents into Any Customized UI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14865v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most web agents operate at the human interface level, observing screenshots or raw DOM trees without application-level access, which limits robustness and action expressiveness. In enterprise settings, however, explicit control of both the frontend and backend is available. We present EmbeWebAgent, a framework for embedding agents directly into existing UIs using lightweight frontend hooks (curated ARIA and URL-based observations, and a per-page function registry exposed via a WebSocket) and a reusable backend workflow that performs reasoning and takes actions. EmbeWebAgent is stack-agnostic (e.g., React or Angular), supports mixed-granularity actions ranging from GUI primitives to higher-level composites, and orchestrates navigation, manipulation, and domain-specific analytics via MCP tools. Our demo shows minimal retrofitting effort and robust multi-step behaviors grounded in a live UI setting. Live Demo: https://youtu.be/Cy06Ljee1JQ</description>

      <title>ReusStdFlow: A Standardized Reusability Framework for Dynamic Workflow Construction in Agentic AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To address the ``reusability dilemma'' and structural hallucinations in enterprise Agentic AI,this paper proposes ReusStdFlow, a framework centered on a novel ``Extraction-Storage-Construction'' paradigm. The framework deconstructs heterogeneous, platform-specific Domain Specific Languages (DSLs) into standardized, modular workflow segments. It employs a dual knowledge architecture-integrating graph and vector databases-to facilitate synergistic retrieval of both topological structures and functional semantics. Finally, workflows are intelligently assembled using a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) strategy. Tested on 200 real-world n8n workflows, the system achieves over 90% accuracy in both extraction and construction. This framework provides a standardized solution for the automated reorganization and efficient reuse of enterprise digital assets.</description>

      <title>Tool-Aware Planning in Contact Center AI: Evaluating LLMs through Lineage-Guided Query Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a domain-grounded framework and benchmark for tool-aware plan generation in contact centers, where answering a query for business insights, our target use case, requires decomposing it into executable steps over structured tools (Text2SQL (T2S)/Snowflake) and unstructured tools (RAG/transcripts) with explicit depends_on for parallelism. Our contributions are threefold: (i) a reference-based plan evaluation framework operating in two modes - a metric-wise evaluator spanning seven dimensions (e.g., tool-prompt alignment, query adherence) and a one-shot evaluator; (ii) a data curation methodology that iteratively refines plans via an evaluator-&gt;optimizer loop to produce high-quality plan lineages (ordered plan revisions) while reducing manual effort; and (iii) a large-scale study of 14 LLMs across sizes and families for their ability to decompose queries into step-by-step, executable, and tool-assigned plans, evaluated under prompts with and without lineage. Empirically, LLMs struggle on compound queries and on plans exceeding 4 steps (typically 5-15); the best total metric score reaches 84.8% (Claude-3-7-Sonnet), while the strongest one-shot match rate at the "A+" tier (Extremely Good, Very Good) is only 49.75% (o3-mini). Plan lineage yields mixed gains overall but benefits several top models and improves step executability for many. Our results highlight persistent gaps in tool-understanding, especially in tool-prompt alignment and tool-usage completeness, and show that shorter, simpler plans are markedly easier. The framework and findings provide a reproducible path for assessing and improving agentic planning with tools for answering data-analysis queries in contact-center settings.</description>

      <title>Automated Proof Generation for Rust Code via Self-Evolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15756v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ensuring correctness is crucial for code generation. Formal verification offers a definitive assurance of correctness, but demands substantial human effort in proof construction and hence raises a pressing need for automation. The primary obstacle lies in the severe lack of data-there is much fewer proofs than code snippets for Large Language Models (LLMs) to train upon. In this paper, we introduce SAFE, a framework that overcomes the lack of human-written proofs to enable automated proof generation of Rust code. SAFE establishes a self-evolving cycle where data synthesis and fine-tuning collaborate to enhance the model capability, leveraging the definitive power of a symbolic verifier in telling correct proofs from incorrect ones. SAFE also re-purposes the large number of synthesized incorrect proofs to train the self-debugging capability of the fine-tuned models, empowering them to fix incorrect proofs based on the verifier's feedback. SAFE demonstrates superior efficiency and precision compared to GPT-4o. Through tens of thousands of synthesized proofs and the self-debugging mechanism, we improve the capability of open-source models, initially unacquainted with formal verification, to automatically write proofs for Rust code. This advancement leads to a significant improvement in performance, achieving a 52.52% accuracy rate in a benchmark crafted by human experts, a significant leap over GPT-4o's performance of 14.39%.</description>

      <title>EVALOOOP: A Self-Consistency-Centered Framework for Assessing Large Language Model Robustness in Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12185v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Evaluating the programming robustness of large language models (LLMs) is paramount for ensuring their reliability in AI-based software development. However, adversarial attacks exhibit fundamental limitations that compromise fair robustness assessment: they demonstrate contradictory evaluation outcomes where different attack strategies tend to favor different models, and more critically, they operate solely through external perturbations, failing to capture the intrinsic stability essential for autonomous coding agents where subsequent inputs are endogenously generated by the model itself. We introduce EVALOOOP, a novel assessment framework that evaluates robustness from a self-consistency perspective, leveraging the natural duality inherent in software engineering tasks (e.g., code generation and code summarization). EVALOOOP establishes a self-contained feedback loop where an LLM iteratively transforms between code and natural language until functional failure occurs, with robustness quantified by a novel Average Sustainable Loops (ASL) metric-the mean number of iterations maintaining functional correctness across benchmark tasks. This cyclical strategy intrinsically evaluates robustness without relying on external attack configurations, providing a unified metric that reveals how effectively LLMs preserve semantic integrity through sustained self-referential transformations. We evaluate 96 popular LLMs, ranging from 0.5B to 685B parameters, on EVALOOOP equipped with the MBPP Plus benchmark, and found that EVALOOOP typically induces a 2.65%-47.62% absolute drop in pass@1 accuracy within ten loops. Intriguingly, robustness does not always align with initial performance (i.e., one-time query); for instance, Qwen3-235B-A22B-Instruct-2507, despite inferior initial code generation compared to OpenAI's o-series models and DeepSeek-V3, demonstrated the superior robustness (ASL score).</description>

      <title>Advancing Software Quality: A Standards-Focused Review of LLM-Based Assurance Techniques</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13766v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Software Quality Assurance (SQA) is critical for delivering reliable, secure, and efficient software products. The Software Quality Assurance Process aims to provide assurance that work products and processes comply with predefined provisions and plans. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) present new opportunities to enhance existing SQA processes by automating tasks like requirement analysis, code review, test generation, and compliance checks. Simultaneously, established standards such as ISO/IEC 12207, ISO/IEC 25010, ISO/IEC 5055, ISO 9001/ISO/IEC 90003, CMMI, and TMM provide structured frameworks for ensuring robust quality practices. This paper surveys the intersection of LLM-based SQA methods and these recognized standards, highlighting how AI-driven solutions can augment traditional approaches while maintaining compliance and process maturity. We first review the foundational software quality standards and the technical fundamentals of LLMs in software engineering. Next, we explore various LLM-based SQA applications, including requirement validation, defect detection, test generation, and documentation maintenance. We then map these applications to key software quality frameworks, illustrating how LLMs can address specific requirements and metrics within each standard. Empirical case studies and open-source initiatives demonstrate the practical viability of these methods. At the same time, discussions on challenges (e.g., data privacy, model bias, explainability) underscore the need for deliberate governance and auditing. Finally, we propose future directions encompassing adaptive learning, privacy-focused deployments, multimodal analysis, and evolving standards for AI-driven software quality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.17868v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current coding benchmarks often inflate Large Language Model (LLM) capabilities due to static paradigms and data contamination, enabling models to exploit statistical shortcuts rather than genuine reasoning. To address this, we introduce UniCode, a generative evaluation framework that systematically probes LLM limits via: (1) multi-dimensional augmentation transforming seed problems into complex variations to disrupt fixed algorithmic patterns; (2) a highly reliable, automated test generation pipeline for scalable evaluation; and (3) fine-grained metrics for rich error signals. Experiments reveal a 31.2% performance collapse in state-of-the-art models on UniCode, primarily driven by deficiencies in conceptual modeling and scalability reasoning rather than syntactic errors. Furthermore, we uncover a seed-problem regression where models revert to memorized seed logic rather than following new specifications, signaling a reliance on shortcuts over reasoning. This work validates UniCode as a robust framework to expose model fragility and foster reasoning-oriented code intelligence.</description>

      <title>Improved Bug Localization with AI Agents Leveraging Hypothesis and Dynamic Cognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12522v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Software bugs cost technology providers (e.g., AT&amp;T) billions annually and cause developers to spend roughly 50% of their time on bug resolution. Traditional methods for bug localization often analyze the suspiciousness of code components (e.g., methods, documents) in isolation, overlooking their connections with other components in the codebase. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) and agentic AI techniques have shown strong potential for code understanding, but still lack causal reasoning during code exploration and struggle to manage growing context effectively, limiting their capability. In this paper, we present a novel agentic technique for bug localization -- CogniGent -- that overcomes the limitations above by leveraging multiple AI agents capable of causal reasoning, call-graph-based root cause analysis and context engineering. It emulates developers-inspired debugging practices (a.k.a., dynamic cognitive debugging) and conducts hypothesis testing to support bug localization. We evaluate CogniGent on a curated dataset of 591 bug reports using three widely adopted performance metrics and compare it against six established baselines from the literature. Experimental results show that our technique consistently outperformed existing traditional and LLM-based techniques, achieving MAP improvements of 23.33-38.57% at the document and method levels. Similar gains were observed in MRR, with increases of 25.14-53.74% at both granularity levels. Statistical significance tests also confirm the superiority of our technique. By addressing the reasoning, dependency, and context limitations, CogniGent advances the state of bug localization, bridging human-like cognition with agentic automation for improved performance.</description>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used for code generation. However, the correctness of code generated by LLMs remains a concern. A potential remedy to this concern is to have LLMs generate formal correctness proofs along with such code. However, compared with code generation, code-proof generation requires much higher reasoning capability and has much less existing data to learn from. In this paper, we present VeruSyn, a data synthesis pipeline for Verus, a state-of-the-art verification tool for system software written in Rust. Through self-synthesis and tutorial-based synthesis, VeruSyn achieves much larger scale and Verus-feature coverage than previous data-synthesis techniques designed for Verus; VeruSyn also supplements its dataset with long-chain-of-thought (CoT) data through agent trajectory synthesis. With VeruSyn, we synthesize the largest set of Verus verified programs: 6.9 million Rust programs, each with a formal specification and a proof that it meets that specification. This dataset lets us create a fine-tuned Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct model with appealing cost-proof tradeoff compared with state-of-the-art commercial models like Claude Sonnet 4.5. It also significantly outperforms models like o4-mini and previously proposed research models.</description>

      <title>Debugging code world models</title>

Abstract: Code World Models (CWMs) are language models trained to simulate program execution by predicting explicit runtime state after every executed command. This execution-based world modeling enables internal verification within the model, offering an alternative to natural language chain-of-thought reasoning. However, the sources of errors and the nature of CWMs' limitations remain poorly understood. We study CWMs from two complementary perspectives: local semantic execution and long-horizon state tracking. On real-code benchmarks, we identify two dominant failure regimes. First, dense runtime state reveals produce token-intensive execution traces, leading to token-budget exhaustion on programs with long execution histories. Second, failures disproportionately concentrate in string-valued state, which we attribute to limitations of subword tokenization rather than program structure. To study long-horizon behavior, we use a controlled permutation-tracking benchmark that isolates state propagation under action execution. We show that long-horizon degradation is driven primarily by incorrect action generation: when actions are replaced with ground-truth commands, a Transformer-based CWM propagates state accurately over long horizons, despite known limitations of Transformers in long-horizon state tracking. These findings suggest directions for more efficient supervision and state representations in CWMs that are better aligned with program execution and data types.</description>

      <title>The Influence of Code Smells in Efferent Neighbors on Class Stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12950v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding what drives code instability is essential for effective software maintenance, as unstable classes require larger or more frequent edits and increase the risk of unintended side effects. Although code smells are widely believed to harm maintainability, most prior stability studies examine only the smells within the class being modified. In practice, however, classes can change because their efferent neighbors (i.e., the classes they depend on) are modified due to ripple effects that propagate along static dependencies, even if the class itself is clean. Such ripple effects may be more severe when the efferent neighbor exhibits code smells. In addition, code smells rarely occur alone. They often appear together within a class or across classes connected by static dependencies, a phenomenon known as code smell interrelation. Such interrelation can lead to code smell interaction, where smells are directly connected through static dependencies and may further compound maintainability issues. However, the effect of code smell interrelation and interaction on code quality remains largely underexplored. Therefore, this study investigates whether the presence of code smells in a class's efferent neighbors affects its stability, considering the factor of code smell interrelation and interaction. To achieve this, we mine one year of commit history from 100 top-starred GitHub projects, detect code smells and static dependencies, determine code smell interrelation and interaction, and model these factors as predictors of class stability.</description>

      <title>GEPA: Reflective Prompt Evolution Can Outperform Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19457v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly adapted to downstream tasks via reinforcement learning (RL) methods like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), which often require thousands of rollouts to learn new tasks. We argue that the interpretable nature of language often provides a much richer learning medium for LLMs, compared to policy gradients derived from sparse, scalar rewards. To test this, we introduce GEPA (Genetic-Pareto), a prompt optimizer that thoroughly incorporates natural language reflection to learn high-level rules from trial and error. Given any AI system containing one or more LLM prompts, GEPA samples trajectories (e.g., reasoning, tool calls, and tool outputs) and reflects on them in natural language to diagnose problems, propose and test prompt updates, and combine complementary lessons from the Pareto frontier of its own attempts. As a result of GEPA's design, it can often turn even just a few rollouts into a large quality gain. Across six tasks, GEPA outperforms GRPO by 6% on average and by up to 20%, while using up to 35x fewer rollouts. GEPA also outperforms the leading prompt optimizer, MIPROv2, by over 10% (e.g., +12% accuracy on AIME-2025), and demonstrates promising results as an inference-time search strategy for code optimization. We release our code at https://github.com/gepa-ai/gepa .</description>

      <title>HEAS: Hierarchical Evolutionary Agent Simulation Framework for Cross-Scale Modeling and Multi-Objective Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15555v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hierarchical Evolutionary Agent Simulation (HEAS) is a Python framework that unifies layered agent-based modeling with evolutionary optimization and tournament evaluation in a single, reproducible workflow. HEAS represents models as hierarchies of lightweight processes ("streams") scheduled in deterministic layers that read and write a shared context, making cross-scale couplings explicit and auditable. A compact API and CLI-simulate, optimize, evaluate-expose single- and multi-objective evolution, PyTorch policy integration via parameter flattening/unflattening, and general tournament tooling with user-defined scoring and voting rules. The framework standardizes evaluation through uniform per-step and episode metrics, persists seeds, logbooks, and hall-of-fame archives, and provides plotting helpers for traces, Pareto fronts, and comparative outcomes, reducing glue code and improving comparability across studies. HEAS emphasizes separation of mechanism from orchestration, allowing exogenous drivers, endogenous agents, and aggregators to be composed and swapped without refactoring, while the same model can be used for forward simulation, optimization, or systematic comparison. We illustrate usage with two compact examples-an ecological system and an enterprise decision-making setting. HEAS offers a practical foundation for cross-disciplinary, multi-level inquiry, yielding reliable, reproducible results.</description>

      <title>zkCraft: Prompt-Guided LLM as a Zero-Shot Mutation Pattern Oracle for TCCT-Powered ZK Fuzzing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00667v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Zero-knowledge circuits enable privacy-preserving and scalable systems but are difficult to implement correctly due to the tight coupling between witness computation and circuit constraints. We present zkCraft, a practical framework that combines deterministic, R1CS-aware localization with proof-bearing search to detect semantic inconsistencies. zkCraft encodes candidate constraint edits into a single Row-Vortex polynomial and replaces repeated solver queries with a Violation IOP that certifies the existence of edits together with a succinct proof. Deterministic LLM-driven mutation templates bias exploration toward edge cases while preserving auditable algebraic verification. Evaluation on real Circom code shows that proof-bearing localization detects diverse under- and over-constrained faults with low false positives and reduces costly solver interaction. Our approach bridges formal verification and automated debugging, offering a scalable path for robust ZK circuit development.</description>
