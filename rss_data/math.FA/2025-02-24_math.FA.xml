      <title>Numerical and graphical exploration of the generalized beta-logarithmic matrix function and its properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the generalized beta-logarithmic matrix function (GBLMF),which combines the extended beta matrix function and the logarithmic mean. The study establishes essential properties of this function, including functional relations, inequalities, finite and infinite sums, integral representations, and partial derivative formulas. Theoretical results are accompanied by numerical examples and graphical representations to demonstrate the behavior of the new matrix function. Additionally, a comparison with classical and previously studied beta matrix functions is presented to highlight the differences and advantages of the generalized version. The findings offer valuable insights into the properties and applications of the extended beta-logarithmic matrix function in various mathematical and applied contexts.</description>

      <title>Tauberian theorems for sequences and the Katznelson--Tzafriri theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we present an alternative proof of a quantified Tauberian theorem for vector-valued sequences first proved in \cite{Sei15_Tauberian}. The theorem relates the decay rate of a bounded sequence with properties of a certain boundary function. We present a slightly strengthened version of this result, and illustrate how it can be used to obtain quantified versions of the Katznelson--Tzafriri theorem as well as results on Ritt operators.</description>

      <title>A Cuntz-Krieger uniqueness theorem for $L^p$-operator graph algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We continue the study $L^p$-operator algebras associated with directed graphs initiated by Corti\~nas and Rodriguez. We establish an $L^p$-analog of the Cuntz-Krieger uniqueness theorem, proving that for a countable graph $Q$ in which every cycle has an entry, a spatial Cuntz-Krieger family in an $L^p$-space generates an injective representation as soon as the idempotents associated to the vertices of $Q$ are nonzero. Additionally, we show that for acyclic graphs, these representations are automatically isometric.
  While our general approach is inspired by the proofs in the C*-algebra setting, a careful analysis of spatial representations of graphs on $L^p$-spaces is required. In particular, we exploit the interplay between analytical properties of Banach algebras, such as the role of hermitian elements, and geometric notions specific to $L^p$-spaces, such as spatial implementation.</description>

      <title>Digital implementations of deep feature extractors are intrinsically informative</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rapid information (energy) propagation in deep feature extractors is crucial to balance computational complexity versus expressiveness as a representation of the input. We prove an upper bound for the speed of energy propagation in a unified framework that covers different neural network models, both over Euclidean and non-Euclidean domains. Additional structural information about the signal domain can be used to explicitly determine or improve the rate of decay. To illustrate this, we show global exponential energy decay for a range of 1) feature extractors with discrete-domain input signals, and 2) convolutional neural networks (CNNs) via scattering over locally compact abelian (LCA) groups.</description>

      <title>Weighted BMO-BLO estimates for Littlewood--Paley square operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15125v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $T(f)$ denote the Littlewood--Paley square operators, including the Littlewood--Paley $\mathcal{G}$-function $\mathcal{G}(f)$, Lusin's area integral $\mathcal{S}(f)$ and Stein's function $\mathcal{G}^{\ast}_{\lambda}(f)$ with $\lambda&gt;2$. We establish the boundedness of Littlewood--Paley square operators on the weighted spaces $\mathrm{BMO}(\omega)$ with $\omega\in A_1$. The weighted space $\mathrm{BLO}(\omega)$ (the space of functions with bounded lower oscillation) is introduced and studied in this paper. This new space is a proper subspace of $\mathrm{BMO}(\omega)$. It is proved that if $T(f)(x_0)$ is finite for a single point $x_0\in\mathbb R^n$, then $T(f)(x)$ is finite almost everywhere in $\mathbb R^n$. Moreover, it is shown that $T(f)$ is bounded from $\mathrm{BMO}(\omega)$ into $\mathrm{BLO}(\omega)$, provided that $\omega\in A_1$. The corresponding John--Nirenberg inequality suitable for the space $\mathrm{BLO}(\omega)$ with $\omega\in A_1$ is discussed. Based on this, the equivalent characterization of the space $\mathrm{BLO}(\omega)$ is also given.</description>

      <title>Spectrum of L\'evy-Ornstein-Uhlenbeck semigroups on $\mathbb{R}^d$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15183v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the spectral properties of Markov semigroups associated with Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) processes driven by L\'evy processes. These semigroups are generated by non-local, non-self-adjoint operators. In the special case where the driving L\'evy process is Brownian motion, one recovers the classical diffusion OU semigroup, whose spectral properties have been extensively studied over past few decades. Our main results establish that, under suitable conditions on the L\'evy process, the spectrum of the L\'evy-OU semigroup in the $L^p$-space weighted with the invariant distribution coincides with that of the diffusion OU semigroup. Furthermore, when the drift matrix $B$ is diagonalizable with real eigenvalues, we derive explicit formulas for eigenfunctions and co-eigenfunctions--an observation that, to the best of our knowledge, has not appeared in the literature. We also show that the multiplicities of the eigenvalues remain independent on the choice of the L\'evy process. A key ingredient in our approach is intertwining relationship: we prove that every L\'evy-OU semigroup is intertwined with a diffusion OU semigroup. Additionally, we examine the compactness properties of these semigroups and provide examples of non-compact L\'evy-OU semigroups.</description>

      <title>$C^*$-extreme points of unital completely positive maps on real $C^*$-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15362v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the general properties and structure of $C^*$-extreme points within the $C^*$-convex set $\mathrm{UCP}(\mathcal{A},B(\mathcal{H}))$ of all unital completely positive (UCP) maps from a unital real $C^*$-algebra $\mathcal{A}$ to the algebra $B(\mathcal{H})$ of all bounded real linear maps on a real Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$. We analyze the differences in the structure of $C^*$-extreme points between the real and complex $C^*$-algebra cases. In particular, we show that the necessary and sufficient conditions for a UCP map between matrix algebras to be a $C^*$-extreme point are identical in both the real and complex matrix algebra cases. We also observe significant differences in the structure of $C^*$-extreme points when $\mathcal{A}$ is a commutative real $C^*$-algebra compared to when $\mathcal{A}$ is a commutative complex $C^*$-algebra. We provide a complete classification of the $C^*$-extreme points of $\mathrm{UCP}(\mathcal{A},B(\mathcal{H}))$, where $\mathcal{A}$ is a unital commutative real $C^*$-algebra and $\mathcal{H}$ is a finite-dimensional real Hilbert space. As an application, we classify all $C^*$-extreme points in the $C^*$-convex set of all contractive skew-symmetric real matrices in $M_n(\mathbb{R})$.</description>

      <title>Kinetic Optimal Transport (OTIKIN) -- Part 1: Second-Order Discrepancies Between Probability Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This is the first of a series of papers aimed at constructing a general theory of optimal transport to describe the time evolution of complex systems of interacting particles at the kinetic level. We argue that this theory may have applications also to biology (RNA sequencing and cell development), computer vision (continuous interpolation of images), and engineering (optimal steering).
  Firstly, we define our main object: a new second-order discrepancy between probability measures, analogous to the $2$-Wasserstein distance, but based on the minimisation of the squared acceleration.
  Secondly, we prove existence for the associated Kantorovich problem, and, under suitable conditions, of an optimal transport map. We also provide an equivalent time-continuous characterisation (Benamou--Brenier formula), where the admissible curves of measures are solutions to an adapted class of Vlasov's continuity equations.
  Thirdly, we define a class of absolutely continuous curves of measures and prove that they coincide exactly with time reparametrisations of solutions to Vlasov's equations.</description>

      <title>Chernoff approximations as a method for finding the resolvent of a linear operator and solving a linear ODE with variable coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.06765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.06765v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Chernoff approximation method is a powerful and flexible tool of functional analysis, which allows in many cases to express exp(tL) in terms of variable coefficients of a linear differential operator L. In this paper, we prove a theorem that allows us to apply this method to find the resolvent of L. Our theorem states that the Laplace transforms of Chernoff approximations of a $C_0$-semigroup converge to the resolvent of the generator of this semigroup. We demonstrate the proposed method on a second-order differential operator with variable coefficients. As a consequence, we obtain a new representation of the solution of a nonhomogeneous linear ordinary differential equation of the second order in terms of functions that are coefficients of this equation, playing the role of parameters of the problem. For the Chernoff function, based on the shift operator, we give an estimate for the rate of convergence of approximations to the solution.</description>

      <title>Complex Interpolation and the Monotonicity in the Spatial Integrability Parameter of Exponentially Weighted Modulation Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00797v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of common retraction and coretraction for families of Banach spaces, formulate a framework for identifying interpolation spaces, and apply it to modulation spaces with exponential weights $E^s_{p,q}$. By constructing the domain of the common coretraction, we are able to prove $E^s_{o, q} \hookrightarrow E^s_{p, q}$ for $o \leq p$, i.e. the monotonicity in the spatial integrability parameter.</description>
