      <title>Filtering in a hazard rate change-point model with financial and life-insurance applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a continuous-time filtering framework for estimating a hazard rate subject to an unobservable change-point. This framework arises naturally in both financial and insurance applications, where the default intensity of a firm or the mortality rate of an individual may experience a sudden jump at an unobservable time, representing, for instance, a shift in the firm's risk profile or a deterioration in an individual's health status. By employing a progressive enlargement of filtration, we integrate noisy observations of the hazard rate with default-related information. We characterise the filter, i.e. the conditional probability of the change-point given the information flow, as the unique strong solution to a stochastic differential equation driven by the innovation process enriched with the discontinuous component. A sensitivity analysis and a comparison of the filter's behaviour under various information structures are provided. Our framework further allows for the derivation of an explicit formula for the survival probability conditional on partial information. This result applies to the pricing of credit-sensitive financial instruments such as defaultable bonds, credit default swaps, and life insurance contracts. Finally, a numerical analysis illustrates how partial information leads to delayed adjustments in the estimation of the hazard rate and consequently to mispricing of credit-sensitive instruments when compared to a full-information setting.</description>

      <title>Portfolios Generated by Contingent Claim Functions, with Applications to Option Pricing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.13717v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a synthesis of the theories of portfolio generating functions and option pricing. The theory of portfolio generation is extended to measure the value of portfolios generated by positive C^{2,1} functions of asset prices X_1,... , X_n directly, rather than with respect to a numeraire portfolio. If a portfolio generating function satisfies a specific partial differential equation, then the value of the portfolio generated by that function will replicate the value of the function. This differential equation is a general form of the Black-Scholes equation. Similar results apply to contingent claim functions, which are portfolio generating functions that are homogeneous of degree 1. With the addition of a riskless asset, an inhomogeneous portfolio generating function V : R^{+n} x [0, T] \to R^+ can be extended to an equivalent contingent claim function \hat{V} : R^+ x R^{+n} x [0, T] \to R^+ that generates the same portfolio and is replicable if and only if V is replicable. Several examples are presented.</description>

      <title>Recursive Optimal Stopping with Poisson Stopping Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17975v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper solves a recursive optimal stopping problem with Poisson stopping constraints using the penalized backward stochastic differential equation (PBSDE) with jumps. Stopping in this problem is only allowed at Poisson random intervention times, and jumps play a significant role not only through the stopping times but also in the recursive objective functional and model coefficients. To solve the problem, we propose a decomposition method based on Jacod-Pham that allows us to separate the problem into a series of sub-problems between each pair of consecutive Poisson stopping times. To represent the value function of the recursive optimal stopping problem when the initial time falls between two consecutive Poisson stopping times and the generator is concave/convex, we leverage the comparison theorem of BSDEs with jumps. We then apply the representation result to American option pricing in a nonlinear market with Poisson stopping constraints.</description>
