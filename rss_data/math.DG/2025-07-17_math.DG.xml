      <title>On the homothety conjecture for the body of flotation and the body of buoyancy on a plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate several closely related "homothety conjectures" for convex bodies on a plane. Using the modern language of differential geometry, we systematically derive the fundamental properties of bodies of flotation, bodies of buoyancy, and bodies of illumination. As a direct consequence of our results, we show that if the body of flotation is homothetic to the body of buoyancy, and if every chord of flotation cuts off from the boundary exactly $\frac{1}{3}$ of its total affine arc length, then $K$ is an ellipse. We also provide natural affine counterparts of the classical theorems on the floating body problem from the Scottish Book due to H. Auerbach. In particular, we obtain an affine counterpart of Zindler carousels introduced by J. Bracho, L. Montejano, and D. Oliveros.</description>

      <title>Analyzing the Geometry of Immersions of Co-Dimension One via Shape Operator Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the extrinsic geometry of isometric immersions into Riemannian manifolds of co-dimension one via a fourth-order geometric evolution of the shape operator. Motivated by bi-harmonic map theory and generalized Chen's conjecture, we introduce a moduli flow, a tensorial gradient flow that decreases a natural energy measuring curvature variation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the combinatorial Yamabe flow on infinite triangulated surfaces in Euclidean background geometry, aiming for solving discrete Yamabe problem on noncompact surfaces. Under suitable conditions, we establish the short-time existence and uniqueness of the flow. We further introduce an extended version of the flow and prove its long-time existence. As an application, we prove the convergence result of the Yamabe flow in the case of hexagonal triangulations of the plane.</description>

      <title>Exterior Generalised Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is the aim of this paper to transfer to generalised geometry tools employed in the study of semi-Riemannian immersions, specializing at times to semi-Riemannian hypersurfaces.
  Given an exact Courant algebroid $E \to M$ and an immersion $\iota\colon N \hookrightarrow M$, there is a well-known construction of an exact Courant algebroid $\iota^! E \to N$, the pullback of $E$. This paper explains the pullback of generalised metrics and divergence operators. Assuming $N$ is a hypersurface, it develops the notion of generalised exterior curvature, introducing the generalised second fundamental form and the generalised mean curvature. Generalised versions of the Gau{\ss}-Codazzi equations are obtained. As an application, the constraint equations for the initial value formulation of the generalised Einstein equations are established in the formalism of generalised geometry. Further applications include a generalised geometry version of the fundamental theorem for hypersurfaces and the result that generalised K\"ahler and hyper-K\"ahler structures restrict to submanifolds compatible with the generalised almost complex structure. In particular, we characterise exact semi-Riemannian Courant algebroids which are flat with respect to the canonical generalised connection. These play the role of the ambient space in the fundamental theorem mentioned above.</description>

      <title>A connection between minimal surfaces and the two-dimensional analogues of a problem of Euler</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: If $\alpha\in\r$, an $\alpha$-stationary surface in Euclidean space is a surface $\Sigma$ whose mean curvature $H$ satisfies $H(p)=\alpha |p|^{-2} \langle\nu,p\rangle$, $p\in\Sigma$. These surfaces generalize in dimension two a classical family of curves studied by Euler which are critical points of the moment of inertia of planar curves. In this paper we establish, via inversions, a one-to-one correspondence between $\alpha$-stationary surfaces and $-(\alpha+4)$-stationary surfaces. In particular, there is a correspondence between $-4$-stationary surfaces and minimal surfaces. Using this duality we give some results of uniqueness of $-4$-stationary surfaces and we solve the B\"{o}rling problem.</description>

      <title>Hamilton's identity and rigidity of complete gradient solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study gradient solitons to general geometric flows. Our approach is to understand what assumptions need to be made about a flow in order to extend results about Ricci solitons. In this direction, we identify an identity, first exploited in the pioneering work of Richard Hamilton in the case of Ricci solitons, which we call Hamilton's identity. We show that a version of this identity for an arbitrary geometric flow allows one to recover results about rigidity, the growth of the potential function, volume growth and the Omori-Yau maximum principle that have been proven for gradient Ricci solitons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate axisymmetric surfaces in Euclidean space that are stationary for the energy $E_\alpha=\int_\Sigma |p|^\alpha\, d\Sigma$. By using a phase plane analysis, we classify these surfaces when they intersect orthogonally the rotation axis. We also give some applications of the maximum principle characterizing the closed stationary surfaces and the compact stationary surfaces with boundary a circle when $\alpha=-2$. Finally, we prove that helicoidal stationary surfaces must be rotational surfaces.</description>

      <title>Two classification results for stationary surfaces of the least moment of inertia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A surface in Euclidean space $\r^3$ is said to be an $\alpha$-stationary surface if it is a critical point of the energy $\int_\Sigma|p|^\alpha$, where $\alpha\in\r$. These surfaces are characterized by the Euler-Lagrange equation $H(p)=\alpha\frac{\langle N(p),p\rangle}{|p|^2}$, $p\in\Sigma$, where $H$ and $N$ are the mean curvature and the normal vector of $\Sigma$. If $\alpha\not=0$, we prove that vector planes are the only ruled $\alpha$-stationary surfaces. The second result of classification asserts that if $\alpha\not=-2,-4$, any $\alpha$-stationary surface foliated by circles must be a surface of revolution. If $\alpha=-4$, the surface is the inversion of a plane, a helicoid, a catenoid or an Riemann minimal example. If $\alpha=-2$, and besides spheres centered at $0$, we find non-spherical cyclic $-$-stationary surfaces.</description>

      <title>Implicit representations of codimension-2 submanifolds and their prequantum structure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the geometry of the space of codimension-2 submanifolds. We implicitly represent these submanifolds by a class of complex-valued functions. This reveals a prequantum bundle structure over the space of submanifolds, equipped with the well-known Marsden-Weinstein symplectic structure. This bundle allows a new physical interpretation of the Marsden-Weinstein structure as the curvature of a connection form, which measures the average of volumes swept by the deformation of the S^1-family of hypersurfaces, defined as the phases of a complex function implicitly representing a submanifold.</description>

      <title>Pseudodifferential Weyl calculus on vector bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a geometric framework for Weyl quantization on pseudo-Riemannian manifolds, in which pseudodifferential operators act on sections of vector bundles equipped with arbitrary connections. We construct the associated star product and compute its semiclassical expansion up to third order in the expansion parameter. A central feature of our approach is a one-to-one correspondence between formally self-adjoint symbols and formally self-adjoint operators, extending known results from flat space to curved geometries. In addition, we analyze the Moyal equation satisfied by the Wigner function in this setting and provide explicit computations of Weyl symbols for several physically significant operators, including the Dirac, Maxwell, linearized Yang-Mills, and linearized Einstein operators. Our results lay the foundation for future developments in quantum field theory on curved spacetimes, semiclassical analysis, and chiral kinetic theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we propose and study a curvature-based mathematical model for dorsal closure in embryonic drosophila. Using an analysis that mixes maximum-principle and integral-estimates, we establish global existence and convergence for data that mimics the initial geometry of a dorsal closure event. Further, we present a numerical approximation scheme for the flow, establishing stability, consistence, and convergence. We also give sample simulations of the flow with initial configurations that include experimentally observed data.</description>

      <title>A Lie Bracket on the Space of (Right) Biderivations of a Lie Algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12089v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Derivations extend the concept of differentiation from functions to algebraic structures as linear operators satisfying the Leibniz rule. In Lie algebras, derivations form a Lie algebra via the commutator bracket of linear endomorphisms. Motivated by this, we study biderivations-bilinear maps capturing higher-order infinitesimal symmetries. This work focuses on right biderivations of Lie algebras, introducing Lie brackets on spaces of biderivations to explore their algebraic and geometric properties. We analyse the interplay between left and right biderivation brackets through symmetric and skew-symmetric cases, providing a coherent Lie algebra framework. Moreover, we initiate the construction of Lie groups corresponding to the Lie algebra of biderivations, linking infinitesimal and global structures. Our results offer new perspectives on higher-order derivations with potential applications in deformation theory and generalised symmetry studies.</description>

      <title>RiemannLoRA: A Unified Riemannian Framework for Ambiguity-Free LoRA Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has become a widely adopted standard for parameter-efficient fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs), significantly reducing memory and computational demands. However, challenges remain, including finding optimal initialization strategies or mitigating overparametrization in low-rank matrix factorization. In this work, we propose a novel approach that addresses both of the challenges simultaneously within a unified framework. Our method treats a set of fixed-rank LoRA matrices as a smooth manifold. Considering adapters as elements on this manifold removes overparametrization, while determining the direction of the fastest loss decrease along the manifold provides initialization. Special care is taken to obtain numerically stable and computationally efficient implementation of our method, using best practices from numerical linear algebra and Riemannian optimization. Experimental results on LLM and diffusion model architectures demonstrate that RiemannLoRA consistently improves both convergence speed and final performance over standard LoRA and its state-of-the-art modifications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06762v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study rigidity problems for Riemannian and semi-Riemannian manifolds with metrics of low regularity. Specifically, we prove a version of the Cheeger-Gromoll splitting theorem \cite{CheegerGromoll72splitting} for Riemannian metrics and the flatness criterion for semi-Riemannian metrics of regularity $C^1$. With our proof of the splitting theorem, we are able to obtain an isometry of higher regularity than the Lipschitz regularity guaranteed by the $\mathsf{RCD}$-splitting theorem \cite{gigli2013splitting, gigli2014splitoverview}. Along the way, we establish a Bochner-Weitzenb\"ock identity which permits both the non-smoothness of the metric and of the vector fields, complementing a recent similar result in \cite{mondino2024equivalence}. The last section of the article is dedicated to the discussion of various notions of Sobolev spaces in low regularity, as well as an alternative proof of the equivalence (see \cite{mondino2024equivalence}) between distributional Ricci curvature bounds and $\mathsf{RCD}$-type bounds, using in part the stability of the variable $\mathsf{CD}$-condition under suitable limits \cite{ketterer2017variableCD}.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03246v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a finite-dimensional moment map property for certain canonical relatively K\"ahler metrics on holomorphic fibrations, called optimal symplectic connections. We then relate the existence of zeroes of this moment map to the stability of the fibration, where the stability property we consider is a version of K-stability that takes into account the fibration structure, first introduced by Dervan--Sektnan. In particular, we prove that a stable deformation of a fibration admitting an optimal symplectic connection still admits an optimal symplectic connection, through a new approach using the finite-dimensional moment map properties and the moment map flow.
  We include an appendix with a proof of a result considered by Sz\'ekelyhidi that a K-polystable deformation of a constant scalar curvature K\"ahler manifold still admits a constant scalar curvature metric, using the same technique.</description>

      <title>Deriving Perelman's entropy from Colding's monotonic volume</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12949v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In his groundbreaking work from 2002, Perelman introduced two fundamental monotonic quantities: the reduced volume and the entropy. While the reduced volume was motivated by the Bishop-Gromov volume comparison applied to a suitably constructed $N$-space, which becomes Ricci-flat as $N\rightarrow \infty$, Perelman did not provide a corresponding explanation for the origin of the entropy. In this article, we demonstrate that Perelman's entropy emerges as the limit of Colding's monotonic volume for harmonic functions on Ricci-flat manifolds, when appropriately applied to Perelman's $N$-space.</description>

      <title>The completeness problem on 3-dimensional non-unimodular Lie groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10998v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the completeness problem for left-invariant Lorentzian metrics on 3-dimensional non-unimodular Lie groups, all of which have Lie algebra of the form $\mathbb{R} \ltimes_A \mathbb{R}^2$, where $A$ is a real $2 \times 2$ matrix with nonzero trace. The case where $A$ is not diagonalizable over $\mathbb{C}$ was addressed in previous work by the authors, and the limiting case where $A$ is a scalar multiple of the identity is also known from the literature. In this paper, we determine all geodesically (in)complete left-invariant Lorentzian metrics for all other cases where $A$ is diagonalizable over $\mathbb{R}$. Additionally, we show that, when $A$ is diagonalizable over $\mathbb{C}$ but not over $\mathbb{R}$, there exists at least one incomplete metric. As a consequence of prior work and our results, we obtain that every 3-dimensional non-unimodular Lie group admits an incomplete left-invariant Lorentzian metric.</description>

      <title>Mirzakhani's frequencies of simple closed geodesics on hyperbolic surfaces in large genus and with many cusps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.03734v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a proof of a conjecture proposed by V. Delecroix, E. Goujard, P. Zograf, and A. Zorich, which describes the large genus asymptotic behaviours of the ratio of frequencies of separating over nonseparating simple closed geodesics on a closed hyperbolic surface of genus $g$ with $n$ cusps. We explicitly give the function $f(\frac{n}{g})$ in the conjecture. The moderate behaviour of the frequencies with respect to the growth rate of the number of cusps compared to that of the genus drastically contrasts with the behaviour of other geometric quantities and exhibits the topological nature of the frequencies.</description>

      <title>Curvature exponent of sub-Finsler Heisenberg groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14619v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The curvature exponent $N_{\mathrm{curv}}$ of a metric measure space is the smallest number $N$ for which the measure contraction property $\mathsf{MCP}(0,N)$ holds. In this paper, we study the curvature exponent of sub-Finsler Heisenberg groups equipped with the Lebesgue measure. We prove that $N_{\mathrm{curv}} \geq 5$, and the equality holds if and only if the corresponding sub-Finsler Heisenberg group is actually sub-Riemannian. Furthermore, we show that for every $N\geq 5$, there is a sub-Finsler structure on the Heisenberg group such that $N_{\mathrm{curv}}=N$.</description>

      <title>Multipole moments in stationary spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19667v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multipole moments in general relativity serve as a powerful tool for characterising the gravitational field. In this paper, we review the construction of the Geroch--Hansen multipole moments for stationary asymptotically flat vacuum spacetimes. A particular focus is placed on the well-definedness of these moments, which hinges on the uniqueness of the one-point conformal completion in Geroch's asymptotic flatness definition. Based on Geroch's approach, we formulate and prove a revised uniqueness result, thereby filling in some gaps in the original approach. Uniqueness holds up to certain conformal transformations, and we discuss how the multipole moments behave under such transformations.</description>
