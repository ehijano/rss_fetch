      <title>On functoriality of Baum-Bott residues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15133v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish the functoriality of Baum--Bott residues under certain conditions. As an application, we show that if $\mathcal{F}$ is a holomorphic foliation, of dimension $k$, on a (possibly non-compact) complex manifold $X$ of dimension $n$, then its singular set $Sing(\mathcal{F})$ has dimension $ \geq \min\{ k - 1,n-k-1\}$. In particular, if $k\leq n/2$, then $\dim(Sing(\mathcal{F}))\geq k-1$. This provides answers to questions posed by Cerveau and Lins Neto concerning foliations of dimension 2 in $\mathbb{C}^4$ and Druel regarding holomorphic foliations on projective manifolds. Furthermore, it confirms the Beauville--Bondal conjecture for the maximal degeneracy locus of Poisson structures. Specifically, if $X$ is a (possibly non-compact) complex Poisson manifold with generic rank $r \leq n/2$, and the degeneracy locus $ X \setminus X_r$ is non-empty, then it contains a component of dimension $ &gt; r - 2$.</description>

      <title>Closed-String Mirror Symmetry for Log Calabi-Yau Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02592v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper establishes closed-string mirror symmetry for all log Calabi-Yau surfaces with generic parameters, where the exceptional divisor are sufficiently small. We demonstrate that blowing down a $(-1)$-divisor removes a single geometric critical point, ensuring that the resulting potential remains a Morse function. Additionally, we show that the critical values are distinct, which implies that the quantum cohomology $QH^{\ast}(X)$ is semi-simple.</description>

      <title>Weinstein exactness of nearby Lagrangians: towards the Lagrangian $C^{0}$ flux conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04158v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address the following problem: if a Hamiltonian diffeomorphism maps a Lagrangian submanifold $L$ to a small Weinstein neighborhood of $L$, is the image necessarily Hamiltonian isotopic to $L$ inside that neighborhood? On one hand, we show that the question can have a negative answer in any symplectic manifold of dimension at least six. On the other hand, we answer an a priori weaker form of the question in the positive in various cases when $L$ satisfies a rationality condition: we prove that the image of $L$ is often exact inside the Weinstein neighborhood. We provide applications to the Lagrangian counterpart of the $C^0$ flux conjecture, to $C^0$-rigidity phenomena of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms, and to topological properties of spaces of Lagrangians with the same rationality constraint. Moreover, we state and prove cases of an analogue of Viterbo's spectral norm conjecture for non-exact Lagrangians; in the process, we make progress on an old question of Viterbo regarding integer difference vectors between points of Lagrangians.</description>

      <title>Discrete Lagrangian Neural Networks with Automatic Symmetry Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.10830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.10830v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By one of the most fundamental principles in physics, a dynamical system will exhibit those motions which extremise an action functional. This leads to the formation of the Euler-Lagrange equations, which serve as a model of how the system will behave in time. If the dynamics exhibit additional symmetries, then the motion fulfils additional conservation laws, such as conservation of energy (time invariance), momentum (translation invariance), or angular momentum (rotational invariance). To learn a system representation, one could learn the discrete Euler-Lagrange equations, or alternatively, learn the discrete Lagrangian function $\mathcal{L}_d$ which defines them. Based on ideas from Lie group theory, in this work we introduce a framework to learn a discrete Lagrangian along with its symmetry group from discrete observations of motions and, therefore, identify conserved quantities. The learning process does not restrict the form of the Lagrangian, does not require velocity or momentum observations or predictions and incorporates a cost term which safeguards against unwanted solutions and against potential numerical issues in forward simulations. The learnt discrete quantities are related to their continuous analogues using variational backward error analysis and numerical results demonstrate the improvement such models can have both qualitatively and quantitatively even in the presence of noise.</description>
