      <title>GOLF: Goal-Oriented Long-term liFe tasks supported by human-AI collaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advent of ChatGPT and similar large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized the human-AI interaction and information-seeking process. Leveraging LLMs as an alternative to search engines, users can now access summarized information tailored to their queries, significantly reducing the cognitive load associated with navigating vast information resources. This shift underscores the potential of LLMs in redefining information access paradigms. Drawing on the foundation of task-focused information retrieval and LLMs' task planning ability, this research extends the scope of LLM capabilities beyond routine task automation to support users in navigating long-term and significant life tasks. It introduces the GOLF framework (Goal-Oriented Long-term liFe tasks), which focuses on enhancing LLMs' ability to assist in significant life decisions through goal orientation and long-term planning. The methodology encompasses a comprehensive simulation study to test the framework's efficacy, followed by model and human evaluations to develop a dataset benchmark for long-term life tasks, and experiments across different models and settings. By shifting the focus from short-term tasks to the broader spectrum of long-term life goals, this research underscores the transformative potential of LLMs in enhancing human decision-making processes and task management, marking a significant step forward in the evolution of human-AI collaboration.</description>

      <title>Behind the Counter: Exploring the Motivations and Barriers of Online Counterspeech Writing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current research mainly explores the attributes and impact of online counterspeech, leaving a gap in understanding of who engages in online counterspeech or what motivates or deters users from participating. To investigate this, we surveyed 458 English-speaking U.S. participants, analyzing key motivations and barriers underlying online counterspeech engagement. We presented each participant with three hate speech examples from a set of 900, spanning race, gender, religion, sexual orientation, and disability, and requested counterspeech responses. Subsequent questions assessed their satisfaction, perceived difficulty, and the effectiveness of their counterspeech. Our findings show that having been a target of online hate is a key driver of frequent online counterspeech engagement. People differ in their motivations and barriers towards engaging in online counterspeech across different demographic groups. Younger individuals, women, those with higher education levels, and regular witnesses to online hate are more reluctant to engage in online counterspeech due to concerns around public exposure, retaliation, and third-party harassment. Varying motivation and barriers in counterspeech engagement also shape how individuals view their own self-authored counterspeech and the difficulty experienced writing it. Additionally, our work explores people's willingness to use AI technologies like ChatGPT for counterspeech writing. Through this work we introduce a multi-item scale for understanding counterspeech motivation and barriers and a more nuanced understanding of the factors shaping online counterspeech engagement.</description>

      <title>Building an Open-Source Community to Enhance Autonomic Nervous System Signal Analysis: DBDP-Autonomic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Smartphones and wearable sensors offer an unprecedented ability to collect peripheral psychophysiological signals across diverse timescales, settings, populations, and modalities. However, open-source software development has yet to keep pace with rapid advancements in hardware technology and availability, creating an analytical barrier that limits the scientific usefulness of acquired data. We propose a community-driven, open-source peripheral psychophysiological signal pre-processing and analysis software framework that could advance biobehavioral health by enabling more robust, transparent, and reproducible inferences involving autonomic nervous system data.</description>

      <title>SeSaMe: A Framework to Simulate Self-Reported Ground Truth for Mental Health Sensing Studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advances in mobile and wearable technologies have enabled the potential to passively monitor a person's mental, behavioral, and affective health. These approaches typically rely on longitudinal collection of self-reported outcomes, e.g., depression, stress, and anxiety, to train machine learning (ML) models. However, the need to continuously self-report adds a significant burden on the participants, often resulting in attrition, missing labels, or insincere responses. In this work, we introduce the Scale Scores Simulation using Mental Models (SeSaMe) framework to alleviate participants' burden in digital mental health studies. By leveraging pre-trained large language models (LLMs), SeSaMe enables the simulation of participants' responses on psychological scales. In SeSaMe, researchers can prompt LLMs with information on participants' internal behavioral dispositions, enabling LLMs to construct mental models of participants to simulate their responses on psychological scales. We demonstrate an application of SeSaMe, where we use GPT-4 to simulate responses on one scale using responses from another as behavioral information. We also evaluate the alignment between human and SeSaMe-simulated responses to psychological scales. Then, we present experiments to inspect the utility of SeSaMe-simulated responses as ground truth in training ML models by replicating established depression and anxiety screening tasks from a previous study. Our results indicate SeSaMe to be a promising approach, but its alignment may vary across scales and specific prediction objectives. We also observed that model performance with simulated data was on par with using the real data for training in most evaluation scenarios. We conclude by discussing the potential implications of SeSaMe in addressing some challenges researchers face with ground-truth collection in passive sensing studies.</description>

      <title>Measuring Compliance with the California Consumer Privacy Act Over Space and Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The widespread sharing of consumers personal information with third parties raises significant privacy concerns. The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) mandates that online businesses offer consumers the option to opt out of the sale and sharing of personal information. Our study automatically tracks the presence of the opt-out link longitudinally across multiple states after the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA) went into effect. We categorize websites based on whether they are subject to CCPA and investigate cases of potential non-compliance. We find a number of websites that implement the opt-out link early and across all examined states but also find a significant number of CCPA-subject websites that fail to offer any opt-out methods even when CCPA is in effect. Our findings can shed light on how websites are reacting to the CCPA and identify potential gaps in compliance and opt- out method designs that hinder consumers from exercising CCPA opt-out rights.</description>

      <title>EXPLORA: A teacher-apprentice methodology for eliciting natural child-computer interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Investigating child-computer interactions within their contexts is vital for designing technology that caters to children's needs. However, determining what aspects of context are relevant for designing child-centric technology remains a challenge. We introduce EXPLORA, a multimodal, multistage online methodology comprising three pivotal stages: (1) building a teacher-apprentice relationship,(2) learning from child-teachers, and (3) assessing and reinforcing researcher-apprentice learning. Central to EXPLORA is the collection of attitudinal data through pre-observation interviews, offering researchers a deeper understanding of children's characteristics and contexts. This informs subsequent online observations, allowing researchers to focus on frequent interactions. Furthermore, researchers can validate preliminary assumptions with children. A means-ends analysis framework aids in the systematic analysis of data, shedding light on context, agency and homework-information searching processes children employ in their activities. To illustrate EXPLORA's capabilities, we present nine single case studies investigating Brazilian child-caregiver dyads' (children ages 9-11) use of technology in homework information-searching.</description>

      <title>Coimagining the Future of Voice Assistants with Cultural Sensitivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Voice assistants (VAs) are becoming a feature of our everyday life. Yet, the user experience (UX) is often limited, leading to underuse, disengagement, and abandonment. Co-designing interactions for VAs with potential end-users can be useful. Crowdsourcing this process online and anonymously may add value. However, most work has been done in the English-speaking West on dialogue data sets. We must be sensitive to cultural differences in language, social interactions, and attitudes towards technology. Our aims were to explore the value of co-designing VAs in the non-Western context of Japan and demonstrate the necessity of cultural sensitivity. We conducted an online elicitation study (N = 135) where Americans (n = 64) and Japanese people (n = 71) imagined dialogues (N = 282) and activities (N = 73) with future VAs. We discuss the implications for coimagining interactions with future VAs, offer design guidelines for the Japanese and English-speaking US contexts, and suggest opportunities for cultural plurality in VA design and scholarship.</description>

      <title>ExpressEdit: Video Editing with Natural Language and Sketching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Informational videos serve as a crucial source for explaining conceptual and procedural knowledge to novices and experts alike. When producing informational videos, editors edit videos by overlaying text/images or trimming footage to enhance the video quality and make it more engaging. However, video editing can be difficult and time-consuming, especially for novice video editors who often struggle with expressing and implementing their editing ideas. To address this challenge, we first explored how multimodality$-$natural language (NL) and sketching, which are natural modalities humans use for expression$-$can be utilized to support video editors in expressing video editing ideas. We gathered 176 multimodal expressions of editing commands from 10 video editors, which revealed the patterns of use of NL and sketching in describing edit intents. Based on the findings, we present ExpressEdit, a system that enables editing videos via NL text and sketching on the video frame. Powered by LLM and vision models, the system interprets (1) temporal, (2) spatial, and (3) operational references in an NL command and spatial references from sketching. The system implements the interpreted edits, which then the user can iterate on. An observational study (N=10) showed that ExpressEdit enhanced the ability of novice video editors to express and implement their edit ideas. The system allowed participants to perform edits more efficiently and generate more ideas by generating edits based on user's multimodal edit commands and supporting iterations on the editing commands. This work offers insights into the design of future multimodal interfaces and AI-based pipelines for video editing.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Authoring Tools with the Explorable Authoring Requirements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Explorables with interactive, multimodal content, openly available on the web, are a promising medium for education. Yet authoring such explorables requires web development expertise, excluding most educators and students from the authoring and remixing process. Some tools are available to reduce this barrier of entry and others are in development, making a method to evaluate these new tools necessary. On the basis of the software quality model ISO 25010, empirical results, and domain modeling, we derive the Explorable Authoring Requirements (EAR) as a requirements catalogue explorable authoring tools should implement. We then outline a future research design to operationalize EAR.</description>

      <title>SciCapenter: Supporting Caption Composition for Scientific Figures with Machine-Generated Captions and Ratings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Crafting effective captions for figures is important. Readers heavily depend on these captions to grasp the figure's message. However, despite a well-developed set of AI technologies for figures and captions, these have rarely been tested for usefulness in aiding caption writing. This paper introduces SciCapenter, an interactive system that puts together cutting-edge AI technologies for scientific figure captions to aid caption composition. SciCapenter generates a variety of captions for each figure in a scholarly article, providing scores and a comprehensive checklist to assess caption quality across multiple critical aspects, such as helpfulness, OCR mention, key takeaways, and visual properties reference. Users can directly edit captions in SciCapenter, resubmit for revised evaluations, and iteratively refine them. A user study with Ph.D. students indicates that SciCapenter significantly lowers the cognitive load of caption writing. Participants' feedback further offers valuable design insights for future systems aiming to enhance caption writing.</description>

      <title>Towards Inclusive Video Commenting: Introducing Signmaku for the Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Previous research underscored the potential of danmaku--a text-based commenting feature on videos--in engaging hearing audiences. Yet, for many Deaf and hard-of-hearing (DHH) individuals, American Sign Language (ASL) takes precedence over English. To improve inclusivity, we introduce "Signmaku," a new commenting mechanism that uses ASL, serving as a sign language counterpart to danmaku. Through a need-finding study (N=12) and a within-subject experiment (N=20), we evaluated three design styles: real human faces, cartoon-like figures, and robotic representations. The results showed that cartoon-like signmaku not only entertained but also encouraged participants to create and share ASL comments, with fewer privacy concerns compared to the other designs. Conversely, the robotic representations faced challenges in accurately depicting hand movements and facial expressions, resulting in higher cognitive demands on users. Signmaku featuring real human faces elicited the lowest cognitive load and was the most comprehensible among all three types. Our findings offered novel design implications for leveraging generative AI to create signmaku comments, enriching co-learning experiences for DHH individuals.</description>

      <title>A Sociotechnical Framework For Addressing Stigma and Designing Personalized Digital Health Products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stigma, a recognized global barrier to effective disease management, impacts social interactions, resource access, and psychological well-being. In this study, we developed a patient-centered framework for deriving design requirements and interventions for health conditions subject to social stigma. This study introduces a patient-centered framework, grounded in sociotechnical systems theory, to create tailored interventions and design requirements for health conditions influenced by social stigma. We tested this framework through a mixed-method study on chronic pelvic pain patients. Our approach led to the identification of ten design requirements that encompass behavioral and psychological support and strategies for day-to-day living. The findings reveal a preference among CPP patients for priming and social support interventions. This study underscores the value of a systems-based perspective in healthcare, advocating for a nuanced, patient-centered approach that addresses the complex nature of health conditions affected by social stigma. It contributes to the ongoing discourse on integrating STS theory into healthcare frameworks, highlighting the need for targeted strategies to combat the complexities of stigma in patient care.</description>

      <title>Human Stress Response and Perceived Safety during Encounters with Quadruped Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the rise of mobile robot deployments in home and work settings, perceived safety of users and bystanders is understudied in the human-robot interaction (HRI) literature. To address this, we present a study designed to identify elements of a human-robot encounter that correlate with observed stress response. Stress is a key component of perceived safety and is strongly associated with human physiological response. In this study a Boston Dynamics Spot and a Unitree Go1 navigate autonomously through a shared environment occupied by human participants wearing multimodal physiological sensors to track their electrocardiography (ECG) and electrodermal activity (EDA). The encounters are varied through several trials and participants self-rate their stress levels after each encounter. The study resulted in a multidimensional dataset archiving various objective and subjective aspects of a human-robot encounter, containing insights for understanding perceived safety in such encounters. To this end, acute stress responses were decoded from the human participants' ECG and EDA and compared across different human-robot encounter conditions. Statistical analysis of data indicate that on average (1) participants feel more stress during encounters compared to baselines, (2) participants feel more stress encountering multiple robots compared to a single robot and (3) participants stress increases during navigation behavior compared with search behavior.</description>

      <title>Cognitively Biased Users Interacting with Algorithmically Biased Results in Whole-Session Search on Controversial Topics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17286v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When interacting with information retrieval (IR) systems, users, affected by confirmation biases, tend to select search results that confirm their existing beliefs on socially significant contentious issues. To understand the judgments and attitude changes of users searching online, our study examined how cognitively biased users interact with algorithmically biased search engine result pages (SERPs). We designed three-query search sessions on debated topics under various bias conditions. We recruited 1,321 crowdsourcing participants and explored their attitude changes, search interactions, and the effects of confirmation bias. Three key findings emerged: 1) most attitude changes occur in the initial query of a search session; 2) confirmation bias and result presentation on SERPs affect search behaviors in the current query and perceived familiarity with clicked results in subsequent queries. The bias position also affect attitude changes of users with lower perceived openness to conflicting opinions; 3) Interactions in the first query and and dwell time throughout the session are associated with users' attitude changes in different forms. Our study goes beyond traditional simulation-based evaluation settings and simulated rational users, sheds light on the mixed effects of human biases and algorithmic biases in controversial information retrieval tasks, and can inform the design of bias-aware user models, human-centered bias mitigation techniques, and socially responsible intelligent IR systems.</description>

      <title>DiffGaze: A Diffusion Model for Continuous Gaze Sequence Generation on 360{\deg} Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present DiffGaze, a novel method for generating realistic and diverse continuous human gaze sequences on 360{\deg} images based on a conditional score-based denoising diffusion model. Generating human gaze on 360{\deg} images is important for various human-computer interaction and computer graphics applications, e.g. for creating large-scale eye tracking datasets or for realistic animation of virtual humans. However, existing methods are limited to predicting discrete fixation sequences or aggregated saliency maps, thereby neglecting crucial parts of natural gaze behaviour. Our method uses features extracted from 360{\deg} images as condition and uses two transformers to model the temporal and spatial dependencies of continuous human gaze. We evaluate DiffGaze on two 360{\deg} image benchmarks for gaze sequence generation as well as scanpath prediction and saliency prediction. Our evaluations show that DiffGaze outperforms state-of-the-art methods on all tasks on both benchmarks. We also report a 21-participant user study showing that our method generates gaze sequences that are indistinguishable from real human sequences.</description>

      <title>Panonut360: A Head and Eye Tracking Dataset for Panoramic Video</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17708</link>

Abstract: With the rapid development and widespread application of VR/AR technology, maximizing the quality of immersive panoramic video services that match users' personal preferences and habits has become a long-standing challenge. Understanding the saliency region where users focus, based on data collected with HMDs, can promote multimedia encoding, transmission, and quality assessment. At the same time, large-scale datasets are essential for researchers and developers to explore short/long-term user behavior patterns and train AI models related to panoramic videos. However, existing panoramic video datasets often include low-frequency user head or eye movement data through short-term videos only, lacking sufficient data for analyzing users' Field of View (FoV) and generating video saliency regions.
  Driven by these practical factors, in this paper, we present a head and eye tracking dataset involving 50 users (25 males and 25 females) watching 15 panoramic videos. The dataset provides details on the viewport and gaze attention locations of users. Besides, we present some statistics samples extracted from the dataset. For example, the deviation between head and eye movements challenges the widely held assumption that gaze attention decreases from the center of the FoV following a Gaussian distribution. Our analysis reveals a consistent downward offset in gaze fixations relative to the FoV in experimental settings involving multiple users and videos. That's why we name the dataset Panonut, a saliency weighting shaped like a donut. Finally, we also provide a script that generates saliency distributions based on given head or eye coordinates and pre-generated saliency distribution map sets of each video from the collected eye tracking data.
  The dataset is available on website: https://dianvrlab.github.io/Panonut360/.</description>

      <title>FastPerson: Enhancing Video Learning through Effective Video Summarization that Preserves Linguistic and Visual Contexts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quickly understanding lengthy lecture videos is essential for learners with limited time and interest in various topics to improve their learning efficiency. To this end, video summarization has been actively researched to enable users to view only important scenes from a video. However, these studies focus on either the visual or audio information of a video and extract important segments in the video. Therefore, there is a risk of missing important information when both the teacher's speech and visual information on the blackboard or slides are important, such as in a lecture video. To tackle this issue, we propose FastPerson, a video summarization approach that considers both the visual and auditory information in lecture videos. FastPerson creates summary videos by utilizing audio transcriptions along with on-screen images and text, minimizing the risk of overlooking crucial information for learners. Further, it provides a feature that allows learners to switch between the summary and original videos for each chapter of the video, enabling them to adjust the pace of learning based on their interests and level of understanding. We conducted an evaluation with 40 participants to assess the effectiveness of our method and confirmed that it reduced viewing time by 53\% at the same level of comprehension as that when using traditional video playback methods.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Boundaries of Ambient Awareness in Twitter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ambient awareness refers to the ability of social media users to obtain knowledge about who knows what (i.e., users' expertise) in their network, by simply being exposed to other users' content (e.g, tweets on Twitter). Previous work, based on user surveys, reveals that individuals self-report ambient awareness only for parts of their networks. However, it is unclear whether it is their limited cognitive capacity or the limited exposure to diagnostic tweets (i.e., online content) that prevents people from developing ambient awareness for their complete network. In this work, we focus on in-wall ambient awareness (IWAA) in Twitter and conduct a two-step data-driven analysis, that allows us to explore to which extent IWAA is likely, or even possible. First, we rely on reactions (e.g., likes), as strong evidence of users being aware of experts in Twitter. Unfortunately, such strong evidence can be only measured for active users, which represent the minority in the network. Thus to study the boundaries of IWAA to a larger extent, in the second part of our analysis, we instead focus on the passive exposure to content generated by other users -- which we refer to as in-wall visibility. This analysis shows that (in line with \citet{levordashka2016ambient}) only for a subset of users IWAA is plausible, while for the majority it is unlikely, if even possible, to develop IWAA. We hope that our methodology paves the way for the emergence of data-driven approaches for the study of ambient awareness.</description>

      <title>From Words and Exercises to Wellness: Farsi Chatbot for Self-Attachment Technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.09362v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the wake of the post-pandemic era, marked by social isolation and surging rates of depression and anxiety, conversational agents based on digital psychotherapy can play an influential role compared to traditional therapy sessions. In this work, we develop a voice-capable chatbot in Farsi to guide users through Self-Attachment (SAT), a novel, self-administered, holistic psychological technique based on attachment theory. Our chatbot uses a dynamic array of rule-based and classification-based modules to comprehend user input throughout the conversation and navigates a dialogue flowchart accordingly, recommending appropriate SAT exercises that depend on the user's emotional and mental state. In particular, we collect a dataset of over 6,000 utterances and develop a novel sentiment-analysis module that classifies user sentiment into 12 classes, with accuracy above 92%. To keep the conversation novel and engaging, the chatbot's responses are retrieved from a large dataset of utterances created with the aid of Farsi GPT-2 and a reinforcement learning approach, thus requiring minimal human annotation. Our chatbot also offers a question-answering module, called SAT Teacher, to answer users' questions about the principles of Self-Attachment. Finally, we design a cross-platform application as the bot's user interface. We evaluate our platform in a ten-day human study with N=52 volunteers from the non-clinical population, who have had over 2,000 dialogues in total with the chatbot. The results indicate that the platform was engaging to most users (75%), 72% felt better after the interactions, and 74% were satisfied with the SAT Teacher's performance.</description>

      <title>A Critical Reflection on the Use of Toxicity Detection Algorithms in Proactive Content Moderation Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10629v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Toxicity detection algorithms, originally designed with reactive content moderation in mind, are increasingly being deployed into proactive end-user interventions to moderate content. Through a socio-technical lens and focusing on contexts in which they are applied, we explore the use of these algorithms in proactive moderation systems. Placing a toxicity detection algorithm in an imagined virtual mobile keyboard, we critically explore how such algorithms could be used to proactively reduce the sending of toxic content. We present findings from design workshops conducted with four distinct stakeholder groups and find concerns around how contextual complexities may exasperate inequalities around content moderation processes. Whilst only specific user groups are likely to directly benefit from these interventions, we highlight the potential for other groups to misuse them to circumvent detection, validate and gamify hate, and manipulate algorithmic models to exasperate harm.</description>

      <title>Towards Massive Interaction with Generalist Robotics: A Systematic Review of XR-enabled Remote Human-Robot Interaction Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11384v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rising interest of generalist robots seek to create robots with versatility to handle multiple tasks in a variety of environments, and human will interact with such robots through immersive interfaces. In the context of human-robot interaction (HRI), this survey provides an exhaustive review of the applications of extended reality (XR) technologies in the field of remote HRI. We developed a systematic search strategy based on the PRISMA methodology. From the initial 2,561 articles selected, 100 research papers that met our inclusion criteria were included. We categorized and summarized the domain in detail, delving into XR technologies, including augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), and mixed reality (MR), and their applications in facilitating intuitive and effective remote control and interaction with robotic systems. The survey highlights existing articles on the application of XR technologies, user experience enhancement, and various interaction designs for XR in remote HRI, providing insights into current trends and future directions. We also identified potential gaps and opportunities for future research to improve remote HRI systems through XR technology to guide and inform future XR and robotics research.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14117v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In our era of rapid technological advancement, the research landscape for writing assistants has become increasingly fragmented across various research communities. We seek to address this challenge by proposing a design space as a structured way to examine and explore the multidimensional space of intelligent and interactive writing assistants. Through a large community collaboration, we explore five aspects of writing assistants: task, user, technology, interaction, and ecosystem. Within each aspect, we define dimensions (i.e., fundamental components of an aspect) and codes (i.e., potential options for each dimension) by systematically reviewing 115 papers. Our design space aims to offer researchers and designers a practical tool to navigate, comprehend, and compare the various possibilities of writing assistants, and aid in the envisioning and design of new writing assistants.</description>

      <title>As Good As A Coin Toss: Human detection of AI-generated images, videos, audio, and audiovisual stimuli</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16760v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As synthetic media becomes progressively more realistic and barriers to using it continue to lower, the technology has been increasingly utilized for malicious purposes, from financial fraud to nonconsensual pornography. Today, the principal defense against being misled by synthetic media relies on the ability of the human observer to visually and auditorily discern between real and fake. However, it remains unclear just how vulnerable people actually are to deceptive synthetic media in the course of their day to day lives. We conducted a perceptual study with 1276 participants to assess how accurate people were at distinguishing synthetic images, audio only, video only, and audiovisual stimuli from authentic. To reflect the circumstances under which people would likely encounter synthetic media in the wild, testing conditions and stimuli emulated a typical online platform, while all synthetic media used in the survey was sourced from publicly accessible generative AI technology.
  We find that overall, participants struggled to meaningfully discern between synthetic and authentic content. We also find that detection performance worsens when the stimuli contains synthetic content as compared to authentic content, images featuring human faces as compared to non face objects, a single modality as compared to multimodal stimuli, mixed authenticity as compared to being fully synthetic for audiovisual stimuli, and features foreign languages as compared to languages the observer is fluent in. Finally, we also find that prior knowledge of synthetic media does not meaningfully impact their detection performance. Collectively, these results indicate that people are highly susceptible to being tricked by synthetic media in their daily lives and that human perceptual detection capabilities can no longer be relied upon as an effective counterdefense.</description>

      <title>Data journeys in popular science: Producing climate change and COVID-19 data visualizations at Scientific American</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.18011v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vast amounts of (open) data are increasingly used to make arguments about crisis topics such as climate change and global pandemics. Data visualizations are central to bringing these viewpoints to broader publics. However, visualizations often conceal the many contexts involved in their production, ranging from decisions made in research labs about collecting and sharing data to choices made in editorial rooms about which data stories to tell. In this paper, we examine how data visualizations about climate change and COVID-19 are produced in popular science magazines, using Scientific American, an established English-language popular science magazine, as a case study. To do this, we apply the analytical concept of data journeys (Leonelli, 2020) in a mixed methods study that centers on interviews with Scientific American staff and is supplemented by a visualization analysis of selected charts. In particular, we discuss the affordances of working with open data, the role of collaborative data practices, and how the magazine works to counter misinformation and increase transparency. This work provides an empirical contribution by providing insight into the data (visualization) practices of science communicators and demonstrating how the concept of data journeys can be used as an analytical framework.</description>

      <title>Learning User Embeddings from Human Gaze for Personalised Saliency Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13653v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reusable embeddings of user behaviour have shown significant performance improvements for the personalised saliency prediction task. However, prior works require explicit user characteristics and preferences as input, which are often difficult to obtain. We present a novel method to extract user embeddings from pairs of natural images and corresponding saliency maps generated from a small amount of user-specific eye tracking data. At the core of our method is a Siamese convolutional neural encoder that learns the user embeddings by contrasting the image and personal saliency map pairs of different users. Evaluations on two public saliency datasets show that the generated embeddings have high discriminative power, are effective at refining universal saliency maps to the individual users, and generalise well across users and images. Finally, based on our model's ability to encode individual user characteristics, our work points towards other applications that can benefit from reusable embeddings of gaze behaviour.</description>
