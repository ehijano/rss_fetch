      <title>Bayesian calibration of stochastic agent based model via random forest</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Agent-based models (ABM) provide an excellent framework for modeling outbreaks and interventions in epidemiology by explicitly accounting for diverse individual interactions and environments. However, these models are usually stochastic and highly parametrized, requiring precise calibration for predictive performance. When considering realistic numbers of agents and properly accounting for stochasticity, this high dimensional calibration can be computationally prohibitive. This paper presents a random forest based surrogate modeling technique to accelerate the evaluation of ABMs and demonstrates its use to calibrate an epidemiological ABM named CityCOVID via Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). The technique is first outlined in the context of CityCOVID's quantities of interest, namely hospitalizations and deaths, by exploring dimensionality reduction via temporal decomposition with principal component analysis (PCA) and via sensitivity analysis. The calibration problem is then presented and samples are generated to best match COVID-19 hospitalization and death numbers in Chicago from March to June in 2020. These results are compared with previous approximate Bayesian calibration (IMABC) results and their predictive performance is analyzed showing improved performance with a reduction in computation.</description>

      <title>Forward and Backward State Abstractions for Off-policy Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Off-policy evaluation (OPE) is crucial for evaluating a target policy's impact offline before its deployment. However, achieving accurate OPE in large state spaces remains challenging.This paper studies state abstractions-originally designed for policy learning-in the context of OPE. Our contributions are three-fold: (i) We define a set of irrelevance conditions central to learning state abstractions for OPE. (ii) We derive sufficient conditions for achieving irrelevance in Q-functions and marginalized importance sampling ratios, the latter obtained by constructing a time-reversed Markov decision process (MDP) based on the observed MDP. (iii) We propose a novel two-step procedure that sequentially projects the original state space into a smaller space, which substantially simplify the sample complexity of OPE arising from high cardinality.</description>

      <title>ScoreFusion: fusing score-based generative models via Kullback-Leibler barycenters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of fusing pre-trained (auxiliary) generative models to enhance the training of a target generative model. We propose using KL-divergence weighted barycenters as an optimal fusion mechanism, in which the barycenter weights are optimally trained to minimize a suitable loss for the target population. While computing the optimal KL-barycenter weights can be challenging, we demonstrate that this process can be efficiently executed using diffusion score training when the auxiliary generative models are also trained based on diffusion score methods. Moreover, we show that our fusion method has a dimension-free sample complexity in total variation distance provided that the auxiliary models are well fitted for their own task and the auxiliary tasks combined capture the target well. The main takeaway of our method is that if the auxiliary models are well-trained and can borrow features from each other that are present in the target, our fusion method significantly improves the training of generative models. We provide a concise computational implementation of the fusion algorithm, and validate its efficiency in the low-data regime with numerical experiments involving mixtures models and image datasets.</description>

      <title>Kolmogorov-Smirnov GAN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel deep generative model, the Kolmogorov-Smirnov Generative Adversarial Network (KSGAN). Unlike existing approaches, KSGAN formulates the learning process as a minimization of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) distance, generalized to handle multivariate distributions. This distance is calculated using the quantile function, which acts as the critic in the adversarial training process. We formally demonstrate that minimizing the KS distance leads to the trained approximate distribution aligning with the target distribution. We propose an efficient implementation and evaluate its effectiveness through experiments. The results show that KSGAN performs on par with existing adversarial methods, exhibiting stability during training, resistance to mode dropping and collapse, and tolerance to variations in hyperparameter settings. Additionally, we review the literature on the Generalized KS test and discuss the connections between KSGAN and existing adversarial generative models.</description>

      <title>The Computational Curse of Big Data for Bayesian Additive Regression Trees: A Hitting Time Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART) is a popular Bayesian non-parametric regression model that is commonly used in causal inference and beyond. Its strong predictive performance is supported by theoretical guarantees that its posterior distribution concentrates around the true regression function at optimal rates under various data generative settings and for appropriate prior choices. In this paper, we show that the BART sampler often converges slowly, confirming empirical observations by other researchers. Assuming discrete covariates, we show that, while the BART posterior concentrates on a set comprising all optimal tree structures (smallest bias and complexity), the Markov chain's hitting time for this set increases with $n$ (training sample size), under several common data generative settings. As $n$ increases, the approximate BART posterior thus becomes increasingly different from the exact posterior (for the same number of MCMC samples), contrasting with earlier concentration results on the exact posterior. This contrast is highlighted by our simulations showing worsening frequentist undercoverage for approximate posterior intervals and a growing ratio between the MSE of the approximate posterior and that obtainable by artificially improving convergence via averaging multiple sampler chains. Finally, based on our theoretical insights, possibilities are discussed to improve the BART sampler convergence performance.</description>

      <title>Modelling financial volume curves with hierarchical Poisson processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modeling the trading volume curves of financial instruments throughout the day is of key interest in financial trading applications. Predictions of these so-called volume profiles guide trade execution strategies, for example, a common strategy is to trade a desired quantity across many orders in line with the expected volume curve throughout the day so as not to impact the price of the instrument. The volume curves (for each day) are naturally grouped by stock and can be further gathered into higher-level groupings, such as by industry. In order to model such admixtures of volume curves, we introduce a hierarchical Poisson process model for the intensity functions of admixtures of inhomogenous Poisson processes, which represent the trading times of the stock throughout the day. The model is based on the hierarchical Dirichlet process, and an efficient Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm is derived following the slice sampling framework for Bayesian nonparametric mixture models. We demonstrate the method on datasets of different stocks from the Trade and Quote repository maintained by Wharton Research Data Services, including the most liquid stock on the NASDAQ stock exchange, Apple, demonstrating the scalability of the approach.</description>

      <title>Stock Volume Forecasting with Advanced Information by Conditional Variational Auto-Encoder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19414v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate the use of Conditional Variational Encoder (CVAE) to improve the forecasts of daily stock volume time series in both short and long term forecasting tasks, with the use of advanced information of input variables such as rebalancing dates. CVAE generates non-linear time series as out-of-sample forecasts, which have better accuracy and closer fit of correlation to the actual data, compared to traditional linear models. These generative forecasts can also be used for scenario generation, which aids interpretation. We further discuss correlations in non-stationary time series and other potential extensions from the CVAE forecasts.</description>

      <title>Improving Finite Sample Performance of Causal Discovery by Exploiting Temporal Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19503v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Methods of causal discovery aim to identify causal structures in a data driven way. Existing algorithms are known to be unstable and sensitive to statistical errors, and are therefore rarely used with biomedical or epidemiological data. We present an algorithm that efficiently exploits temporal structure, so-called tiered background knowledge, for estimating causal structures. Tiered background knowledge is readily available from, e.g., cohort or registry data. When used efficiently it renders the algorithm more robust to statistical errors and ultimately increases accuracy in finite samples. We describe the algorithm and illustrate how it proceeds. Moreover, we offer formal proofs as well as examples of desirable properties of the algorithm, which we demonstrate empirically in an extensive simulation study. To illustrate its usefulness in practice, we apply the algorithm to data from a children's cohort study investigating the interplay of diet, physical activity and other lifestyle factors for health outcomes.</description>

      <title>Instance-Optimal Private Density Estimation in the Wasserstein Distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Estimating the density of a distribution from samples is a fundamental problem in statistics. In many practical settings, the Wasserstein distance is an appropriate error metric for density estimation. For example, when estimating population densities in a geographic region, a small Wasserstein distance means that the estimate is able to capture roughly where the population mass is. In this work we study differentially private density estimation in the Wasserstein distance. We design and analyze instance-optimal algorithms for this problem that can adapt to easy instances.
  For distributions $P$ over $\mathbb{R}$, we consider a strong notion of instance-optimality: an algorithm that uniformly achieves the instance-optimal estimation rate is competitive with an algorithm that is told that the distribution is either $P$ or $Q_P$ for some distribution $Q_P$ whose probability density function (pdf) is within a factor of 2 of the pdf of $P$. For distributions over $\mathbb{R}^2$, we use a different notion of instance optimality. We say that an algorithm is instance-optimal if it is competitive with an algorithm that is given a constant-factor multiplicative approximation of the density of the distribution. We characterize the instance-optimal estimation rates in both these settings and show that they are uniformly achievable (up to polylogarithmic factors). Our approach for $\mathbb{R}^2$ extends to arbitrary metric spaces as it goes via hierarchically separated trees. As a special case our results lead to instance-optimal private learning in TV distance for discrete distributions.</description>

      <title>Filtration learning in exact multi-parameter persistent homology and classification of time-series data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To analyze the topological properties of the given discrete data, one needs to consider a continuous transform called filtration. Persistent homology serves as a tool to track changes of homology in the filtration. The outcome of the topological analysis of data varies depending on the choice of filtration, making the selection of filtration crucial. Filtration learning is an attempt to find an optimal filtration that minimizes the loss function. Exact Multi-parameter Persistent Homology (EMPH) has been recently proposed, particularly for topological time-series analysis, that utilizes the exact formula of rank invariant instead of calculating it. In this paper, we propose a framework for filtration learning of EMPH. We formulate an optimization problem and propose an algorithm for solving the problem. We then apply the proposed algorithm to several classification problems. Particularly, we derive the exact formula of the gradient of the loss function with respect to the filtration parameter, which makes it possible to directly update the filtration without using automatic differentiation, significantly enhancing the learning process.</description>

      <title>Exact Bayesian Gaussian Cox Processes Using Random Integral</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19722v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A Gaussian Cox process is a popular model for point process data, in which the intensity function is a transformation of a Gaussian process. Posterior inference of this intensity function involves an intractable integral (i.e., the cumulative intensity function) in the likelihood resulting in doubly intractable posterior distribution. Here, we propose a nonparametric Bayesian approach for estimating the intensity function of an inhomogeneous Poisson process without reliance on large data augmentation or approximations of the likelihood function. We propose to jointly model the intensity and the cumulative intensity function as a transformed Gaussian process, allowing us to directly bypass the need of approximating the cumulative intensity function in the likelihood. We propose an exact MCMC sampler for posterior inference and evaluate its performance on simulated data. We demonstrate the utility of our method in three real-world scenarios including temporal and spatial event data, as well as aggregated time count data collected at multiple resolutions. Finally, we discuss extensions of our proposed method to other point processes.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Externalities while Learning: an Online Version of the Coase Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19824v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In economic theory, the concept of externality refers to any indirect effect resulting from an interaction between players that affects the social welfare. Most of the models within which externality has been studied assume that agents have perfect knowledge of their environment and preferences. This is a major hindrance to the practical implementation of many proposed solutions. To address this issue, we consider a two-player bandit setting where the actions of one of the players affect the other player and we extend the Coase theorem [Coase, 1960]. This result shows that the optimal approach for maximizing the social welfare in the presence of externality is to establish property rights, i.e., enable transfers and bargaining between the players. Our work removes the classical assumption that bargainers possess perfect knowledge of the underlying game. We first demonstrate that in the absence of property rights, the social welfare breaks down. We then design a policy for the players which allows them to learn a bargaining strategy which maximizes the total welfare, recovering the Coase theorem under uncertainty.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19861v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Policy Mirror Descent (PMD) is a powerful and theoretically sound methodology for sequential decision-making. However, it is not directly applicable to Reinforcement Learning (RL) due to the inaccessibility of explicit action-value functions. We address this challenge by introducing a novel approach based on learning a world model of the environment using conditional mean embeddings. We then leverage the operatorial formulation of RL to express the action-value function in terms of this quantity in closed form via matrix operations. Combining these estimators with PMD leads to POWR, a new RL algorithm for which we prove convergence rates to the global optimum. Preliminary experiments in finite and infinite state settings support the effectiveness of our method.</description>

      <title>FI-CBL: A Probabilistic Method for Concept-Based Learning with Expert Rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A method for solving concept-based learning (CBL) problem is proposed. The main idea behind the method is to divide each concept-annotated image into patches, to transform the patches into embeddings by using an autoencoder, and to cluster the embeddings assuming that each cluster will mainly contain embeddings of patches with certain concepts. To find concepts of a new image, the method implements the frequentist inference by computing prior and posterior probabilities of concepts based on rates of patches from images with certain values of the concepts. Therefore, the proposed method is called the Frequentist Inference CBL (FI-CBL). FI-CBL allows us to incorporate the expert rules in the form of logic functions into the inference procedure. An idea behind the incorporation is to update prior and conditional probabilities of concepts to satisfy the rules. The method is transparent because it has an explicit sequence of probabilistic calculations and a clear frequency interpretation. Numerical experiments show that FI-CBL outperforms the concept bottleneck model in cases when the number of training data is small. The code of proposed algorithms is publicly available.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning of Multivariate Extremes via a Geometric Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of geometric extremes, where extremal dependence properties are inferred from the deterministic limiting shapes of scaled sample clouds, provides an exciting approach to modelling the extremes of multivariate data. These shapes, termed limit sets, link together several popular extremal dependence modelling frameworks. Although the geometric approach is becoming an increasingly popular modelling tool, current inference techniques are limited to a low dimensional setting (d &lt; 4), and generally require rigid modelling assumptions. In this work, we propose a range of novel theoretical results to aid with the implementation of the geometric extremes framework and introduce the first approach to modelling limit sets using deep learning. By leveraging neural networks, we construct asymptotically-justified yet flexible semi-parametric models for extremal dependence of high-dimensional data. We showcase the efficacy of our deep approach by modelling the complex extremal dependencies between meteorological and oceanographic variables in the North Sea off the coast of the UK.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.20044v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new particle-based sampling and approximate inference method, based on electrostatics and Newton mechanics principles, is introduced with theoretical ground, algorithm design and experimental validation. This method simulates an interacting particle system (IPS) where particles, i.e. the freely-moving negative charges and spatially-fixed positive charges with magnitudes proportional to the target distribution, interact with each other via attraction and repulsion induced by the resulting electric fields described by Poisson's equation. The IPS evolves towards a steady-state where the distribution of negative charges conforms to the target distribution. This physics-inspired method offers deterministic, gradient-free sampling and inference, achieving comparable performance as other particle-based and MCMC methods in benchmark tasks of inferring complex densities, Bayesian logistic regression and dynamical system identification. A discrete-time, discrete-space algorithmic design, readily extendable to continuous time and space, is provided for usage in more general inference problems occurring in probabilistic machine learning scenarios such as Bayesian inference, generative modelling, and beyond.</description>

      <title>Cost-aware Bayesian optimization via the Pandora's Box Gittins index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.20062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.20062v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bayesian optimization is a technique for efficiently optimizing unknown functions in a black-box manner. To handle practical settings where gathering data requires use of finite resources, it is desirable to explicitly incorporate function evaluation costs into Bayesian optimization policies. To understand how to do so, we develop a previously-unexplored connection between cost-aware Bayesian optimization and the Pandora's Box problem, a decision problem from economics. The Pandora's Box problem admits a Bayesian-optimal solution based on an expression called the Gittins index, which can be reinterpreted as an acquisition function. We study the use of this acquisition function for cost-aware Bayesian optimization, and demonstrate empirically that it performs well, particularly in medium-high dimensions. We further show that this performance carries over to classical Bayesian optimization without explicit evaluation costs. Our work constitutes a first step towards integrating techniques from Gittins index theory into Bayesian optimization.</description>

      <title>Minimax And Adaptive Transfer Learning for Nonparametric Classification under Distributed Differential Privacy Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.20088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.20088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper considers minimax and adaptive transfer learning for nonparametric classification under the posterior drift model with distributed differential privacy constraints. Our study is conducted within a heterogeneous framework, encompassing diverse sample sizes, varying privacy parameters, and data heterogeneity across different servers. We first establish the minimax misclassification rate, precisely characterizing the effects of privacy constraints, source samples, and target samples on classification accuracy. The results reveal interesting phase transition phenomena and highlight the intricate trade-offs between preserving privacy and achieving classification accuracy. We then develop a data-driven adaptive classifier that achieves the optimal rate within a logarithmic factor across a large collection of parameter spaces while satisfying the same set of differential privacy constraints. Simulation studies and real-world data applications further elucidate the theoretical analysis with numerical results.</description>

      <title>Optimal Rate of Kernel Regression in Large Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.04268v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform a study on kernel regression for large-dimensional data (where the sample size $n$ is polynomially depending on the dimension $d$ of the samples, i.e., $n\asymp d^{\gamma}$ for some $\gamma &gt;0$ ). We first build a general tool to characterize the upper bound and the minimax lower bound of kernel regression for large dimensional data through the Mendelson complexity $\varepsilon_{n}^{2}$ and the metric entropy $\bar{\varepsilon}_{n}^{2}$ respectively. When the target function falls into the RKHS associated with a (general) inner product model defined on $\mathbb{S}^{d}$, we utilize the new tool to show that the minimax rate of the excess risk of kernel regression is $n^{-1/2}$ when $n\asymp d^{\gamma}$ for $\gamma =2, 4, 6, 8, \cdots$. We then further determine the optimal rate of the excess risk of kernel regression for all the $\gamma&gt;0$ and find that the curve of optimal rate varying along $\gamma$ exhibits several new phenomena including the multiple descent behavior and the periodic plateau behavior. As an application, For the neural tangent kernel (NTK), we also provide a similar explicit description of the curve of optimal rate. As a direct corollary, we know these claims hold for wide neural networks as well.</description>

      <title>Nearest Neighbor Sampling for Covariate Shift Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.09969v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many existing covariate shift adaptation methods estimate sample weights given to loss values to mitigate the gap between the source and the target distribution. However, estimating the optimal weights typically involves computationally expensive matrix inversion and hyper-parameter tuning. In this paper, we propose a new covariate shift adaptation method which avoids estimating the weights. The basic idea is to directly work on unlabeled target data, labeled according to the $k$-nearest neighbors in the source dataset. Our analysis reveals that setting $k = 1$ is an optimal choice. This property removes the necessity of tuning the only hyper-parameter $k$ and leads to a running time quasi-linear in the sample size. Our results include sharp rates of convergence for our estimator, with a tight control of the mean square error and explicit constants. In particular, the variance of our estimators has the same rate of convergence as for standard parametric estimation despite their non-parametric nature. The proposed estimator shares similarities with some matching-based treatment effect estimators used, e.g., in biostatistics, econometrics, and epidemiology. Our experiments show that it achieves drastic reduction in the running time with remarkable accuracy.</description>

      <title>Submodular Information Selection for Hypothesis Testing with Misclassification Penalties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10930v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of selecting an optimal subset of information sources for a hypothesis testing/classification task where the goal is to identify the true state of the world from a finite set of hypotheses, based on finite observation samples from the sources. In order to characterize the learning performance, we propose a misclassification penalty framework, which enables nonuniform treatment of different misclassification errors. In a centralized Bayesian learning setting, we study two variants of the subset selection problem: (i) selecting a minimum cost information set to ensure that the maximum penalty of misclassifying the true hypothesis is below a desired bound and (ii) selecting an optimal information set under a limited budget to minimize the maximum penalty of misclassifying the true hypothesis. Under certain assumptions, we prove that the objective (or constraints) of these combinatorial optimization problems are weak (or approximate) submodular, and establish high-probability performance guarantees for greedy algorithms. Further, we propose an alternate metric for information set selection which is based on the total penalty of misclassification. We prove that this metric is submodular and establish near-optimal guarantees for the greedy algorithms for both the information set selection problems. Finally, we present numerical simulations to validate our theoretical results over several randomly generated instances.</description>

Abstract: Employing Large Language Models (LLMs) to address mathematical problems is an intriguing research endeavor, considering the abundance of math problems expressed in natural language across numerous science and engineering fields. LLMs, with their generalized ability, are used as a foundation model to build AI agents for different tasks. In this paper, we study the effectiveness of utilizing LLM agents to solve math problems through conversations. We propose MathChat, a conversational problem-solving framework designed for math problems. MathChat consists of an LLM agent and a user proxy agent which is responsible for tool execution and additional guidance. This synergy facilitates a collaborative problem-solving process, where the agents engage in a dialogue to solve the problems. We perform evaluation on difficult high school competition problems from the MATH dataset. Utilizing Python, we show that MathChat can further improve previous tool-using prompting methods by 6%.</description>

      <title>MALIBO: Meta-learning for Likelihood-free Bayesian Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.03565v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bayesian optimization (BO) is a popular method to optimize costly black-box functions. While traditional BO optimizes each new target task from scratch, meta-learning has emerged as a way to leverage knowledge from related tasks to optimize new tasks faster. However, existing meta-learning BO methods rely on surrogate models that suffer from scalability issues and are sensitive to observations with different scales and noise types across tasks. Moreover, they often overlook the uncertainty associated with task similarity. This leads to unreliable task adaptation when only limited observations are obtained or when the new tasks differ significantly from the related tasks. To address these limitations, we propose a novel meta-learning BO approach that bypasses the surrogate model and directly learns the utility of queries across tasks. Our method explicitly models task uncertainty and includes an auxiliary model to enable robust adaptation to new tasks. Extensive experiments show that our method demonstrates strong anytime performance and outperforms state-of-the-art meta-learning BO methods in various benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Fishnets: Information-Optimal, Scalable Aggregation for Sets and Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.03812v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Set-based learning is an essential component of modern deep learning and network science. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and their edge-free counterparts Deepsets have proven remarkably useful on ragged and topologically challenging datasets. The key to learning informative embeddings for set members is a specified aggregation function, usually a sum, max, or mean. We propose Fishnets, an aggregation strategy for learning information-optimal embeddings for sets of data for both Bayesian inference and graph aggregation. We demonstrate that i) Fishnets neural summaries can be scaled optimally to an arbitrary number of data objects, ii) Fishnets aggregations are robust to changes in data distribution, unlike standard deepsets, iii) Fishnets saturate Bayesian information content and extend to regimes where MCMC techniques fail and iv) Fishnets can be used as a drop-in aggregation scheme within GNNs. We show that by adopting a Fishnets aggregation scheme for message passing, GNNs can achieve state-of-the-art performance versus architecture size on ogbn-protein data over existing benchmarks with a fraction of learnable parameters and faster training time.</description>

      <title>Learning Stackable and Skippable LEGO Bricks for Efficient, Reconfigurable, and Variable-Resolution Diffusion Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.06389v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models excel at generating photo-realistic images but come with significant computational costs in both training and sampling. While various techniques address these computational challenges, a less-explored issue is designing an efficient and adaptable network backbone for iterative refinement. Current options like U-Net and Vision Transformer often rely on resource-intensive deep networks and lack the flexibility needed for generating images at variable resolutions or with a smaller network than used in training. This study introduces LEGO bricks, which seamlessly integrate Local-feature Enrichment and Global-content Orchestration. These bricks can be stacked to create a test-time reconfigurable diffusion backbone, allowing selective skipping of bricks to reduce sampling costs and generate higher-resolution images than the training data. LEGO bricks enrich local regions with an MLP and transform them using a Transformer block while maintaining a consistent full-resolution image across all bricks. Experimental results demonstrate that LEGO bricks enhance training efficiency, expedite convergence, and facilitate variable-resolution image generation while maintaining strong generative performance. Moreover, LEGO significantly reduces sampling time compared to other methods, establishing it as a valuable enhancement for diffusion models.

      <title>Scaling laws for learning with real and surrogate data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04376v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Collecting large quantities of high-quality data can be prohibitively expensive or impractical, and a bottleneck in machine learning. One may instead augment a small set of $n$ data points from the target distribution with data from more accessible sources, e.g. data collected under different circumstances or synthesized by generative models. We refer to such data as `surrogate data.' We introduce a weighted empirical risk minimization (ERM) approach for integrating surrogate data into training. We analyze mathematically this method under several classical statistical models, and validate our findings empirically on datasets from different domains. Our main findings are: $(i)$ Integrating surrogate data can significantly reduce the test error on the original distribution. Surprisingly, this can happen even when the surrogate data is unrelated to the original ones. We trace back this behavior to the classical Stein's paradox. $(ii)$ In order to reap the benefit of surrogate data, it is crucial to use optimally weighted ERM. $(iii)$ The test error of models trained on mixtures of real and surrogate data is approximately described by a scaling law. This scaling law can be used to predict the optimal weighting scheme, and to choose the amount of surrogate data to add.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.05758v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Longitudinal data are important in numerous fields, such as healthcare, sociology and seismology, but real-world datasets present notable challenges for practitioners because they can be high-dimensional, contain structured missingness patterns, and measurement time points can be governed by an unknown stochastic process. While various solutions have been suggested, the majority of them have been designed to account for only one of these challenges. In this work, we propose a flexible and efficient latent-variable model that is capable of addressing all these limitations. Our approach utilizes Gaussian processes to capture temporal correlations between samples and their associated missingness masks as well as to model the underlying point process. We construct our model as a variational autoencoder together with deep neural network parameterised encoder and decoder models, and develop a scalable amortised variational inference approach for efficient model training. We demonstrate competitive performance using both simulated and real datasets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03913v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Biomanufacturing innovation relies on an efficient Design of Experiments (DoEs) to optimize processes and product quality. Traditional DoE methods, ignoring the underlying bioprocessing mechanisms, often suffer from a lack of interpretability and sample efficiency. This limitation motivates us to create a new optimal learning approach for digital twin model calibration. In this study, we consider the cell culture process multi-scale mechanistic model, also known as Biological System-of-Systems (Bio-SoS). This model with a modular design, composed of sub-models, allows us to integrate data across various production processes. To calibrate the Bio-SoS digital twin, we evaluate the mean squared error of model prediction and develop a computational approach to quantify the impact of parameter estimation error of individual sub-models on the prediction accuracy of digital twin, which can guide sample-efficient and interpretable DoEs.</description>

      <title>Learning Decision Policies with Instrumental Variables through Double Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08498v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A common issue in learning decision-making policies in data-rich settings is spurious correlations in the offline dataset, which can be caused by hidden confounders. Instrumental variable (IV) regression, which utilises a key unconfounded variable known as the instrument, is a standard technique for learning causal relationships between confounded action, outcome, and context variables. Most recent IV regression algorithms use a two-stage approach, where a deep neural network (DNN) estimator learnt in the first stage is directly plugged into the second stage, in which another DNN is used to estimate the causal effect. Naively plugging the estimator can cause heavy bias in the second stage, especially when regularisation bias is present in the first stage estimator. We propose DML-IV, a non-linear IV regression method that reduces the bias in two-stage IV regressions and effectively learns high-performing policies. We derive a novel learning objective to reduce bias and design the DML-IV algorithm following the double/debiased machine learning (DML) framework. The learnt DML-IV estimator has strong convergence rate and $O(N^{-1/2})$ suboptimality guarantees that match those when the dataset is unconfounded. DML-IV outperforms state-of-the-art IV regression methods on IV regression benchmarks and learns high-performing policies in the presence of instruments.</description>

      <title>Kernel vs. Kernel: Exploring How the Data Structure Affects Neural Collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02105v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, a vast amount of literature has focused on the "Neural Collapse" (NC) phenomenon, which emerges when training neural network (NN) classifiers beyond the zero training error point. The core component of NC is the decrease in the within class variability of the network's deepest features, dubbed as NC1. The theoretical works that study NC are typically based on simplified unconstrained features models (UFMs) that mask any effect of the data on the extent of collapse. In this paper, we provide a kernel-based analysis that does not suffer from this limitation. First, given a kernel function, we establish expressions for the traces of the within- and between-class covariance matrices of the samples' features (and consequently an NC1 metric). Then, we turn to focus on kernels associated with shallow NNs. First, we consider the NN Gaussian Process kernel (NNGP), associated with the network at initialization, and the complement Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK), associated with its training in the "lazy regime". Interestingly, we show that the NTK does not represent more collapsed features than the NNGP for prototypical data models. As NC emerges from training, we then consider an alternative to NTK: the recently proposed adaptive kernel, which generalizes NNGP to model the feature mapping learned from the training data. Contrasting our NC1 analysis for these two kernels enables gaining insights into the effect of data distribution on the extent of collapse, which are empirically aligned with the behavior observed with practical training of NNs.</description>

      <title>Markov chain Monte Carlo without evaluating the target: an auxiliary variable approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05242v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In sampling tasks, it is common for target distributions to be known up to a normalising constant. However, in many situations, evaluating even the unnormalised distribution can be costly or infeasible. This issue arises in scenarios such as sampling from the Bayesian posterior for tall datasets and the 'doubly-intractable' distributions. In this paper, we begin by observing that seemingly different Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms, such as the exchange algorithm, PoissonMH, and TunaMH, can be unified under a simple common procedure. We then extend this procedure into a novel framework that allows the use of auxiliary variables in both the proposal and acceptance-rejection steps. We develop the theory of the new framework, applying it to existing algorithms to simplify and extend their results. Several new algorithms emerge from this framework, with improved performance demonstrated on both synthetic and real datasets.</description>
