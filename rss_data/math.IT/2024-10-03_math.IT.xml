      <title>Secure Backscatter Communications Through RIS: Modeling and Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Backscatter communication (BC) has emerged as a pivotal wireless communication paradigm owing to its low-power and cost-effective characteristics. However, BC faces various challenges from its low signal detection rate to its security vulnerabilities. Recently, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) have surfaced as a transformative technology addressing power and communication performance issues in BC. However, the potential of RIS in addressing the security challenges of BC remains uncharted. This paper investigates the secrecy performance of RIS-aided BC, where all channels are distributed according to the Fisher-Snedecor $\mathcal{F}$ distribution. Specifically, we consider a RIS with $N$ reflecting elements to help a backscatter device (BD) establish a smart environment and enhance the secrecy performance in BC. Due to the nature of BC systems, our analysis considers two possible scenarios (i) in the absence of direct links and (ii) in the presence of direct links. In both cases, we first derive compact analytical expressions of the probability density function (PDF) and cumulative distribution function (CDF) for the received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at both a legitimate receiver and an eavesdropper. Then, to analyze the secrecy performance, we further derive analytical expressions of the average secrecy capacity (ASC) and secrecy outage probability (SOP) for both mentioned scenarios. In addition, regarding the importance of system behavior in a high SNR regime, we provide an asymptotic analysis of the SOP and ASC. Eventually, the Monte-Carlo simulation is used to validate the analytical results, revealing that utilizing RIS can greatly improve the secrecy performance of the BC system relative to traditional BC setups that do not incorporate RIS.</description>

      <title>List Decoding Bounds for Binary Codes with Noiseless Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In an error-correcting code, a sender encodes a message $x \in \{ 0, 1 \}^k$ such that it is still decodable by a receiver on the other end of a noisy channel. In the setting of \emph{error-correcting codes with feedback}, after sending each bit, the sender learns what was received at the other end and can tailor future messages accordingly.
  While the unique decoding radius of feedback codes has long been known to be $\frac13$, the list decoding capabilities of feedback codes is not well understood. In this paper, we provide the first nontrivial bounds on the list decoding radius of feedback codes for lists of size $\ell$. For $\ell = 2$, we fully determine the $2$-list decoding radius to be $\frac37$. For larger values of $\ell$, we show an upper bound of $\frac12 - \frac{1}{2^{\ell + 2} - 2}$, and show that the same techniques for the $\ell = 2$ case cannot match this upper bound in general.</description>

      <title>Some three-weight linear codes and their complete weight enumerators and weight hierarchies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Linear codes with a few weights can be applied to secrete sharing, authentication codes, association schemes and strongly regular graphs. For an odd prime power $q$, we construct a class of three-weight $\F_q$-linear codes from quadratic functions via a bivariate construction and then determine the complete weight enumerators and weight hierarchies of these linear codes completely. This paper generalizes some results in Li et al. (2022) and Hu et al. (2024).</description>

      <title>Capacity Bounds for the Poisson-Repeat Channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop bounds on the capacity of Poisson-repeat channels (PRCs) for which each input bit is independently repeated according to a Poisson distribution. The upper bounds are obtained by considering an auxiliary channel where the output lengths corresponding to input blocks of a given length are provided as side information at the receiver. Numerical results show that the resulting upper bounds are significantly tighter than the best known one for a large range of the PRC parameter $\lambda$ (specifically, for $\lambda\ge 0.35$). We also describe a way of obtaining capacity lower bounds using information rates of the auxiliary channel and the entropy rate of the provided side information.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) systems play a crucial role in fifth-generation (5G) mobile communications, primarily achieved through the utilization of precoding matrix techniques. This paper presents precoding techniques employing codebooks in downlink MIMO-5G wireless communications, aiming to enhance network performance to meet the overarching 5G objectives of increased capacity and reduced latency. We conduct a comparative analysis of various precoding techniques outlined by the 5G standard through diverse simulations across different scenarios. These simulations enable us to assess the performance of the different precoding techniques, ultimately revealing the strengths and weaknesses inherent in Type I and Type II codebooks.</description>

      <title>Cooperative Semantic Knowledge Base Update Policy for Multiple Semantic Communication Pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semantic communication has emerged as a promising communication paradigm and there have been extensive research focusing on its applications in the increasingly prevalent multi-user scenarios. However, the knowledge discrepancy among multiple users may lead to considerable disparities in their performance. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a novel multi-pair cooperative semantic knowledge base (SKB) update policy. Specifically, for each pair endowed with SKB-enabled semantic communication, its well-understood knowledge in the local SKB is selected out and uploaded to the server to establish a global SKB, via a score-based knowledge selection scheme. The knowledge selection scheme achieves a balance between the uplink transmission overhead and the completeness of the global SKB. Then, with the assistance of the global SKB, each pair's local SKB is refined and their performance is improved. Numerical results show that the proposed cooperative SKB update policy obtains significant performance gains with minimal transmission overhead, especially for the initially poor-performing pairs.</description>

      <title>Temporal Predictive Coding for Gradient Compression in Distributed Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a prediction-based gradient compression method for distributed learning with event-triggered communication. Our goal is to reduce the amount of information transmitted from the distributed agents to the parameter server by exploiting temporal correlation in the local gradients. We use a linear predictor that \textit{combines past gradients to form a prediction of the current gradient}, with coefficients that are optimized by solving a least-square problem. In each iteration, every agent transmits the predictor coefficients to the server such that the predicted local gradient can be computed. The difference between the true local gradient and the predicted one, termed the \textit{prediction residual, is only transmitted when its norm is above some threshold.} When this additional communication step is omitted, the server uses the prediction as the estimated gradient. This proposed design shows notable performance gains compared to existing methods in the literature, achieving convergence with reduced communication costs.</description>

      <title>Personalized Federated Learning for Generative AI-Assisted Semantic Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semantic Communication (SC) focuses on transmitting only the semantic information rather than the raw data. This approach offers an efficient solution to the issue of spectrum resource utilization caused by the various intelligent applications on Mobile Users (MUs). Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) models have recently exhibited remarkable content generation and signal processing capabilities, presenting new opportunities for enhancing SC. Therefore, we propose a GAI-assisted SC (GSC) model deployed between MUs and the Base Station (BS). Then, to train the GSC model using the local data of MUs while ensuring privacy and accommodating heterogeneous requirements of MUs, we introduce Personalized Semantic Federated Learning (PSFL). This approach incorporates a novel Personalized Local Distillation (PLD) and Adaptive Global Pruning (AGP). In PLD, each MU selects a personalized GSC model as a mentor tailored to its local resources and a unified Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)-based SC (CSC) model as a student. This mentor model is then distilled into the student model for global aggregation. In AGP, we perform network pruning on the aggregated global model according to real-time communication environments, reducing communication energy. Finally, numerical results demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed PSFL scheme.</description>

      <title>Assessing the Viability of Synthetic Physical Copy Detection Patterns on Different Imaging Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02575v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the potential of synthetic physical Copy Detection Patterns (CDP) to improve the robustness of anti-counterfeiting systems. By leveraging synthetic physical CDP, we aim at enhancing security and cost-effectiveness across various real-world applications. Our research demonstrates that synthetic CDP offer substantial improvements in authentication accuracy compared to one based on traditional digital templates. We conducted extensive tests using both a scanner and a diverse range of mobile phones, validating our approach through ROC analysis. The results indicate that synthetic CDP can reliably differentiate between original and fake samples, making this approach a viable solution for real-world applications, though requires an additional research to make this technology scalable across a variety of imaging devices.</description>

      <title>Optimal continuity bound for the von Neumann entropy under energy constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02686v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using techniques proposed in [Sason, IEEE Trans. Inf. Th. 59, 7118 (2013)] and [Becker, Datta and Jabbour, IEEE Trans. Inf. Th. 69, 4128 (2023)], and building on results from the latter, we construct a globally optimal continuity bound for the von Neumann entropy under energy constraints imposed by arbitrary Hamiltonians, satisfying the Gibbs hypothesis. In particular, this provides a precise expression for the modulus of continuity of the von Neumann entropy over the set of states with bounded energy for infinite-dimensional quantum systems. Thus, it completely solves the problem of finding an optimal continuity bound for the von Neumann entropy in this setting, which was previously known only for pairs of states which were sufficiently close to each other. This continuity bound follows from a globally optimal semicontinuity bound for the von Neumann entropy under general energy constraints, which is our main technical result.</description>

      <title>Data Similarity-Based One-Shot Clustering for Multi-Task Hierarchical Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02733v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the problem of cluster identity estimation in a hierarchical federated learning setting in which users work toward learning different tasks. To overcome the challenge of task heterogeneity, users need to be grouped in a way such that users with the same task are in the same group, conducting training together, while sharing the weights of feature extraction layers with the other groups. Toward that end, we propose a one-shot clustering algorithm that can effectively identify and group users based on their data similarity. This enables more efficient collaboration and sharing of a common layer representation within the federated learning system. Our proposed algorithm not only enhances the clustering process, but also overcomes challenges related to privacy concerns, communication overhead, and the need for prior knowledge about learning models or loss function behaviors. We validate our proposed algorithm using various datasets such as CIFAR-10 and Fashion MNIST, and show that it outperforms the baseline in terms of accuracy and variance reduction.</description>

      <title>Boosting Ordered Statistics Decoding of Short LDPC Codes with Simple Neural Network Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14165v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ordered statistics decoding has been instrumental in addressing decoding failures that persist after normalized min-sum decoding in short low-density parity-check codes. Despite its benefits, the high computational complexity of effective ordered statistics decoding has limited its application in complexity-sensitive scenarios. To mitigate this issue, we propose a novel variant of the ordered statistics decoder. This approach begins with the design of a neural network model that refines the measurement of codeword bits, utilizing iterative information from normalized min-sum decoding failures. Subsequently, a fixed decoding path is established, comprising a sequence of blocks, each featuring a variety of test error patterns. The introduction of a sliding window-assisted neural model facilitates early termination of the ordered statistics decoding process along this path, aiming to balance performance and computational complexity. Comprehensive simulations and complexity analyses demonstrate that the proposed hybrid method matches state-of-the-art approaches across various metrics, particularly excelling in reducing latency.</description>

      <title>Optimal Tree-Based Mechanisms for Differentially Private Approximate CDFs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18573v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper considers the $\varepsilon$-differentially private (DP) release of an approximate cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the samples in a dataset. We assume that the true (approximate) CDF is obtained after lumping the data samples into a fixed number $K$ of bins. In this work, we extend the well-known binary tree mechanism to the class of \emph{level-uniform tree-based} mechanisms and identify $\varepsilon$-DP mechanisms that have a small $\ell_2$-error. We identify optimal or close-to-optimal tree structures when either of the parameters, which are the branching factors or the privacy budgets at each tree level, are given, and when the algorithm designer is free to choose both sets of parameters. Interestingly, when we allow the branching factors to take on real values, under certain mild restrictions, the optimal level-uniform tree-based mechanism is obtained by choosing equal branching factors \emph{independent} of $K$, and equal privacy budgets at all levels. Furthermore, for selected $K$ values, we explicitly identify the optimal \emph{integer} branching factors and tree height, assuming equal privacy budgets at all levels. Finally, we describe general strategies for improving the private CDF estimates further, by combining multiple noisy estimates and by post-processing the estimates for consistency.</description>

      <title>Continuity of entropies via integral representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15226v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that Frenkel's integral representation of the quantum relative entropy provides a natural framework to derive continuity bounds for quantum information measures. Our main general result is a dimension-independent semi-continuity relation for the quantum relative entropy with respect to the first argument. Using it, we obtain a number of results: (1) a tight continuity relation for the conditional entropy in the case where the two states have equal marginals on the conditioning system, resolving a conjecture by Wilde in this special case; (2) a stronger version of the Fannes-Audenaert inequality on quantum entropy; (3) better estimates on the quantum capacity of approximately degradable channels; (4) an improved continuity relation for the entanglement cost; (5) general upper bounds on asymptotic transformation rates in infinite-dimensional entanglement theory; and (6) a proof of a conjecture due to Christandl, Ferrara, and Lancien on the continuity of 'filtered' relative entropy distances.</description>
