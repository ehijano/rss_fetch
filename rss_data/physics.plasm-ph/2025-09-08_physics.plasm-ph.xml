      <title>Measuring the properties of homogeneous turbulence in curved spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Turbulence in curved spacetimes in general, and in the vicinity of black holes (BHs) in particular, represents a poorly understood phenomenon that is often analysed employing techniques developed for flat spacetimes. We here propose a novel approach to study turbulence in strong gravitational fields that is based on the computation of structure functions on generic manifolds and is thus applicable to arbitrary curved spacetimes. In particular, we introduce, for the first time, a formalism to compute the characteristic properties of turbulence, such as the second-order structure function or the power spectral density, in terms of proper lengths and volumes and not in terms of coordinate lengths and volumes, as customarily done. By applying the new approach to the turbulent rest-mass density field from simulations of magnetised disc accretion onto a Kerr BH, we inspect in a rigorous way turbulence in regions close to the event horizon, but also in the disc, the wind, and in the jet. We demonstrate that the new approach can capture the typical behavior of an inertial-range cascade and that differences up to $40-80\%$ emerge in the vicinity of the event horizon with respect to the standard flat-spacetime approach. While these differences become smaller at larger distances, our study highlights that special care needs to be paid when analysing turbulence in strongly curved spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Unveiling a New $\beta$-Scaling of the Tearing Instability in Weakly Collisional Plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12702v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the linear tearing instability in weakly collisional plasmas using a non-ideal gyrotropic-MHD framework, uncovering a previously unknown scaling relation for the instability growth rate in high-$\beta$ environments. Even starting from an isotropic equilibrium, our analysis reveals a $\beta$-dependence, with the maximum growth rate scaling as $\sigma_\mathrm{max} \tau_a \propto \beta^{-1/4}$, challenging the long-held assumption of $\beta$-independence inherent in classical MHD formulations. This novel scaling emerges due to self-consistent fluctuations in pressure anisotropy, dynamically induced by perturbations in velocity and magnetic fields. Increasing plasma-$\beta$ always suppresses the instability, whereas a background pressure anisotropy can either enhance or further suppress it, depending on its sign: for $p_{\parallel,0} &lt; p_{\perp,0}$ the instability is strengthened, while for $p_{\parallel,0} &gt; p_{\perp,0}$ it is weakened. Importantly, this effect is not limited to low-collisionality plasmas at high $\beta$; it can also manifest in more collisional environments once the strict assumption of pressure isotropy is relaxed. This finding has profound implications for various astrophysical contexts characterized by high $\beta$ and varying degrees of collisionality, including the solar corona and heliospheric current sheets, planetary magnetospheres, as probed by space missions, and the intracluster medium, where magnetic reconnection critically impacts magnetic field evolution and cosmic ray transport. Our results therefore question the universality of the widely-accepted plasmoid-mediated fast reconnection paradigm and underscore the necessity of incorporating pressure anisotropy effects into reconnection models for accurate representation of astrophysical plasmas.</description>

      <title>Aligning Thermal and Current Quenches with a High Density Low-Z Injection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17557v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The conventional approach for thermal quench mitigation in a tokamak disruption is through a high-Z impurity injection that radiates away the plasma's thermal energy before it reaches the wall. The downside is a robust Ohmic-to-runaway current conversion due to the radiatively clamped low post-thermal-quench electron temperature. An alternative approach is to deploy a low-Z (either deuterium or hydrogen) injection that aims to slow down the thermal quench, and ideally aligns it with the current quench. This approach has been investigated here via 3D MHD simulations using the PIXIE3D code. By boosting the hydrogen density, a fusion-grade plasma is dilutionally cooled at approximately the original pressure. Energy loss to the wall is controlled by a Bohm outflow condition at the boundary where the magnetic field intercepts a thin plasma sheath at the wall, in addition to Bremsstrahlung bulk losses. Robust MHD instabilities proceed as usual, while the collisionality of the plasma has been greatly increased and parallel transport is now in the Braginskii regime. The main conclusion of this study is that the decreased transport loss along open field lines due to a sufficient low-Z injection slows down the thermal quench rate to the order of 20 ms, aligned with the current quench timescale for a 15 MA ITER plasma.</description>

      <title>Quantum Inspiration, Classical Advantage: Dequantized particle algorithm for the nonlinear Vlasov-Poisson system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05151v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a dequantization algorithm for the Vlasov--Poisson (VP) system, termed the dequantized particle algorithm, by systematically dequantizing the underlying many-body quantum theory. Starting from the second-quantized Hamiltonian description, we derive a finite-dimensional dequantized system and show that it furnishes a structure-preserving discretization of the Schr\"odinger--Poisson (SP) equations. Through the Wigner or Husimi transformations, this discretization provides an efficient approximation of the VP system when quantum effects are negligible. Unlike conventional structure-preserving algorithms formulated in 6D phase space, this dequantized particle algorithm operates in 3D configuration space, potentially offering more compact and efficient representations of physical information under appropriate conditions. A numerical example of the classical nonlinear two-stream instability, simulated using merely 97 dequantized particles, demonstrates the efficiency, accuracy, and conservation properties of the algorithm and confirms its potential as a foundation for developing quantum and quantum-inspired classical algorithms for kinetic plasma dynamics.</description>

      <title>Is There an Exact Magnetic-Moment for Charged Particle Motion in a Homogeneous, Time-Dependent Magnetic Field?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03641v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The nonperturbative guiding-center model provides an exact alternative to full-orbit simulations of charged particle dynamics in situations where traditional guiding-center theory may fail. We demonstrate that the charged particle motion in a homogeneous, time-varying magnetic field is a solvable example of the nonperturbative guiding-center model. This entails showing that the exact magnetic moment of Qin and Davidson can be constructed to be asymptotic to the adiabatic invariant series of Kruskal. In contrast to the perturbative invariant, the exact invariant contains information about parametric resonances. These resonances destroy the conservation of the usual magnetic moment over very long times. This refutes some previous claims about the all-time invariance of the magnetic moment.</description>
