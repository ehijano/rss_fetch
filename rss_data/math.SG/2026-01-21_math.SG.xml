      <title>Geometric realisations of type $\tilde{A}_n$ preprojective algebras in homological mirror symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The type $A_n$-singularity $\mathbb{C}^2/\mathbb{Z}_{n+1}$ can be resolved by hyper-K\"ahler manifolds $X_{\zeta}$ with underlying smooth manifolds diffeomorphic to the resolution of singularities $X_{\text{res}}$, whose hyper-K\"ahler structure depends on a parameter $\zeta\in H_2(X_{\text{res}};\mathbb{R})$. The structure as a complex manifold of each such hyper-K\"ahler manifold is equivalent to the resolution of singularities at the poles and the structure of a Milnor fibre with roots determined by $\zeta$ elsewhere; the symplectic structure is exact along the equator and is deformed by areas depending on $\zeta$ on the exceptional $(-2)$-spheres away from the equator.
  We show that removing suitable divisors $D_u$ from a fixed $X_{\zeta}$ varying with $u$ in the underlying upper hemisphere of the $S^2$-family of K\"ahler-structures yields a log Calabi--Yau hyper-K\"ahler family (in particular a family of log Calabi--Yau submanifolds), and that mirror symmetry is satisfied (partly conjectural in one direction) for this family by hyper-K\"ahler rotation, in particular by interchanging the structures over the equator and the pole. We furthermore show homological mirror symmetry after adding the missing divisors, which is related to attaching stops and computing singularity categories of certain Landau--Ginzburg potentials on the $A$-side and $B$-side, respectively.
  More concretely: we compute wrapped Fukaya categories and compare them with (previous and new) computations of derived categories of coherent sheaves and derived categories of singularities in algebraic geometry. We show that the relevant categories (with two exceptions) are triangulated equivalent to module categories over the additive and the multiplicative preprojective algebras of type $\tilde{A}_n$, or to deformations of these algebras depending on the parameters $\zeta$.</description>

      <title>Approximability for Lagrangian submanifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a notion of categorical approximability for metric spaces that can be viewed as a categorification of approximability for metric groups, as defined by Turing in 1938. Approximability as introduced here is a property of metric spaces that is more general than precompactness. It is shown that several classes of Lagrangian submanifolds - closed Lagrangian submanifolds in a cotangent disk bundle; equators on the sphere; weakly exact Lagrangians on the torus-endowed with the spectral metric are approximable in this sense. Among other geometric applications, we show that there are such examples of spaces of Lagrangians that are approximable but are not precompact.</description>

      <title>From multiplicative to additive geometry: Deformation theory and 2D TQFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a theory of Poisson deformation of Hamiltonian quasi-Poisson manifolds to Hamiltonian Poisson manifolds that include degenerate cases. More significantly, this theory extends to singular cases arising from symplectic implosion: we introduce a generalized Hamiltonian deformation theory and we show that the imploded cross section of the double $D(G)_\imp$ deforms to the implosion of the cotangent bundle $T^*G_\imp$ with applications to the master moduli space of $G$-flat connections.\\ In parallel, we construct a topological quantum field theory $\N: \text{Cob}_{2}\to \mathbf{QHam}$, where $\mathbf{QHam}$ is the category of quasi-Hamiltonian manifolds. To each cobordism $\Sigma$, we associate a quasi-Hamiltonian space $\N(\Sigma)$ built from the fusion product of copies of the double $D(G).$ We show that these spaces are invariant under the \emph{quiver homotopy} and that the composition of cobordisms corresponds to a quasi-Hamiltonian reduction. This provides a multiplicative version of the 2D Hamiltonian TQFT of Maiza-Mayrand.</description>

      <title>Mirror construction of Hecke correspondence between Nakajima quiver varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nakajima constructed geometric representations of a deformed Kac-Moody Lie algebra using Hecke correspondences between quiver varieties. In this paper, we show that Hecke correspondences, which are holomorphic Lagrangians in products of Nakajima quiver varieties, can be obtained by applying the localized mirror construction to the morphism spaces between families of framed Lagrangian branes supported on the core of a plumbing of two-spheres. Moreover, for a non-ADE quiver, we show that the localized mirror functor is fully-faithful.</description>

Abstract: We provide a complete classification of quaternionic skew-Hermitian symmetric spaces, namely symmetric spaces that admit a torsion-free ${\rm SO}^{*}(2n){\rm Sp}(1)$-structure for arbitrary $n&gt;1$. Moreover, we prove that any homogeneous quaternionic skew-Hermitian manifold is necessarily a symmetric space.</description>

      <title>Period collapse of Markov triangles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.14090v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cristofaro-Gardiner and Kleinman showed the complete period collapse of the Ehrhart quasipolynomial of Fibonacci triangles and their irrational limits, by studying the Fourier-Dedekind sums involved in the Ehrhart function of right-angled rational triangles. We generalize this result using integral affine geometrical methods to all Markov triangles, as defined by Vianna. In particular, we show new occurrences of strong period collapse, namely by constructing for each Markov number $p$ a two-sided sequence of rational triangles and two irrational limits with quasipolynomial Ehrhart function of period $p$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04897v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By analogy with Weinstein's neighbourhood theorem, we prove a uniqueness result for symplectic neighbourhoods of a large family of stratified subspaces. This result generalizes existing constructions, e.g., in the search for exotic Lagrangians. Along the way, we prove a strong version of Moser's trick and a (non-symplectic) tubular neighbourhood theorem for these stratified subspaces.</description>

      <title>Holomorphic foliations of degree two and arbitrary dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.12880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.12880v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a complete classification of degree-$2$ foliations on $\mathbb{P}^n$ in any dimension, assuming they are not algebraically integrable. If $\mathcal{F}$ is such a foliation, then either $\mathcal{F}$ is the linear pull-back of a degree-$2$ foliation by curves on $\mathbb{P}^{n-k+1}$, or a logarithmic foliation of type $(1^{n-k+1},2)$, or a logarithmic foliation of type $(1^{n-k+3})$, or the linear pull-back of a degree-$2$ foliation of dimension $2$ on $\mathbb{P}^{n-k+2}$ tangent to an action of the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{aff}(\mathbb{C})$. Meanwhile, we prove that any $2$-dimensional foliation tangent to a global vector field must satisfy that its tangent sheaf is either not locally free or has a direct summand isomorphic to $\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}^{n}}(a)$, with $a\in\{0,1\}$. As a byproduct of our classification, we describe the geometry of Poisson structures on $\mathbb{P}^{4}$ with generic rank two.</description>

      <title>Canonical torus action on symplectic singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15791v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that any symplectic singularity lying on a smoothable projective symplectic variety locally admits a good action of an algebraic torus of dimension $r \geq 1$, which is canonical. Under mild assumptions, $r=1$ is also confirmed. In particular, it admits (canonical) good $\mathbb{C}^*$-action. This proves Kaledin's conjecture conditionally but in a substantially stronger form. Our key idea is to use Donaldson-Sun theory on local Kahler metrics in complex differential geometry to connect with the theory of Poisson deformations of symplectic varieties.
  For general symplectic singularities, we prove the same assertion -- namely, the existence of a canonical (local) torus action -- assuming that the Donaldson-Sun theory extends to such singularities along with suitable singular (hyper)Kahler metrics. Conversely, our results can be also used to study local behaviour of such metrics around the germ. For instance, we show that such singular hyperKahler metric around isolated singularity is close to a metric cone in a polynomial order, and satisfies $r=1$ i.e., has a good canonical (local) $\mathbb{C}^*$-action, as the complexification of the cone metric rescaling. Our theory also fits well to singularities on many hyperKahler reductions.</description>

      <title>Pseudo-Legendrian and Legendrian Simplicity of Links in 3-Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18185v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct infinite families of non-simple isotopy classes of links in overtwisted contact structures on $S^1$-bundles over surfaces. These examples include: (1) a pair of Legendrian links that are not Legendrian isotopic, but which are isotopic as framed links, homotopic as Legendrian immersed multi-curves, and have Legendrian-isotopic components and (2) a pair of Legendrian links that are not Legendrian isotopic, but are isotopic as framed links, homotopic as Legendrian immersed multi-curves, and which are link-homotopic as Legendrian links. Moreover, we construct examples showing that both of these non-simplicity phenomena can occur in the same smooth isotopy class. To construct these examples, we develop the theory of links transverse to a nowhere-zero vector field in a 3-manifold, and construct analogous examples in the category of links transverse to a vector field.</description>

      <title>Hilbert Polynomials of Calabi Yau Hypersurfaces in Toric Varieties and Lattice Points in Polytope Boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02176v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the Hilbert polynomial of a Calabi-Yau hypersurface $Z$ in a smooth toric variety $M$ associated to a convex polytope $\Delta$ is given by a lattice point count in the polytope boundary $\partial \Delta,$ just as the Hilbert polynomial of $M$ is known to be given by a lattice point count in the convex polytope $\Delta.$ Our main tool is a computation of the Euler class in $K$-theory of the normal line bundle to the hypersurface $Z,$ in terms of the Euler classes of the divisors corresponding to the facets of the moment polytope. We observe a remarkable parallel between our expression for the Euler class and the inclusion-exclusion principle in combinatorics. To obtain our result we combine these facts with the known relation between lattice point counts in the facets of $\Delta$ and the Hilbert polynomials of the smooth toric varieties corresponding to these facets.</description>

      <title>Quantum Heegaard diagrams and knot Floer Homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08805v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a knot presented as a braid closure, we construct a unified intersection model for the Alexander and Jones polynomials of the knot via what we call quantum Heegaard diagrams. These diagrams are obtained by stabilising the disc model of the first author, which we show are doubly-pointed Heegaard diagrams of the knot together with an additional set of base points. We identify the Alexander grading in the disc model with the Alexander grading in the Heegaard diagram. As the Lagrangian intersection Floer homology of the Heegaard tori in the symmetric power of the Heegaard surface is knot Floer homology, we can view knot Floer homology as a natural categorification of the Alexander polynomial arising from the disc model.
  The additional base points let us define a new grading on the intersection between the Heegaard tori, which we call quantum Alexander grading. Combining this with the classical Alexander grading, we define a two-variable graded intersection between the Heegaard tori that recovers the Jones and Alexander polynomials as two specialisations of coefficients. The resulting intersection formula for the Jones polynomial opens up a potential avenue to obtaining a new geometric categorification of the Jones polynomial.</description>
