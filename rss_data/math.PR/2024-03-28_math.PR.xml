      <title>Randomisation in the Josephus Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Josephus problem is a well--studied elimination problem consisting in determining the position of the survivor after repeated applications of a deterministic rule removing one person at a time from a given group.
  A natural probabilistic variant of this process is introduced in this paper. More precisely, in this variant, the survivor is determined after performing a succession of Bernouilli trials with parameter $p$ designating each time the person to remove. When the number of participants tends to infinity, the main result characterises the limit distribution of the position of the survivor with an increasing degree of precision as the parameter approaches the unbiaised case $p=1/2$. Then, the convergence rate to the position of the survivor is obtained in the form of a Central-Limit Theorem.
  A number of other variants of the suggested probabilistic elimination process are also considered. They each admit a specific limit behavior which, in most cases, is stated in the form of an open problem.</description>

      <title>Markov chains and mappings of distributions on compact spaces II: Numerics and Conjectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider a compact metric space $S$ and a pair $(j,k)$ with $k \ge 2$ and $1 \le j \le k$. For any probability distribution $\theta \in P(S)$, define a Markov chain on $S$ by: from state $s$, take $k$ i.i.d. ($\theta$) samples, and jump to the $j$'th closest. Such a chain converges in distribution to a unique stationary distribution, say $\pi_{j,k}(\theta)$. This defines a mapping $\pi_{j,k}: P(S) \to P(S)$. What happens when we iterate this mapping? In particular, what are the fixed points of this mapping? A few results are proved in a companion article; this article, not intended for formal publication, records numerical studies and conjectures.</description>

      <title>Tagged particles and size-biased dynamics in mean-field interacting particle systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a connection between tagged particles and size-biased empirical processes in interacting particle systems, in analogy to classical results on the propagation of chaos. In a mean-field scaling limit, the evolution of the occupation number on the tagged particle site converges to a time-inhomogeneous Markov process with non-linear master equation given by the law of large numbers of size-biased empirical measures. The latter are important in recent efforts to understand the dynamics of condensation in interacting particle systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, the complete moment convergence for the partial sum of moving average processes $\{X_n=\sum_{i=-\infty}^{\infty}a_iY_{i+n},n\ge 1\}$ is estabished under some proper conditions, where $\{Y_i,-\infty&lt;i&lt;\infty\}$ is a sequence of $m$-widely acceptable ($m$-WA) random variables, which is stochastically dominated by a random variable $Y$ in sub-linear expectations space $(\Omega,\HH,\ee)$ and $\{a_i,-\infty&lt;i&lt;\infty\}$ is an absolutely summable sequence of real numbers. The results extend the relevant results in probability space to those under sub-linear expectations.</description>

      <title>Scaling limits for random walks on long range percolation clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study limit laws for simple random walks on supercritical long-range percolation clusters on the integer lattice. For the long range percolation model, the probability that two vertices are connected behaves asymptotically as a negative power of distance between them. We prove that the scaling limit of simple random walk on the infinite component converges to an isotropic alpha-stable Levy process. This complements the work of Crawford and Sly, who proved the corresponding result for alpha between 0 and 1. The convergence holds in both the quenched and annealed senses.</description>

      <title>Contact processes with quenched disorder on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ and on Erdos-Renyi graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In real systems impurities and defects play an important role in determining their properties. Here we will consider what probabilists have called the contact process in a random environment and what physicists have more precisely named the contact process with quenched disorder. We will concentrate our efforts on the special case called the random dilution model, in which sites independently and with probability $p$ are active and particles on them give birth at rate $\lambda$, while the other sites are inert and particles on them do not give birth. We show that the resulting inhomogeniety can make dramatic changes in the behavior in the supercritical, subcritical, and critical behavior. In particular, the usual exponential decay of the desnity of particles in the subcritical phase becomes a power law (the Griffiths phase), and polynomial decay at the critical value becomes a power of $\log$.</description>

      <title>Phase transition in the EM scheme of an SDE driven by $\alpha$-stable noises with $\alpha \in (0,2]$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study in this paper the EM scheme for a family of well-posed critical SDEs with the drift $-x\log(1+|x|)$ and $\alpha$-stable noises. Specifically, we find that when the SDE is driven by a rotationally symmetric $\alpha$-stable processes with $\alpha=2$ (i.e. Brownian motion), the EM scheme is bounded in the $L^2$ sense uniformly w.r.t. the time. In contrast, if the SDE is driven by a rotationally symmetric $\alpha$-stable process with $\alpha \in (0,2)$, all the $\beta$-th moments, with $\beta \in (0,\alpha)$, of the EM scheme blow up. This demonstrates a phase transition phenomenon as $\alpha \uparrow 2$. We verify our results by simulations.</description>

      <title>Lipschitz-type estimate for the frog model with Bernoulli initial configuration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the frog model with Bernoulli initial configuration, which is an interacting particle system on the multidimensional lattice consisting of two states of particles: active and sleeping. Active particles perform independent simple random walks. On the other hand, although sleeping particles do not move at first, they become active and can move around when touched by active particles. Initially, only the origin has one active particle, and the other sites have sleeping particles according to a Bernoulli distribution. Then, starting from the original active particle, active ones are gradually generated and propagate across the lattice, with time. It is of interest to know how the propagation of active particles behaves as the parameter of the Bernoulli distribution varies. In this paper, we treat the so-called time constant describing the speed of propagation, and prove that the absolute difference between the time constants for parameters $p,q \in (0,1]$ is bounded from above and below by multiples of $|p-q|$.</description>

      <title>Decision-Epoch Matters: Unveiling its Impact on the Stability of Scheduling with Randomly Varying Connectivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A classical queuing theory result states that in a parallel-queue single-server model, the maximum stability region does not depend on the scheduling decision epochs, and in particular is the same for preemptive and non-preemptive systems. We consider here the case in which each of the queues may be connected to the server or not, depending on an exogenous process. In our main result, we show that the maximum stability region now does strongly depend on how the decision epochs are defined. We compare the setting where decisions can be made at any moment in time (the unconstrained setting), to two other settings: decisions are taken either (i) at moments of a departure (non-preemptive scheduling), or (ii) when an exponentially clock rings with rate $\gamma$. We characterise the maximum stability region for the two constrained configurations, allowing us to observe a reduction compared to the unconstrained configuration. In the non-preemptive setting, the maximum stability region is drastically reduced compared to the unconstrained setting and we conclude that a non-preemptive scheduler cannot take opportunistically advantage (in terms of stability) of the random varying connectivity. Instead, for the $\gamma$ decision epochs, we observe that the maximum stability region is monotone in the rate of the decision moments $\gamma$, and that one can be arbitrarily close to the maximum stability region in the unconstrained setting if we choose $\gamma$ large enough. We further show that Serve Longest Connected (SLC) queue is maximum stable in both constrained settings, within the set of policies that select a queue among the connected ones. From a methodological viewpoint, we introduce a novel theoretical tool termed a ``test for fluid limits'' (TFL) that might be of independent interest. TFL is a simple test that, if satisfied by the fluid limit, allows us to conclude for stability.</description>

      <title>Weak convergence of probability measures on hyperspaces with the upper Fell-topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let E be a locally compact second countable Hausdorff space and F the pertaining family of all closed sets. We endow F respectively with the Fell-topology, the upper Fell topology or the upper Vietoris-topology and investigate weak convergence of probability measures on the corresponding hyperspaces with a focus on the upper Fell topology. The results can be transferred to distributional convergence of random closed sets in E with applications to the asymptotic behavior of measurable selection.</description>

      <title>Dimension-independent functional inequalities by tensorization and projection arguments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study stability under tensorization and projection-type operations of gradient-type estimates and other functional inequalities for Markov semigroups on metric spaces. Using transportation-type inequalities obtained by F. Baudoin and N. Eldredge in 2021, we prove that constants in the gradient estimates can be chosen to be independent of the dimension. Our results are applicable to hypoelliptic diffusions on sub-Riemannian manifolds and some hypocoercive diffusions. As a byproduct, we obtain dimension-independent reverse Poincar\'{e}, reverse logarithmic Sobolev, and gradient bounds for Lie groups with a transverse symmetry and for non-isotropic Heisenberg groups.</description>

      <title>On the law of the iterated logarithm for continued fractions with sequentially restricted partial quotients</title>

      <description>arXiv:1707.09673v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a law of the iterated logarithm (LIL) for the set of real numbers whose $n$-th partial quotient is bigger than $\alpha_n$, where $(\alpha_n)$ is a sequence such that $\sum 1/\alpha_n$ is finite. This set is shown to have Hausdorff dimension $1/2$ in many cases and the measure in LIL is absolutely continuous to the Hausdorff measure. The result is obtained as an application of a strong invariance principle for unbounded observables on the limit set of a sequential iterated function system.</description>

      <title>Multivariate Gaussian Approximation for Random Forest via Region-based Stabilization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09960v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive Gaussian approximation bounds for random forest predictions based on a set of training points given by a Poisson process, under fairly mild regularity assumptions on the data generating process. Our approach is based on the key observation that the random forest predictions satisfy a certain geometric property called region-based stabilization. In the process of developing our results for the random forest, we also establish a probabilistic result, which might be of independent interest, on multivariate Gaussian approximation bounds for general functionals of Poisson process that are region-based stabilizing. This general result makes use of the Malliavin-Stein method, and is potentially applicable to various related statistical problems.</description>

      <title>Markov chain models for inspecting response dynamics in psychological testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The importance of considering contextual probabilities in shaping response patterns within psychological testing is underscored, despite the ubiquitous nature of order effects discussed extensively in methodological literature. Drawing from concepts such as path-dependency, first-order autocorrelation, state-dependency, and hysteresis, the present study is an attempt to address how earlier responses serve as an anchor for subsequent answers in tests, surveys, and questionnaires. Introducing the notion of non-commuting observables derived from quantum physics, I highlight their role in characterizing psychological processes and the impact of measurement instruments on participants' responses. We advocate for the utilization of first-order Markov chain modeling to capture and forecast sequential dependencies in survey and test responses. The employment of the first-order Markov chain model lies in individuals' propensity to exhibit partial focus to preceding responses, with recent items most likely exerting a substantial influence on subsequent response selection. This study contributes to advancing our understanding of the dynamics inherent in sequential data within psychological research and provides a methodological framework for conducting longitudinal analyses of response patterns of test and questionnaire.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18141v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove Fredholm determinants build out from generalizations of Schur measures, or equivalently, arbitrary multiplicative functionals of the original Schur measures are tau-functions of the 2D Toda lattice hierarchy. Our result apply to finite temperature Schur measures, and extends both the result of Okounkov in \cite{okounkovschurmeasures} and of Cafasso-Ruzza in \cite{cafassoruzza} concerning the finite-temperature Plancherel measure. Our proof lies on the semi-infinite wedge formalism and the Boson-Fermion correspondance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18297v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a mean field game for a family of filtering problems related to the classic sequential testing of the drift of a Brownian motion. To the best of our knowledge this work presents the first treatment of mean field filtering games with stopping and an unobserved common noise in the literature. We show that the game is well-posed, characterize the solution, and establish the existence of an equilibrium under certain assumptions. We also perform numerical studies for several examples of interest.</description>

      <title>Construction of Gross-Neveu model using Polchinski flow equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18562v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Gross-Neveu model is a quantum field theory model of Dirac fermions in two dimensions with a quartic interaction term. Like Yang-Mills theory in four dimensions, the model is renormalizable (but not super-renormalizable) and asymptotically free (i.e. its short-distance behaviour is governed by the free theory). We give a new construction of the massive Euclidean Gross-Neveu model in infinite volume based on the renormalization group flow equation. The construction does not involve cluster expansion or discretization of phase-space. We express the Schwinger functions of the Gross-Neveu model in terms of the effective potential and construct the effective potential by solving the flow equation using the Banach fixed point theorem. Since we use crucially the fact that fermionic fields can be represented as bounded operators our construction does not extend to models including bosons. However, it is applicable to other asymptotically free purely fermionic theories such as the symplectic fermion model.</description>

      <title>Logarithmic singularity in the density four-point function of two-dimensional critical percolation in the bulk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18576v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide definitive proof of the logarithmic nature of the percolation conformal field theory in the bulk by showing that the four-point function of the density operator has a logarithmic divergence as two points collide and that the same divergence appears in the operator product expansion (OPE) of two density operators. The right hand side of the OPE contains two operators with the same scaling dimension, one of them multiplied by a term with a logarithmic singularity. Our method involves a probabilistic analysis of the percolation events contributing to the four-point function. It does not require algebraic considerations, nor taking the $Q \to 1$ limit of the $Q$-state Potts model, and is amenable to a rigorous mathematical formulation. The logarithmic divergence appears as a consequence of scale invariance combined with independence.</description>

      <title>On the scaling of random Tamari intervals and Schnyder woods of random triangulations (with an asymptotic D-finite trick)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a Tamari interval of size $n$ (i.e., a pair of Dyck paths which are comparable for the Tamari relation) chosen uniformly at random. We show that the height of a uniformly chosen vertex on the upper or lower path scales as $n^{3/4}$, and has an explicit limit law. By the Bernardi-Bonichon bijection, this result also describes the height of points in the canonical Schnyder trees of a uniform random plane triangulation of size $n$.
  The exact solution of the model is based on polynomial equations with one and two catalytic variables. To prove the convergence from the exact solution, we use a version of moment pumping based on D-finiteness, which is essentially automatic and should apply to many other models. We are not sure to have seen this simple trick used before.
  It would be interesting to study the universality of this convergence for decomposition trees associated to positive Bousquet-M\'elou--Jehanne equations.</description>

      <title>A monotone scheme for G-equations with application to the explicit convergence rate of robust central limit theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.07184</link>
      <description>arXiv:1904.07184v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a monotone approximation scheme for a class of fully nonlinear PDEs called G-equations. Such equations arise often in the characterization of G-distributed random variables in a sublinear expectation space. The proposed scheme is constructed recursively based on a piecewise constant approximation of the viscosity solution to the G-equation. We establish the convergence of the scheme and determine the convergence rate with an explicit error bound, using the comparison principles for both the scheme and the equation together with a mollification procedure. The first application is obtaining the convergence rate of Peng's robust central limit theorem with an explicit bound of Berry-Esseen type. The second application is an approximation scheme with its convergence rate for the Black-Scholes-Barenblatt equation.</description>

      <title>Doubly Reflected Backward SDEs Driven by G-Brownian Motions and Fully Nonlinear PDEs with Double Obstacles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2008.09973v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a new method to study the doubly reflected backward stochastic differential equation driven by G-Brownian motion (G-BSDE). Our approach involves approximating the solution through a family of penalized reflected G-BSDEs with a lower obstacle that are monotone decreasing. By employing this approach, we establish the well-posedness of the solution of the doubly reflected G-BSDE with the weakest known conditions, and uncover its relationship with the fully nonlinear partial differential equation with double obstacles for the first time.</description>

      <title>Multiple Ising interfaces in annulus and $2N$-sided radial SLE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.08124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.08124v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider critical planar Ising model in annulus with alternating boundary conditions on the outer boundary and free boundary conditions in the inner boundary. As the size of the inner hole goes to zero, the event that all interfaces get close to the inner hole before they meet each other is a rare event. We prove that the law of the collection of the interfaces conditional on this rare event converges in total variation distance to the so-called $2N$-sided radial SLE$_3$, introduced by~[HL21]. The proof relies crucially on an estimate for multiple chordal SLE. Suppose $(\gamma_1, \ldots, \gamma_N)$ is chordal $N$-SLE$_{\kappa}$ with $\kappa\in (0,4]$ in the unit disc, and we consider the probability that all $N$ curves get close to the origin. We prove that the limit $\lim_{r\to 0+}r^{-A_{2N}}\mathbb{P}[\mathrm{dist}(0,\gamma_j)&lt;r, 1\le j\le N]$ exists, where $A_{2N}$ is the so-called $2N$-arm exponents and $\mathrm{dist}$ is Euclidean distance. We call the limit Green's function for chordal $N$-SLE$_{\kappa}$. This estimate is a generalization of previous conclusions with $N=1$ and $N=2$ proved in~[LR12, LR15] and~[Zha20] respectively.</description>

      <title>Boundary current fluctuations for the half space ASEP and six vertex model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.16335v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study fluctuations of the current at the boundary for the half space asymmetric simple exclusion process (ASEP) and the height function of the half space six vertex model at the boundary at large times. We establish a phase transition depending on the asymptotic density of particles at the boundary, with GSE and GOE limits as well as the Baik--Rains crossover distribution near the critical point. This was previously known for half space last passage percolation, and recently established for the half space log-gamma polymer and KPZ equation in the groundbreaking work of Imamura, Mucciconi, and Sasamoto.
  The proof uses the underlying algebraic structure of these models in a crucial way to obtain exact formulas. In particular, we show a relationship between the half space six vertex model and a half space Hall--Littlewood measure with two boundary parameters, which is then matched to a free boundary Schur process via a new identity of symmetric functions. Fredholm Pfaffian formulas are established for the half space ASEP and six vertex model, indicating a hidden free fermionic structure.</description>

      <title>Noise Sensitivity of the Minimum Spanning Tree of the Complete Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.07357v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the noise sensitivity of the minimum spanning tree (MST) of the $n$-vertex complete graph when edges are assigned independent random weights. It is known that when the graph distance is rescaled by $n^{1/3}$ and vertices are given a uniform measure, the MST converges in distribution in the Gromov-Hausdorff-Prokhorov (GHP) topology. We prove that if the weight of each edge is resampled independently with probability $\varepsilon\gg n^{-1/3}$, then the pair of rescaled minimum spanning trees -- before and after the noise -- converges in distribution to independent random spaces. Conversely, if $\varepsilon\ll n^{-1/3}$, the GHP distance between the rescaled trees goes to $0$ in probability. This implies the noise sensitivity and stability for every property of the MST that corresponds to a continuity set of the random limit. The noise threshold of $n^{-1/3}$ coincides with the critical window of the Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graphs. In fact, these results follow from an analog theorem we prove regarding the minimum spanning forest of critical random graphs.</description>

      <title>Weak uniqueness by noise for singular stochastic PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.01642v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove weak uniqueness of mild solutions for a general class of SPDEs on a Hilbert space. The main novelty is that the drift is only defined on a Sobolev-type subspace and no H\"older-continuity assumptions are required. This allows us to cover examples such as equations with divergence-form and non-divergence-form drift, and Cahn--Hilliard-type equations with possibly singular perturbations. The main idea is to consider a suitable coloured Wiener noise so that both the solvability of the SPDE and the regularising effect of the Kolmogorov operator are preserved via stochastic maximal regularity results. As a by-product, this also allows us to generalise the available results of uniqueness by noise for perturbations of the heat equation to higher dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.17038v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a short proof for the exponential equivalence between misanthrope processes in contact with weak reservoirs and those with impermeable boundaries. As a consequence, we can derive both the hydrodynamic limit and the large deviations of the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process (TASEP) in contact with weak reservoirs. This extends a recent result which proved the hydrodynamic behaviour of a vanishing viscocity approximation of the TASEP in contact with weak reservoirs. Further applications to a class of asymmetric exclusion processes with long jumps are discussed.</description>

      <title>A priori bounds for quasi-linear SPDEs in the full sub-critical regime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2103.11039v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with quasi-linear parabolic equations driven by an additive forcing $\xi \in C^{\alpha-2}$, in the full sub-critical regime $\alpha \in (0,1)$. We are inspired by Hairer's regularity structures, however we work with a more parsimonious model indexed by multi-indices rather than trees. This allows us to capture additional symmetries which play a crucial role in our analysis. Assuming bounds on this model, which is modified in agreement with the concept of algebraic renormalization, we prove local a priori estimates on solutions to the quasi-linear equations modified by the corresponding counter terms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.05561v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we present the theory of lacunary trigonometric sums and lacunary sums of dilated functions, from the origins of the subject up to recent developments. We describe the connections with mathematical topics such as equidistribution and discrepancy, metric number theory, normality, pseudorandomness, Diophantine equations, and the subsequence principle. In the final section of the paper we prove new results which provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the central limit theorem for subsequences, in the spirit of Nikishin's resonance theorem for convergence systems. More precisely, we characterize those sequences of random variables which allow to extract a subsequence satisfying a strong form of the central limit theorem.</description>

      <title>Stability of Sequential Lateration and of Stress Minimization in the Presence of Noise</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.10900v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sequential lateration is a class of methods for multidimensional scaling where a suitable subset of nodes is first embedded by some method, e.g., a clique embedded by classical scaling, and then the remaining nodes are recursively embedded by lateration. A graph is a lateration graph when it can be embedded by such a procedure. We provide a stability result for a particular variant of sequential lateration. We do so in a setting where the dissimilarities represent noisy Euclidean distances between nodes in a geometric lateration graph. We then deduce, as a corollary, a perturbation bound for stress minimization. To argue that our setting applies broadly, we show that a (large) random geometric graph is a lateration graph with high probability under mild conditions, extending a previous result of Aspnes et al (2006).</description>

      <title>Partial Information Decomposition for Continuous Variables based on Shared Exclusions: Analytical Formulation and Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.06373v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Describing statistical dependencies is foundational to empirical scientific research. For uncovering intricate and possibly non-linear dependencies between a single target variable and several source variables within a system, a principled and versatile framework can be found in the theory of Partial Information Decomposition (PID). Nevertheless, the majority of existing PID measures are restricted to categorical variables, while many systems of interest in science are continuous. In this paper, we present a novel analytic formulation for continuous redundancy--a generalization of mutual information--drawing inspiration from the concept of shared exclusions in probability space as in the discrete PID definition of $I^\mathrm{sx}_\cap$. Furthermore, we introduce a nearest-neighbor based estimator for continuous PID, and showcase its effectiveness by applying it to a simulated energy management system provided by the Honda Research Institute Europe GmbH. This work bridges the gap between the measure-theoretically postulated existence proofs for a continuous $I^\mathrm{sx}_\cap$ and its practical application to real-world scientific problems.</description>

      <title>Free energy expansions of a conditional GinUE and large deviations of the smallest eigenvalue of the LUE</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18983v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a planar Coulomb gas ensemble of size $N$ with the inverse temperature $\beta=2$ and external potential $Q(z)=|z|^2-2c \log|z-a|$, where $c&gt;0$ and $a \in \mathbb{C}$. Equivalently, this model can be realised as $N$ eigenvalues of the complex Ginibre matrix of size $(c+1) N \times (c+1) N$ conditioned to have deterministic eigenvalue $a$ with multiplicity $cN$. Depending on the values of $c$ and $a$, the droplet reveals a phase transition: it is doubly connected in the post-critical regime and simply connected in the pre-critical regime. In both regimes, we derive precise large-$N$ expansions of the free energy up to the $O(1)$ term, providing a non-radially symmetric example that confirms the Zabrodin-Wiegmann conjecture made for general planar Coulomb gas ensembles. As a consequence, our results provide asymptotic behaviours of moments of the characteristic polynomial of the complex Ginibre matrix, where the powers are of order $O(N)$. Furthermore, by combining with a duality formula, we obtain precise large deviation probabilities of the smallest eigenvalue of the Laguerre unitary ensemble. Our proof is based on a refined Riemann-Hilbert analysis for planar orthogonal polynomials using the partial Schlesinger transform.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14396v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a class of infinite horizon fully coupled McKean-Vlasov forward-backward stochastic differential equations (FBSDEs). We propose a generalized monotonicity condition involving two flexible functions. Under this condition, we establish the well-posedness results for infinite horizon McKean-Vlasov FBSDEs by the method of continuation, including the unique solvability, an estimate of the solution, and the related continuous dependence property of the solution on the coefficients. Based on the solvability result, we study an infinite horizon mean field control problem. Moreover, by choosing appropriate form of the flexible functions, we can eliminate the different phenomenon between the linear-quadratic (LQ) problems on infinite horizon and finite horizon proposed in Wei and Yu (SIAM J. Control Optim. 59: 2594-2623, 2021).</description>
