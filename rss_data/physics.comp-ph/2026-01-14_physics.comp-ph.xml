      <title>ChemXDyn: Dynamics-informed species and reaction detection methodology from atomistic simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate identification of chemical species and reaction pathways from molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories is a prerequisite for deriving predictive chemical-kinetic models and for mechanistic discovery in reactive systems. However, state-of-the-art trajectory analysis methods infer bonding from instantaneous distance thresholds, which can misclassify transient, nonreactive encounters as bonds and thereby introduce spurious intermediates, distorted reaction networks, and biased rate estimates. Here, we introduce ChemXDyn, a dynamics-aware computational methodology that leverages time-resolved interatomic distance signatures as a core principle to robustly identify chemically consistent bonded interactions and, consequently, extract meaningful reaction pathways. In particular, ChemXDyn propagates molecular connectivity through time while enforcing atomic valence and coordination constraints to distinguish genuine bond-breaking and bond-forming events from transient, nonreactive encounters. We evaluate ChemXDyn on ReaxFF MD simulations of hydrogen and ammonia oxidation and on neural-network potential MD simulations of methane oxidation, and benchmark its performance against widely used trajectory analysis methods. Across these cases, ChemXDyn suppresses unphysical species prevalent in static analyses, recovers experimentally consistent reaction pathways, and improves the fidelity of rate constant estimation. In ammonia oxidation, ChemXDyn removes unphysical intermediates and resolves key NOx- and N2O-forming and -consuming routes. In methane oxidation, it reconstructs the canonical progression from CH4 to CO2. By linking atomistic dynamics to chemically consistent reaction identification, ChemXDyn provides a transferable foundation for MD-derived reaction networks and kinetics, with potential utility spanning combustion, catalysis, plasma chemistry, and electrochemical environments.</description>

      <title>Multi-Task Fine-Tuning Enables Robust Out-of-Distribution Generalization in Atomistic Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate de novo molecular and materials design requires structure-property models that generalize beyond known regimes. Although pretrained atomistic models achieve strong in-distribution accuracy after fine-tuning, their reliability under out-of-distribution (OOD) conditions remains unclear. We identify a critical failure mode in downstream adaptation: standard fine-tuning induces representation collapse, erasing pretrained chemical and structural priors and severely degrading OOD performance. To address this limitation, we propose multi-task fine-tuning (MFT), which jointly optimizes downstream property prediction with a physically grounded force-field objective inherited from pretraining. This approach preserves essential chemical priors while enabling task-specific adaptation. Across molecular and materials benchmarks, MFT consistently improves OOD generalization, approaching the theoretical limit set by in-distribution accuracy, while outperforming standard fine-tuning, training from scratch, and state-of-the-art task-specific models. These results establish safe adaptation as a central requirement for large atomistic models and position MFT as a practical and data-efficient pathway toward robust molecular and materials discovery.</description>

      <title>Low energy excitations in a long prism geometry: computing the lower critical dimension of the Ising spin glass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07926v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a general method for studying systems that display excitations with arbitrarily low energy in their low-temperature phase. We argue that in a rectangular right prism geometry, with longitudinal size much larger than the transverse size, correlations decay exponentially (at all temperatures) along the longitudinal dimension, but the scaling of the correlation length with the transverse size carries crucial information from which the lower critical dimension can be inferred. The method is applied in the particularly demanding context of Ising spin glasses at zero magnetic field. The lower critical dimension and the multifractal spectrum for the correlation function are computed from large-scale numerical simulations. Several technical novelties (such as the unexpectedly crucial performance of Houdayer's cluster method or the convenience of using open - rather than periodic - boundary conditions) allow us to study three-dimensional prisms with transverse dimensions up to $L=24$ and effectively infinite longitudinal dimensions down to low temperatures. The value that we find for the lower critical dimension turns out to be in agreement with expectations from both the Replica Symmetry Breaking theory and the Droplet model for spin glasses. We argue that our novel setting holds promise in clarifying which of the two competing theories more accurately describes three-dimensional spin glasses.</description>

      <title>Autonomous Materials Exploration by Integrating Automated Phase Identification and AI-Assisted Human Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08185v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous experimentation holds the potential to accelerate materials development by combining artificial intelligence (AI) with modular robotic platforms to explore extensive combinatorial chemical and processing spaces. Such self-driving laboratories can not only increase the throughput of repetitive experiments, but also incorporate human domain expertise to drive the search towards user-defined objectives, including improved materials performance metrics. We present an autonomous materials synthesis extension to SARA, the Scientific Autonomous Reasoning Agent, utilizing phase information provided by an automated probabilistic phase labeling algorithm to expedite the search for targeted phase regions. By incorporating human input into an expanded SARA-H (SARA with human-in-the-loop) framework, we enhance the efficiency of the underlying reasoning process. Using synthetic benchmarks, we demonstrate the efficiency of our AI implementation and show that the human input can contribute to significant improvement in sampling efficiency. We conduct experimental active learning campaigns using robotic processing of thin-film samples of several oxide material systems, including Bi$_2$O$_3$, SnO$_x$, and Bi-Ti-O, using lateral-gradient laser spike annealing to synthesize and kinetically trap metastable phases. We showcase the utility of human-in-the-loop autonomous experimentation for the Bi-Ti-O system, where we identify extensive processing domains that stabilize $\delta$-Bi$_2$O$_3$ and Bi$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$, explore dwell-dependent ternary oxide phase behavior, and provide evidence confirming predictions that cationic substitutional doping of TiO$_2$ with Bi inhibits the unfavorable transformation of the metastable anatase to the ground-state rutile phase. The autonomous methods we have developed enable the discovery of new materials and new understanding of materials synthesis and properties.</description>

      <title>Lattice Boltzmann methods for simulating non-Newtonian fluids: A comprehensive review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-Newtonian fluids encompass a large family of fluids with additional nonlinear material properties, contributing to non-trivial flow behaviour that cannot be captured through a single constant viscosity term. Common non-Newtonian characteristics include shear-thinning, shear-thickening, viscoplasticity, and viscoelasticity, commonly encountered in everyday fluids, such as ketchup, blood, toothpaste, mud, etc., as well as practical applications involving porous media, cosmetics, food processing, and pharmaceuticals. Due to the complex nature of these fluids, accurate computational fluid dynamics simulations are essential for predicting their behaviour under various flow conditions. Recent advancements have highlighted the growing trend of using the lattice Boltzmann method to solve such complex flows, owing to its ability to handle intricate boundary conditions, ease of including additional multiphysics, and providing computationally efficient parallel simulations. Since the initial review over a decade ago [Phillips &amp; Roberts, IMA J. Appl. Math. 76, 790-816 (2011)], significant advancements have been made to the lattice Boltzmann method to simulate non-Newtonian fluids. Here, we present a comprehensive review of different lattice Boltzmann techniques used to solve non-Newtonian fluid systems, specifically dealing with shear-dependent viscosity, viscoplasticity, and viscoelasticity. In addition, we discuss various benchmark cases that validate these approaches and highlight their growing application to realistic and challenging complex flow problems. We further address outstanding issues in current lattice Boltzmann models, as well as future directions for numerical advancement and application.</description>

      <title>An open-source computational framework for immersed fluid-structure interaction modeling using FEBio and MFEM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fluid-structure interaction (FSI) simulation of biological systems presents significant computational challenges, particularly for applications involving large structural deformations and contact mechanics, such as heart valve dynamics. Traditional ALE methods encounter fundamental difficulties with such problems due to mesh distortion, motivating immersed techniques. This work presents a novel open-source immersed FSI framework that strategically couples two mature finite element libraries: MFEM, a GPU-ready and scalable library with state-of-the-art parallel performance developed at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, and FEBio, a nonlinear finite element solver with sophisticated solid mechanics capabilities designed for biomechanics applications developed at the University of Utah. This coupling creates a unique synergy wherein the fluid solver leverages MFEM's distributed-memory parallelization and pathway to GPU acceleration, while the immersed solid exploits FEBio's comprehensive suite of hyperelastic and viscoelastic constitutive models and advanced solid mechanics modeling targeted for biomechanics applications. FSI coupling is achieved using a fictitious domain methodology with variational multiscale stabilization for enhanced accuracy on under-resolved grids expected with unfitted meshes used in immersed FSI. A fully implicit, monolithic scheme provides robust coupling for strongly coupled FSI characteristic of cardiovascular applications. The framework's modular architecture facilitates straightforward extension to additional physics and element technologies. Several test problems are considered to demonstrate the capabilities of the proposed framework, including a 3D semilunar heart valve simulation. This platform addresses a critical need for open-source immersed FSI software combining advanced biomechanics modeling with high-performance computing infrastructure.</description>

      <title>MinGLE: A Minimalist, Configurable, and Pedagogical Geant4 Application Template</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08469v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Geant4 toolkit is the leading software for the simulation of particle transport through matter, widely used in nuclear physics, high-energy physics, and medical physics. However, the initial learning curve for new developers can be steep, often due to the complexity and experiment-specific nature of many introductory examples. This paper introduces MinGLE (Mini Geant4 Learning Example), a dedicated application template designed to be a universal, flexible, and educational starting point for Geant4 projects. MinGLE achieves a complete, functional simulation kernel using fewer than 70 lines of core C++ code. This minimalism is realized by leveraging contemporary Geant4 features, including factory classes for run management and physics, and the Text Geometry format for detector definition. Furthermore, MinGLE employs a unique pedagogical structure, using Git tags to document the incremental development of eleven core Geant4 components, with each tagged version being fully compilable, executable, and testable, providing a clear, step-by-step learning resource.</description>

      <title>Excitonic Landscape of Monolayer Transition-Metal Dichalcogenides: Experimental Discrepancies, Theoretical Advances, and Strain Dependence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Excitons in monolayer transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have garnered significant attention because of their large binding energies due to weakly screened Coulomb interaction, and direct bandgap at the K/K$^\prime$ point in the hexagonal Brillouin zone featuring spin-polarised bands due to spin-orbit coupling and lack of inversion symmetry. This makes them prospective for next-generation optoelectronic and quantum devices. However, despite the intense research activity, the reported values for exciton binding energies, quasiparticle gaps, and spectral features exhibit substantial variation across both experimental and theoretical studies. In this article, we present a comprehensive and critical assessment of the current understanding of excitonic properties in single-layer TMDs, integrating results from the angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), photoluminescence (PL) measurements, and other experimental techniques with first-principles theoretical insights. Special emphasis is placed on the comparison and reconciliation of discrepancies observed across different experimental setups and sample qualities. Furthermore, we highlight our state-of-the-art GW-BSE calculations, which include both equilibrium and laterally strained systems, to systematically analyse the behaviour of direct and indirect excitons. By evaluating the effect of strain as a tunable control variable, we demonstrate its potential to engineer excitonic properties, supported by cross-validation against prior theoretical predictions and experimental findings. In doing so, we clarify the sources of discrepancies in the literature and offer a unified perspective on excited-state engineering strategies in two-dimensional TMDs.</description>

      <title>Cyclic- and helical-symmetry-adapted phonon formalism within density functional perturbation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08745v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a first-principles framework for the calculation of phonons in nanostructures with cyclic and/or helical symmetry. In particular, we derive a cyclic- and helical-symmetry-adapted representation of the dynamical matrix at arbitrary phonon wavevectors within a variationally formulated, symmetry-adapted density functional perturbation theory framework. In so doing, we also derive the acoustic sum rules for cylindrical geometries, which include a rigid-body rotational mode in addition to the three translational modes. We implement the cyclic- and helical-symmetry-adapted formalism within a high-order finite-difference discretization. Using carbon nanotubes as representative systems, we demonstrate the accuracy of the framework through excellent agreement with periodic plane-wave results. We further apply the framework to compute the Young's and shear moduli of carbon nanotubes, as well as the scaling laws governing the dependence of ring and radial breathing mode phonon frequencies on nanotube diameter. The elastic moduli are found to be in agreement with previous density functional theory and experimental results, while the phonon scaling laws show qualitative agreement with previous atomistic simulations.</description>

      <title>Gradient-free online learning of subgrid-scale dynamics with neural emulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.19385v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a generic algorithm to train machine learning-based subgrid parametrizations online, i.e., with \textit{a posteriori} loss functions, but for non-differentiable numerical solvers. The proposed approach leverages a neural emulator to approximate the reduced state-space solver, which is then used to allow gradient propagation through temporal integration steps. We apply this methodology on a chaotic two-timescales Lorenz-96 system and a single layer quasi-geostrophic system with zonal dynamics, known to be highly unstable with offline strategies. Using our algorithm, we are able to train a parametrization that recovers most of the benefits of online strategies without having to compute the gradient of the original solver. We found that training the neural emulator and parametrization components separately with different loss quantities is necessary in order to minimize the propagation of approximation biases. Experiments on emulator architectures with different complexities also indicates that emulator performance is key in order to learn an accurate parametrization. This work is a step towards learning parametrization with online strategies for climate models.</description>

      <title>Tensor Decomposition Networks for Fast Machine Learning Interatomic Potential Computations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01131v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: $\rm{SO}(3)$-equivariant networks are the dominant models for machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs). The key operation of such networks is the Clebsch-Gordan (CG) tensor product, which is computationally expensive. To accelerate the computation, we develop tensor decomposition networks (TDNs) as a class of approximately equivariant networks in which CG tensor products are replaced by low-rank tensor decompositions, such as the CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) decomposition. With the CP decomposition, we prove (i) a uniform bound on the induced error of $\rm{SO}(3)$-equivariance, and (ii) the universality of approximating any equivariant bilinear map. To further reduce the number of parameters, we propose path-weight sharing that ties all multiplicity-space weights across the $\mathcal{O}(L^3)$ CG paths into a single shared parameter set without compromising equivariance, where $L$ is the maximum angular degree. The resulting layer acts as a plug-and-play replacement for tensor products in existing networks, and the computational complexity of tensor products is reduced from $\mathcal{O}(L^6)$ to $\mathcal{O}(L^4)$. We evaluate TDNs on PubChemQCR, a newly curated molecular relaxation dataset containing 105 million DFT-calculated snapshots. We also use existing datasets, including OC20, and OC22. Results show that TDNs achieve competitive performance with dramatic speedup in computations. Our code is publicly available as part of the AIRS library (\href{https://github.com/divelab/AIRS/tree/main/OpenMol/TDN}{https://github.com/divelab/AIRS/}).</description>

      <title>Electron neural closure for turbulent magnetosheath simulations: energy channels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.00282v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce a non-local five-moment electron pressure tensor closure parametrized by a Fully Convolutional Neural Network (FCNN). Electron pressure plays an important role in generalized Ohm's law, competing with electron inertia. This model is used in the development of a surrogate model for a fully kinetic energy-conserving semi-implicit Particle-in-Cell simulation of decaying magnetosheath turbulence. We achieve this by training FCNN on a representative set of simulations with a smaller number of particles per cell and showing that our results generalise to a simulation with a large number of particles per cell. We evaluate the statistical properties of the learned equation of state, with a focus on pressure-strain interaction, which is crucial for understanding energy channels in turbulent plasmas. The resulting equation of state learned via FCNN significantly outperforms local closures, such as those learned by Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) or double adiabatic expressions. We report that the overall spatial distribution of pressure-strain and its conditional averages are reconstructed well. However, some small-scale features are missed, especially for the off-diagonal components of the pressure tensor. Nevertheless, the results are substantially improved with more training data, indicating favorable scaling and potential for improvement, which will be addressed in future work.</description>

Abstract: Understanding how network structure constrains and enables information processing is a central problem in the statistical mechanics of interacting systems. Here we study random networks across the structural percolation transition and analyze how connectivity governs realizable input-output transformations under cascade dynamics. Using Erdos-Renyi networks as a minimal ensemble, we examine structural, functional, and information-theoretic observables as functions of mean degree. We find that the emergence of the giant connected component coincides with a sharp transition in realizable information processing: complex input-output response functions become accessible, functional diversity increases rapidly, output entropy rises, and directed information flow, quantified by transfer entropy, extends beyond local neighborhoods. We term this coincidence of structural, functional, and informational transitions functional percolation, referring to a sharp expansion of the space of realizable input-output functions at the percolation threshold. Near criticality, networks exhibit a Pareto-optimal tradeoff between functional complexity and diversity, suggesting that percolation criticality may provide a general organizing principle of information processing capacity in systems with local interactions and propagating influences.</description>
