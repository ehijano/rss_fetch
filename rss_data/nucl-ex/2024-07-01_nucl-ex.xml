      <title>Calculation of crystal defects induced in CaWO$_{4}$ by 100 eV displacement cascades using a linear Machine Learning interatomic potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00133v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We determine the energy stored in the crystal defects induced by $\mathcal{O}(10-100)$\,eV nuclear recoils in low-threshold CaWO$_{4}$ cryogenic detectors. A Machine Learning interatomic potential is developed to perform molecular dynamics simulations. We show that the energy spectra expected from Dark Matter and neutrino coherent scattering are affected by the crystal defects and we provide reference predictions. We discuss the special case of the spectrum of nuclear recoils induced by neutron capture, which could offer a unique sensitivity to the calculated stored energies.</description>

      <title>Imaging of single barium atoms in a second matrix site in solid xenon for barium tagging in a $^{136}$Xe double beta decay experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutrinoless double beta decay is one of the most sensitive probes for new physics beyond the Standard Model of particle physics. One of the isotopes under investigation is $^{136}$Xe, which would double beta decay into $^{136}$Ba. Detecting the single $^{136}$Ba daughter provides a sort of ultimate tool in the discrimination against backgrounds. Previous work demonstrated the ability to perform single atom imaging of Ba atoms in a single-vacancy site of a solid xenon matrix. In this paper, the effort to identify signal from individual barium atoms is extended to Ba atoms in a hexa-vacancy site in the matrix and is achieved despite increased photobleaching in this site. Abrupt fluorescence turn-off of a single Ba atom is also observed. Significant recovery of fluorescence signal lost through photobleaching is demonstrated upon annealing of Ba deposits in the Xe ice. Following annealing, it is observed that Ba atoms in the hexa-vacancy site exhibit antibleaching while Ba atoms in the tetra-vacancy site exhibit bleaching. This may be evidence for a matrix site transfer upon laser excitation. Our findings offer a path of continued research toward tagging of Ba daughters in all significant sites in solid xenon.</description>

      <title>Mechanisms of mirror energy difference for states exhibiting Thomas-Ehrman shift: Gamow shell model case studies of $^{18}$Ne/$^{18}$O and $^{19}$Na/$^{19}$O</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00884v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The mirror energy difference (MED) of the mirror state, especially for states bearing the Thomas-Erhman shift, serves as a sensitive probe of isospin symmetry breaking. We employ the Gamow shell model, which includes the inter-nucleon correlation and continuum coupling, to investigate the MED for $sd$-shell nuclei by taking the $^{18}$Ne/$^{18}$O and $^{19}$Na/$^{19}$O as examples. Our GSM provides good descriptions for the excitation energies and MEDs for the $^{18}$Ne/$^{18}$O and $^{19}$Na/$^{19}$O. Moreover, our calculations also reveal that the large MED of the mirror states is caused by the significant occupation of the weakly bound or unbound $s_{1/2}$ waves, giving the radial density distribution of the state in the proton-rich nucleus more extended than that of mirror states in deeply-bound neutron-rich nuclei. Furthermore, our GSM calculation shows that the contribution of Coulomb is different for the low-lying states in proton-rich nuclei, which significantly contributes to MEDs of mirror states. Moreover, the contributions of the nucleon-nucleon interaction are different for the mirror state, especially for the state of proton-rich nuclei bearing the Thomas-Erhman shift, which also contributes to the significant isospin symmetry breaking with large MED.</description>

      <title>Applying Deep Learning Technique to Chiral Magnetic Wave Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00926v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The chiral magnetic wave (CMW) is a collective mode in quark-gluon plasma originated from the chiral magnetic effect (CME) and chiral separation effect. Its detection in heavy-ion collisions is challenging due to significant background contamination. In Ref.[1], we have constructed a neural network which can accurately identify the CME-related signal from the final-state pion spectra. In this paper, we generalize such a neural network to the case of CMW search. We show that, after a updated training, the neural network can effectively recognize the CMW-related signal. Additionally, we assess the performance of the neural network compared to other known methods for CMW search.</description>

      <title>Measurement of the inclusive isolated-photon production cross section in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01165v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The production cross section of inclusive isolated photons has been measured by the ALICE experiment at the CERN LHC in pp collisions at centre-of-momentum energy of $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV collected during the LHC Run 2 data-taking period. The measurement is performed by combining the measurements of the electromagnetic calorimeter EMCal and the central tracking detectors ITS and TPC, covering a pseudorapidity range of $|\eta^{\gamma}|&lt;0.67$ and a transverse momentum range of $7&lt;p_{\rm T}^{\gamma}&lt;200$ GeV/$c$. The result extends to lower $p_{\rm T}^{\gamma}$ and $x_{\rm T}^{\gamma} = 2p_{\rm T}^{\gamma}/\sqrt{s}$ ranges, the lowest $x_{\rm T}^{\gamma}$ of any isolated photon measurements to date, extending significantly those measured by the ATLAS and CMS experiments towards lower $p_{\rm T}^{\gamma}$ at the same collision energy with a small overlap between the measurements. The measurement is compared with next-to-leading order perturbative QCD calculations and the results from the ATLAS and CMS experiments as well as with measurements at other collision energies. The measurement and theory prediction are in agreement with each other within the experimental and theoretical uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Electroproduction of the Lambda/Sigma^0 hyperons at Q^2~0.5 (GeV/c)^2 in forward angles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01173v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 2018, the E12-17-003 experiment was conducted at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (JLab) to explore the possible existence of an nnLambda state in the reconstructed missing mass distribution from a tritium gas target [K. N. Suzuki et al., Prog. Theor. Exp. Phys. 2022, 013D01 (2022), B. Pandey et al., Phys. Rev. C 105, L051001 (2022)]. As part of this investigation, data was also collected using a gaseous hydrogen target, not only for a precise absolute mass scale calibration but also for the study of Lambda/Sigma^0 electroproduction. This dataset was acquired at Q^2~0.5 (GeV/c)^2, W=2.14 GeV, and theta_{gamma K}^{c.m.}~8 deg. It covers forward angles where photoproduction data is scarce and a low-Q^2 region that is of interest for hypernuclear experiments. On the other hand, this kinematic region is at a slightly higher Q^2 than previous hypernuclear experiments, thus providing crucial information for understanding the Q^2 dependence of the differential cross sections for Lambda/Sigma^0 hyperon electroproduction. This paper reports on the Q^2 dependence of the differential cross section for the e + p -&gt; e' + K^+ + Lambda/Sigma^0 reaction in the 0.2-0.8 (GeV/c)^2, and provides comparisons with the currently available theoretical models.</description>

      <title>A measurement of the sodium and iodine scintillation quenching factors across multiple NaI(Tl) detectors to identify systematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12480v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The amount of light produced by nuclear recoils in scintillating targets is strongly quenched compared to that produced by electrons. A precise understanding of the quenching factor is particularly interesting for WIMP searches and CE{\nu}NS measurements since both rely on nuclear recoils, whereas energy calibrations are more readily accessible from electron recoils. There is a wide variation among the current measurements of the quenching factor in sodium iodide (NaI) crystals, especially below 10 keV, the energy region of interest for dark matter and CE{\nu}NS studies. A better understanding of the quenching factor in NaI(Tl) is of particular interest for resolving the decades-old puzzle in the field of dark matter between the null results of most WIMP searches and the claim for dark matter detection by the DAMA/LIBRA collaboration. In this work, we measured sodium and iodine quenching factors for five small NaI(Tl) crystals grown with similar thallium concentrations and growth procedures. Unlike previous experiments, multiple crystals were tested, with measurements made in the same experimental setup to control systematic effects. The quenching factors agree in all crystals we investigated, and both sodium and iodine quenching factors are smaller than those reported by DAMA/LIBRA. The dominant systematic effect was due to the electron equivalent energy calibration originating from the non-proportional behavior of the NaI(Tl) light yield at lower energies, potentially the cause for the discrepancies among the previous measurements.</description>

      <title>Non-equilibrium Green's function approach to low-energy fission dynamics: fluctuations in fission reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04255v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a microscopic modeling for a decay of a heavy compound nucleus, starting from a nucleonic degree of freedom. To this end, we develop an approach based on a non-equilibrium Green's function, which is combined with a configuration interaction (CI) approach based on a constrained density-functional theory (DFT). We apply this approach to a barrier-top fission of $^{236}$U, restricting the model space to seniority zero configurations of neutrons and protons. We particularly focus on the distribution of the fission probability. We find that it approximately follows the chi-squared distribution with the number of degrees of freedom $\nu$ of the order of 1, which is consistent with the experimental finding. We also show that $\nu$ corresponds to the number of eigenstates of the many-body Hamiltonian whose energy is close to the excitation energy of the system and at the same time which have significant components on both sides of a fission barrier.</description>

      <title>Role of hidden-color components in the tetraquark mixing model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18411v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multiquarks can have two-hadron components and hidden-color components in their wave functions. The presence of two-hadron components in multiquarks introduces a potential source of confusion, particularly with respect to their resemblance to hadronic molecules. On the other hand, hidden-color components are essential for distinguishing between multiquarks and hadronic molecules. In this work, we study the hidden-color components in the wave functions of the tetraquark mixing model, a model that has been proposed as a suitable framework for describing the properties of two nonets in the $J^P=0^+$ channel: the light nonet [$a_0 (980)$, $K_0^* (700)$, $f_0 (500)$, $f_0 (980)$] and the heavy nonet [$a_0 (1450)$, $K_0^* (1430)$, $f_0 (1370)$, $f_0 (1500)$]. Our analysis reveals a substantial presence of hidden-color components within the tetraquark wave functions. To elucidate the impact of hidden-color components on physical quantities, we conduct computations of the hyperfine masses, $\langle V_{CS}\rangle$, for the two nonets, considering scenarios involving only the two-meson components and those incorporating the hidden-color components. We demonstrate that the hidden-color components constitute an important part of the hyperfine masses, such that the mass difference formula, $\Delta M\approx \Delta \langle V_{CS}\rangle$, which has been successful for the two nonets, cannot be achieved without the hidden-color contributions. This can provide another evidence supporting the tetraquark nature of the two nonets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00693v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose two approaches for extracting the total gluon helicity contribution to proton spin from lattice QCD, one from local operator matrix elements in a fixed gauge accessible on lattice with feasible renormalization, and the other from gauge-invariant nonlocal gluon correlators. Neither of these approaches requires a matching procedure when converted to the MS scheme. Our proposal resolves a long-standing inconsistency in the literature regarding lattice calculations of the total gluon helicity, and has the potential to greatly facilitate these calculations.</description>

      <title>Wobbling motion in triaxial nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02747v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The experimental evidence for the collective wobbling motion of triaxial nuclei is reviewed. The classification into transverse and longitudinal in the presence of quasiparticle excitations is discussed. The description by means of the quasiparticle+triaxial rotor model is discussed in detail.
  The structure of the states is analyzed using the spin-coherent-state and spin-squeezed-state representations of the reduced density matrices of the total and particle angular momenta, which distill the corresponding classical precessional motions. Various approximate solutions of the quasiparticle+triaxial rotor model are evaluated.
  The microscopic studies of wobbling in the small-amplitude random phase approximation are discussed. Selected studies of wobbling by means of the triaxial projected shell model are presented, which focus on how this microscopic approach removes certain deficiencies of the semi-microscopic quasiparticle+triaxial rotor model.</description>

      <title>A More Precise Measurement of the Radius of PSR J0740+6620 Using Updated NICER Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14467v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: PSR J0740+6620 is the neutron star with the highest precisely determined mass, inferred from radio observations to be $2.08\pm0.07\,\rm M_\odot$. Measurements of its radius therefore hold promise to constrain the properties of the cold, catalyzed, high-density matter in neutron star cores. Previously, Miller et al. (2021) and Riley et al. (2021) reported measurements of the radius of PSR J0740+6620 based on Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) observations accumulated through 17 April 2020, and an exploratory analysis utilizing NICER background estimates and a data set accumulated through 28 December 2021 was presented in Salmi et al. (2022). Here we report an updated radius measurement, derived by fitting models of X-ray emission from the neutron star surface to NICER data accumulated through 21 April 2022, totaling $\sim1.1$ Ms additional exposure compared to the data set analyzed in Miller et al. (2021) and Riley et al. (2021), and to data from X-ray Multi-Mirror (XMM-Newton) observations. We find that the equatorial circumferential radius of PSR J0740+6620 is $12.92_{-1.13}^{+2.09}$ km (68% credibility), a fractional uncertainty $\sim83\%$ the width of that reported in Miller et al. (2021), in line with statistical expectations given the additional data. If we were to require the radius to be less than 16 km, as was done in Salmi et al. (2024), then our 68% credible region would become $R=12.76^{+1.49}_{-1.02}$ km, which is close to the headline result of Salmi et al. (2024). Our updated measurements, along with other laboratory and astrophysical constraints, imply a slightly softer equation of state than that inferred from our previous measurements.</description>
