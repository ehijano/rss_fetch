      <title>Strange Attractors in Complex Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08629v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Disorder and noise in physical systems often disrupt spatial and temporal regularity, yet chaotic systems reveal how order can emerge from unpredictable behavior. Complex networks, spatial analogs of chaos, exhibit disordered, non-Euclidean architectures with hidden symmetries, hinting at spontaneous order. Finding low-dimensional embeddings that reveal network patterns and link them to dimensionality that governs universal behavior remains a fundamental open challenge, as it needs to bridge the gap between microscopic disorder and macroscopic regularities. Here, the minimal space revealing key network properties is introduced, showing that non-integer dimensions produce chaotic-like attractors.</description>

      <title>Sociohydrodynamics: data-driven modelling of social behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17627v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Living systems display complex behaviors driven by physical forces as well as decision-making. Hydrodynamic theories hold promise for simplified universal descriptions of socially-generated collective behaviors. However, the construction of such theories is often divorced from the data they should describe. Here, we develop and apply a data-driven pipeline that links micromotives to macrobehavior by augmenting hydrodynamics with individual preferences that guide motion. We illustrate this pipeline on a case study of residential dynamics in the United States, for which census and sociological data is available. Guided by Census data, sociological surveys, and neural network analysis, we systematically assess standard hydrodynamic assumptions to construct a sociohydrodynamic model. Solving our simple hydrodynamic model, calibrated using statistical inference, qualitatively captures key features of residential dynamics at the level of individual US counties. We highlight that a social memory, akin to hysteresis in magnets, emerges in the segregation-integration transition even with memory-less agents. This suggests an explanation for the phenomenon of neighborhood tipping, whereby a small change in a neighborhood's population leads to a rapid demographic shift. Beyond residential segregation, our work paves the way for systematic investigations of decision-guided motility in real space, from micro-organisms to humans, as well as fitness-mediated motion in more abstract genomic spaces.</description>

      <title>Topological Symmetry Breaking in Antagonistic Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00144v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A dynamic concordia discors, a finely tuned equilibrium between opposing forces, is hypothesized to drive historical transformations. Similarly, a precise interplay of excitation and inhibition, the 80:20 ratio, is at the basis of the normal functionality of neural systems. In artificial neural networks, reinforcement learning allows for fine-tuning internal signed connections, optimizing adaptive responses to complex stimuli, and ensuring robust performance. At present, engineered structures of competing components are, however, largely unexplored, particularly because their emergent phases are closely linked with frustration mechanisms in the hosting network. In this context, the spin glass theory has shown how an apparently uncontrollable non-ergodic chaotic behavior arises from the complex interplay of competing interactions and frustration among units, leading to multiple metastable states preventing the system from exploring all accessible configurations over time. Here, we tackle the problem of disentangling topology and dynamics in systems with antagonistic interactions. We make use of the signed Laplacian operator to demonstrate how fundamental topological defects in lattices and networks percolate, shaping the geometrical arena and complex energy landscape of the system. This unveils novel, highly robust multistable phases and establishes deep connections with spin glasses when thermal noise is considered, providing a natural topological and algebraic description of their still-unknown set of pure states at zero temperature.</description>
