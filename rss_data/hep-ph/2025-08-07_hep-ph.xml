      <title>High-energy evolution in planar QCD to three loops: the non-conformal contribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Balitsky-Kovchegov (BK) equation offers a tractable description of the high-energy growth of gauge-theory scattering amplitudes and the nonlinear saturation effects that eventually tame it. Motivated by the upcoming Electron-Ion Collider (EIC), whose extended kinematic reach promises more decisive tests of saturation at high energies, we present a framework based on the spacelike-timelike correspondence that streamlines the computation of multi-loop corrections to the BK equation. We explicitly verify the correspondence at three loops in the large-flavor limit and predict the full nonconformal component of the three-loop BK Hamiltonian in the planar limit of a generic gauge theory, treating the numbers of fermions and scalars as free parameters.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Axion Background Detection Using Resonant Cavity Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The axion is a well-motivated and generic extension of the Standard Model. If produced in the early universe, axions may still be relativistic today, forming a Cosmic Axion Background (C$a$B) potentially detectable in direct detection experiments. A key challenge, however, is that the C$a$B is expected to have a broad energy spectrum, limiting the effectiveness of resonant cavity experiments designed for narrowband searches. We propose a new strategy using multi-cavity arrays to distinguish signal from background noise by exploiting spatial correlations in the axion-induced electric fields. We compute the two-point correlation function for electric fields in spatially separated cavities sourced by an isotropic C$a$B. Analyzing various cavity geometries, we find that stacked, wide-base cavity arrays offer optimal sensitivity to the axion signal. We apply our formalism to prospective upgrades of the ADMX experiment, including configurations with four and eighteen coupled cavities.</description>

      <title>Profiling Dark Matter Spikes with Gravitational Waves from Accelerated Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dark matter halos can develop a density spike, e.g., around a galactic supermassive black hole, with the profile $\rho \propto r^{-\gamma_{\rm sp}}$ determined both by the galaxy's formation history and the microphysics of dark matter. We show that future LISA/DECIGO observations, of intermediate/stellar-mass binary mergers inside the spike around the supermassive black hole, can measure $\gamma_{\rm sp}$ at a few-percent--level precision. The spike induces a distinctive time-dependent acceleration along the non-circular orbit taken by the binary's center of mass, which is observable as a secular modulation of the gravitational wave signal. This method -- insensitive to confounding astrophysical effects (dynamical friction, tidal effects, etc.) and not reliant on unknown dark matter particle physics -- provides a clean diagnostic of density spikes and a new probe of dark matter.</description>

      <title>Indirect searches for realistic sub-GeV Dark Matter models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Indirect searches for Dark Matter (DM) particles with mass in the MeV -- GeV scale have received significant attention lately. Pair-annihilations of such DM particles in the Galaxy can give rise to (at the same time) MeV to GeV $\gamma$-rays via prompt emission, sub-GeV $e^\pm$ in cosmic-rays, as well as a broad photon spectrum ranging from $X$-rays to soft $\gamma$-rays, produced by the DM induced $e^\pm$ via inverse Compton scattering, bremsstrahlung and in-flight annihilation processes (collectively called `secondary emissions'). We focus on two representative realistic sub-GeV DM models, namely, the vector-portal kinetic-mixing model and the higgs-portal model, and perform a detailed study of the indirect detection constraints from existing $X$-rays, $\gamma$-rays and cosmic-ray observations, based on all of the above-mentioned signals. We also estimate the future prospects from the upcoming MeV photon telescope COSI, including all possible types of prompt and secondary emission signals. We compare our results with the constraints and (or) projections from cosmological and terrestrial observations. We find that, for both the sub-GeV DM models, the current observations constrain the annihilation cross-section at the level of $\langle \sigma v \rangle \lesssim 10^{-27} {\rm cm}^3/{\rm s}$, or lower for some specific mass ranges or under optimistic assumptions. Moreover, new unconstrained DM parameter space can be probed at the upcoming instruments like COSI, thanks to the inclusion of secondary photons which in many cases provide the dominant signal.</description>

      <title>Flavour Physics Beyond the Standard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flavour physics plays a central role in the search for physics beyond the Standard Model, posing fundamental questions whose answers may point to new physics scales far above the electroweak scale. The flavour structure of the Standard Model is strikingly hierarchical, hinting at underlying organizing principles yet to be uncovered. At the same time, flavour-changing processes rank among the most sensitive probes of new physics. In this chapter, we review how precision measurements of flavour-violating observables, in particular meson-antimeson mixing and rare decays, provide powerful indirect tests of new physics, constraining scenarios from heavy mediators to light, weakly coupled particles. We also survey theoretical frameworks proposed to explain the origin of the Standard Model flavour hierarchies. Together, these complementary aspects demonstrate how flavour physics continues to shape both experimental strategies and theoretical developments in the quest to understand the fundamental structure of particle interactions.</description>

      <title>Theory uncertainties in predictions of strong-field QED</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Experiments using high-power lasers and relativistic electron beams will soon be capable of precision testing of the theory of strong-field quantum electrodynamics. The comparison between experiment and theory always occurs via numerical simulations, but the lack of quantitative uncertainty bounds for the latter means that the origin of any discrepancies cannot be identified conclusively. Here I present a simulation framework that can place meaningful bounds on the theory uncertainties inherent to its operation. This work shows that the use of the locally constant field approximation leads to a theory uncertainty of a few per cent in the signals of quantum radiation reaction expected in near-term experiments.</description>

      <title>A background-free signal of jet-induced diffusion wake in quark-gluon plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rapidity asymmetry of jet-hadron correlation has been proposed as a robust signal of dijet-induced diffusion wake in quark-gluon plasma in high-energy heavy-ion collisions. We generalize this observable to other jet configurations such as {\gamma}/Z0-jets and propose a new method to compute the rapidity asymmetry that is free of background. In this new method, the rapidity of the trigger is fixed or restricted to a symmetrical range while the rapidity of the associated jet is varied. The rapidity asymmetry is defined as the difference between the hadron rapidity distribution in the opposite azimuthal direction of the jet (or the same direction of the trigger) with different associated jet rapidities. Since the background in this hadron rapidity distribution with different associated jet rapidity is identical, it will be completely canceled in the rapidity asymmetry. Such background-free rapidity asymmetry caused by jet-induced diffusion wake is demonstrated in CoLBT-hydro simulations of dijets and {\gamma}-jets in Pb+Pb collisions at the LHC, which weakens as hadron pT increases, and subtraction of a p+p baseline has a negligible effect.</description>

      <title>A neutrino data analysis of extra-dimensional theories with massive bulk fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a global neutrino oscillation analysis of models with a single large extra dimension in which right-handed neutrinos possess bulk Dirac masses. Two scenarios are considered: Large Extra Dimensions with bulk masses and the Dark Dimension framework, both predicting a tower of sterile Kaluza-Klein states that mix with active neutrinos. Using data from MINOS/MINOS+, KamLAND, and Daya Bay, we perform a joint likelihood analysis. No signatures of these theories were found. Therefore, we constrain the compactification radius under different bulk mass and Yukawa coupling assumptions. Large positive bulk masses or sizable Yukawas lead to strong bounds, while small couplings or negative bulk masses remain less constrained.</description>

      <title>A New Source of Phase Transition Gravitational Waves: Heavy Particle Braking Across Bubble Walls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel mechanism for the generation of microscopic gravitational waves (GWs) during cosmological first-order phase transitions, arising from the braking of heavy particles as they traverse bubble walls. Unlike conventional sources such as bubble collision, sound waves or turbulence in the plasma, this mechanism originates from the direct interaction between massive particles and the expanding bubble wall. We use quantum field theory to rigorously compute the gravitational radiation. The resulting GW spectrum exhibits distinctive features: the peak frequency is tightly correlated with the bubble wall velocity, while the peak amplitude scales as the fourth power of the heavy particle mass. These unique dependencies offer a new observational handle on particle physics beyond the Standard Model. We illustrate this mechanism within a specific model framework, demonstrating its viability. Our findings enrich the landscape of phase transition GW sources and open new avenues for more directly probing heavy particle dynamics and new physics model in the early universe.</description>

      <title>A comprehensive study of the charged Higgs boson in the two Higgs doublet type-II seesaw model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the phenomenology of the charged Higgs boson within the Two-Higgs-Doublet Type-II Seesaw Model (2HDMcT Type-III) at future $\mu^+ \mu^-$ colliders. Focusing on $2 \to 2$ processes such as $\mu^+ \mu^- \to H^+_1 S^-$ ($S^- = H^-_1, H^-_2$) and $\mu^+ \mu^- \to H^+_1 W^-$, we incorporate both theoretical and experimental constraints to assess their production prospects. We find that $\sigma(\mu^+ \mu^- \to H_1^+ H_1^-)$ can reach or exceed the corresponding $e^+ e^-$ cross section, while $\sigma(\mu^+ \mu^- \to H_1^+ H_2^-)$ is roughly eighteen times smaller but can be enhanced up to 0.62 fb upon relaxing electroweak precision observables constraints. Moreover, we observe that the cross section for $\mu^+ \mu^- \to H^+_1 W^-$ is significantly enhanced due to the large $\tan\beta$ amplification characteristic of the Type-III scenario. Furthermore, we conduct a signal-background analysis and determine the discovery ($5\sigma$) regions at a 3 TeV muon collider for the $\mu^+ \mu^- \to H_1^+ H_1^-$, $\mu^+ \mu^- \to H_1^+ H_2^-$, and $\mu^+ \mu^- \to W^\pm H_1^\mp$ processes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.04500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the contributions of CP-conserving dimension-six SMEFT operators to the two-loop renormalisation constants of quark and gluon fields in the on-shell scheme. Specifically, we consider the top-quark chromomagnetic operator and the triple gluon operator. We also compute the contribution of four-quark operators to the gluon renormalisation constant and discuss the implications for the running of the strong coupling constant.</description>

      <title>Charged Higgs Signatures at Future Electron-Proton Colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present a detailed collider phenomenology study of the charged Higgs boson within a Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) framework featuring an extended gauge and scalar sector. The charged Higgs can decay via conventional modes, such as $H^- \to \bar{t}b$ and $H^- \to W^-h$, as well as through exotic channels like $H^- \to W'Z$ (or $WZ'$). These decays lead to distinct final-state topologies determined by the nature of the intermediate particles. We perform a comprehensive phenomenological analysis at future electron-proton colliders, namely the LHeC and FCC-eh, considering the luminosity projections provided in their design reports. Our results indicate that the conventional decay modes of the charged Higgs boson can achieve observable sensitivity and even discovery prospects at sufficiently high luminosities. In contrast, the exotic decay channel $H^- \to W'Z$ does not exhibit any viable discovery potential. These findings highlight the complementarity of future electron-proton colliders in probing extended Higgs sectors, particularly through conventional charged Higgs signatures.</description>

      <title>Hot New Early Dark Energy: Dark Radiation Matter Decoupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03795v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a microscopic model of the dark sector that resolves the Hubble tension within standard current datasets based on well-known fundamental principles, gauge symmetry and spontaneous symmetry breaking. It builds on the Hot New Early Dark Energy (Hot NEDE) setup, featuring a dark $SU(N)$ gauge symmetry broken to $SU(N-1)$ in a supercooled phase transition that creates a thermal bath of self-interacting dark radiation in the epoch between Big Bang Nucleosynthesis and recombination. Adding a fermion multiplet charged under the gauge symmetry provides a naturally stable component of dark matter that interacts with dark radiation. Spontaneous symmetry breaking predicts a decoupling of this interaction once the dark sector cools down, that we refer to as dark radiation matter decoupling (DRMD). We find agreement between the SH${}_0$ES determination of $H_0$ as well as combined Planck 2018, Pantheon+ and DESI baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data at 1.4$\sigma$ level, compared to a 5.7$\sigma$ tension in the $\Lambda$ Cold Dark Matter model. We also provide a simplified three-parameter DRMD model encoding the essential features, while the full model offers additional falsifiable predictions.</description>

      <title>Scaling Relations for Dark Matter Halos Hosting Ultra-Faint Dwarf Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03823v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the extraction of parameters of dark matter halos hosting ultra-faint dwarf galaxies, in the case where there are only ${\cal O}(10)$ identified member stars with measured line-of-sight velocities. This scenario is likely to be increasingly common, as upcoming newly discovered dwarf galaxies in the Milky Way, by e.g. the Rubin Observatory, will likely (at least initially) have only a few identified members. Assuming an NFW dark matter profile, equilibrium modeling likely can only robustly extract one halo parameter ($\rho_s r_s$), but the scale radius itself will typically be unconstrained. In these cases, the results obtainable from Jeans modeling can be well replicated by a simple scaling relation motivated by the half-light mass estimator. As a application, we examine the recently discovered stellar system Ursa Major III, which has been optimistically assessed to have the largest $J$-factor of any known object. We suggest that, because of the presence of outlier stars, the $J$-factor obtained from modeling of Ursa Major III is likely inflated, as it is inconsistent with the half-light mass estimator, while removal of the outliers will leave the $J$-factor unconstrained from below.</description>

      <title>Graph theory-based automated quantum algorithm for efficient querying of acyclic and multiloop causal configurations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum algorithms provide a promising framework in high-energy physics, in particular, for unraveling the causal configurations of multiloop Feynman diagrams by identifying Feynman propagators with qubits, a challenge analogous to querying directed acyclic graphs in graph theory. In this paper, we present the Minimum Clique-optimised quantum Algorithm (MCA), an automated quantum algorithm designed to efficiently query the causal structures within the Loop-Tree Duality. The MCA quantum algorithm is optimised by exploiting graph theory techniques, specifically, by analogy with the Minimum Clique Partition problem. The evaluation of the MCA quantum algorithm is exhibited by analysing the transpiled quantum circuit depth and quantum circuit area.</description>

Abstract: Neutron multiplicity is a key observable in recent neutrino experiments that can enhance the sensitivity of various neutrino physics searches. Nuclear deexcitation plays a significant role in neutron emissions associated with neutrino-nucleus interactions; therefore, precise prediction of this process is eessential. To address this need, a general-purpose nuclear deexcitation event generator \textsc{NucDeEx} was developed and released as an open-source package. The treatment of low-lying discrete excited states was updated to better reproduce experimental data. Benchmarks were conducted using existing nuclear deexcitation event generators and experimental data. Application to other simulators, neutrino event generator \textsc{NEUT} and general particle simulation tool \textsc{Geant4}, are also presented.</description>

      <title>Gravitational wave spectra for cosmological phase transitions with non-linear decay of the fluid motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We summarize the theoretical framework of gravitational wave (GW) production by bulk fluid motion induced by expanding broken-phase bubbles during a first-order phase transition. Using a locally stationary unequal-time correlator (UETC) to model the decay of the source due to non-linearities, we provide templates for the resulting GW background that have been validated against data from Higgsless simulations. This UETC generalizes the stationary one considered in the sound-shell model, appropriate for linear sound waves whose kinetic-energy decay is negligible, to encompass the non-linear evolution of the compressional fluid motion beyond the sound-wave regime. We demonstrate the implementation of templates based on this theoretical description and the results from the Higgsless simulations in the public Python package CosmoGW, facilitating their use in experimental forecasts and parameter-estimation studies. The GW spectrum is delivered as a function of the key phase transition parameters: the wall velocity $v_w$, the strength $\alpha$, the nucleation rate $\beta$, and the source duration $\delta \eta_{\rm fin}$.</description>

      <title>Tripartite entanglement and Bell non-locality in loop-induced Higgs boson decays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18023v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we study quantum entanglement properties of the three-body $H\to\gamma l\bar{l}$ decays (for $l=e,\mu,\tau$) within the context of the Standard Model augmented with CP-violating interactions in the lepton Yukawa sector. Our aim is to elucidate the distribution of entanglement between the final photon, lepton and antilepton across the phase-space. These rare Higgs boson decays occur at 1-loop level, presenting a unique opportunity to scrutinize quantum correlations of fundamental interactions in tripartite systems by computing concurrence measures and investigating Bell non-locality. Moreover, we explore post-decay and autodistillation phenomena. Multipartite entanglement measures have much richer structure than those in the bipartite case, thus deserve more attention in collider phenomenology. In this line, we analyze here novel observables for these three-body Higgs boson decays, which can be extended to other multiparticle systems within the high-energy regime. We found that entanglement manifests among final particles, occasionally achieving a maximally entangled state in specific kinematical configurations. Also, these decay channels are promising for Bell non-locality tests but CP-effects are suppressed by lepton masses in this kind of observables.</description>

Abstract: The high-temperature plasma in the solar interior generates stochastic gravitational waves (GWs). Due to its significance as the primary source of high-frequency GWs in the solar system, we reexamine this phenomenon highlighting some physical processes, including the contribution of macroscopic hydrodynamic fluctuations. Our analysis builds upon several studies of axion emission from the Sun, particularly in relation to the treatment of plasma effects. The resulting GW spectrum is comparable to many well-motivated early Universe signals, yet orders of magnitude below the current sensitivities of axion helioscopes such as (Baby)IAXO.</description>

Abstract: Transfer learning (TL) allows a deep neural network (DNN) trained on one type of data to be adapted for new problems with limited information. We propose to use the TL technique in physics. The DNN learns the details of one process, and after fine-tuning, it makes predictions for related processes. We consider the DNNs, trained on inclusive electron-carbon scattering data, and show that after fine-tuning, they accurately predict cross sections for electron interactions with nuclear targets ranging from helium-3 to iron.</description>

      <title>The Influence of Lepton Portal on the WIMP-pFIMP framework</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19734v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dynamics and detection possibility of a pseudo-FIMP (pFIMP) dark matter (DM) in the presence of a thermal DM have been studied in different contexts. The pFIMP phenomenology largely depends on the WIMP-like partner DM, as pFIMP interacts with the standard model (SM) particles only via the partner DM loop. Introducing a lepton portal interaction, which connects DM directly to the SM lepton sector, improves its detection prospects. However, such possibilities are constrained strongly by the non-observation of lepton flavor-violating decays. Interestingly, this also makes it possible to probe such models in future low-energy experiments. In this article, we have tried to establish such connections and find parameter space which respects the limits from DM relic, direct, indirect, and lepton flavor violation (LFV). We also recast the constraints from di-lepton/di-tau plus missing energy signal at the LHC on our model and provide projections for HL-LHC and future lepton colliders. Although the LFV and collider limits mainly concern WIMPs, the parameter space for pFIMPs is also constrained due to its strong connection to WIMPs through DM relic density and detection prospects.</description>

      <title>Testing tree level TeV scale seesaw scenarios in $\mu$TRISTAN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21956v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate TeV scale seesaw scenarios at $\mu^+ e^-$ and $\mu^+ \mu^+$ colliders in the $\mu$TRISTAN experiment. In minimal type-I seesaw scenario we consider two generations of Standard Model (SM) singlet heavy Majorana type Right Handed Neutrinos (RHNs) which couples with SM gauge bosons through light-heavy neutrino mixing. We discuss the prospects of probing heavy neutrinos via the processes such as $\mu^+e^-\to \nu N_i\to e^+ j j\nu$ or $\mu^- j j\nu$ for $\sqrt{s}=346$~GeV and $1\text{ ab}^{-1}$ luminosity. Studying these process, we estimate limits on the light-heavy neutrino mixing angles as a function of heavy neutrino mass, which could be two orders of magnitude stronger than electroweak precision data. Further, we study the effect of doubly charged scalar boson $(H^{++})$ from the type-II seesaw scenario in $\mu^+ \mu^+$ collision at $\sqrt{s}=2$ TeV. In this case we consider $\mu^+ \mu^+ \to \ell_i^+ \ell_j^+$ and $\mu^+ \mu^+ \to H^{++} Z/ \gamma$ processes followed by the same sign dilepton decay of $H^{++}$. We find that events involving $e^+ e^+$ among these final states can probe the neutrino mass ordering in $\mu$TRISTAN experiment at 5$\sigma$ significance. In addition to that we study the production of positively charged triplet fermion in $\mu$TRISTAN following $\mu^+ \mu^+ \to \mu^+ \Sigma^+$ process where $\Sigma^+$ decays into $\mu^+ jj$ mode through $Z$ boson exchange. Considering a triplet at 1 TeV and studying SM backgrounds we estimate the discovery potential of $\mu^+ \mu^+ jj$ signal at $\mu$TRISTAN with respect to projected luminosity.</description>

      <title>eV-scale sterile neutrino: A window open to non-unitarity?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09280v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An excess observed in the accelerator neutrino experiments in the $\nu_{\mu} \rightarrow \nu_{e}$ channel at high confidence level (CL) has been interpreted as due to eV-scale sterile neutrino(s). But, it has been suffered from the problem of ``appearance - disappearance tension'' at the similarly high CL because the measurements of the $\nu_{\mu} \rightarrow \nu_{\mu}$ channel do not observe the expected event number depletion corresponding to the sterile contribution in the appearance channel. We suggest non-unitarity as a simple and natural way of resolving the tension, which leads us to construct the non-unitary $(3+1)$ model. With reasonable estimation of the parameters governing non-unitarity, we perform an illustrative analysis to know if the tension is resolved in this model. At the best fit of the appearance signature we have found the unique solution with $\sin^2 2\theta_{14} \approx 0.3$, which is consistent with the (reactors + Ga) data combined fit. Unexpectedly, our tension-easing mechanism bridges between the two high CL signatures, the BEST and LSND-MiniBooNE anomalies. Finally, consistency between apparently insufficient tension easing in the unitary $(3+1+N_{S})$ model simulations and our result is discussed.</description>

Abstract: While the anomalous magnetic moments of the electron and the muon have been measured with remarkable precision, the magnetic moment of the $\tau$-lepton is only known to rather limited precision. A promising approach to measure it exploits $\tau^+\tau^-$ production in ultraperipheral collisions of lead ions at the LHC. In this article, a state-of-the-art theory prediction for $\tau^+\tau^-$ production including leptonic $\tau$-decays is provided. The impact of spin correlations between the $\tau$-leptons, of the masses of final-state leptons, of next-to-leading-order electroweak corrections, and of the parametrization of the photon flux are discussed.</description>

      <title>Pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone-boson Dark Matter from Three Complex Scalars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19886v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study explores a dark matter model in which a pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson arises as a viable dark matter candidate from the spontaneous and soft breaking of global $\mathrm{U}(1)$ symmetries and stabilized by a residual $\mathbb{Z}_3$ discrete symmetry. The model introduces three complex scalar fields, singlets under the Standard Model gauge group, and charged under a dark $\mathrm{U}(1)_V$ gauge symmetry together with a permutative exchange symmetry among three scalars. These features naturally suppress the dark matter--nucleon scattering cross section by its Nambu-Goldstone boson nature. In addition to conventional annihilation channels, the $\mathbb{Z}_3$ structure allows semi-annihilation processes, playing a crucial role in setting the relic abundance.We analyze theoretical and experimental constraints, including relic abundance, Higgs invisible decays, and perturbative unitarity, and evaluate the elastic scattering cross section for boosted dark matter.</description>

      <title>Shear and bulk viscosity for a pure glue theory using an effective matrix model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20138v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: At nonzero temperatures, the deconfining phase transition can be analyzed using an effective matrix model to characterize the change in holonomy. The model includes gluons and two-dimensional ghost fields in the adjoint representation, or ``teens''. As ghosts, the teen fields are responsible for the decrease of the pressure as $T \rightarrow T_d$, with $T_d$ the transition temperature for deconfinement. Using the solution of this matrix model for a large number of colors, the parameters of the teen fields are adjusted so that the expectation value of the Polyakov loop is close to the values from the lattice. The shear, $\eta$, and bulk, $\zeta$, viscosities are computed in weak coupling but nonzero holonomy. In the pure glue theory, the value of the Polyakov loop is relatively large in the deconfined phase, $\approx 1/2$ at $T_d$. Consequently, if $s$ is the entropy density, while $\eta/s$ decreases as $T\rightarrow T_d$, it is still well above the conformal bound. In contrast, $\zeta/s$ is largest at $T_d$, comparable to $\eta/s$, then falls off rapidly with increasing temperature and is negligible by $\sim 2 T_d$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.21213v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dynamics of the electroweak phase transition in the early universe has profound implications for cosmology and particle physics. We systematically study the steady-state dynamics of bubble walls in scenarios where the transition is first order within three representative beyond the Standard Model frameworks, characterised by the presence of an additional scalar in different electroweak representations. Focusing on the local thermal equilibrium regime, we numerically solve the coupled scalar and hydrodynamic equations to extract key properties of the phase transition front: the wall velocity, width, plasma and field profiles. Remarkably, we find a near-universal behaviour across models when expressed in terms of thermodynamic quantities, that can be captured by simple fitting functions, useful for phenomenological applications. These results also provide an upper bound on the bubble velocity and represent the first necessary step for the full inclusion of out-of-equilibrium effects.</description>

      <title>RGE effects on new physics searches via gravitational waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13074v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational wave (GW) observations offer a promising probe of new physics associated with a first-order electroweak phase transition. Precision studies of the Higgs potential, including Fisher matrix analyses, have been extensively conducted in this context. However, significant theoretical uncertainties in the GW spectrum, particularly those due to renormalization scale dependence in the conventional daisy-resummed approach, have cast doubt on the reliability of such precision measurements. These uncertainties have been highlighted using the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) as a benchmark. To address these issues, we revisit Fisher matrix analyses based on the daisy-resummed approach, explicitly incorporating renormalization scale uncertainties. We then reassess the prospects for precise new physics measurements using GW observations. Adopting the SMEFT as a benchmark, we study the effects of one-loop RGE running of dimension-six operators on the Higgs effective potential via the Higgs self-couplings, top Yukawa coupling, and gauge couplings, in addition to the SMEFT tree-level effects. We find that future GW observations can remain sensitive to various dimension-six SMEFT effects, even in the presence of renormalization scale uncertainties, provided that the SMEFT $(H^{\dagger}H)^3$ operator is precisely measured, e.g., by future collider experiments.</description>

      <title>`Dark' Matter Effect as a Novel Solution to the KM3-230213A Puzzle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22754v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent KM3NeT observation of an ${\cal{O}}(100~{\rm PeV})$ event KM3-230213A is puzzling because IceCube with much larger effective area times exposure has not found any such events. We propose a novel solution to this conundrum in terms of dark matter (DM) scattering in the Earth's crust. We show that intermediate dark-sector particles that decay into muons are copiously produced when high-energy ($\sim100~\text{PeV}$) DM propagates through a sufficient amount of Earth overburden. The same interactions responsible for DM scattering in Earth also source the boosted DM flux from a high-luminosity blazar. We address the non-observation of similar events at IceCube via two examples of weakly coupled long-lived dark sector scenarios that satisfy all existing constraints. We calculate the corresponding dark sector cross sections, lifetimes and blazar luminosities required to yield one event at KM3NeT, and also predict the number of IceCube events for these parameters that can be tested very soon. Our proposed DM explanation of the event can also be distinguished from a neutrino-induced event in future high-energy neutrino flavor analyses, large-scale DM direct detection experiments, as well as at future colliders.</description>

      <title>Initial condition for the Balitsky-Kovchegov equation at next-to-leading order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00487v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We determine the initial condition of the Balitsky-Kovchegov evolution equation at next-to-leading order (NLO) accuracy using HERA deep inelastic scattering data. Posterior distributions characterizing the initial condition are extracted using Bayesian inference. The total cross section and charm quark production data from HERA are found to provide stringent constraints on the posterior. These distributions quantify the uncertainty in the initial condition and serve as necessary input for propagating uncertainties to all NLO calculations within the Color Glass Condensate framework.</description>

      <title>A Rephasing Invariant Formula for the Dirac CP Phase and General Perturbative Expansion: Prospects for DUNE and T2HK</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04720v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a formula for the Dirac CP phase $\delta = \arg ( U_{e1} U_{e2} U_{\mu 3} U_{\tau 3} / U_{e3} \det U_{\rm MNS} )$, directly derived from the lepton mixing matrix in an arbitrary basis of phases. In contrast to the numerically suppressed Jarlskog invariant, this expression is computationally simple and less sensitive to approximations. We apply the formula to derive general perturbative corrections from charged-lepton mixing $s_{ij}^{e}$ to the underlying CP phase of neutrinos $\delta_{\nu}$. A compact analytic expressions $\delta = \delta_{\nu} + s_{12}^{e} D_{12} + s_{13}^{e} D_{13} + s_{23}^{e} D_{23}$ shows that these corrections can substantially exceed $O(10^{\circ})$, potentially within the reach of future long-baseline experiments such as DUNE and T2HK.</description>

      <title>Determination of the sensitivity of $\Lambda$ and $\Lambda^+_c$ electric dipole moments using a full angular analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19056v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A search for a non-zero Electric Dipole Moment (EDM) of particles, which is a clear signal of a violation of CP symmetry, is one of the unique ways to discover physics beyond the Standard Model. In this paper, we discuss a method for determining the EDM of baryons from the full angular distribution of final particles in electron-positron pair annihilation processes. The question of how accurately the state-of-the-art experiments can determine EDM of $\Lambda$ and $\Lambda_c^+$ baryons is discussed in detail. Investigating the pseudo-statistics that corresponds to the BESIII experiment, the estimated sensitivity for $\Lambda$ EDM is obtained at the level of $10^{-18}$ $e\,$cm. The similar figure for the proposed Super Tau-Charm Facility (STCF) experiment is found to be of the order of $10^{-20}$ $e\,$cm. For the $\Lambda_c^+$ EDM, the calculated sensitivity for the STCF experiment is $10^{-16}$ $e\,$cm. The case of a polarized initial electron is considered separately as such an option is planned at the STCF experiment.</description>

      <title>New comprehensive description of the scaling evolution of the cosmological magneto-hydrodynamic system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06194v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the evolution of primordial magnetic fields until the recombination epoch, which is constrained by the conservation of magnetic helicity density if they are maximally helical and by the Hosking integral if they are non-helical. We combine these constraints with conditions obtained by estimating time scales of energy dissipation processes to describe the evolution of magnetic field strength and magnetic coherence length analytically. The dissipation processes depend on whether magnetic or kinetic energy is dominant, whether the decay dynamics is linear or not, and whether the dominant dissipation term is shear viscosity or drag force. We apply the description to compare constraints on primordial magnetic fields at different epochs in the early universe and argue that magnetogenesis before the electroweak symmetry breaking is not feasible.</description>

      <title>Probing Primordial Black Hole Formation from Domain Wall Isocurvature Perturbations: Constraints and Implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09986v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Domain walls are topological defects produced by the spontaneous symmetry-breaking of discrete symmetry during cosmological phase transitions. The horizon-size domain wall can significantly contribute to the energy density in the late-evolution stage. We propose that the density perturbations from the fluctuations in the number density of the horizon-size domain wall could collapse to form primordial black holes. This mechanism becomes effective when the domain wall energy density ratio to that of the radiation reaches about 0.1 in the radiation-dominated Universe. We find that models with $Z_2$ symmetry are excluded for interpreting pulsar timing array observations on the nano-Hz gravitational wave background since this model's domain wall number density fluctuations could lead to an overabundance of the primordial black holes. Moreover, models with $N\sim 10$ domain walls also suffer strong constraints from the overabundance of primordial black holes.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Holes from Domain Wall Density Fluctuations: Bridging Gravitational Wave Observations Across Two Frequency Bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10251v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel mechanism for the formation of primordial black holes by demonstrating that the delayed production of isocurvature perturbations resulting from Poisson fluctuations within the domain wall network can lead to collapse and the formation of primordial black holes during the horizon crossing of domain walls. Our findings establish a statistical relationship between the number of domains and the power spectrum of the perturbations. This relationship can be employed to constrain the symmetry of the model in light of the potential overabundance of primordial black holes. Furthermore, by incorporating the effects of accretion, we demonstrate that the annihilation of the domain wall network at the QCD scale may provide a plausible common origin for gravitational wave observations across two distinct frequency bands.</description>

      <title>Surface Gauge Invariance, Soft Limits and the Transmutation of Gluons into Scalars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17179v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Over the past year, the "scalar-scaffolding" formalism has revealed a number of new features of gluon amplitudes. In this paper, we leverage these developments to study two distinct but related questions, linked by the scaffolding statement of gauge invariance. We start by revisiting the soft expansion of gluon amplitudes. The scaffolding picture allows for a precise definition of the soft limit and a canonical way to expand the amplitude. At tree-level, this reproduces the classic Weinberg soft theorem, and at one-loop, using surface kinematics, we derive an extension of this theorem valid at the level of the loop integrand. We then switch gears and describe a new relationship between gluon and scalar amplitudes. The expression of surface gauge invariance naturally suggests a certain differential operator acting on individual external gluons. Remarkably, we find that, both for the tree-level amplitude and the surface one-loop integrand, repeated applications of this operator transmutes gluon amplitudes/integrands into those of Tr$(\phi^3)$ scalars. This is an interesting counterpart to the $\delta$-shift connection that lifts "stringy" Tr$(\phi^3)$ amplitudes to those of gluons.</description>

      <title>Wiener filtering and multi-tracer techniques for dark matter cross-correlations between gamma-ray emission and galaxy catalogs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02160v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cross-correlations between a gravitational tracer of dark matter and the contribution to the unresolved gamma-ray background (UGRB) from the radiation produced by the annihilation of the particles responsible for the dark matter, have been established as a powerful tool to investigate the particle physics nature of dark matter. Cross-correlations of the UGRB with galaxy catalogs, cluster catalogs and weak lensing have indeed been measured. In this paper we study statistical techniques that could improve the sensitivity of the cross-correlation techniques on the bounds that can be set to the particle dark matter physical properties. The two methods that we investigate are the application of a Wiener filter and the exploitation of the full multi-tracer information. After identifying the optimal strategies, we show that the adoption of a Wiener filter in the cross-correlation analysis can improve the sensitivity to the dark matter annihilation rate by a factor of 2/2.5 as compared to the standard analysis where no filter is applied. The inclusion of the full multi-tracer information can improve the sensitivity up to a factor of 5 for dark matter masses below about 50 GeV, the Wiener filter remaining the best option for heavier dark matter.</description>
