      <title>Evaluating Credit VIX (CDS IV) Prediction Methods with Incremental Batch Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the experimental process and results of SVM, Gradient Boosting, and an Attention-GRU Hybrid model in predicting the Implied Volatility of rolled-over five-year spread contracts of credit default swaps (CDS) on European corporate debt during the quarter following mid-May '24, as represented by the iTraxx/Cboe Europe Main 1-Month Volatility Index (BP Volatility). The analysis employs a feature matrix inspired by Merton's determinants of default probability. Our comparative assessment aims to identify strengths in SOTA and classical machine learning methods for financial risk prediction</description>

      <title>Trading with Time Series Causal Discovery: An Empirical Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15846v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the application of causal discovery algorithms in equity markets, with a focus on their potential to build investment strategies. An investment strategy was developed based on the causal structures identified by these algorithms. The performance of the strategy is evaluated based on the profitability and effectiveness in stock markets. The results indicate that causal discovery algorithms can successfully uncover actionable causal relationships in large markets, leading to profitable investment outcomes. However, the research also identifies a critical challenge: the computational complexity and scalability of these algorithms when dealing with large datasets. This challenge presents practical limitations for their application in real-world market analysis.</description>

      <title>Option Pricing with Stochastic Volatility, Equity Premium, and Interest Rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15416v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a new model for options pricing. The Black-Scholes-Merton (BSM) model plays an important role in financial options pricing. However, the BSM model assumes that the risk-free interest rate, volatility, and equity premium are constant, which is unrealistic in the real market. To address this, our paper considers the time-varying characteristics of those parameters. Our model integrates elements of the BSM model, the Heston (1993) model for stochastic variance, the Vasicek model (1977) for stochastic interest rates, and the Campbell and Viceira model (1999, 2001) for stochastic equity premium. We derive a linear second-order parabolic PDE and extend our model to encompass fixed-strike Asian options, yielding a new PDE. In the absence of closed-form solutions for any options from our new model, we utilize finite difference methods to approximate prices for European call and up-and-out barrier options, and outline the numerical implementation for fixed-strike Asian call options.</description>

      <title>Weak error estimates for rough volatility models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.01591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.01591v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a class of stochastic processes with rough stochastic volatility, examples of which include the rough Bergomi and rough Stein-Stein model, that have gained considerable importance in quantitative finance.
  A basic question for such (non-Markovian) models concerns efficient numerical schemes. While strong rates are well understood (order $H$), we tackle here the intricate question of weak rates. Our main result asserts that the weak rate, for a reasonably large class of test function, is essentially of order $\min \{ 3H+\tfrac12, 1 \}$ where $H \in (0,1/2]$ is the Hurst parameter of the fractional Brownian motion that underlies the rough volatility process.
  Interestingly, the phase transition at $H=1/6$ is related to the correlation between the two driving factors, and thus gives additional meaning to a quantity already of central importance in stochastic volatility modelling.Our results are complemented by a lower bound which show that the obtained weak rate is indeed optimal.</description>

      <title>AlphaForge: A Framework to Mine and Dynamically Combine Formulaic Alpha Factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18394v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The complexity of financial data, characterized by its variability and low signal-to-noise ratio, necessitates advanced methods in quantitative investment that prioritize both performance and interpretability.Transitioning from early manual extraction to genetic programming, the most advanced approach in the alpha factor mining domain currently employs reinforcement learning to mine a set of combination factors with fixed weights. However, the performance of resultant alpha factors exhibits inconsistency, and the inflexibility of fixed factor weights proves insufficient in adapting to the dynamic nature of financial markets. To address this issue, this paper proposes a two-stage formulaic alpha generating framework AlphaForge, for alpha factor mining and factor combination. This framework employs a generative-predictive neural network to generate factors, leveraging the robust spatial exploration capabilities inherent in deep learning while concurrently preserving diversity. The combination model within the framework incorporates the temporal performance of factors for selection and dynamically adjusts the weights assigned to each component alpha factor. Experiments conducted on real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed model outperforms contemporary benchmarks in formulaic alpha factor mining. Furthermore, our model exhibits a notable enhancement in portfolio returns within the realm of quantitative investment and real money investment.</description>

      <title>Handling model risk with XVAs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.11834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.11834v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we revisit Burnett (2021) \&amp; Burnett and Williams (2021)'s notion of hedging valuation adjustment (HVA), originally intended to deal with dynamic hedging frictions such as transaction costs, in the direction of model risk. The corresponding HVA reconciles a global fair valuation model with the local models used by the different desks of the bank. Model risk and dynamic hedging frictions indeed deserve a reserve, but a risk-adjusted one, so not only an HVA, but also a contribution to the KVA of the bank. The orders of magnitude of the effects involved suggest that local models should not so much be managed via reserves, as excluded altogether.</description>
