      <title>The Beta-Bound: Drift constraints for Gated Quantum Probabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum mechanics provides extraordinarily accurate probabilistic predictions, yet the framework remains silent on what distinguishes quantum systems from definite measurement outcomes. This paper develops a measurement-theoretic framework for projective gating. The central object is the $\beta$-bound, an inequality that controls how much probability assignments can drift when gating and measurement fail to commute. For a density operator $\rho$, projector $F$, and effect $E$, with gate-passage probability $s = {\rm Tr}(\rho F)$ and commutator norm $\varepsilon = \|[F, E]\|$, the symmetric partial-gating drift satisfies $|\Delta p_F(E)| \leq 2 \sqrt{(1 - s)/s} \cdot \varepsilon$. The constant 2 is sharp. We introduce two diagnostic quantities: the coherence witness $W(\rho, F) = \|F \rho (I - F)\|_1$, measuring cross-boundary coherence, and the record fidelity gap $\Delta_T(\rho_F, R)$, measuring expectation-value change under symmetrisation. Three experimental vignettes demonstrate falsifiability: Hong--Ou--Mandel interferometry, atomic energy-basis dephasing, and decoherence-induced classicality. The framework is operational and interpretation-neutral, compatible with Everettian, Bohmian, QBist, and collapse approaches. It provides quantitative structure that any interpretation must accommodate, along with a template for experimental tests.</description>

      <title>Navigating permanent underdetermination in dark energy and inflationary cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13521v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We identify troubling cases of so-called `permanent underdetermination' in both dark energy and inflationary cosmology. We bring to bear (a) a taxonomy of possible responses to underdetermination, and (b) an understanding of both dark energy and inflationary cosmology from an effective field theory point of view. We argue that, under certain conditions, there are viable responses which can arguably alleviate at least some of the concerns about underdetermination in the dark energy and inflationary sectors. However, the epistemic threat of permanent underdetermination remains a significant challenge.</description>

      <title>Implications of computer science theory for the simulation hypothesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16050v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The simulation hypothesis has recently excited renewed interest in the physics and philosophy communities. However, the hypothesis specifically concerns {\textit{computers}} that simulate physical universes. So to formally investigate the hypothesis, we need to understand it in terms of computer science (CS) theory. In addition we need a formal way to couple CS theory with physics. Here I couple those fields by using the physical Church-Turing thesis. This allow me to exploit Kleene's second recursion, to prove that not only is it possible for {us} to be a simulation being run on a computer, but that we might be in a simulation being run a computer \emph{by us}. In such a ``self-simulation'', there would be two identical instances of us, both equally ``real''. I then use Rice's theorem to derive impossibility results concerning simulation and self-simulation; derive implications for (self-)simulation if we are being simulated in a program using fully homomorphic encryption; and briefly investigate the graphical structure of universes simulating other universes which contain computers running their own simulations. I end by describing some of the possible avenues for future research. While motivated in terms of the simulation hypothesis, the results in this paper are direct consequences of the Church-Turing thesis. So they apply far more broadly than the simulation hypothesis.</description>
