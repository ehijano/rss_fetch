      <title>Estimating Galaxy Parameters with Self-Organizing Maps and the Effect of Missing Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The current and upcoming large data volume galaxy surveys require the use of machine learning techniques to maximize their scientific return. This study explores the use of Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs) to estimate galaxy parameters with a focus on handling cases of missing data and providing realistic probability distribution functions for the parameters. We train a SOM with a simulated mass-limited lightcone assuming a ugrizYJHKs+IRAC dataset, mimicking the Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) Deep joint dataset. For parameter estimation, we derive SOM likelihood surfaces considering photometric errors to derive total (statistical and systematic) uncertainties. We explore the effects of missing data including which bands are particular critical to the accuracy of the derived parameters. We demonstrate that the parameter recovery is significantly better when the missing bands are "filled-in" rather than if they are completely omitted. We propose a practical method for such recovery of missing data.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Vertical Distribution of HI Absorbing Clouds in the Solar Neighborhood</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The vertical distribution of cold neutral hydrogen (HI) clouds is a constraint on models of the structure, dynamics, and hydrostatic balance of the interstellar medium. In 1978, Crovisier pioneered a method to infer the vertical distribution of HI absorbing clouds in the solar neighborhood. Using data from the Nan\c{c}ay 21-cm absorption survey, they determine the mean vertical displacement of cold HI clouds, $\langle|z|\rangle$. We revisit Crovisier's analysis and explore the consequences of truncating the HI absorption sample in Galactic latitude. For any non-zero latitude limit, we find that the quantity inferred by Crovisier is not the mean vertical displacement but rather a ratio involving higher moments of the vertical distribution. The resultant distribution scale heights are thus ${\sim}1.5$ to ${\sim}3$ times smaller than previously determined. In light of this discovery, we develop a Bayesian Monte Carlo Markov Chain method to infer the vertical distribution of HI absorbing clouds. We fit our model to the original Nan\c{c}ay data and find a vertical distribution moment ratio $\langle|z|^3\rangle/\langle|z|^2\rangle = 97 \pm 15\,\text{pc}$, which corresponds to a Gaussian scale height $\sigma_z = 61 \pm 9\,\text{pc}$, an exponential scale height $\lambda_z = 32 \pm 5\,\text{pc}$, and a rectangular half-width $W_{z, 1/2} = 129 \pm 20\,\text{pc}$. Consistent with recent simulations, the vertical scale height of cold HI clouds appears to remain constant between the inner-Galaxy and the Galactocentric distance of the solar neighborhood. Local fluctuations might explain the large scale height observed at the same Galactocentric distance on the far side of the Galaxy.</description>

      <title>JWST Spectroscopy of SN H0pe: Classification and Time Delays of a Triply-imaged Type Ia Supernova at z = 1.78</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: SN H0pe is a triply imaged supernova (SN) at redshift $z=1.78$ discovered using the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). In order to classify the SN spectroscopically and measure the relative time delays of its three images (designated A, B, and C), we acquired NIRSpec follow-up spectroscopy spanning 0.6 to 5 microns. From the high signal-to-noise spectra of the two bright images B and C, we first classify the SN, whose spectra most closely match those of SN 1994D and SN 2013dy, as a Type Ia SN. We identify prominent blueshifted absorption features corresponding to Si II $\lambda6355$ and Ca II H $\lambda3970$ and K $\lambda3935$. We next measure the absolute phases of the three images from our spectra, which allows us to constrain their relative time delays. The absolute phases of the three images, determined by fitting the three spectra to Hsiao07 SN templates, are $6.5_{-1.8}^{+2.4}$d, $24.3_{-3.9}^{+3.9}$d, and $50.6_{-15.3}^{+16.1}$d for the brightest to faintest images. These correspond to relative time delays between Image A and Image B and between Image B and Image C of $-122.3_{-43.8}^{+43.7}$d and $49.3_{-14.7}^{+12.2}$d, respectively. The SALT3-NIR model yields phases and time delays consistent with these values. After unblinding, we additionally explored the effect of using Hsiao07 template spectra for simulations through eighty instead of sixty days past maximum, and found a small (11.5 and 1.0 days, respectively) yet statistically insignificant ($\sim$0.25$\sigma$ and $\sim$0.1$\sigma$) effect on the inferred image delays.</description>

      <title>Close Major-merger Pairs at $z=0$: Star-forming Galaxies with Pseudobulges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a study of star-forming galaxies (SFGs) with pseudobulges (bulges with S\'ersic index $\rm n &lt; 2$) in a local close major-merger galaxy pair sample (H-KPAIR). With data from new aperture photometries in the optical and near-infrared bands (aperture size of 7\;kpc) and from the literature, we find that the mean Age of central stellar populations in Spirals with pseudobulges is consistent with that of disky galaxies and is nearly constant against the bulge-to-total ratio (B/T). Paired Spirals have a slightly lower fraction of pure disk galaxies ($\rm B/T \leq 0.1$) than their counterparts in the control sample. Compared to SFGs with classical bulges, those with pseudobulges have a higher ($&gt;2\;\sigma$) mean of specific star formation rate (sSFR) enhancement ($\rm sSFR_{enh} = 0.33\pm0.07$ vs $\rm sSFR_{enh} = 0.12\pm0.06$) and broader scatter (by $\sim 1$\;dex). The eight SFGs that have the highest $\rm sSFR_{enh}$ in the sample all have pseudobulges. A majority (69\%) of paired SFGs with strong enhancement (having sSFR more than 5 times the median of the control galaxies) have pseudobulges. The Spitzer data show that the pseudobulges in these galaxies are tightly linked to nuclear/circum-nuclear starbursts. Pseudobulge SFGs in S+S and in S+E pairs have significantly ($&gt;3\;\sigma$) different sSFR enhancement, with the means of $\rm sSFR_{enh} = 0.45\pm0.08$ and $-0.04\pm0.11$, respectively. We find a decrease in the sSFR enhancements with the density of the environment for SFGs with pseudobulges. Since a high fraction (5/11) of pseudobulge SFGs in S+E pairs are in rich groups/clusters (local density $\rm N_{1Mpc} \geq 7$), the dense environment might be the cause for their low $\rm sSFR_{enh}$.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Cosmic Cradle: clustering and massive star formation in the enigmatic Galactic bubble N59</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we have conducted an investigation focused on a segment of the $Spitzer$ mid-infrared bubble N59, specifically referred to as R1 within our study. Situated in the inner Galactic plane, this region stands out for its hosting of five 6.7 GHz methanol masers, as well as numerous compact H II regions, massive clumps, filaments, and prominent bright rims. As 6.7 GHz masers are closely linked to the initial phases of high-mass star formation, exploring regions that exhibit a high abundance of these maser detections provides an opportunity to investigate relatively young massive star-forming sites. To characterize the R1 region comprehensively, we utilize multi-wavelength (archival) data from optical to radio wavelengths, together with $^{13}$CO and C$^{18}$O data. Utilizing the $Gaia$ DR3 data, we estimate the distance towards the bubble to be $4.66 \pm 0.70$ kpc. By combining near-infrared (NIR) and mid-infrared (MIR) data, we identify 12 Class I and 8 Class II sources within R1. Furthermore, spectral energy distribution (SED) analysis of selected sources reveals the presence of four embedded high-mass sources with masses ranging from 8.70-14.20 M$_\odot$. We also identified several O and B-type stars from radio continuum analysis. Our molecular study uncovers two distinct molecular clouds in the region, which, although spatially close, occupy different regions in velocity space. We also find indications of a potential hub-filament system fostering star formation within the confines of R1. Finally, we propose that the feedback from the H II regions has led to the formation of prominent Bright Rimmed Clouds (BRC) within our region of interest.</description>

      <title>N$_2$H$^+$(1-0) as a tracer of dense gas in and between spiral arms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in identifying giant molecular filaments in galactic surveys allow us to study the interstellar material and its dense, potentially star forming phase on scales comparable to resolved extragalactic clouds. Two large filaments detected in the CHIMPS $^{13}$CO(3-2) survey, one in the Sagittarius-arm and one in an inter-arm region, were mapped with dense gas tracers inside a 0.06 deg$^2$ area and with a spatial resolution of around 0.4 and 0.65 pc at the distance of the targets using the IRAM 30m telescope, to investigate the environmental dependence of the dense gas fraction. The N$_2$H$^+$(1-0) transition, an excellent tracer of the dense gas, was detected in parsec-scale, elliptical clumps and with a filling factor of around 8.5% in our maps. The N$_2$H$^+$-emitting areas appear to have higher dense gas fraction (e.g. the ratio of N$_2$H$^+$ and $^{13}$CO emission) in the inter-arm than in the arm which is opposite to the behaviour found by previous studies, using dust emission rather than N$_2$H$^+$ as a tracer of dense gas. However, the arm filament is brighter in $^{13}$CO and the infrared emission of dust, and the dense gas fraction determined as above is governed by the $^{13}$CO brightness. We caution that measurements regarding the distribution and fraction of dense gas on these scales may be influenced by many scale- and environment-dependent factors, as well as the chemistry and excitation of the particular tracers, then consider several scenarios that can reproduce the observed effect.</description>

      <title>A Deep Redshift Survey of the Perseus Cluster: Spatial Distribution and Kinematics of Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the global kinematics of the Perseus galaxy cluster (Abell 426) at redshift z = 0.017 using a large sample of galaxies from our new MMT/Hectospec spectroscopic observation for this cluster. The sample includes 1447 galaxies with measured redshifts within 60' from the cluster center (1148 from this MMT/Hectospec program and 299 from the literature). The resulting spectroscopic completeness is 67% at r-band apparent magnitude $r_{\rm{Petro, 0}}\leq 18.0$ within 60' from the cluster center. To identify cluster member galaxies in this sample, we develop a new open-source Python package, CausticSNUpy. This code implements the algorithm of the caustic technique and yields 418 member galaxies within 60' of the cluster. We study the cluster using this sample of member galaxies. The cluster shows no significant signal of global rotation. A statistical test shows that the cluster does not have a noticeable substructure within 30'. We find two central regions where the X-ray emitting intracluster medium and galaxies show significant velocity differences ($&gt;7\sigma$). On a large scale, however, the overall morphology and kinematics between the intracluster medium and galaxies agree well. Our results suggest that the Perseus cluster is a relaxed system and has not experienced a recent merger.</description>

      <title>Radio imaging of gravitationally lensed radio-quiet quasars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present 6-GHz Very Large Array radio images of 70 gravitational lens systems at 300-mas resolution, in which the source is an optically-selected quasar, and nearly all of which have two lensed images. We find that about in half of the systems (40/70, with 33/70 secure), one or more lensed images are detected down to our detection limit of 20microJy/beam, similar to previous investigations and reinforcing the conclusion that typical optically-selected quasars have intrinsic GHz radio flux densities of a few microJy ($\sim10^{23}$WHz$^{-1}$) at redshifts of 1--2. In addition, for ten cases it is likely that the lensing galaxies are detected in the radio. Available detections of, and limits on the far-infrared luminosities from the literature, suggest that nearly all of the sample lie on the radio-FIR correlation typical of star-forming galaxies, and that their radio luminosities are at least compatible with the radio emission being produced by star formation processes. One object, WISE2329$-$1258, has an extra radio component that is not present in optical images, and is difficult to explain using simple lens models. In-band spectral indices, where these can be determined, are generally moderately steep and consistent with synchrotron processes either from star-formation/supernovae or AGN. Comparison of the A/B image flux ratios at radio and optical wavelengths suggests a 10 per cent level contribution from finite source effects or optical extinction to the optical flux ratios, together with sporadic larger discrepancies that are likely to be due to optical microlensing.</description>

      <title>The ALMaQUEST Survey XV: The Dependence of the Molecular-to-Atomic Gas Ratios on Resolved Optical Diagnostics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The atomic-to-molecular gas conversion is a critical step in the baryon cycle of galaxies, which sets the initial conditions for subsequent star formation and influences the multi-phase interstellar medium. We compiled a sample of 94 nearby galaxies with observations of multi-phase gas contents by utilizing public H I, CO, and optical IFU data from the MaNGA survey together with new FAST H I observations. In agreement with previous results, our sample shows that the global molecular-to-atomic gas ratio ($R_{\rm mol} \equiv$ log $M_{\rm H_2}/M_{\rm H\ I}$) is correlated with the global stellar mass surface density $\mu_*$ with a Kendall's $\tau$ coefficient of 0.25 and $p &lt; 10^{-3}$, less tightly but still correlated with stellar mass and NUV$-$ r color, and not related to the specific star formation rate (sSFR). The cold gas distribution and kinematics inferred from the H I and CO global profile asymmetry and shape do not significantly rely on $R_{\rm mol}$. Thanks to the availability of kpc-scale observations of MaNGA, we decompose galaxies into H II, composite, and AGN-dominated regions by using the BPT diagrams. With increasing $R_{\rm mol}$, the fraction of H II regions within 1.5 effective radius decreases slightly; the density distribution in the spatially resolved BPT diagram also changes significantly, suggesting changes in metallicity and ionization states. Galaxies with high $R_{\rm mol}$ tend to have high oxygen abundance, both at one effective radius with a Kendall's $\tau$ coefficient of 0.37 ($p &lt; 10^{-3}$) and their central regions. Among all parameters investigated here, the oxygen abundance at one effective radius has the strongest relation with global $R_{\rm mol}$, but the dependence of gas conversion on gas distribution and galaxy ionization states is weak.</description>

      <title>Quantitatively rating galaxy simulations against real observations with anomaly detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmological galaxy formation simulations are powerful tools to understand the complex processes that govern the formation and evolution of galaxies. However, evaluating the realism of these simulations remains a challenge. The two common approaches for evaluating galaxy simulations is either through scaling relations based on a few key physical galaxy properties, or through a set of pre-defined morphological parameters based on galaxy images. This paper proposes a novel image-based method for evaluating the quality of galaxy simulations using unsupervised deep learning anomaly detection techniques. By comparing full galaxy images, our approach can identify and quantify discrepancies between simulated and observed galaxies. As a demonstration, we apply this method to SDSS imaging and NIHAO simulations with different physics models, parameters, and resolution. We further compare the metric of our method to scaling relations as well as morphological parameters. We show that anomaly detection is able to capture similarities and differences between real and simulated objects that scaling relations and morphological parameters are unable to cover, thus indeed providing a new point of view to validate and calibrate cosmological simulations against observed data.</description>

      <title>Radio properties of Green Pea galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Green Peas (GPs) are young, compact, star-forming dwarf galaxies, and local (z~0.3) analogues of the early galaxies (z&gt;6) considered to be mainly responsible for the reionisation of the Universe. Recent X-ray observations of GPs have detected high excess emission which cannot be accounted for by star formation alone, and implies presence of an active galactic nucleus (AGN). We employ radio observations to study the radio properties of GPs, build their radio spectral energy distributions, and verify the presence of AGNs. We performed new radio observations of three GPs with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (JVLA) in the L, C, and X bands (1.4, 6 and 10 GHz resp.), supplemented by the data from archival observations and large radio surveys. We also analysed the archival radio data for a larger sample of GPs and blueberry (BBs) galaxies, which are lower-mass and lower-redshift analogues of the GPs. To understand the significance of the radio observations, we assess the detectability of these sources, and compare the detected radio luminosities with the expectations from theoretical and empirical relations. Two of the three targeted GPs were strongly detected ($&gt;10\sigma$) in the JVLA observations and their fluxes are consistent with star formation, while the third source was undetected. Although a large fraction (~75%) of the sources from the larger archival sample of GPs and BBs could be detected with archival surveys, only a small number (&lt;40%) are detected and their radio luminosity is significantly lower than the expectation from empirical relations. Our results show that the majority of the dwarf galaxy sample is highly underluminous. Especially towards the lower end of galaxy mass and star formation rate (SFR), the radio luminosity-SFR relation deviates from the empirical relations, suggesting that the relations established for larger galaxies may not hold towards the low-mass end.</description>

      <title>AT2023lli: A Tidal Disruption Event with Prominent Optical Early Bump and Delayed Episodic X-ray Emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01686v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-cadence, multiwavelength observations have continuously revealed the diversity of tidal disruption events (TDEs), thus greatly advancing our knowledge and understanding of TDEs. In this work, we conducted an intensive optical-UV and X-ray follow-up campaign of TDE AT2023lli, and found a remarkable month-long bump in its UV/optical light curve nearly two months prior to maximum brightness. The bump represents the longest separation time from the main peak among known TDEs to date. The main UV/optical outburst declines as $t^{-4.10}$, making it one of the fastest decaying optically selected TDEs. Furthermore, we detected sporadic X-ray emission 30 days after the UV/optical peak, accompanied by a reduction in the period of inactivity. It is proposed that the UV/optical bump could be caused by the self-intersection of the stream debris, whereas the primary peak is generated by the reprocessed emission of the accretion process. In addition, our results suggest that episodic X-ray radiation during the initial phase of decline may be due to the patched obscurer surrounding the accretion disk, a phenomenon associated with the inhomogeneous reprocessing process. The double TDE scenario, in which two stars are disrupted in sequence, is also a possible explanation for producing the observed early bump and main peak. We anticipate that the multicolor light curves of TDEs, especially in the very early stages, and the underlying physics can be better understood in the near future with the assistance of dedicated surveys such as the deep high-cadence survey of the 2.5-meter Wide Field Survey Telescope (WFST).</description>

      <title>SN H0pe: The First Measurement of $H_0$ from a Multiply-Imaged Type Ia Supernova, Discovered by JWST</title>

Abstract: The first James Webb Space Telescope ({\it JWST}) Near InfraRed Camera (NIRCam) imaging in the field of the galaxy cluster PLCK G165.7+67.0 ($z=0.35$) uncovered a Type Ia supernova (SN~Ia) at $z=1.78$, called ``SN H0pe." Three different images of this one SN were detected as a result of strong gravitational lensing, each one traversing a different path in spacetime, thereby inducing a relative delay in the arrival of each image. Follow-up {\it JWST} observations of all three SN images enabled photometric and rare spectroscopic measurements of the two relative time delays. Following strict blinding protocols which oversaw a live unblinding and regulated post-unblinding changes, these two measured time delays were compared to the predictions of seven independently constructed cluster lens models to measure a value for the Hubble constant, $H_0=71.8^{+9.8}_{-7.6}$~km~s$^{-1}$~Mpc$^{-1}$. The range of admissible $H_0$ values predicted across the lens models limits further precision, reflecting the well-known degeneracies between lens model constraints and time delays. It has long been theorized that a way forward is to leverage a standard candle, however this has not been realized until now. For the first time, the lens models are evaluated by their agreement with the SN absolute magnification, breaking these degeneracies and producing our best estimate, $H_0=75.4^{+8.1}_{-5.5}$~km~s$^{-1}$~Mpc$^{-1}$. This is the first precision measurement of $H_0$ from a multiply-imaged SN~Ia, and provides a measurement in a rarely utilized redshift regime. This result agrees with other local universe measurements, yet exceeds the value of $H_0$ derived from the early Universe with $\gtrsim90\%$ confidence, increasing evidence of the Hubble tension. With the precision provided by only four more events, this approach could solidify this disagreement to $&gt;3\sigma$.</description>

      <title>Titanium abundances in late-type stars, II. Grid of departure coefficients and application to a sample of $70\,000$ stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19304v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rapidly growing datasets from stellar spectroscopic surveys are providing unprecedented opportunities to analyse the chemical evolution history of our Galaxy. However, spectral analysis requires accurate modelling of synthetic stellar spectra for late-type stars, for which the assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) has been shown to be insufficient in many cases. Errors associated with LTE can be particularly large for Ti I, which is susceptible to over-ionisation, particularly in metal-poor stars. The aims of this work are to study and quantify the 1D non-LTE effects on titanium abundances across the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram for a large sample of stars. A large grid of departure coefficients, $\beta_\nu$, were computed on standard MARCS model atmospheres. The grid extends from 3000K to 8000K in T$_{\mathrm{eff}}$, -0.5 to +5.5 dex in log(g), and -5.0 to +1.0 in [Fe/H], with non-LTE effects in this grid reaching up to 0.4 dex. This was used to compute abundance corrections that were subsequently applied to the LTE abundances of over 70,000 stars selected from the GALAH survey and additional metal-poor dwarfs. The non-LTE effects grow towards lower [Fe/H], lower log(g), and higher T$_{\mathrm{eff}}$, with a minimum and maximum $\Delta$A(Ti I) of 0.02 and 0.19 in the GALAH sample. For metal-poor giants, the non-LTE modelling reduces the average ionisation imbalance from -0.11 dex to -0.01 dex at [Fe/H] = -1.7, and the enhancement in titanium abundances from Ti I lines results in a [Ti/Fe] versus [Fe/H] trend that more closely resembles the behaviour of Ti II at low metallicities. Non-LTE effects on titanium abundances are significant. Neglecting them may alter our understanding of Galactic chemical evolution. We have made our grid of departure coefficients publicly available, with the caveat that the Ti abundances of metal-poor dwarfs need further study in 3D non-LTE.</description>

      <title>Joint ALMA/X-ray monitoring of the radio-quiet type 1 AGN IC 4329A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19524v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The origin of a compact millimeter (mm, 100-250 GHz) emission in radio-quiet active galactic nuclei (RQ AGN) remains debated. Recent studies propose a connection with self-absorbed synchrotron emission from the accretion disk X-ray corona. We present the first joint ALMA ($\sim$100 GHz) and X-ray (NICER/XMM-Newton/Swift; 2-10 keV) observations of the unobscured RQ AGN, IC 4329A ($z = 0.016$). The time-averaged mm-to-X-ray flux ratio aligns with recently established trends for larger samples (Kawamuro et al. 2022, Ricci et al. 2023), but with a tighter scatter ($\sim$0.1 dex) compared to previous studies. However, there is no significant correlation on timescales of less than 20 days. The compact mm emission exhibits a spectral index of $-0.23 \pm 0.18$, remains unresolved with a 13 pc upper limit, and shows no jet signatures. Notably, the mm flux density varies significantly (factor of 3) within 4 days, exceeding the contemporaneous X-ray variability (37% vs. 18%) and showing the largest mm variations ever detected in RQ AGN over daily timescales. The high amplitude variability rules out scenarios of heated dust and thermal free-free emission, pointing toward a synchrotron origin for the mm radiation in a source of $\sim$1 light day size. While the exact source is not yet certain, an X-ray corona scenario emerges as the most plausible compared to a scaled-down jet or outflow-driven shocks.}</description>

      <title>The Milky Way Bar Pattern Speed using Hercules and Gaia DR3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.04981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.04981v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The distribution of moving groups in the solar neighborhood has been used to constrain dynamical properties of the Milky Way for decades. The kinematic bimodality between the main mode (Hyades, Pleiades, Coma Berenices, and Sirius) and Hercules can be explained by two different bar models -- via the outer Lindblad resonance of a bar with a high pattern speed ($\sim$55 km s$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-1}$), or via the corotation resonance of a bar with a low pattern speed ($\sim$40 km s$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-1}$). Recent works directly studying the kinematics of bar stars and gas flows near the center of the Galaxy have converged on the low pattern speed model. In this paper, we independently confirm this result by using Gaia DR3 to directly study the variation of Hercules across Galactic azimuth. We find that Hercules increases in $V_\phi$ and becomes stronger as we move towards the minor axis of the bar, and decreases in $V_\phi$ and becomes weaker as we move towards the major axis of the bar. This is in direct agreement with theoretical predictions of a low pattern speed bar model in which Hercules is formed by the corotation resonance with stars orbiting the bar's L4/L5 Lagrange points.</description>

      <title>A new kinematic model of the Galaxy: analysis of the stellar velocity field from Gaia Data Release 3</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.08527v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work presents the results of a kinematic analysis of the Galaxy that uses a new model as applied to the newest available Gaia data. We carry out the Taylor decomposition of the velocity field up to second order for 18 million high luminosity stars (i.e. OBAF-type stars, giants and subgiants) from the Gaia DR3 data. We determine the components of mean stellar velocities and their first and second partial derivatives (relative to cylindrical coordinates) for more than 28 thousand points in the plane of our Galaxy. We estimate Oort's constants $A$, $B$, $C$, and $K$ and other kinematics parameters and map them as a function of Galactocentric coordinates. The values found confirm the results of our previous works and are in excellent agreement with those obtained by other authors in the Solar neighbourhood. In addition, the introduction of second order partial derivatives of the stellar velocity field allows us to determine the values of the vertical gradient of the Galaxy azimuthal, radial and vertical velocities. Also, we determine the mean of the Galaxy rotation curve for Galactocentric distances from 4 kpc to 18 kpc by averaging Galactic azimuths in the range -30$^\circ$ &lt; $\theta$ &lt; +30$^\circ$ about the direction Galactic Centre-Sun-Galactic anticentre. Maps of the velocity components and of their partial derivatives with respect to coordinates within 10 kpc of the Sun reveal complex substructures, which provide clear evidence of non-axisymmetric features of the Galaxy. Finally, we show evidence of differences in the Northern and Southern hemispheres stellar velocity fields.</description>

      <title>MAGIC: Muse gAlaxy Groups In Cosmos -- A survey to probe the impact of environment on galaxy evolution over the last 8 Gyr</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.00924v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the MUSE gAlaxy Groups in COSMOS (MAGIC) survey, which was built to study the impact of environment on galaxy evolution over the last 8 Gyr. It consists of 17 MUSE fields targeting 14 massive structures at intermediate redshift ($0.3&lt;z&lt;0.8$) in the COSMOS area. We securely measured the redshifts for 1419 sources and identified 76 galaxy pairs and 67 groups of at least 3 members using a friends-of-friends algorithm. The environment of galaxies is quantified from group properties, as well as from global and local density estimators. The MAGIC survey has increased the number of objects with a secure spectroscopic redshift over its footprint by a factor of about 5. Most of the new redshifts have apparent magnitudes in the $z^{++}$ band $z_{app}^{++}&gt;21.5$. The spectroscopic redshift completeness is high: in the redshift range of [OII] emitters ($0.25 \le z &lt; 1.5$), where most of the groups are found, it globally reaches a maximum of 80% down to $z_{app}^{++}=25.9$, and locally decreases from $\sim 100$% to $\sim50$% in magnitude bins from $z_{app}^{++}=23-24$ to $z_{app}^{++}=25.5$. We find that the fraction of quiescent galaxies increases with local density and with the time spent in groups. A morphological dichotomy is also found between bulge-dominated quiescent and disk-dominated star-forming galaxies. As environment gets denser, the peak of the stellar mass distribution shifts towards $M_*&gt;10^{10}~M_\odot$, and the fraction of galaxies with $M_*&lt;10^9~M_\odot$ decreases significantly, even for star-forming galaxies. We also highlight peculiar features such as close groups, extended nebulae, and a gravitational arc. Our results suggest that galaxies are preprocessed in groups of increasing mass before entering rich groups and clusters. We publicly release two catalogs containing the properties of galaxies and groups, respectively.</description>

      <title>Did the Gaia Enceladus/Sausage merger form the Milky Way's bar?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.02318v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Milky Way's last significant merger, the Gaia Enceladus/Sausage (GES), is thought to have taken place between 8-11 Gyr ago. Recent studies in the literature suggest that the bar of the Milky Way is rather old, indicating that it formed at a similar epoch to the GES merger. We investigate the possible link between these events using one of the Auriga cosmological simulations which has salient features in common with the Milky Way, including a last significant merger with kinematic signatures resembling that of the GES. In this simulation, the GES-like merger event triggers tidal forces on the disc, gas inflows and a burst of star formation, with the formation of a bar occuring within 1 Gyr of the first pericentre. To highlight the effects of the merger, we rerun the simulation from z=4 with the progenitors of the GES-like galaxy removed well before the merger time. The consequence is a delay in bar formation by around 2 Gyr, and this new bar forms without any significant external perturbers. We conclude that this Milky Way-like simulation shows a route to the real Milky Way's bar forming around the epoch of the GES merger due to tidal forces on its first pericentre. We explore all Auriga galaxies with GES-like merger events, and find that those with stellar mass ratios below 10% form bars within 1 Gyr of the merger, while bar formation is delayed in the more massive merger scenarios. These include the 4 oldest bars in the simulation suite. Lastly, we note some later morphological differences between the disc of the original simulation and our rerun, in particular that the latter does not grow radially for the final 7 Gyr. Our study suggests that the GES may therefore be responsible for the formation of the Milky Way's bar, as well as for the build-up of its extended disc.</description>

      <title>Star Formation Histories of Dwarf Lenticular Galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.01028v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Star formation histories (SFHs) are essential for understanding galaxy formation and evolution. We present the mean SFHs of 148 dwarf lenticular galaxies (dS0s) derived from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) spectra. These SFHs reveal two distinct periods of active star formation. The first period, concluding approximately 6 Gyr ago, witnessed the formation of predominantly old, metal-poor (Z=0.0004) stars, accounting for approximately 60\% of the stellar mass and 30\% of the luminosity. The scarcity of extremely metal-poor (Z=0.0001) stars suggests pre-enrichment during the re-ionization era. Star formation gradually waned during this initial phase. In contrast, the second period, ending around 1 Gyr ago, exhibited a peak in the middle of the period, contributing to the formation of moderately old stellar populations with intermediate metallicity. The SFHs of dS0 galaxies show a clear dependence on stellar mass, with more massive dS0s forming stars earlier. But, we find no significant correlation with morphological properties such as outer spiral arms and nucleation. The SFHs of dS0 galaxies share many similarities with those of dE galaxies, suggesting a common origin, mostly not primordial.</description>

      <title>On the Metallicity Gradients in the Galactic Disk using Open Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09237v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the metallicity distribution and evolution in the Galactic disk based on the largest sample of open star clusters in the Galaxy. From the catalogue of 1879 open clusters in the range of Galactocentric distance (R_GC) from 4 to 20 kpc, we investigate the variation of metallicity in the Galactic disk as functions of R_GC, vertical distance (Z), and ages of the clusters. In the direction perpendicular to the Galactic plane, variation in metallicity is found to follow a stepped linear relation. We estimate a vertical metallicity gradient d[Fe/H]/dZ of -0.545+/-0.046 dex/kpc for |Z| &lt; 0.487 kpc, and -0.075+/-0.093 dex/kpc for 0.487 &lt; |Z| &lt; 1.8 kpc. On average, metallicity variations above and below the Galactic plane are found to change at similar rates. The change in metallicity in the radial direction is also found to follow a two-function linear relation. We obtain a radial metallicity gradient d[Fe/H]/d[R_GC] of -0.070+/-0.002 dex/kpc for 4.0&lt;R_GC&lt;12.8 kpc, and -0.005+/-0.018 dex/kpc for 12.8&lt; R_GC &lt; 20.5 kpc which clearly shows a strong variation in the metallicity gradient when moving from the inner to the outer Galactic disk. Age-metallicity relation (AMR) is found to follow a steeper negative slope of -0.031+/-0.006 dex/Gyr for clusters older than 240 Myr, however, there is some hint of positive metallicity age gradient for younger clusters.</description>

      <title>On the chemical and kinematic signatures of the resonances of the Galactic bar as revealed by the LAMOST-APOGEE red clump stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12814v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Milky Way is widely considered to exhibit features of a rotational bar or quadrupole bar. In either case, the feature of the resonance of the Galactic bar should be present in the properties of the chemistry and kinematics, over a large area of the disk. With a sample of over 170,000 red clump (RC) stars from LAMOST-APOGEE data, we attempt to detect the chemical and kinematic signatures of the resonances of the Galactic bar, within 4.0 $\leq$ $R$ $\leq$ 15.0 kpc and $|Z|$ $\leq$ 3.0 kpc. The measurement of the $\Delta$[Fe/H]/$\Delta|Z|$ $-$ $R$ with subtracted the global profiles trends, shows that the thin and thick disks values are Cor_$\Delta$[Fe/H]/$\Delta|Z|$ = 0.010 $\mathrm{sin}$ (1.598 $R$ + 2.551) and Cor_$\Delta$[Fe/H]/$\Delta|Z|$ = 0.006 $\mathrm{sin}$ (1.258 $R$ $-$ 0.019), respectively. The analysis of the tilt angle of the velocity ellipsoid indicates that the thin and thick disks are accurately described as $\alpha$ = $\alpha_{0}$ arctan (Z/R), with $\alpha_{0}$ = 0.198 $\mathrm{sin}$ (0.853 $R$ + 1.982) + 0.630 and $\alpha_{0}$ = 0.220 $\mathrm{sin}$ (0.884 $R$ + 2.012) + 0.679 for thin and thick disks, respectively. These periodic oscillations in Cor_$\Delta$[Fe/H]/$\Delta|Z|$ and $\alpha_{0}$ with $R$ appear in both thin and thick disks, are the most likely chemical and kinematic signatures of the resonance of the Galactic bar. The difference in the phase of the functions of the fitted periodic oscillations for the thin and thick disks may be related to the presence of a second Galactic bar.</description>

      <title>NuSTAR Observations of Candidate Subparsec Binary Supermassive Black Holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.06144v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present analysis of NuSTAR X-ray observations of three AGN that were identified as candidate subparsec binary supermassive black hole (SMBH) systems in the Catalina Real-Time Transient Survey based on apparent periodicity in their optical light curves. Simulations predict that close-separation accreting SMBH binaries will have different X-ray spectra than single accreting SMBHs. We previously observed these AGN with Chandra and found no differences between their low energy X-ray properties and the larger AGN population. However some models predict differences to be more prominent at energies higher than probed by Chandra. We find that even at the higher energies probed by NuSTAR, the spectra of these AGN are indistinguishable from the larger AGN population. This could rule out models predicting large differences in the X-ray spectra in the NuSTAR bands. Alternatively, it might mean that these three AGN are not binary SMBHs.</description>

      <title>Turbocharging constraints on dark matter substructure through a synthesis of strong lensing flux ratios and extended lensed arcs</title>

Abstract: Strong gravitational lensing provides a purely gravitational means to infer properties of dark matter halos and thereby constrain the particle nature of dark matter. Strong lenses sometimes appear as four lensed images of a background quasar accompanied by spatially-resolved emission from the quasar host galaxy encircling the main deflector (lensed arcs). We present methodology to simultaneously reconstruct lensed arcs and relative image magnifications (flux ratios) in the presence of full populations of dark matter subhalos and line-of-sight halos. To this end, we develop a new approach for multi-plane ray tracing that accelerates lens mass and source light reconstruction by factors of $\sim 100-1000$. Using simulated data with a cold dark matter (CDM) ground truth, we show that simultaneous reconstruction of lensed arcs and flux ratios isolates small-scale perturbations to flux ratios by dark matter substructure from uncertainties associated with the main deflector mass profile on larger angular scales. Relative to analyses that use only image positions and flux ratios to constrain the lens model, incorporating arcs strengthens likelihood ratios penalizing warm dark matter (WDM) with a characteristic suppression scale $m_{\rm{hm}} / M_{\odot}$ in the range $\left[10^7 - 10^{7.5}\right]$, $\left[10^{7.5} - 10^{8}\right]$, $\left[10^8 - 10^{8.5}\right]$, $\left[10^{8.5} - 10^{9}\right]$ by factors of $1.3$, $2.5$, $5.6$, and $13.1$, respectively, and the $95\%$ exclusion limit improves by 0.5 dex in $\log_{10} m_{\rm{hm}}$. The enhanced sensitivity to low-mass halos enabled by these methods pushes the observational frontier of substructure lensing to the threshold of galaxy formation, enabling stringent tests of any theory that alters the properties of dark matter halos.</description>

      <title>VLBI detection of nearby (&lt; 100 pc) young stars: Pilot observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04355v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To increase the number of sources with Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) astrometry available for comparison with the Gaia results, we have observed 31 young stars with recently reported radio emission. These stars are all in the Gaia DR3 catalog and were suggested, on the basis of conventional interferometry observations, to be non-thermal radio emitters and, therefore, good candidates for VLBI detections. The observations were carried out with the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) at two epochs separated by a few days and yielded 10 detections (a $\sim$30\% detection rate). Using the astrometric Gaia results, we have extrapolated the target positions to the epochs of our radio observations and compared them with the position of the radio sources. For seven objects, the optical and radio positions are coincident within five times their combined position errors. Three targets, however, have position discrepancies above eight times the position errors, indicating different emitting sources at optical and radio wavelengths. In one case, the VLBA emission is very likely associated with a known companion of the primary target. In the other two cases, we associate the VLBA emission with previously unknown companions, but further observations will be needed to confirm this.</description>

      <title>Determining stellar accretion rates from $Pa_{\alpha}$ and $Br_{\beta}$ emission lines with JWST NIRSpec</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09568v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this letter we present the first systematic spectroscopic measurements of the Near-InfraRed (NIR) hydrogen recombination lines Paschen alpha ($Pa_{\alpha}$ $\lambda = 1.875 \mu m$) and Brackett beta ($Br_{\beta}$ $\lambda = 2.626 \mu m$), produced by pre-main-sequence (PMS) stars. These stars, consisting of T Tauri and Herbig AeBe stars are located in the massive Galactic star-formation region NGC 3603. The measurements were obtained from JWST NIRSpec, using multi-object spectroscopy (MOS) mode. Utilising existing empirical relations between $L_{acc}$ and $L_{Br_{\gamma}}$, we have used our new measurements to formulate, for the first time, an empirical relationship between the accretion luminosity $L_{acc}$ of the stars, and the line luminosities $L_{line}$ of both $Pa_{\alpha}$ and $Br_{\beta}$. These relationships are: $\log_{10}( \frac{L_{acc}}{L_{\odot}}) = 1.42 (\pm 0.18) \times \log_{10}( \frac{L_{Pa_{\alpha}}}{L_{\odot}}) + 3.33 (\pm 0.42)$ and $\log_{10}( \frac{L_{acc}}{L_{\odot}}) = 1.47 (\pm 0.18) \times \log_{10}( \frac{L_{Br_{\beta}}}{L_{\odot}}) + 4.60 (\pm 0.57)$. These new relationships are key for roughly estimating the accretion rates for large samples of PMS stars with JWST.</description>
