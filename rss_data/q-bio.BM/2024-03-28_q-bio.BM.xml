      <title>Sort &amp; Slice: A Simple and Superior Alternative to Hash-Based Folding for Extended-Connectivity Fingerprints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17954v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extended-connectivity fingerprints (ECFPs) are a ubiquitous tool in current cheminformatics and molecular machine learning, and one of the most prevalent molecular feature extraction techniques used for chemical prediction. Atom features learned by graph neural networks can be aggregated to compound-level representations using a large spectrum of graph pooling methods; in contrast, sets of detected ECFP substructures are by default transformed into bit vectors using only a simple hash-based folding procedure. We introduce a general mathematical framework for the vectorisation of structural fingerprints via a formal operation called substructure pooling that encompasses hash-based folding, algorithmic substructure-selection, and a wide variety of other potential techniques. We go on to describe Sort &amp; Slice, an easy-to-implement and bit-collision-free alternative to hash-based folding for the pooling of ECFP substructures. Sort &amp; Slice first sorts ECFP substructures according to their relative prevalence in a given set of training compounds and then slices away all but the $L$ most frequent substructures which are subsequently used to generate a binary fingerprint of desired length, $L$. We computationally compare the performance of hash-based folding, Sort &amp; Slice, and two advanced supervised substructure-selection schemes (filtering and mutual-information maximisation) for ECFP-based molecular property prediction. Our results indicate that, despite its technical simplicity, Sort &amp; Slice robustly (and at times substantially) outperforms traditional hash-based folding as well as the other investigated methods across prediction tasks, data splitting techniques, machine-learning models and ECFP hyperparameters. We thus recommend that Sort &amp; Slice canonically replace hash-based folding as the default substructure-pooling technique to vectorise ECFPs for supervised molecular machine learning.</description>

      <title>Assembly Theory is an approximation to algorithmic complexity based on LZ compression that does not explain selection or evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06629v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that Assembly Theory (AT) is reliant on Shannon Entropy and a method based upon statistical compression that belongs to the LZ family of compression algorithms, family which comprises popular algorithms used in ZIP, GZIP, or JPEG. Such popular algorithms have been shown to empirically reproduce the results of AT that were reported before in successful applications to separating organic from non-organic molecules and in the context of the study of selection and evolution. In particular, the assembly index calculation method is an LZ compression scheme, even if used for classification or explanatory purposes. We show that the assembly index value is equivalent to the size of a minimal context-free grammar. The statistical compressibility of such a method is bounded by Shannon Entropy and other equivalent traditional LZ compression schemes, such as LZ77, LZ78, or LZW. In addition, we demonstrate that AT, and the algorithms supporting its pathway complexity, assembly index, and assembly number, define compression schemes and methods that are subsumed into the theory of algorithmic (Kolmogorov-Solomonoff-Chaitin) complexity. Due to AT's current lack of logical consistency in defining causality for non-stochastic processes and lack of empirical evidence that it outperforms other complexity measures found in the literature capable of explaining the same phenomena, we conclude that the assembly index and the assembly number do not lead to an explanation or quantification of biases in generative (physical or biological) processes, including those brought about by (abiotic or Darwinian) selection and evolution that could not have been made with Shannon Entropy or had not been reported before with algorithmic complexity.</description>
