      <title>Eigenvalue statistics for random polymer models: Localization and delocalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the local eigenvalue statistics (LES) associated with one-dimensional lattice models of random polymers. We consider models constructed from two polymers. Each polymer is a finite interval of lattice points with a finite potential. These polymers are distributed along $\mathbb{Z}$ according to a Bernoulli distribution. The deterministic spectrum for these models is dense pure point, and is known to contain finitely-many critical energies. In this paper, we prove that the LES centered at these critical energies is described by a uniform clock process, and that the LES for the unfolded eigenvalues, centered at any other energy in the deterministic spectrum, is a Poisson point process. These results add to our understanding of these models that exhibit dynamical localization in any energy interval avoiding the critical energies [Damanik, Sims, Stolz] [De Bievre, Germinet], and nontrivial transport for wave packets with initial states supported at an integer point [Jitomirskaya, Schultz-Baldes, Stolz]. We show that the projection of these initial states onto spectral subspaces associated with any energy interval that contains all of the critical energies exhibit nontrivial transport, refining the connection between nontrivial transport and the critical energies. Finally, we also prove that the transition in the unfolded LES is sharp at the critical energies.</description>

      <title>Matrix harmonic analysis at high temperature via the Dirichlet process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate harmonic analysis of random matrices of large size with their Dyson indices going simultaneous to zero, that is in the high temperature limit. In this regime, the limiting empirical spectral distribution and the multivariate Bessel function/Heckman-Opdam hypergeometric function of the empirical spectral distribution are intimately related to the Markov-Krein correspondence. The uniqueness, existence and other properties of the Markov-Krein correspondence are studied using the theory of the Dirichlet process.</description>

      <title>Analysis of quantities determining the critical inverse temperature in the annealed Potts model with Pareto vertex weights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider in this work the crucial quantity $t_c$ that determines the critical inverse temperature $\beta_c$ in the $q$-state Potts model on sparse rank-1 random graphs where the vertices are equipped with a Pareto weight density $(\tau-1)\,w^{-\tau}\,{\cal X}_{[1,\infty)}(w)$. It is shown in \cite{ref1} that this $t_c$ is the unique positive zero of a function ${\cal K}$ that is obtained by an appropriate combination of the stationarity condition and the criticality condition for the case the external field $B$ equals 0 and that $q\geq3$ and $\tau\geq4$, see \cite{ref1}, Theorem~1.14 and Theorem ~1.21 and their proofs in \cite{ref1}, Section~7.1 and Section~7.3. From the proof of \cite{ref1}, Theorem~1.14, it is seen that ${\cal K}'$ and ${\cal K}''$ also have a unique positive zero, $t_c'$ and $t_c''$, respectively, and $t_c'=t_b$ and $t_c''=t_{\ast}$, where $t_b$ and $t_{\ast}$ are the unique positive zeros of ${\cal F}_0(t)-t\,{\cal F}_0'(t)$ and ${\cal F}_0''(t)$, respectively. Here, ${\cal F}_0(t)=E\,[W(e^{tW}-1)/(E\,[W]\,(e^{tW}+q-1))]$, and $t_c$, $t_b$ and $t_{\ast}$ play a key role in the graphical analysis of \cite{ref1}, Section~5.1 and Figure~1. Furthermore, $\gamma_c=\exp(\beta_c)-1$ and $t_c$ are related according to $\gamma_c=t_c/{\cal F}_0(t_c)$.
  We analyse $t_c$, $t_c'$ and $t_c''$ for general real $\tau\geq4$ and general real $q&gt;2$ by an appropriate formulation of their defining equations ${\cal K}(t_c)={\cal K}'(t_c')={\cal K}''(t_c'')=0$. Thus we find, along with the inequality $0&lt;t_c''&lt;t_c'&lt;t_c&lt;\infty$, the simple upper bounds $t_c&lt;2\,{\rm ln}(q-1)$, $t_c'&lt;\frac32\,{\rm ln}(q-1)$, $t_c''&lt;{\rm ln}(q-1)$, as well as certain sharpenings of these simple bounds and counterparts about the large-$q$ behaviour of $t_c$, $t_c$ and $t_c''$. We show that these bounds are sharp in the sense that they hold with equality for the limiting homogeneous case $\tau\to\infty$.</description>

      <title>Finite $N$ precursors of the free cumulants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce $\mathrm{U}(N)$ invariant polynomials on the space of $N\times N$ matrices that are precursors of free cumulants in various respects. First, they are polynomials of deterministic matrices, that are not yet evaluated over some probability law, contrary to what is usually meant by cumulants. Secondly, they converge towards the algebraic expression of free cumulants in terms of moments as $N\to \infty$, with $1/N^2$ corrections expressed in terms of monotone Hurwitz numbers. Their most crucial property is their additivity with respect to averaging over sums of $\mathrm{U}(N)$ conjugacy orbits, providing a finite $N$ version of the well-known additivity of free cumulants in free probability. Finally, they extend several properties of free cumulants at finite $N$, including a Wick rule for their average over a Gaussian weight and their appearance in various matrix integrals. Building on the additivity property of these precursors, we also define and compute a coproduct describing the behaviour of general invariant polynomials with respect to the addition of $\mathrm{U}(N)$ conjugacy orbits, as well as their expectation values on sums of $\mathrm{U}(N)$-invariant random matrices. In our construction, a central role is played by the so-called HCIZ integral, both for the definition of the precursors and for the derivation of their properties.</description>

      <title>Anyons in the $\pi$-flux phase of fermionic matter coupled to a $\mathbb{Z}_2$-gauge field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a system of weakly interacting spinful lattice fermions coupled to a dynamical $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge field. The ground state lies in the sector of a uniform $\pi$-flux per plaquette and the monopoles are massive. In the presence of a staggered mass for the fermions, this yields a fully gapped, four-dimensional ground state space on large tori. It is topologically ordered. By considering adiabatic $\pi$-flux insertion, we construct dressed monopole excitations and show that their braiding with the fermionic excitations are those of the toric code.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Eisenhart lift is extended to the dynamics described by action-dependent Lagrangians. The resulting Brinkmann metrics depends on all coordinates. It is shown that the symmetries of the initial dynamics result in the existence of (conformal) Killing vectors of Brinkmann metric. An example is given of equivalent time- and action-dependent descriptions which result in conformally equivalent metrics.</description>

      <title>Finite entropy sums in quantum field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Entropies associated with spatial subsystems in conventional local quantum field theories are typically divergent when the spatial regions have boundaries. However, in certain linear combinations of the entropies for various subsystems, these divergences may cancel, giving finite quantities that provide information-theoretic data about the underlying state. In this note, we show that all such quantities can be written as linear combinations of three basic types of quantities: i) the entropy of a spatial subsystem minus the entropy of its complementary subsystem, ii) the mutual information between non-adjacent subsystems, and iii) the tripartite information for triples of disjoint sub-systems. For a fixed decomposition of a spatial slice into regions, we describe a basis of sums of entropies for collections of for these regions for which all divergences related to both region boundaries and higher-codimension intersections of regions cancel. Key mathematical technology used in this work (Fourier transforms on the Boolean cube and M\"obius transformations of functions on partially ordered sets) and several of the main proof ideas were suggested by AI (ChatGPT5). We offer a few comments on the use of AI in physics and mathematics, based on our experience.</description>

      <title>Quantum Physics using Weighted Model Counting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Weighted model counting (WMC) has proven effective at a range of tasks within computer science, physics, and beyond. However, existing approaches for using WMC in quantum physics only target specific problem instances, lacking a general framework for expressing problems using WMC. This limits the reusability of these approaches in other applications and risks a lack of mathematical rigor on a per-instance basis. We present an approach for expressing linear algebraic problems, specifically those present in physics and quantum computing, as WMC instances. We do this by introducing a framework that converts Dirac notation to WMC problems. We build up this framework theoretically, using a type system and denotational semantics, and provide an implementation in Python. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in calculating the partition functions of several physical models: The transverse-field Ising model (quantum) and the Potts model (classical). The results suggest that heuristics developed in automated reasoning can be systematically applied to a wide class of problems in quantum physics through our framework.</description>

      <title>$k$-Positive Maps: New Characterizations and a Generation Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study $k$-positive linear maps on matrix algebras and address two problems, (i) characterizations of $k$-positivity and (ii) generation of non-decomposable $k$-positive maps. On the characterization side, we derive optimization-based conditions equivalent to $k$-positivity that (a) reduce to a simple check when $k=d$, (b) reveal a direct link to the spectral norm of certain order-3 tensors (aligning with known NP-hardness barriers for $k&lt;d$), and (c) recast $k$-positivity as a novel optimization problem over separable states, thereby connecting it explicitly to separability testing. On the generation side, we introduce a Lie-semigroup-based method that, starting from a single $k$-positive map, produces one-parameter families that remain $k$-positive and non-decomposable for small enough times. We illustrate this by generating such families for $d=3$ and $d=4$. We also formulate a semi-definite program (SDP) to test an equivalent form of the positive partial transpose (PPT) square conjecture (and do not find any violation of the latter). Our results provide practical computational tools for certifying $k$-positivity and a systematic way to sample $k$-positive non-decomposable maps.</description>

      <title>Computing Radially-Symmetric Solutions of the Ultra-Relativistic Euler Equations with Entropy-Stable Discontinuous Galerkin Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ultra--relativistic Euler equations describe gases in the relativistic case when the thermal energy dominates. These equations for an ideal gas are given in terms of the pressure, the spatial part of the dimensionless four-velocity, and the particle density. Kunik et al.\ (2024, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcp.2024.113330) proposed genuine multi--dimensional benchmark problems for the ultra--relativistic Euler equations. In particular, they compared full two-dimensional discontinuous Galerkin simulations for radially symmetric problems with solutions computed using a specific one-dimensional scheme. Of particular interest in the solutions are the formation of shock waves and a pressure blow-up. In the present work we derive an entropy-stable flux for the ultra--relativistic Euler equations. Therefore, we derive the main field (or entropy variables) and the corresponding potentials. We then present the entropy-stable flux and conclude with simulation results for different test cases both in 2D and in 3D.</description>

Abstract: We study a mean-field model for a system of 2D abelian anyons, given by the dynamics of a Schr{\"o}dinger matter field coupled to a Chern-Simons gauge field. We derive an effective 1D equation by adding a strongly anisotropic trapping potential (wave-guide) acting on the Schr{\"o}dinger field, and tracing out the tight confinement direction. The effective dynamics in the loose direction of the wave-guide turns out to be governed by the classical 1D quintic NLS equation.</description>

      <title>The Moffatt-Pukhnachev flow: a new twist on an old problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21525v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The flow of a thin viscous film on the outside of a horizontal circular cylinder, whose angular velocity is time-periodic with specified frequency and amplitude, is investigated. The constant angular velocity problem was originally studied by Moffatt (1977) and Pukhnachev (1977). Surface tension is neglected. The evolution equation for the film thickness is solved numerically for a range of oscillation amplitudes and frequency. A blow-up map charted in amplitude-frequency space reveals highly intricate fractal-like structures exhibiting self-similarity. For a general initial condition the film surface reaches a slope singularity at a finite time and tends to overturn. The high-frequency and low-frequency limits are examined asymptotically using a multiple-scales approach. At high frequency the analysis suggests that an appropriate choice of initial profile can substantially delay the overturning time, and even yield a time-periodic solution. In the low-frequency limit it is possible to construct a quasi-periodic solution that does not overturn if the oscillation amplitude lies below a threshold value. Above this value the solution tends inexorably toward blow-up. It is shown how solutions exhibiting either a single-shock or a double-shock may be constructed in common with the steadily rotating cylinder problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Within the framework of fractional quantum mechanics, an exact solution has been found for the energy spectrum of a quantum particle confined in a quantum well - a symmetric one-dimensional finite potential well. A simple graphical algorithm is described for obtaining the number of discrete levels in a quantum well and their associated energy values. The presented results open up new possibilities for emulating fractional quantum mechanics using quantum wells.</description>

Abstract: We describe relativistic particles with spin as points moving in phase space $X=T^* R^{1,3}\times C^2_L\times C^2_R$, where $T^* R^{1,3}=R^{1,3}\times R^{1,3}$ is the space of coordinates and momenta, and $C^2_L$ and $C^2_R$ are the spaces of representation of the Lorentz group of type $(\frac12 , 0)$ and $(0, \frac12)$. Passing from relativistic mechanics with a Lorentz-invariant Hamiltonian function $H$ on the phase space $X$ to quantum mechanics with a Hamiltonian operator $\hat H$, we introduce two complex conjugate line bundles $L_C^+$ and $L_C^-$ over $X$. Quantum particles are introduced as sections $\Psi_+$ of the bundle $L_C^+$ holomorphic along the space $C^2_L\times C^2_R$, and antiparticles are sections $\Psi_-^{}$ of the bundle $L_C^-$ antiholomorphic along the internal spin space $C^2_L\times C^2_R$. The wave functions $\Psi_\pm$ are characterized by conserved charges $q_{\sf{v}}=\pm 1$ associated with the structure group U(1)$_{\sf{v}}$ of the bundles $L_C^\pm$. Wave functions $\Psi_\pm$ are governed by relativistic analogue of the Schr\"odinger equation. We show how fields with spin $s=0$ (Klein-Gordon), spin $s=\frac12$ (Dirac) and spin $s=1$ (Proca fields) arise from these equations in the zeroth, first, and second order expansions of the functions $\Psi_\pm^{}$ in the coordinates of the spin space $C^2_L\times C^2_R$. The Klein-Gordon, Dirac and Proca equations for these fields follow from the Schr\"odinger equation on the extended phase space $T^* R^{1,3}\times C^2_L\times C^2_R$. Using these results, we also introduce equations describing first quantized photons. We show that taking into account the charges $q_{\sf{v}}=\pm 1$ of the fields $\Psi_\pm$ changes the definitions of the inner products and currents, which eliminates negative energies and negative probabilities from relativistic quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>Lectures on the Spinor and Twistor Formalism in 3D Conformal Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: These notes are based on my lectures given at $\text{ST}^4$ 2025 held at IISER Bhopal. We study the application of spinor and twistor methods to three dimensional conformal field theories in these notes. They are divided into three parts dealing with spinor helicity, twistors and super-twistors respectively. In the first part, we introduce the off-shell spinor helicity formalism and apply it in several contexts including double copy relations, connection to four dimensional scattering amplitudes, correlators in Chern-Simons matter theories and the holography of chiral higher spin theory. The second part of the notes introduces the twistor space formalism. After discussing the geometry of twistor space, we derive the Penrose transform for conserved currents, scalars with arbitrary scaling dimension as well as generic non-conserved operators. We also explicitly show how the spinor and twistor approaches are related. We discuss how correlators of these operators and conserved currents in particular drastically simplify in twistor space unveiling their hidden simplicity. We also extend our construction to super-conformal field theories and develop a manifest super-twistor space formalism and derive the supersymmetric Penrose transform. We find that the supersymmetric correlators are simple and natural generalizations of their non-supersymmetric counterparts. The notes are made to be self-contained and also include over $50$ exercises that illustrate the formalism.</description>

      <title>Quantum Phase Sensitivity with Generalized Coherent States Based on Deformed su(1,1) and Heisenberg Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the phase sensitivity of a Mach Zehnder interferometer using a special class of generalized coherent states constructed from generalized Heisenberg and deformed su(1,1) algebras. These states, derived from a perturbed harmonic oscillator with a four parameter deformed spectrum, provide enhanced tunability and nonclassical features. The quantum Fisher information and its associated quantum Cram\'er-Rao bound are used to define the fundamental precision limits in phase estimation. We analyze the phase sensitivity under three realistic detection methods: difference intensity detection, single mode intensity detection, and balanced homodyne detection. The performance of each method is compared with the quantum Cram\'er Rao bound to evaluate their optimality. Our results demonstrate that, for suitable parameter regimes, these generalized coherent states enable phase sensitivities approaching the quantum limit, offering a flexible framework for precision quantum metrology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by a recent progress concerning quantum commuting and quantum tensor models of composed systems we investigate a notion of (generalized) unitary induced quantum channel. Using properties of Brown algebras we provide an equivalent characterization of discussed families in both tensor and commuting paradigms. In particular, we provide an equivalent formulation of Tsirelson's conjecture (Connes' embedding problem) in terms of considered paradigms based on protocols which do not require measurements performed on infinite-dimensional subsystems. As a result we show that there is a difference between quantum commuting and quantum tensor models for generalized unitary induced channels.</description>

Abstract: We construct spectral triples of one- and two-qubit states and study the Connes spectral distances. We also construct the Dirac operator corresponding to the normal quantum trace distances. Based on the Connes spectral distances, we define a coherence measure of quantum states, and calculate the coherence of one-qubit states. We also study some simple cases about two-qubit states, and the corresponding spectral distances satisfy the Pythagoras theorem. These results are significant for the study of physical relations and geometric structures of qubits and other quantum states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18874v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study lightlikeness preserving mappings from the $4$-dimensional Minkowski spacetime $\mathcal{M}_4$ to itself under no additional regularity assumptions like continuity, surjectivity, or injectivity. We prove that such a mapping $\phi$ satisfies one of the following three conditions. (1) The mapping $\phi$ can be written as a composition of a Lorentz transformation, a multiplication by a positive scalar, and a translation. (2) There is an event $r\in \mathcal{M}_4$ such that $\phi(\mathcal{M}_4\setminus\{r\})$ is contained in one light cone. (3) There is a lightlike line $\ell$ such that $\phi(\mathcal{M}_4\setminus \ell)$ is contained in another lightlike line. Here, a line that is contained in some light cone in $\mathcal{M}_4$ is called a lightlike line. We also give several similar results on mappings defined on a certain subset of $\mathcal{M}_4$ or the compactification of $\mathcal{M}_4$.</description>

Our constructions are based on "oblique tensorization", where one-dimensional results are strongly used, and its generalizations towards complete description of non-uniqueness.

      <description>arXiv:2409.10348v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using an original method, we find the algebra of generalized symmetries of a remarkable (1+2)-dimensional ultraparabolic Fokker-Planck equation, which is also called the Kolmogorov equation and is singled out within the entire class of ultraparabolic linear second-order partial differential equations with three independent variables by its wonderful symmetry properties. It turns out that the essential subalgebra of this algebra, which consists of linear generalized symmetries, is generated by the recursion operators associated with the nilradical of the essential Lie invariance algebra of the Kolmogorov equation, and the Casimir operator of the Levi factor of the latter algebra unexpectedly arises in the consideration. We also establish an isomorphism between this algebra and the Lie algebra associated with the second Weyl algebra, which provides a dual perspective for studying their properties. After developing the theoretical background of finding exact solutions of homogeneous linear systems of differential equations using their linear generalized symmetries, we efficiently apply it to the Kolmogorov equation.</description>

      <title>Spectral Networks: Bridging higher-rank Teichm\"uller theory and BPS states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03588v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This book offers a comprehensive introduction to spectral networks from a unified viewpoint that bridges geometry with the physics of supersymmetric gauge theories. It provides the foundational background needed to approach the frontiers of this rapidly evolving field, treating geometric and physical aspects in parallel. After surveying fundamental topics in algebra and geometry, a detailed introduction to higher-rank Teichm\"uller theory is developed, including Fock-Goncharov theory for Hitchin representations, maximal representations and the more recent notion of $\Theta$-positivity. Spectral networks are subsequently introduced, emphasizing their utility in the study of character varieties via the abelianization and non-abelianization maps they define. In parallel, key aspects of four-dimensional gauge dynamics with eight supercharges are explored, including electric-magnetic duality, Seiberg-Witten theory, and class $\mathcal S$ theories. The role of spectral networks as a framework for determining and analyzing BPS spectra in class $\mathcal S$ theories is then examined. The final chapter outlines recent applications of spectral networks across a range of contemporary research areas. This volume is intended for researchers and advanced students in either mathematics or physics who wish to enter the field.</description>

Abstract: We studied some geometric properties of the Moyal sphere. Using the conformal metric of the sphere in ordinary space and the matrix basis, we calculated the scalar curvature, total curvature integral and area of the Moyal sphere. We found that when the noncommutative parameter approaches to 0, the scalar curvature and area of the Moyal sphere return to those of the ordinary sphere. As the noncommutative parameter increases, the area of the Moyal sphere will decrease and eventually approach to 0. We found that the total curvature integral of the two-dimensional Moyal sphere still satisfies the usual Gauss-Bonnet formula and does not depend on the noncommutative parameter. We also calculated the approximate expression of the conformal metric with a constant curvature and obtained the corresponding correction function. In addition, we studied a type of generalized deformed Moyal sphere with two noncommutative parameters and obtained similar results.</description>

      <title>Mean-field behavior of the quantum Ising susceptibility and a new lace expansion for the classical Ising model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06592v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The transverse-field Ising model is widely studied as one of the simplest quantum spin systems. It is known that this model exhibits a phase transition at the critical inverse temperature $\beta_{\mathrm{c}}$, which is determined by the spin-spin couplings and the transverse field $q \geq 0$. Bj\"ornberg [Commun. Math. Phys., 232 (2013)] investigated the divergence rate of the susceptibility for the nearest-neighbor model as the critical point is approached by simultaneously changing the spin-spin coupling $J \geq 0$ and $q$ in a proper manner, with fixed temperature. In this paper, we fix $J$ and $q$ and show that the susceptibility diverges as $(\beta_{\mathrm{c}} - \beta)^{-1}$ as $\beta\uparrow\beta_{\mathrm{c}}$ for $d&gt;4$ assuming an infrared bound on the space-time two-point function. One of the key elements is a stochastic-geometric representation in Bj\"ornberg &amp; Grimmett [J. Stat. Phys., 136 (2009)] and Crawford &amp; Ioffe [Commun. Math. Phys., 296 (2010)]. As a byproduct, we derive a new lace expansion for the classical Ising model (i.e., $q=0$).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08041v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a companion work on the combinatorial quantization of 4d 2-Chern-Simons theory, the author has constructed the Hopf category of quantum 2-gauge transformations $\tilde{C}=\mathbb{U}_q\mathfrak{G}$ acting on the discrete surface-holonomy configurations on a lattice. We prove in this article that the 2-$\mathsf{Hilb}$-enriched 2-representation 2-category $\operatorname{2Rep}(\tilde C)$ of finite semisimple $\mathbb{C}$-linear $\tilde C$-module categories is braided, planar-pivotal, and lax rigid, hence $\operatorname{2Rep}(\tilde C)$ provides an example of a ribbon tensor 2-category. We explicitly construct the ribbon balancing functors, and exhibit their coherence conditions against the rigid dagger structures. This allows one to refine the various notions of \textit{framing} in a 2-category with duals that have been previously studied in the literature. Following the 2-tangle hypothesis of Baez-Langford, framed invariants of 2-tangles can then be constructed from ribbon 2-functors into $\operatorname{2Rep}(\tilde C)$, analogous to the definition of decorated ribbon graphs in the Reshetikhin-Turaev construction. We will also prove that, in the classical limit $q\rightarrow 1$, the 2-category $\operatorname{2Rep}(\mathbb{U}_{q=1}\mathfrak{G})$ becomes strict pivotal in the sense of Douglas-Reutter.</description>

      <title>Langevin equations and a geometric integration scheme for the overdamped limit of rotational Brownian motion of axisymmetric particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04501v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The translational motion of anisotropic or self-propelled colloidal particles is closely linked with the particle's orientation and its rotational Brownian motion. In the overdamped limit, the stochastic evolution of the orientation vector follows a diffusion process on the unit sphere and is characterized by an orientation-dependent (``multiplicative'') noise. As a consequence, the corresponding Langevin equation attains different forms depending on whether It\=o's or Stratonovich's stochastic calculus is used. We clarify that both forms are equivalent and derive them in a top-down appraoch from a geometric construction of Brownian motion on the unit sphere, based on infinitesimal random rotations. Our approach suggests further a geometric integration scheme for rotational Brownian motion, which preserves the normalization constraint of the orientation vector exactly. We show that a simple implementation of the scheme, based on Gaussian random rotations, converges weakly at order 1 of the integration time step, and we outline an advanced variant of the scheme that is weakly exact for an arbitrarily large time step. Due to a favorable prefactor of the discretization error, already the Gaussian scheme allows for integration time steps that are one order of magnitude larger compared to a commonly used algorithm for rotational Brownian dynamics simulations based on projection on the constraining manifold. For torques originating from constant external fields, we prove by virtue of the Fokker-Planck equation that the constructed diffusion process satisfies detailed balance and converges to the correct equilibrium distribution. The analysis is restricted to time-homogeneous rotational Brownian motion (i.e., a single rotational diffusion constant), which is relevant for axisymmetric particles and also chemically anisotropic spheres, such as self-propelled Janus particles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17334v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive a fourth order entropy stable extension of the Navier-Stokes-Fourier equations into the transition regime of rarefied gases. We do this through a novel reformulation of the closure of conservation equations derived from the Boltzmann equation that subsumes existing methods such as the Chapman-Enskog expansion. We apply the linearized version of this extension to the stationary heat problem and the Poiseuille channel and compare our analytical solutions to asymptotic and numerical solutions of the linearized Boltzmann equation. In both model problems, our solutions compare remarkably well in the transition regime. For some macroscopic variables, this agreement even extends far beyond the transition regime.</description>

      <title>Lie algebraic invariants in quantum linear optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12223v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum linear optics without post-selection is not powerful enough to produce any quantum state from a given input state. This limits its utility since some applications require entangled resources that are difficult to prepare. Thus, we need a deeper understanding of linear optical state preparation. In this work, we give a recipe to derive conserved quantities in the evolution of arbitrary states along any possible passive linear interferometer. One example of such an invariant is the projection of a density operator onto the Lie algebra of passive linear optical Hamiltonians. These invariants give necessary conditions for exact state preparation: if the input and output states have different invariants, it is impossible to design a passive linear interferometer that evolves one into the other. Moreover, we provide a lower bound to the distance between an output and target state based on the distance between their invariants. This gives a necessary condition for approximate or heralded state preparations. Therefore, the invariants allow us to narrow the search when trying to prepare useful entangled states, like NOON states, from easy-to-prepare states, like Fock states. We conclude that future exact and approximate state preparation methods will need to consider the necessary conditions given by our invariants to weed out impossible linear optical evolutions.</description>

      <title>Oscillatory spacelike singularities: The Bianchi type $\mathrm{VI}_{-1/9}$ vacuum models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10375v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Bianchi type $\mathrm{VI}_{-1/9}$, $\mathrm{VIII}$ and $\mathrm{IX}$ vacuum models all have 4-dimensional Hubble-normalized state spaces and are expected to have a generic initial oscillatory singularity, but the invariant boundary sets responsible for the oscillations are much more complicated for type $\mathrm{VI}_{-1/9}$ than those of type $\mathrm{VIII}$ and $\mathrm{IX}$. For the first time, we explicitly solve the equations on these type $\mathrm{VI}_{-1/9}$ boundary sets and also introduce a new graph representation of the associated network of heteroclinic chains (i.e. sequences of solutions describing the oscillations). In particular, we give examples of networks of entangled cyclic heteroclinic chains and show that only some of these cyclic heteroclinic chains are asymptotically relevant.</description>

      <title>Massive vector field perturbations in the Schwarzschild spacetime from supersymmetric gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15627v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We unify the dynamics of massive vector (Proca) fields in Schwarzschild spacetime with supersymmetric gauge theories through the Seiberg-Witten/quasinormal mode (SW/QNM) duality. By mapping Proca perturbations-specifically monopole and odd-parity modes governed by confluent Heun equations-to the quantum Seiberg-Witten curve, we establish a gauge-gravity correspondence. Leveraging instanton counting, we analytically compute QNM and quasi-bound state frequencies to high precision, resolving spectral properties non-perturbatively. Our results align with numerical benchmarks while extending the SW framework beyond scalar fields.</description>

      <title>Constant maps in equivariant topological strings and geometric modeling of fluxes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20444v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the equivariant generalization of topological strings on toric manifolds, focusing in particular on defining the contributions of constant maps in the genus expansion of the partition function. This approach regularizes the integration over non-compact Calabi-Yau spaces, producing finite results at each order in the expansion, as illustrated by a broad set of explicit examples. Our investigation highlights the geometric modeling of flux compactifications and clarifies the link between the effective supergravity framework and the equivariant topological string formalism, building on recent developments by Martelli and Zaffaroni. We conclude that the connection between topological string theory and supergravity/field theory involves switching between geometric moduli and fluxes, shedding light on the role of ensemble averages in string theory. We propose an exact non-perturbative holographic match with the corresponding M2-brane partition functions, which we test perturbatively at all orders in the gauge group rank $N$ in a companion paper. A special case of our proposal for vanishing flux reformulates the Ooguri--Strominger--Vafa conjecture within the equivariant topological string framework.</description>

      <title>Kuramoto meets Koopman: Constants of motion, symmetries, and network motifs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06248v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using spectral properties of the Koopman generator, we derive necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of distinct constants of motion in the Kuramoto model with heterogeneous phase lags on any weighted, directed, signed graph. We also identify Lie symmetries that generate new constants of motion. These results reveal a broad class of network motifs that support conserved quantities and how a leader drives a group of conformist-contrarian oscillators to reach periodic states with higher average synchrony or even perfect synchrony.</description>

      <title>Thermal quasi-geostrophic model on the sphere: derivation and structure-preserving simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17044v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive the global model of thermal quasi-geostrophy on the sphere via asymptotic expansion of the thermal rotating shallow water equations. The model does not rely on the asymptotic expansion of the Coriolis force and extends the quasi-geostrophic model on the sphere by including an additional transported buoyancy field acting as a source term for the potential vorticity. We give its Hamiltonian description in terms of semidirect product Lie--Poisson brackets. The Hamiltonian formulation reveals the existence of an infinite number of conservation laws, Casimirs, parameterized by two arbitrary smooth functions. A structure-preserving discretization is provided based on Zeitlin's self-consistent matrix approximation for hydrodynamics. A Casimir-preserving time integrator is employed to numerically fully preserve the resulting finite-dimensional Lie--Poisson structure. Simulations reveal the formation of vorticity and buoyancy fronts, and large-scale structures in the buoyancy dynamics induced by the buoyancy-bathymetry interaction.</description>

      <title>On geometric bases for A-polynomials II: $\mathfrak{su}_3$ and Kuberberg bracket</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20260v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We continue the study of quantum A-polynomials -- equations for knot polynomials with respect to their coloring (representation-dependence) -- as the relations between different links, obtained by hanging additional ``simple'' components on the original knot. Depending on the choice of this ``decoration'', the knot polynomial is either multiplied by a number or decomposes into a sum over ``surrounding'' representations by a cabling procedure. What happens is that these two of decorations, when complicated enough, become dependent -- and this provides an equation. Remarkably it can be made independent of the representation. However, the equivalence of links is not a topological property -- it follows from the properties of $R$-matrices, and strongly depends on the choice the gauge group and particular links. The relatively well studied part of the story concerns $\mathfrak{su}_2$, where $R$-matrices can be chosen in an especially convenient Kauffman form, what makes the derivation of equations rather geometrical. To make these geometric methods somewhat simpler we suggest to use an arcade formalism/representation of the braid group to simplify decorating links universally. Here we attempt to extend this technique to the next case, $\mathfrak{su}_3$, where the Kauffman rule is substituted by a more involved Kuberberg rule, still remains more geometric than generic analysis of MOY-diagrams, needed for higher ranks. Already in this case we encounter a classification problem for possible ``decorations'' and emergence of two-lined Young diagrams in enumeration of representations.</description>

      <title>Quantum accessible information and classical entropy inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06700v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Computing accessible information for an ensemble of quantum states is a basic problem in quantum information theory. We show that the optimality criterion recently obtained in [7], when applied to specific ensembles of states, leads to nontrivial tight lower bounds for the Shannon entropy that are discrete relatives of the famous log-Sobolev inequality. In this light, the hypothesis of globally information-optimal measurement for an ensemble of equiangular equiprobable states (quantum pyramids) put forward and numerically substantiated in [2] is reconsidered and the corresponding tight entropy inequalities are proposed. Via the optimality criterion, this suggests also a proof of the conjecture concerning globally information-optimal observables for quantum pyramids put forward in [2].</description>
