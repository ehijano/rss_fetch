      <title>Economic Struggles and Inflation: How Does that affect voting decision?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Economic hardships significantly affect public perception and voting intentions in general elections. The primary focus of my study is to capture the degree of influence that individual economic hardships have on their voting. I utilize the ANES 2024 Pilot Study1 Survey dataset and introduce a novel composite Inflation Behavior Index (IBR) that captures individuals' cumulative economic and cost of living experience. To that effect, the primary objectives of the current study are threefold: first, to develop a composite economic behavior index from available data and variables to capture the overall economic experience of U.S. individuals due to ongoing inflation; second, to examine how this economic behavior impacts political engagement and voting behavior utilizing appropriate and fitting mathematical models; and finally which specific personal experiences and perceptions about economy and cost of living likely to revoke party loyalty in upcoming U.S. presidential election. My study finds that increased personal economic struggles (pocketbook voting) due to inflation make it more likely for individuals to express an intention to vote against the Incumbent even if the Incumbent is from their self-identified political party. Conversely, having a negative perception of the national economy (sociotropic voting) is less likely to revoke party loyalty in the upcoming General election. In simpler terms, voters are more likely to vote along party lines even if they perceive their party (the Incumbent) is not handling the economy and cost of living well.</description>

      <title>Evaluation methods and empirical research on coastal environmental performance for Chinese harbor cities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For controlling pollution of the marine environment while developing coastal economy, the coastal environmental performance was proposed and measured in static and dynamic methods combined with DEA and efficiency theory in this paper. With the two methods, 16 harbor cities were evaluated. The results showed the index designed in this paper can better reflect the effect to the marine environment for economy of the coastal cities.</description>

      <title>Evaluation to Chinese marine economy in the coastal areas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For promoting the development of the marine economy more sustainably, based on the data envelopment analysis method and combined with the impact of the marine environment, the environmental performance of the marine economy was evaluated for Chinese coastal provinces. Firstly, the classical CCR model was used. Then, a model that considered undesirable outputs was developed to suit the Chinese marine economy. Using the two models, the economic efficiencies without environmental consideration and the environmental performance index were calculated and compared. According to the results, the empirical relationship between EPI and EE, per capita GDP, and the industrial structure was analyzed. It is useful for guiding the coastal local economy of China to a healthy way.</description>

      <title>Measuring and Controlling Fishing Capacity for Chinese Inshore Fleets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fishing capacity and capacity utilization for Chinese inshore fleets over the latest 13 years were measured using the DEA method. Relevant models were then established to analyze the relationships between capacity output, capacity utilization, and income, and the function of collecting taxes to control fishing capacity was quantitatively simulated. It was pointed out that the tax system would be effective for curtailing fishing capacity and improving the efficiency of the entire fishing industry in China, provided that the tax rate is not too low. Finally, it was suggested that collecting taxes at a proper rate be implemented for Chinese inshore fishing fleets.</description>

      <title>Maximal Social Welfare Relations on Infinite Populations Satisfying Permutation Invariance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study social welfare relations (SWRs) on infinite utility streams. Our main result is a new characterization of a utilitarian SWR on lotteries over welfare distributions for an infinite population. We characterize this SWR as the maximally complete SWR over lotteries on such distributions which satisfies Strong Pareto, Permutation Invariance (elsewhere called "Relative Anonymity" and "Isomorphism Invariance"), Dominance, Ex Ante Indifference, and an Additive Invariance axiom.</description>

      <title>Has the Recession Started?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To answer this question, we develop a new Sahm-type recession indicator that combines vacancy and unemployment data. The indicator is the minimum of the Sahm indicator -- the difference between the 3-month trailing average of the unemployment rate and its minimum over the past 12 months -- and a similar indicator constructed with the vacancy rate -- the difference between the 3-month trailing average of the vacancy rate and its maximum over the past 12 months. We then propose a two-sided recession rule: When our indicator reaches 0.3pp, a recession may have started; when the indicator reaches 0.8pp, a recession has started for sure. This new rule is triggered earlier than the Sahm rule: on average it detects recessions 1.4 months after they have started, while the Sahm rule detects them 2.6 months after their start. The new rule also has a better historical track record: it perfectly identifies all recessions since 1930, while the Sahm rule breaks down before 1960. With July 2024 data, our indicator is at 0.5pp, so the probability that the US economy is now in recession is 40%. In fact, the recession may have started as early as March 2024.</description>

      <title>Hungry Professors? Decision Biases Are Less Widespread than Previously Thought</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In many situations people make sequences of similar, but unrelated decisions. Such decision sequences are prevalent in many important contexts including judicial judgments, loan approvals, college admissions, and athletic competitions. A growing literature claims that decisions in such sequences may be severely biased because decision outcomes seem to be systematically affected by the scheduling. In particular, it has been argued that mental depletion leads to harsher decisions before food breaks and that the ``law of small numbers'' induces decisions to be negatively auto-correlated (i.e. favorable decisions are followed by unfavorable ones and vice versa). These findings have attracted much academic and media attention and it has been suspected that they may only represent the ``tip of the iceberg''. However, voices of caution point out that existing studies may suffer from serious limitations, because the decision order is not randomly determined, other influencing factors are hard to exclude, or direct evidence for the underlying mechanisms is not available. We exploit a large-scale natural experiment in a context in which the previous literature would predict the presence of scheduling biases. Specifically, we investigate whether the grades of randomly scheduled oral exams in Law School depend on the position of the exam in the sequence. Our rich data enables us to filter-out student, professor, day, and course-specific features. Our results contradict the previous findings and suggest that caution is advised when generalizing from previous studies for policy advice.</description>

      <title>From Text to Insight: Leveraging Large Language Models for Performance Evaluation in Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study explores the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically GPT-4, to enhance objectivity in organizational task performance evaluations. Through comparative analyses across two studies, including various task performance outputs, we demonstrate that LLMs can serve as a reliable and even superior alternative to human raters in evaluating knowledge-based performance outputs, which are a key contribution of knowledge workers. Our results suggest that GPT ratings are comparable to human ratings but exhibit higher consistency and reliability. Additionally, combined multiple GPT ratings on the same performance output show strong correlations with aggregated human performance ratings, akin to the consensus principle observed in performance evaluation literature. However, we also find that LLMs are prone to contextual biases, such as the halo effect, mirroring human evaluative biases. Our research suggests that while LLMs are capable of extracting meaningful constructs from text-based data, their scope is currently limited to specific forms of performance evaluation. By highlighting both the potential and limitations of LLMs, our study contributes to the discourse on AI role in management studies and sets a foundation for future research to refine AI theoretical and practical applications in management.</description>

      <title>The Impacts of the Gender Imbalance on the Marriage Market: Evidence from World War II in Japan</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.00687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2102.00687v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study uses the unprecedented changes in the sex ratio due to the losses of men during World War II to identify the impacts of the gender imbalance on marriage market outcomes in Japan. Using newly digitized census-based historical statistics, we find evidence that men have a stronger bargaining position in the marriage market than women do. Under the conditions of relative male scarcity, women are less likely to marry. Although the entry of younger cohorts with a natural gender balance into the marriage market attenuated its magnitude, this tendency persisted until the mid-1950s. Widowed women facing male scarcity are particularly unable to remarry. Our results suggest that reinstating military pensions in the early 1950s further reduced their incentive to remarry.</description>

      <title>An Empirical Analysis of Optimal Nonlinear Pricing in Business-to-Business Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.11643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.11643v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In continuous-choice settings, consumers decide not only on whether to purchase a product, but also on how much to purchase. Thus, firms optimize a full price schedule rather than a single price point. This paper provides a methodology to empirically estimate the optimal schedule under multi-dimensional consumer heterogeneity with a focus on B2B applications. We apply our method to novel data from an educational-services firm that contains purchase-size information not only for deals that materialized, but also for potential deals that eventually failed. We show that this data, combined with identifying assumptions, helps infer how price sensitivity varies with "customer size". Using our estimated model, we show that the optimal second-degree price discrimination (i.e., optimal nonlinear tariff) improves the firm's profit upon linear pricing by at least 8.2%. That said, this second-degree price discrimination scheme only recovers 7.1% of the gap between the profitability of linear pricing and that of infeasible first degree price discrimination. We also conduct several further simulation analyses (i) empirically quantifying the magnitude by which incentive-compatibility constraints impact the optimal pricing and profits, (ii) comparing the role of demand- v.s. cost-side factors in shaping the optimal price schedule, and (iii) studying the implications of fixed fees for the optimal contract and profitability.</description>

      <title>Quantifying uncertainty in area and regression coefficient estimation from remote sensing maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13659v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Remote sensing map products are used to obtain estimates of environmental quantities, such as deforested area or the effect of conservation zones on deforestation. However, the quality of map products varies, and - because maps are outputs of complex machine learning algorithms that take in a variety of remotely sensed variables as inputs - errors are difficult to characterize. Without capturing the biases that may be present, naive calculations of population-level estimates from such maps are statistically invalid. In this paper, we compare several uncertainty quantification methods - stratification, Olofsson area estimation method, and prediction-powered inference - that combine a small amount of randomly sampled ground truth data with large-scale remote sensing map products to generate statistically valid estimates. Applying these methods across four remote sensing use cases in area and regression coefficient estimation, we find that they result in estimates that are more reliable than naively using the map product as if it were 100% accurate and have lower uncertainty than using only the ground truth and ignoring the map product. Prediction-powered inference uses ground truth data to correct for bias in the map product estimate and (unlike stratification) does not require us to choose a map product before sampling. This is the first work to (1) apply prediction-powered inference to remote sensing estimation tasks, and (2) perform uncertainty quantification on remote sensing regression coefficients without assumptions on the structure of map product errors. To improve the utility of machine learning-generated remote sensing maps for downstream applications, we recommend that map producers provide a holdout ground truth dataset to be used for calibration in uncertainty quantification alongside their maps.</description>
