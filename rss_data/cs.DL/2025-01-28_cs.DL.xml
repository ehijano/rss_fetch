      <title>HERITRACE: A User-Friendly Semantic Data Editor with Change Tracking and Provenance Management for Cultural Heritage Institutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: HERITRACE is a data editor designed for galleries, libraries, archives and museums, aimed at simplifying data curation while enabling non-technical domain experts to manage data intuitively without losing its semantic integrity. While the semantic nature of RDF can pose a barrier to data curation due to its complexity, HERITRACE conceals this intricacy while preserving the advantages of semantic representation. The system natively supports provenance management and change tracking, ensuring transparency and accountability throughout the curation process. Although HERITRACE functions effectively out of the box, it offers a straightforward customization interface for technical staff, enabling adaptation to the specific data model required by a given collection. Current applications include the ParaText project, and its adoption is already planned for OpenCitations. Future developments will focus on integrating the RDF Mapping Language (RML) to enhance compatibility with non-RDF data formats, further expanding its applicability in digital heritage management.</description>

      <title>Perspective Chapter: MOOCs in India: Evolution, Innovation, Impact, and Roadmap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the largest population of the world and one of the highest enrolments in higher education, India needs efficient and effective means to educate its learners. India started focusing on open and digital education in 1980's and its efforts were escalated in 2009 through the NMEICT program of the Government of India. A study by the Government and FICCI in 2014 noted that India cannot meet its educational needs just by capacity building in brick and mortar institutions. It was decided that ongoing MOOCs projects under the umbrella of NMEICT will be further strengthened over its second (2017-21) and third (2021-26) phases. NMEICT now steers NPTEL or SWAYAM (India's MOOCs) and several digital learning projects including Virtual Labs, e-Yantra, Spoken Tutorial, FOSSEE, and National Digital Library on India - the largest digital education library in the world. Further, India embraced its new National Education Policy in 2020 to strongly foster online education. In this chapter, we take a deep look into the evolution of MOOCs in India, its innovations, its current status and impact, and the roadmap for the next decade to address its challenges and grow. AI-powered MOOCs is an emerging opportunity for India to lead MOOCs worldwide.</description>

      <title>A review of annotation classification tools in the educational domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An annotation consists of a portion of information that is associated with a piece of content in order to explain something about the content or to add more information. The use of annotations as a tool in the educational field has positive effects on the learning process. The usual way to use this instrument is to provide students with contents, usually textual, with which they must associate annotations. In most cases this task is performed in groups of students who work collaboratively. This process encourages analysis and understanding of the contents since they have to understand them in order to annotate them, and also encourages teamwork. To facilitate its use, computer applications have been devel-oped in recent decades that implement the annotation process and offer a set of additional functionalities. One of these functionalities is the classification of the annotations made. This functionality can be exploited in various ways in the learning process, such as guiding the students in the annotation process, providing information to the student about how the annotation process is done and to the teacher about how the students write and how they understand the content, as well as implementing other innovative educational processes. In this sense, the classification of annotations plays a critical role in the application of the annotation in the educational field. There are many studies of annotations, but most of them consider the classification aspect marginally only. This paper presents an initial study of the classification mech-anisms used in the annotation tools, identifying four types of cases: absence of classification mechanisms, classification based on pre-established vocabularies, classification based on extensible vocabularies, and classification based on struc-tured vocabularies.</description>

      <title>A Survey on Knowledge Organization Systems of Research Fields: Resources and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04432v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Knowledge Organization Systems (KOSs), such as term lists, thesauri, taxonomies, and ontologies, play a fundamental role in categorising, managing, and retrieving information. In the academic domain, KOSs are often adopted for representing research areas and their relationships, primarily aiming to classify research articles, academic courses, patents, books, scientific venues, domain experts, grants, software, experiment materials, and several other relevant products and agents. These structured representations of research areas, widely embraced by many academic fields, have proven effective in empowering AI-based systems to i) enhance retrievability of relevant documents, ii) enable advanced analytic solutions to quantify the impact of academic research, and iii) analyse and forecast research dynamics. This paper aims to present a comprehensive survey of the current KOS for academic disciplines. We analysed and compared 45 KOSs according to five main dimensions: scope, structure, curation, usage, and links to other KOSs. Our results reveal a very heterogeneous scenario in terms of scope, scale, quality, and usage, highlighting the need for more integrated solutions for representing research knowledge across academic fields. We conclude by discussing the main challenges and the most promising future directions.</description>

      <title>Preserving Culinary Traditions. A Crowdsourced Digital Collection of Cookbooks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12786v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recipes of popular origin and handwritten cookbooks are often overlooked by scholars. Rag\`u is a pilot project that tries to fill in this gap by gathering and digitising a collection of cookbooks belonging to the Italian traditional cuisine, and making it accessible via a digital platform. The project aims at contributing to two research lines: a) to identify agile methods for publishing data in a low-cost crowdsourcing project, and b) to devise an effective storytelling journey for the Rag\`u project.</description>

      <title>The Vertebrate Breed Ontology: Towards Effective Breed Data Standardization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02623v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Background: Limited universally-adopted data standards in veterinary medicine hinder data interoperability and therefore integration and comparison; this ultimately impedes the application of existing information-based tools to support advancement in diagnostics, treatments, and precision medicine.
  Objectives: A single, coherent, logic-based standard for documenting breed names in health, production, and research-related records will improve data use capabilities in veterinary and comparative medicine. Methods: The Vertebrate Breed Ontology (VBO) was created from breed names and related information compiled from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, breed registries, communities, and experts, using manual and computational approaches. Each breed is represented by a VBO term that includes breed information and provenance as metadata. VBO terms are classified using description logic to allow computational applications and Artificial Intelligence-readiness.
  Results: VBO is an open, community-driven ontology representing over 19,500 livestock and companion animal breed concepts covering 49 species. Breeds are classified based on community and expert conventions (e.g., cattle breed) and supported by relations to the breed's genus and species indicated by National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Taxonomy terms. Relationships between VBO terms (e.g., relating breeds to their foundation stock) provide additional context to support advanced data analytics. VBO term metadata includes synonyms, breed identifiers/codes, and attributed cross-references to other databases.
  Conclusion and clinical importance: The adoption of VBO as a source of standard breed names in databases and veterinary electronic health records can enhance veterinary data interoperability and computability.</description>
