      <title>From Continuous to First-Order-Like: Amorphous-to-Amorphous Transition in Phase-Change Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polymorphism is ubiquitous in crystalline solids. Amorphous solids, such as glassy water and silicon, may undergo amorphous-to-amorphous transitions (AATs). The nature of AATs remains ambiguous, due to diverse system-dependent behaviors and experimental challenges to characterize disordered structures. Here, we identify two ordered motifs in amorphous phase-change materials and monitor their interplay upon pressure-induced AATs. Tuning temperature, we find a crossover from continuous to first-order-like AATs. The crossover emerges at a special pressure-temperature combination, where the AAT encounters a maximum in crystallization rate. Analyzing the two ordered motifs in a two-state model, we draw a phenomenological parallel to the phase transition behavior of supercooled water near its second critical point. This analogy raises an intriguing question regarding the existence of a critical-like point within amorphous solids.</description>

      <title>Quantum Geometry: Revisiting electronic scales in quantum matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electronic properties of solids are often well understood via the low energy dispersion of Bloch bands, motivating single band approximations in many metals and semiconductors. However, a closer look reveals new length and time scales introduced by quantum dipole fluctuations due to interband mixing, which are reflected in the momentum space textures of the electronic wavefunctions. This structure is usually referred to as quantum geometry. The scales introduced by geometry not only qualitatively modify the linear and nonlinear responses of a material but can also have a vital role in determining the many-body ground state. This review explores how quantum geometry impacts properties of materials and outlines recent experimental advances that have begun to explore quantum geometric effects in various condensed matter platforms. We discuss the separation of scales that can allow us to estimate the significance of quantum geometry in various response functions.</description>

      <title>The dynamical role of optical phonons and sub-lattice screening in a solid-state ion conductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solid-state electrolytes (SSEs) require ionic conductivities that are competitive with liquid electrolytes to realize applications in all-solid state batteries. Although numerous materials have been discovered, the underlying mechanisms enabling superionic conduction remain elusive. In particular, the role of ultrafast lattice dynamics in mediating ion migration, which involves couplings between ions, phonons, and electrons, is rarely explored experimentally at their corresponding timescales. To investigate the contributions of coupled lattice dynamics on ion migration, we modulate the charge density occupations within the crystal, and then measure the time-resolved change in impedance on picosecond timescales for a candidate SSE, Li0.5La0.5TiO3. Upon perturbation, we observe enhanced ion migration at ultrafast timescales that are shorter than laser-induced heating. The respective transients match the timescales of optical and acoustic phonon vibrations, suggesting their involvement in ion migration. We further computationally evaluate the effect of a charge transfer from the O 2p to Ti 3d band on the electronic and physical structure of LLTO. We hypothesize that the charge transfer excitation distorts the TiO6 polyhedra by altering the local charge density occupancy of the hopping site at the migration pathway saddle point, thereby causing a reduction in the migration barrier for the Li+ hop, shown using computation. We rule out the contribution of photogenerated electrons and laser heating. Overall, our investigation introduces a new spectroscopic tool to probe fundamental ion hopping mechanisms transiently at ultrafast timescales, which has previously only been achieved in a time-averaged manner or solely via computational methods. Our proposed technique expands our capability to answer dynamical questions previously limited by incumbent spectroscopic strategies.</description>

      <title>Small-Cell-Based Fast Active Learning of Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) are often trained with on-the-fly active learning, where sampled configurations from atomistic simulations are added to the training set. However, this approach is limited by the high computational cost of ab initio calculations for large systems. Recent works have shown that MLIPs trained on small cells (1-8 atoms) rival the accuracy of large-cell models (100s of atoms) at far lower computational cost. Herein, we refer to these as small-cell and large-cell training, respectively. In this work, we iterate on earlier small-cell training approaches and characterize our resultant small-cell protocol. Potassium and sodium-potassium systems were studied: the former, a simpler system benchmarked in detail; the latter, a more complex binary system for further validation. Our small-cell training approach achieves up to two orders of magnitude of cost savings compared to large-cell (54-atom) training, with some training runs requiring fewer than 120 core-hours. Static and thermodynamic properties predicted using the MLIPs were evaluated, with small-cell training in both systems yielding strong ab initio agreement. Small cells appear to encode the necessary information to model complex large-scale phenomena--solid-liquid interfaces, critical exponents, diverse concentrations--even when the training cells themselves are too small to accommodate these phenomena. Based on these tests, we provide analysis and recommendations.</description>

      <title>GPR_calculator: An On-the-Fly Surrogate Model to Accelerate Massive Nudged Elastic Band Calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present GPR_calculator, a package based on Python and C++ programming languages to build an on-the-fly surrogate model using Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) to approximate expensive electronic structure calculations. The key idea is to dynamically train a GPR model during the simulation that can accurately predict energies and forces with uncertainty quantification. When the uncertainty is high, the expensive electronic structure calculation is performed to obtain the ground truth data, which is then used to update the GPR model. To illustrate the power of GPR_calculator, we demonstrate its application in Nudged Elastic Band (NEB) simulations of surface diffusion and reactions, achieving 3-10 times acceleration compared to pure ab initio calculations. The source code is available at https://github.com/MaterSim/GPR_calculator.</description>

      <title>Exact lattice summations for Lennard-Jones potentials coupled to a three-body Axilrod-Teller-Muto term applied to cuboidal phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work provides a rigorous analysis of Bain-type cuboidal lattice transformations, which connect the face-centered cubic (fcc), mean-centered cubic (mcc), body-centered cubic (bcc) and axially centered cubic (acc) lattices. Our study incorporates a general $(n,m)$ Lennard-Jones two-body potential and a long-range repulsive Axilrod-Teller-Muto (ATM) three-body potential. The two-body lattice sums and their meromorphic continuations are evaluated to full precision using super-exponentially convergent series expansions. Furthermore, we introduce a novel approach to computing three-body lattice sums by converting the multi-dimensional sum into an integral involving products of Epstein zeta functions. This enables us to evaluate three-body lattice sums and their meromorphic continuations to machine precision within minutes on a standard laptop. Using our computational framework, we analyze the stability of cuboidal lattice phases relative to the close-packed fcc structure along a Bain transformation path for varying ATM coupling strengths. We analytically demonstrate that the ATM cohesive energy exhibits an extremum at the bcc phase and show numerically that it corresponds to a minimum for repulsive three-body forces along the Bain path. Our results indicate that strong repulsive three-body interactions can destabilize the fcc phase and render bcc energetically favorable for soft LJ potentials. However, even in this scenario, the bcc phase remains susceptible to further cuboidal distortions. These results suggest that the stability of the bcc phase is, besides vibrational, temperature, and pressure effects, strongly influenced by higher than two-body forces. Because of the wrong short-range behavior of the triple-dipole ATM model the LJ potential is limited to exponents $n&gt;9$ for the repulsive wall, otherwise one observes distortion into a set of linear chains collapsing to the origin.</description>

      <title>Cryogenic-temperature Grain-to-grain Epitaxial Growth of High-quality Ultrathin CoFe Layer on MgO Tunnel Barrier for High-performance Magnetic Tunnel Junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One candidate for ultimate non-volatile memory with ultralow power consumption is magneto-resistive random-access memory (VC-MRAM). To develop VC-MRAM, it is important to fabricate high-performance magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs), which require the epitaxial growth of an ultrathin ferromagnetic electrode on a crystalline tunnel barrier using a mass-manufacturing-compatible process. In this study, the grain-to-grain epitaxial growth of perpendicularly magnetized CoFe ultrathin films on polycrystalline MgO (001) was demonstrated using cryogenic-temperature sputtering on 300 mm Si wafers. Cryogenic-temperature sputtering at 100 K suppressed the island-like initial growth of CoFe on MgO without hampering epitaxy. Sub-nanometer-thick CoFe layers exhibited remarkable perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA). An even larger PMA was obtained using an Fe-doped MgO (MgFeO) tunnel barrier owing to improved uniformity of the CoFe layer. A 0.8-nm-thick CoFe layer grown on MgFeO exhibited a magnetic damping constant as low as 0.008. The ultralow magnetic damping enables voltage-driven magnetization switching with a low write-error rate (WER) below 10^-6 at a pulse duration of 0.3 ns, and WER on the order of 10^-3 even for a relatively long pulse duration of 1.5 ns. These properties achieved using a mass-manufacturing deposition process can promote the development of VC-MRAM and other advanced spintronic devices based on MTJs.</description>

      <title>Structure-Property Relationship in Disordered Hyperuniform Materials: Microstructure Representation, Field Fluctuations and Effective Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Disordered hyperuniform (DHU) materials are an emerging class of exotic heterogeneous material systems characterized by a unique combination of disordered local structures and a hidden long-range order, which endow them with unusual physical properties. Here, we consider material systems possessing continuously varying local material properties $\mathcal{K}({\bf x})$ modeled via a random field. We devise quantitative microstructure representation of the material systems based on a class of analytical spectral density function ${\tilde \chi}_{_\mathcal{K}}({k})$ associated with $\mathcal{K}({\bf x})$, possessing a power-law small-$k$ scaling behavior ${\tilde \chi}_{_\mathcal{K}}({k}) \sim k^\alpha$. By controlling the exponent $\alpha$ and using a highly efficient forward generative model, we obtain realizations of a wide spectrum of distinct material microstructures spanning from hyperuniform ($\alpha&gt;0$) to nonhyperuniform ($\alpha=0$) to antihyperuniform ($\alpha&lt;0$) systems. We perform a comprehensive perturbation analysis to quantitatively connect the fluctuations of the local material property to the fluctuations of the resulting physical fields. In the weak-contrast limit, our first-order perturbation theory reveals that the physical fields associated with Class-I hyperuniform materials (characterized by $\alpha \ge 2$) are also hyperuniform, albeit with a lower hyperuniformity exponent ($\alpha-2$). As one moves away from this weak-contrast limit, the fluctuations of the physical field develop a diverging spectral density at the origin. We also establish an end-to-end mapping connecting the spectral density of the local material property to the overall effective conductivity of the material system via numerical homogenization.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of Circular Complex Permeability in Single-Crystal Yttrium Iron Garnet at Cryogenic Temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The operation of superconducting qubits requires a sensitive readout circuit at cryogenic temperatures, driving the demand for cryogenic non-reciprocal microwave components such as circulators. However, evaluating these components at low temperatures presents significant challenges for companies and institutions without specialized measurement systems. In the development of such cryogenic non-reciprocal components, the temperature dependence of ferrite's magnetic properties is the most critical factor. Therefore, an evaluation technique for accurately assessing these properties at cryogenic temperatures is essential.
  In this study, we develop a measurement method to characterize low-loss ferrite materials over a temperature range of 300 K to 2 K. The use of the circularly polarized resonance mode (TE11n) enables the direct estimation of circular complex permeability and the determination of key material parameters, including saturation magnetization and damping constant - both essential for assessing the performance of ferrite materials in circulator applications. Without the need for device fabrication, we demonstrate that single-crystal Yttrium Iron Garnet (YIG) can effectively function as a circulator down to 2 K. This approach offers a promising pathway for the development of cryogenic circulators.</description>

      <title>Optoelectronic properties of self-trapped holes in orthorhombic Ga2O3 and its alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigated the influence of valence band holes on the optoelectronic properties of orthorhombic k-Ga2O3 and its alloys with Al and In. Our hybrid density functional theory calculations show that self-trapped holes (STHs) localize on oxygen atoms within a single unit cell and exhibit \emph{p}-orbital characteristics. The inclusion of isoelectronic dopants such as Al and In reduces but does not remove the absorption of visible light due to STH formation. The combination of a positive STH formation energy, large lattice distortions, and emergent acceptor levels, coupled with the observed red-shifted, visible spectrum, emergent absorption peaks, implies that alternative doping/alloying strategies are necessary to achieve effective p-type conductivity in orthorhombic k-Ga2O3.</description>

      <title>Laboratory Three-dimensional X-ray Micro-beam Laue Diffraction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of three-dimensional (3D) non-destructive X-ray characterization techniques in home laboratories is essential for enabling many more researchers to perform 3D characterization daily, overcoming the limitations imposed by competitive and scarce access to synchrotron facilities. Recent efforts have focused on techniques such as laboratory diffraction contrast tomography (LabDCT), which allows 3D characterization of recrystallized grains with sizes larger than 15-20 $\mu$m, offering a boundary resolution of approximately 5$\mu$m using commercial X-ray computed tomography (CT) systems. To enhance the capabilities of laboratory instruments, we have developed a new laboratory-based 3D X-ray micro-beam diffraction (Lab-3D$\mu$XRD) technique. Lab-3D$\mu$XRD combines the use of a focused polychromatic beam with a scanning-tomographic data acquisition routine to enable depth-resolved crystallographic orientation characterization. This work presents the first realization of Lab-3D$\mu$XRD, including hardware development through the integration of a newly developed Pt-coated twin paraboloidal capillary X-ray focusing optics into a conventional X-ray $\mu$CT system, as well as the development of data acquisition and processing software. The results are validated through comparisons with LabDCT and synchrotron phase contrast tomography. The findings clearly demonstrate the feasibility of Lab-3D$\mu$XRD, particularly in detecting smaller grains and providing intragranular information. Finally, we discuss future directions for developing Lab-3D$\mu$XRD into a versatile tool for studying materials with smaller grain sizes and high defect densities, including the potential of combining it with LabDCT and $\mu$CT for multiscale and multimodal microstructural characterization.</description>

      <title>Atomic structure analysis of PL5 in silicon carbide with single-spin spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Divacancy (VV) spin defects in 4H polytype of silicon carbide (4H-SiC) are emerging candidates for quantum information processing and quantum sensing. Among these defects, PL5 and PL6 stand out due to their superior charge stability and optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) properties at room temperature. However, their atomic structures remain unresolved, with ongoing controversy regarding their potential association with stacking faults. Previous measurements relying on spin ensemble detection are insufficient to draw definitive conclusions. In this study, we conduct correlative imaging of stacking faults and PL5-6 at single-defect level, conclusively demonstrating that PL5-6 are not associated with stacking faults. Further investigation of PL5 through single-spin ODMR spectroscopy allows us to determine its six spatial orientations, as well as to measure the orientation of its transverse anisotropy spin splitting (E) and the statistical distribution of hyperfine splitting. These results and ab initio calculations suggest that PL5 should be VsiVc(hk) divacancy coupled with a nearby antisite atom (VVA). The structure resolution of PL5 starts the first step toward its controllable fabrication, paving the way for various applications.</description>

      <title>Enhanced THz emission from spintronic emitters with Pt-Al alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Platinum (Pt) is the element with the largest spin Hall conductivity and is known as the most efficient spin-to-charge conversion material in spintronic THz emitters. By alloying with aluminum (Al), its resistivity can be substantially increased, exceeding $100\,\mu\Omega$cm. While the spin Hall conductivity is reduced by alloying, the relative resistivity increase surpasses the reduction of spin Hall conductivity and thereby enhances the spin Hall angle. We make use of this mechanism to improve the commonly used Pt-based spintronic THz emitter and demonstrate that an increase of 67% in the THz emission amplitude can be achieved between 20\% and 30\% Al in Pt. We show that the enhanced THz emission amplitude is driven by the enhanced multilayer impedance due to the larger resistivity.</description>

      <title>Quasi-rigid-band behavior and band gap changes upon isovalent substitution in Cs$_3$Bi$_2$Br$_{9-x}$I$_x$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recently introduced approach, combining the parameter-free Armiento-K\"{u}mmel generalized gradient approximation exchange functional with the nonseparable gradient approximation Minnesota correlation functional, was used to calculate the electronic structure of the Cs$_3$Bi$_2$Br$_{9-x}$I$_x$ series within density functional theory including the spin-orbit coupling. The changes in the band gap size and its dependence on the $x$ value was investigated. The band gap was found to be of indirect nature and it decreases with increasing I content as long as the system is in the $P\overline{3}m1$ phase. A clear non-linear dependence of the band gap size on $x$ was established which is in qualitative and quantitative agreement with reported experimental data. The quasi-rigid band behavior of the states in the valence and conduction bands of the $P\overline{3}m1$ phase is discussed since no significant changes in the shape of the total density of unoccupied states were observed upon the isovalent substitution.</description>

      <title>Nonperturbative quantum theory of multiplasmonic electron emission from surfaces: Gauge-specific cumulant expansions vs. Volkov ansatz over plasmonic coherent states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Energetic electromagnetic fields produce a variety of elementary excitations in solids that can strongly modify their primary photoemission spectra. Such is the plasmon excitation or pumping mechanism which, although indirect, is very efficient and hence may give rise to formation of plasmonic coherent states. In turn, these states may act as a source or sink of energy and momentum for escaping electrons. Starting from the model Hamiltonian approach we show that prepumped plasmonic bath of coherent states gives rise to ponderomotive potentials and Floquet electronic band structure that support multiple plasmon-induced electron emission or plasmoemission from metals. Theoretical description of multiple plasmoemission requires a nonperturbative approch which is here formulated by applying cumulant expansion and Volkov ansatz to the calculations of electron wavefunctions and emission rates. The calculations are performed in the standard length gauge as well as in the Pauli-transformed velocity gauge for electron-plasmon interaction. The applicability of two nonperturbative approaches to calculation of excitation amplitudes are examined in each gauge. They smoothly interpolate between the fully quantal first order Born approximation and semiclassical multiplasmon-induced electron excitation limit. This is illustrated on the example of plasmoemission from Floquet surface bands on Ag(111) from which this channel of electron yield has been detected. Our calculations indicate that even subsingle mode occupations of plasmonic coherent states can support multiplasmon electron emission from surface bands. A way of calibration of plasmonic coherent states is proposed.</description>

Abstract: Using first-principles calculations, we examine the electronic structure of quasi-one-dimensional fullerene nanoribbons derived from two-dimensional fullerene networks. Depending on the edge geometry and width, these nanoribbons exhibit a rich variety of properties, including direct and indirect band gaps, positive and negative effective masses, as well as dispersive and flat bands. Our findings establish a comprehensive understanding of the electronic properties of fullerene nanoribbons, with potential implications for the design of future nanoscale devices.</description>

      <title>Mechanical Amorphization of Glass-Forming Systems Induced by Oscillatory Deformation: The Energy Absorption and Efficiency Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The kinetic process of mechanical amorphization plays a central role in tailoring material properties. Therefore, a quantitative understanding of how this process depends on loading parameters is critical for optimizing mechanical amorphization and tuning material performance. In this study, we employ molecular dynamics simulations to investigate oscillatory deformation-induced amorphization in three glass-forming intermetallic systems, addressing two unresolved challenges: (1) the relationship between amorphization efficiency and mechanical loading, and (2) energy absorption dynamics during crystal-to-amorphous (CTA) transitions. Our results demonstrate a decoupling between amorphization efficiency--governed by work rate and described by an effective temperature model--and energy absorption, which adheres to the Herschel-Bulkley constitutive relation. Crucially, the melting enthalpy emerges as a key determinant of the energy barrier, establishing a thermodynamic analogy between mechanical amorphization and thermally induced melting. This relationship provides a universally applicable metric to quantify amorphization kinetics. By unifying material properties and loading conditions, this work establishes a predictive framework for controlling amorphization processes. These findings advance the fundamental understanding of deformation-driven phase transitions and offer practical guidelines for designing materials with tailored properties for ultrafast fabrication, ball milling, and advanced mechanical processing techniques.</description>

      <title>A Novel Graphyne-Like Carbon Allotrope: 2D Dewar-Anthracyne</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anthracyne (2DDA). 2DDA consists of chains of Dewar-anthracenes connected by acetylenic linkages. DFT-based simulations show that 2DDA is thermally stable and exhibits no imaginary phonon modes, confirming its dynamic stability. 2DDA is metallic with Dirac-like features near the Fermi level, dominated by C pz orbitals. It shows marked mechanical anisotropy, with Young's modulus of 176.24 N/m (x) and 31.51 N/m (y), shear modulus up to 69.14 N/m, and Poisson's ratio varying from 0.27 to 0.87. The material also exhibits strong anisotropic optical absorption in the visible and ultraviolet ranges. Raman and IR spectra reveal intense bands at 648 cm-1 (Raman) and 1292 cm-1 (Infrared). Nanoribbon structures derived from 2DDA exhibit diverse electronic behaviors, from metals up to bandgap values of up to 0.42 eV, depending on the edge-type terminations and width. These findings demonstrate the 2DDA potential for nanoelectronic and optoelectronic applications.</description>

      <title>High-Performance Gradient Evaluation for Complex Soft Materials Using MPI-based DFS Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07111v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article presents a depth-first search (DFS)-based algorithm for evaluating sensitivity gradients in the topology optimization of soft materials exhibiting complex deformation behavior. The algorithm is formulated using a time-dependent adjoint sensitivity approach and is implemented within a PETSc-based C++ MPI framework for efficient parallel computing. It has been found that on a single processor, the sensitivity analysis for these complex materials can take approximately 45 minutes. This necessitates the use of high-performance computing (HPC) to achieve feasible optimization times. This work provides insights into the algorithmic framework and its application to large-scale generative design for physics integrated simulation of soft materials under complex loading conditions.</description>

      <title>Functionally graded keratin facilitates tactile sensing in elephant whiskers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07143v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Keratin composites enable animals to hike with hooves, fly with feathers, and sense with skin. These distinct functions arise from variations in the underlying properties and microscale arrangement of this natural polymer. One well-studied example is mammalian whiskers, elongated keratin rods attached to tactile skin structures that extend the animal's sensory volume. Here, we investigate the non-actuated whiskers that cover Asian elephant (Elephas maximus) trunks and find they are geometrically and mechanically tailored to facilitate tactile perception by encoding contact location in vibrotactile signal amplitude and frequency. Elephant whiskers emerge from armored trunk skin and shift from a thick, circular, porous, stiff root to a thin, ovular, dense, soft point. This smooth transition enables interaction with widely varying substrates, reduces wear, and increases the vibrotactile signal information generated during contact. The functionally graded geometry, porosity, and stiffness of elephant whiskers tune the neuromechanics of trunk touch, facilitating highly dexterous manipulation.</description>

      <title>Magnetic ground state of a Jeff = 1/2 based frustrated triangular lattice antiferromagnet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The subtle interplay between competing degrees of freedom, crystal electric fields, and spin correlations can lead to exotic quantum states in 4f ion-based frustrated magnets. We present the crystal structure, thermodynamic, and muon spin relaxation studies of the 4f ion-based frustrated magnet Ba4YbReWO12, wherein Yb3+ ions constitute a triangular lattice. The magnetic susceptibility does not show any signature of spin freezing down to 1.9 K or long-range magnetic ordering down to 0.4 K. The low-temperature Curie-Weiss fit to the inverse magnetic susceptibility data reveals a weak antiferromagnetic exchange interaction between the Jeff=1/2 state of the Yb3+ moments in the lowest Kramers doublet. The lowest Kramers ground state doublet is well separated from the first excited state with a gap of 278 K, as evidenced by our muon spin relaxation experiments that support the realization of the Jeff 1/2 state at low temperatures. The specific heat indicates a phase transition at 0.09 K, and the associated entropy release at low temperatures is consistent with that expected for the Jeff = 1/2 state. The zero-field muSR measurements show neither the signature of spin freezing nor a phase transition, at least down to 43 mK. Our results suggest the coexistence of static and slowly fluctuating moments in the ground state of this Jeff = 1/2 frustrated triangular lattice antiferromagnet. Ba4RReWO12 (R=rare earth) offers a viable platform to realize intriguing quantum states borne out of spin-orbit coupling and frustration.</description>

      <title>Magnetic excitations in Nd$_{n+1}$Ni$_{n}$O$_{3n+1}$ Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates observed via resonant inelastic x-ray scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic interactions are thought to play a key role in the properties of many unconventional superconductors, including cuprates, iron pnictides, and square-planar nickelates. Superconductivity was also recently observed in the bilayer and trilayer Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates, whose electronic structure is expected to differ from that of cuprates and square-planar nickelates. Here we study how electronic structure and magnetic interactions evolve with the number of layers, $n$, in thin film Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates Nd$_{n+1}$Ni$_{n}$O$_{3n+1}$ with $n=1,\:3$, and 5 using resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS). The RIXS spectra are consistent with a high-spin $|3d^8 \underline{L} \rangle$ electronic configuration, resembling that of La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$NiO$_4$ and the parent perovskite, NdNiO$_3$. The magnetic excitations soften to lower energy in the structurally self-doped, higher-$n$ films. Our observations confirm that structural tuning is an effective route for altering electronic properties, such as magnetic superexchange, in this prominent family of materials.</description>

      <title>Low-voltage Ferroelectric Field-Effect Transistors with Ultrathin Aluminum Scandium Nitride and 2D channels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07271v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The continued evolution of CMOS technology demands materials and architectures that emphasize low power consumption, particularly for computations involving large scale data processing and multivariable optimization. Ferroelectric materials offer promising solutions through enabling dual-purpose memory units capable of performing both storage and logic operations. In this study, we demonstrate ferroelectric field effect transistors (FeFETs) with MoS2 monolayer channels fabricated on ultrathin 5 nm and 10 nm ferroelectric Aluminum Scandium Nitride (AlScN) films. By decreasing the thickness of the ferroelectric film, we achieve significantly reduced gate voltages (&lt;3V) required to switch the conductance of the devices, enabling operation at low voltages compatible with advanced CMOS. We observe a characteristic crossover in hysteresis behavior that varies with film thickness, channel fabrication method, and environmental conditions. Through systematic investigation of multiple parameters including channel fabrication methods, dimensional scaling, and environmental effects, we provide pathways to improve device performance. While our devices demonstrate clear ferroelectric switching behavior, further optimization is required to enhance the ON/OFF ratio at zero gate voltage while continuing to reduce the coercive field of these ultrathin films.</description>

      <title>Data Fusion of Deep Learned Molecular Embeddings for Property Prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07297v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data-driven approaches such as deep learning can result in predictive models for material properties with exceptional accuracy and efficiency. However, in many problems data is sparse, severely limiting their accuracy and applicability. To improve predictions, techniques such as transfer learning and multi-task learning have been used. The performance of multi-task learning models depends on the strength of the underlying correlations between tasks and the completeness of the dataset. We find that standard multi-task models tend to underperform when trained on sparse datasets with weakly correlated properties. To address this gap, we use data fusion techniques to combine the learned molecular embeddings of various single-task models and trained a multi-task model on this combined embedding. We apply this technique to a widely used benchmark dataset of quantum chemistry data for small molecules as well as a newly compiled sparse dataset of experimental data collected from literature and our own quantum chemistry and thermochemical calculations. The results show that the fused, multi-task models outperform standard multi-task models for sparse datasets and can provide enhanced prediction on data-limited properties compared to single-task models.</description>

      <title>Catalight -- an open source automated photocatalytic reactor package illustrated through plasmonic acetylene hydrogenation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07404v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An open-source and modular Python package, Catalight, is developed and demonstrated to automate (photo)catalysis measurements. (Photo)catalysis experiments require studying several parameters to evaluate performance, including temperature, gas flow rate and composition, illumination power, and spectral profile. Catalight orchestrates measurements over this complicated parameter space and systematically stores, analyzes, and visualizes the resulting data. To showcase the capabilities of Catalight, we perform an automated apparent activation barrier measurement of acetylene hydrogenation over a plasmonic AuPd catalyst on Al2O3 support, simultaneously varying laser power, wavelength, and temperature in a multi-day experiment controlled by a simple Python script. Our chemical results unexpectedly show an increased activation barrier upon light excitation, contrary to previous findings for other plasmonic reactions and catalysts. We show that the reaction rate order with respect to both acetylene and hydrogen is unchanged upon illumination, suggesting that molecular surface coverage is not changing under light excitation. By analyzing the inhomogeneity of the laser induced heating, we attribute these results to a partial photothermal effect combined with a photochemical/hot electron driven mechanism. Our findings highlight the capabilities of a new experiment automation tool; explore the photocatalytic mechanism for an industrially relevant reaction; and identify systematic sources of error in canon photocatalysis experimental procedures.</description>

      <title>Lifetime-limited Gigahertz-frequency Mechanical Oscillators with Millisecond Coherence Times</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-frequency mechanical oscillators with long coherence times are essential to realizing a variety of high-fidelity quantum sensors, transducers, and memories. However, the unprecedented coherence times needed for quantum applications require exquisitely sensitive new techniques to probe the material origins of phonon decoherence and new strategies to mitigate decoherence in mechanical oscillators. Here, we combine non-invasive laser spectroscopy techniques with materials analysis to identify key sources of phonon decoherence in crystalline media. Using micro-fabricated high-overtone bulk acoustic-wave resonators ($\mu$HBARs) as an experimental testbed, we identify phonon-surface interactions as the dominant source of phonon decoherence in crystalline quartz; lattice distortion, subsurface damage, and high concentration of elemental impurities near the crystal surface are identified as the likely causes. Removal of this compromised surface layer using an optimized polishing process is seen to greatly enhance coherence times, enabling $\mu$HBARs with Q-factors of &gt; 240 million at 12 GHz frequencies, corresponding to &gt; 6 ms phonon coherence times and record-level f-Q products. Complementary phonon linewidth and time-domain ringdown measurements, performed using a new Brillouin-based pump-probe spectroscopy technique, reveal negligible dephasing within these oscillators. Building on these results, we identify a path to &gt; 100 ms coherence times as the basis for high-frequency quantum memories. These findings clearly demonstrate that, with enhanced control over surfaces, dissipation and noise can be significantly reduced in a wide range of quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Chirality-induced selectivity of angular momentum by orbital Edelstein effect in carbon nanotubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are promising materials exhibiting exceptional strength, electrical conductivity, and thermal properties, making them promising for various technologies. Besides achiral configurations with a zigzag or armchair edge, there exist chiral CNTs with a broken inversion symmetry. Here, we demonstrate that chiral CNTs exhibit chirality-induced orbital selectivity (CIOS), which is caused by the orbital Edelstein effect and could be detected as chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS). We find that the orbital Edelstein susceptibility is an odd function of the chirality angle of the nanotube and is proportional to its radius. For metallic CNTs close to the Fermi level, the orbital Edelstein susceptibility increases quadratically with energy. This makes the CISS and CIOS of metallic chiral nanotubes conveniently tunable by doping or applying a gate voltage, which allows for the generation of spin- and orbital-polarized currents. The possibility of generating large torques makes chiral CNTs interesting candidates for technological applications in spin-orbitronics and quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Hallmarks of terahertz magnon currents in an antiferromagnetic insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07682v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The efficient transport of spin angular momentum is expected to play a crucial role in future spintronic devices, which potentially operate at frequencies reaching the terahertz range. Antiferromagnetic insulators exhibit significant potential for facilitating ultrafast pure spin currents by terahertz magnons. Consequently, we here use femtosecond laser pulses to trigger ultrafast spin currents across antiferromagnetic NiO thin films in Py|NiO|Pt stacks, where permalloy (Py) and Pt serve as spin-current source and detector respectively. We find that the spin current pulses traversing NiO reach a velocity up to 40 nm/ps and experience increasing delay and broadening as the NiO thickness is increased. We can consistently explain our observations by ballistic transport of incoherent magnon. Our approach has high potential to characterize terahertz magnon transport in magnetic insulators with any kind of magnetic order.</description>

      <title>Antiferromagnetic Chiral Bobber Formation and Topological Proximity Effect in MnBi2Te4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07747v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With topological materials being billed as the key to a new generation of nanoelectronics via either functional real-space topological structures (domain walls, skyrmions etc.) or via momentum-space topology (topological insulators), tailored and controllable topological properties are of paramount significance, since they lead to topologically protected states with negligible dissipation, enabling stable and non-volatile information processing. Here, we report on the evolution of topological magnetic textures in the proximity of other topological defects, i.e., antiferromagnetic domain walls in the topological insulator MnBi2Te4. The transition from the antiferromagnetic ground state to a canted antiferromagnetic state at finite magnetic fields is accompanied by the formation of chiral bobbers - bulk-terminated topological defects adjacent to the domain walls in this system, leading to a topological proximity effect.</description>

      <title>Short-range magnetic order and planar anisotropy in the topological ferrimagnet Mn3Si2Te6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mn3Si2Te6 is a ferrimagnetic topological nodal-line semiconductor that exhibits unconventional colossal magnetoresitance (CMR) behavior, with short-range spin fluctuations being potentially intimately linked to the emergent properties. In this work, we determine the short range magnetic order and quantify the local magnetic anisotropy through total neutron scattering and polarized neutron powder diffraction (pNPD) measurements on polycrystalline Mn3Si2Te6. The real space local and long range spin structure was determined through the application of magnetic pair distribution function (mPDF) analysis, with measurements from the low temperature ordered phase to the high temperature paramagnetic state. Short-range order over a frustrated trimer of three nearest neighbors was found to exist well above the long range ferrimagnetic transition. pNPD measurements in the spin polarized paramagnetic state were used to extract the local site susceptibility tensor of the Mn ions to quantify the magnetic anisotropy. Our combined mPDF and pNPD results provide quantitative information on the short-range order intrinsic to Mn3Si2Te6, showing strong in-plane anisotropy with the spins largely confined to the ab-plane in zero field and remain stable with increasing temperature through the long-range to short-range ordered transition.</description>

      <title>Phonon fluctuation diagnostics: Origin of charge order in AV$_3$Sb$_5$ kagome metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07883v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The microsopic origin of the charge-density wave (CDW) in AV$_3$Sb$_5$ (A = K, Rb, Cs) kagome metals remains a longstanding question, often revolving around electron-phonon coupling and purely electronic mechanisms involving Van Hove scenarios, nesting, and sublattice interference. To reveal the processes driving the CDW transition, we combine ab-initio calculations analysis of the phonon self-energy and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). Our momentum-resolved study, supported by ARPES data, reveals that lattice instabilities in the V-135 family of kagome metals appear to also be driven by electronic states far from high-symmetry points, where these states exhibit the strongest coupling with the phonon modes responsible for the CDW distortion. Footing on an interpretation scheme based on phonon fluctuation diagnostics, our work challenges and revises theories that so far have exclusively attributed CDW formation to nesting effects close to the Fermi level.</description>

      <title>Local structural distortions drive magnetic molecular field in compositionally complex spinel oxide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01156v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding how local distortions determine the functional properties of high entropy materials, containing five or more elements at a crystallographic site, is an open challenge. We address this for a compositionally complex spinel oxide (Mn$_{0.2}$Co$_{0.2}$Ni$_{0.2}$Cu$_{0.2}$Zn$_{0.2}$)Cr$_2$O$_4$ ($A^5$Cr$_2$O$_4$). By comparatively examining extended X-ray absorption fine structure on $A^5$Cr$_2$O$_4$ and its parent counterparts $A$Cr$_2$O$_4$ along with density functional theory calculations for multiple configurations, we find that the element-specific distortions go beyond the first neighbor. Specifically, the strong Jahn-Teller distortion present in CuCr$_2$O$_4$ is found to be completely suppressed in $A^5$Cr$_2$O$_4$. Instead, there is a broad distribution of Cu-O and Cu-Cr bond distances while other $A$-O distances acquire certain specific values. This study demonstrates the additional flexibility of a cationic sublattice in maintaining a uniform long-range structure, in contrast to previous reports showing only the accommodative anionic sublattice. Remarkably, despite the presence of multiple magnetic ions and variable bond lengths, the mean field magnetic interactions of $A^5$Cr$_2$O$_4$ exhibit a striking resemblance to those of NiCr$_2$O$_4$. This compelling observation originates from the comparability of bond lengths around Cr in both materials. Our study paves the way for a deeper understanding of the impact of local structural distortions in compositionally complex quantum materials, enabling the targeted design with tailored properties.</description>

      <title>Magnon spectroscopy in the electron microscope</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02908v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The miniaturisation of transistors is approaching its limits due to challenges in heat management and information transfer speed. To overcome these obstacles, emerging technologies such as spintronics are being developed, which leverage the electron's spin in addition to its charge. Local phenomena at interfaces or structural defects will greatly influence the efficiency of spin-based devices, making the ability to study and control spin wave propagation at the nano- and atomic scales a key challenge. The development of high-spatial-resolution tools to probe spin waves, also called magnons, at relevant lengthscales is thus essential to understand how their properties are affected by such local features. Here, we show the first experimental detection of bulk magnons at the nanoscale using scanning transmission electron microscopy. By employing high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy with hybrid-pixel direct electron detectors optimized for low acceleration voltages, we successfully overcome the challenges posed by weak signals and identify magnon excitations in a thin NiO nanocrystal. Advanced inelastic electron scattering simulations corroborate our findings. These results open new avenues for detecting magnons, exploring their dispersions and their modifications arising from nanoscale structural or chemical defects. This marks an important milestone in magnonics and presents exciting opportunities for the future development of spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Multifunctional steep-slope spintronic transistors with spin-gapless-semiconductor or spin-gapped-metal electrodes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07216v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spin-gapless semiconductors (SGSs) are a promising class of materials for spintronic applications, enabling functions beyond conventional electronics. This study introduces a novel design for multifunctional spintronic field-effect transistors (FETs) using SGSs and/or spin-gapped metals (SGMs) as source and drain electrodes. These devices operate similarly to metal-semiconductor Schottky barrier FETs, where a potential barrier forms between the SGS (or SGM) electrode and the semiconducting channel. Unlike traditional Schottky barrier FETs, these devices utilize the unique spin-dependent transport properties of SGS/SGM electrodes to achieve sub-60 mV/dec switching, overcoming the 60 mV/dec sub-threshold swing limit in MOSFETs for low-voltage operation. Additionally, SGMs contribute a negative differential resistance (NDR) effect with an ultra-high peak-to-valley current ratio. The proposed spintronic FETs combine sub-60 mV/dec switching, non-local giant magnetoresistance (GMR), and NDR, making them suitable for applications like logic-in-memory computing and multivalued logic. These properties support computing architectures beyond the von-Neumann model, enabling efficient data processing. Two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterials provide a promising platform for these multifunctional FETs. We screen a computational 2D materials database to identify suitable SGS and SGM materials, selecting VS$2$ as the SGS for simulations. Using a non-equilibrium Green's function method with density functional theory, we simulate transfer ($I{\mathrm{D}}$-$V_{\mathrm{G}}$) and output ($I_{\mathrm{D}}$-$V_{\mathrm{D}}$) characteristics of a VS$_2$/Ga$_2$O$_2$ FET based on 2D type-II SGS VS$_2$, predicting a sub-threshold swing of 20 mV/dec, a high on/off ratio of 10$^8$, and a notable non-local GMR effect, demonstrating potential for low-power, high-performance applications.</description>

      <title>Advancing Electrochemical CO$_2$ Capture with Redox-Active Metal-Organic Frameworks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16444v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Addressing climate change calls for action to control CO$_2$ pollution. Direct air and ocean capture offer a solution to this challenge. Making carbon capture competitive with alternatives, such as forestation and mineralisation, requires fundamentally novel approaches and ideas. One such approach is electrosorption, which is currently limited by the availability of suitable electrosorbents. In this work, we introduce a metal-organic copper-2,3,6,7,10,11-hexahydroxytriphenylene (Cu$_3$(HHTP)$_2$) metal-organic framework (MOF) that can act as electrosorbent for CO$_2$ capture, thereby expanding the palette of materials that can be used for this process. Cu$_3$(HHTP)$_2$ is the first MOF to switch its ability to capture and release CO$_2$ in aqueous electrolytes. By using cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD) analysis, and differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS), we demonstrate reversible CO$_2$ electrosorption. Based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we provide atomistic insights into the mechanism of electrosorption and conclude that efficient CO$_2$ capture is facilitated by a combination of redox-active copper atom and aromatic HHTP ligand within Cu3(HHTP)2. By showcasing the applicability of Cu$_3$(HHTP)$_2$ -- with a CO$_2$ capacity of 2 mmol g$^{-1}$ and an adsorption enthalpy of -20 kJ mol$^{-1}$ - this study encourages further exploration of conductive redox-active MOFs in the search for superior CO$_2$ electrosorbents.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11817v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The difference between free surface energy and fracture toughness in amorphous silica is studied via multi-scale simulations. We combine the homogenization of a molecular dynamics fracture model with a phase-field approach to track and quantify the various energy contributions. We clearly separate free surface energy localized as potential energy on the surface and damage diffusion over a 16-23 A range around the crack path. The plastic contribution is negligible. These findings, which clarify brittle fracture mechanisms in amorphous materials, align with toughness measurements in silica.</description>

      <title>Strain-induced non-relativistic altermagnetic spin splitting effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17916v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, the large time-reversal-odd ($\mathcal{T}$-odd) spin current generated by the non-relativistic altermagnetic spin splitting effect (ASSE) has demonstrated significant potential for spintronic applications, with both computational and experimental validations. However, considering the broad application prospects and the scarcity of conductive altermagnetic materials, the development of novel reliable methods for inducing altermagnetism is necessary. Here, strain engineering is proposed as a simple yet effective approach. This work focuses on $\mathrm{OsO}_2$--the $5d$ counterpart of $\mathrm{RuO}_2$ sharing the rutile structure--employing $ab~initio$ calculations to systematically investigate strain effects on its ASSE. We find that applying a minor equibiaxial tensile strain $\mathcal{E}_{\mathrm{ts}}$ to $\mathrm{OsO}_2$ can induce a transition from non-magnetic to altermagnetic states. Only $3\%$ $\mathcal{E}_{\mathrm{ts}}$ is required to achieve a spin-charge conversion ratio ($\theta_{\text{AS}}$) of $\sim7\%$ for the $\mathcal{T}$-odd spin current generated by ASSE, far exceeding the intrinsic spin Hall angle $\theta_{\text{IS}}$ produced by the conventional spin Hall effect (CSHE). Calculations reveal that substantial $\theta_{\text{AS}}$ persists even in the absence of spin-orbit coupling, with its magnitude positively correlating to non-relativistic spin splitting magnitude, which further confirms the strain-induced ASSE's non-relativistic origin. Further calculations reveal that $\mathrm{RuO}_2$ exhibits analogous phenomena, which may resolve recent controversies regarding its magnetic properties. Our research opens new simple pathways for developing next-generation altermagnetic spintronic devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04558v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Triggered by the development of exfoliation and the identification of a wide range of extraordinary physical properties in self-standing films consisting of one or few atomic layers, two-dimensional (2D) materials such as graphene, transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), and other van der Waals (vdW) crystals currently constitute a wide research field protruding in multiple directions in combination with layer stacking and twisting, nanofabrication, surface-science methods, and integration into nanostructured environments. Photonics encompasses a multidisciplinary collection of those directions, where 2D materials contribute with polaritons of unique characteristics such as strong spatial confinement, large optical-field enhancement, long lifetimes, high sensitivity to external stimuli (e.g., electric and magnetic fields, heating, and strain), a broad spectral range from the far infrared to the ultraviolet, and hybridization with spin and momentum textures of electronic band structures. The explosion of photonics with 2D materials as a vibrant research area is producing breakthroughs, including the discovery and design of new materials and metasurfaces with unprecedented properties as well as applications in integrated photonics, light emission, optical sensing, and exciting prospects for applications in quantum information, and nanoscale thermal transport. This Roadmap summarizes the state of the art in the field, identifies challenges and opportunities, and discusses future goals and how to meet them through a wide collection of topical sections prepared by leading practitioners.</description>

      <title>Screening of material defects using universal machine-learning interatomic potentials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06993v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Finding new materials with previously unknown atomic structure or materials with optimal set of properties for a specific application greatly benefits from computational modeling. Recently, such screening has been dramatically accelerated by the invent of universal machine-learning interatomic potentials that offer first principles accuracy at orders of magnitude lower computational cost. Their application to the screening of defects with desired properties or to finding new stable compounds with high density of defects, however, has not been explored. Here, we show that the universal machine-learning interatomic potentials have reached sufficient accuracy to enable large-scale screening of defective materials. We carried out vacancy calculations for 86 259 materials in the Materials Project database and analyzed the formation energies in terms of oxidation numbers. We further demonstrate the application of these models for finding new materials at or below the convex hull of known materials and for simulated etching of low-dimensional materials.</description>

Abstract: Multi-Q magnetic structures on triangular lattices, with their two-dimensional topological spin texture, have attracted significant interest. However, unambiguously confirming their formation by excluding the presence of three equally-populated single-Q domains remains challenging. In the metallic triangular lattice antiferromagnet Co1/3TaS2, two magnetic ground states have been suggested at different temperature ranges, with the low-temperature phase being a triple-Q structure corresponding to the highest-density Skyrmion lattice. Using inelastic neutron scattering (INS) and advanced spin dynamics simulations, we demonstrate a clear distinction in the excitation spectra between the single-Q and triple-Q phases of Co1/3TaS2 and, more generally, a triangular lattice. First, we refined the spin Hamiltonian by fitting the excitation spectra measured in its paramagnetic phase, allowing us to develop an unbiased model independent of magnetic ordering. Second, we observed that the two magnetically ordered phases in Co1/3TaS2 exhibit markedly different behaviors in their long-wavelength Goldstone modes. Our spin model, derived from the paramagnetic phase, confirms that these behaviors originate from the single-Q and triple-Q nature of the respective ordered phases, providing unequivocal evidence of the single-Q to triple-Q phase transition in Co1/3TaS2. Importantly, we propose that the observed contrast in the long-wavelength spin dynamics between the single-Q and triple-Q orderings is universal, offering a potentially unique way to distinguish a generic triple-Q ordering on a triangular lattice from its multi-domain single-Q counterparts. We describe its applicability with examples of similar hexagonal systems forming potential triple-Q orderings. (For the full abstract, please refer to the manuscript)</description>

      <title>Highly efficient field-free switching by orbital Hall torque in a MoS2-based device operating at room temperature</title>

Abstract: Charge-to-spin and spin-to-charge conversion mechanisms in high spin-orbit materials are the new frontier of memory devices. They operate via spin-orbit torque (SOT) switching of a magnetic electrode, driven by an applied charge current. In this work, we propose a novel memory device based on the semiconducting two-dimensional centrosymmetric transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) MoS2, that operates as a SOT device in the writing process and a spin valve in the reading process. We demonstrate that stable voltage states at room temperature can be deterministically controlled by a switching current density as low as 3.2x10^4 A/cm^2 even in zero field, owed to a tilted geometry and a differential voltage architecture. An applied field of 50-100 Oe can be used as a characterizing control parameter for the state switching. Ab initio calculations of spin Hall effect (SHE) and orbital Hall effect (OHE) point to the latter as the most likely responsible for the generation of the SOT in the magnetic electrode. The large value of OHC in bulk MoS2 makes our device competitive in terms of energetic efficiency and could be integrated in TMD heterostructures to design memory devices with multiple magnetization states for non-Boolean computation.</description>
