      <title>On conjugate system with respect to completely positive maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the operator-valued partial derivative associated with covariance matrices on a von Neumann algebra B. We provide a cumulant characterization for the existence of conjugate variables and study some structure implications of their existence. Namely, we show that the center of the von Neumann algebra generated by B and its relative commutant is the center of B.</description>

      <title>Characterization of minimal tripotents via annihilators and its application to the study of additive preservers of truncations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The contributions in this note begin with a new characterization of (positive) scalar multiples of minimal tripotents in a general JB$^*$-triple $E$, proving that a non-zero element $a\in E$ is a positive scalar multiple of a minimal tripotent in $E$ if, and only if, its inner quadratic annihilator (that is, the set $^{\perp_{q}}\!\{a\} = \{ b\in E: \{a,b,a\} =0\}$) is maximal among all inner quadratic annihilators of single elements in $E$. We subsequently apply this characterization to the study of surjective additive maps between atomic JBW$^*$-triples preserving truncations in both directions. Let $A: E\to F$ be a surjective additive mapping between atomic JBW$^*$-triples, where $E$ contains no one-dimensional Cartan factors as direct summands. We show that $A$ preserves truncations in both directions if, and only if, there exists a bijection $\sigma: \Gamma_1\to \Gamma_2$, a bounded family $(\gamma_k)_{k\in \Gamma_1}\subseteq \mathbb{R}^+$, and a family $(\Phi_k)_{k\in \Gamma_1},$ where each $\Phi_k$ is a (complex) linear or a conjugate-linear (isometric) triple isomorphism from $C_k$ onto $\widetilde{C}_{\sigma(k)}$ satisfying $\inf_{k} \{\gamma_k \} &gt;0,$ and $$A(x) = \Big( \gamma_{k} \Phi_k \left(\pi_k(x)\right) \Big)_{k\in\Gamma_1},\ \hbox{ for all } x\in E,$$ where $\pi_k$ denotes the canonical projection of $E$ onto $C_k.$</description>

      <title>$\ell^1$-bases, algebraic structure and strong Arens irregularity of Banach algebras in harmonic analysis$^1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A long standing problem in abstract harmonic analysis concerns the strong Arens irregularity (sAir, for short) of the Fourier algebra $A(G)$ of a locally compact group $G.$ The groups for which $A(G)$ is known to be sAir are all amenable. So far this class includes the abelian groups, the discrete amenable groups, the second countable amenable groups $G$ such that $\overline{[G, G]}$ is not open in $G,$ the groups of the form $\prod_{i=0}^\infty G_i$ where each $G_i$, $i\ge1$, is a non-trivial metrizable compact group and $G_0$ is an amenable second countable locally compact group, the groups of the form $G_0\times G$, where $G$ is a compact group whose local weight $w(G)$ has uncountable cofinality and $G_0$ is any locally compact amenable group with $w(G_0)\le w(G)$, and the compact group $SU(2).$ We were primarily concerned with the groups for which $A(G)$ is sAir. We introduce a new class of $\ell^1$-bases in Banach algebras. These new $\ell^1$-bases enable us, among other results, to unify most of the results related to Arens products proved in the past seventy years since Arens defined his products. This includes the strong Arens irregularity of algebras in harmonic analysis, and in particular almost all the cases mentioned above for the Fourier algebras. In addition, we also show that $A(G)$ is sAir for compact connected groups with an infinite dual rank. The $\ell^1$-bases for the Fourier algebra are constructed with coefficients of certain irreducible representations of the group. With this new approach using $\ell^1$-bases, the rich algebraic structure of the algebras and semigroups under study such as the second dual of Banach algebras with an Arens product or certain semigroup compactifications (the Stone-\v Cech compactification of an infinite discrete group, for instance) is also unveiled</description>

      <title>Homology of Steinberg algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study homological invariants of the Steinberg algebra $\mathcal{A}_k(\mathcal{G})$ of an ample groupoid $\mathcal{G}$ over a commutative ring $k$. For $\mathcal{G}$ principal or Hausdorff with ${\mathcal{G}}^{\rm{Iso}}\setminus{\mathcal{G}}^{(0)}$ discrete, we compute Hochschild and cyclic homology of $\mathcal{A}_k(\mathcal{G})$ in terms of groupoid homology. For any ample Hausdorff groupoid $\mathcal{G}$, we find that $H_*(\mathcal{G})$ is a direct summand of $HH_*(\mathcal{A}_k(\mathcal{G}))$; using this and the Dennis trace we obtain a map $\overline{D}_*:K_*(\mathcal{A}_k(\mathcal{G}))\to H_n(\mathcal{G},k)$. We study this map when $\mathcal{G}$ is the (twisted) Exel-Pardo groupoid associated to a self-similar action of a group $G$ on a graph, and compute $HH_*(\mathcal{A}_k(\mathcal{G}))$ and $H_*(\mathcal{G},k)$ in terms of the homology of $G$, and the $K$-theory of $\mathcal{A}_k(\mathcal{G})$ in terms of that of $k[G]$.</description>

      <title>Twisted convolution algebras with coefficients on a differential subalgebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.08846v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $({\sf G},\alpha, \omega,\mathfrak B)$ be a measurable twisted action of the locally compact group ${\sf G}$ on a Banach $^*$-algebra $\mathfrak B$ and $\mathfrak A$ a differential Banach $^*$-subalgebra of $\mathfrak B$, which is stable under said action. We observe that $L^1_{\alpha,\omega}({\sf G},\mathfrak A)$ is a differential subalgebra of $L^1_{\alpha,\omega}({\sf G},\mathfrak B)$. We use this fact to provide new examples of groups with symmetric Banach $^*$-algebras. In particular, we prove that discrete rigidly symmetric extensions of compact groups are symmetric or that semidirect products ${\sf K}\rtimes{\sf H}$, with ${\sf H}$ symmetric and ${\sf K}$ compact, are symmetric.</description>

      <title>Actions of tensor categories on Kirchberg algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18429v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We characterize the simplicity of Pimsner algebras for non-proper C*-correspondences. With the aid of this criterion, we give a systematic strategy to produce outer actions of unitary tensor categories on Kirchberg algebras. In particular, every countable unitary tensor category admits an outer action on the Cuntz algebra $\mathcal{O}_2$. We also study the realizability of modules over fusion rings as K-groups of Kirchberg algebras acted on by unitary tensor categories, which turns out to be generically true for every unitary fusion category. Several new examples are provided, among which actions on Cuntz algebras of 3-cocycle twists of cyclic groups are constructed for all possible 3-cohomological classes by answering a question asked by Izumi.</description>
