      <title>Milgram's experiment in the knowledge space: Individual navigation strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data deluge characteristic for our times has led to information overload, posing a significant challenge to effectively finding our way through the digital landscape. Addressing this issue requires an in-depth understanding of how we navigate through the abundance of information. Previous research has discovered multiple patterns in how individuals navigate in the geographic, social, and information spaces, yet individual differences in strategies for navigation in the knowledge space has remained largely unexplored. To bridge the gap, we conducted an online experiment where participants played a navigation game on Wikipedia and completed questionnaires about their personal information. Utilizing a graph embedding trained on the English Wikipedia, our study identified distinctive strategies that participants adopt: when the target is a famous person, participants typically use the geographical and occupational information of the target to navigate, reminiscent of hub-driven and proximity-driven approaches, respectively. We discovered that many participants playing the same game exhibit a "wisdom of the crowd" effect: The set of strategies provide a good estimate for the information landscape around the target indicating that the individual differences complement each other.</description>

      <title>An entropic analisis of social demonstrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social media has dramatically influenced how individuals and groups express their demands, concerns and aspirations during social demonstrations. The study of X or Twitter hashtags during those events has revealed the presence of some temporal points characterised by high correlation among their participants. It has also been reported that the connectivity presents a modular-to-nested transition at the point of maximum correlation. The present study aims to determine whether it is possible to characterise this transition using entropic-based tools. Our results show that entropic analysis can effectively find the transition point to the nested structure, allowing researchers to know that the transition occurs without the need for a network representation. The entropic analysis also shows that the modular-to-nested transition is characterised not by the diversity in the number of hashtags users post but by how many hashtags they share.</description>

      <title>Machine learning-based similarity measure to forecast M&amp;A from patent data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Defining and finalizing Mergers and Acquisitions (M&amp;A) requires complex human skills, which makes it very hard to automatically find the best partner or predict which firms will make a deal. In this work, we propose the MASS algorithm, a specifically designed measure of similarity between companies and we apply it to patenting activity data to forecast M&amp;A deals. MASS is based on an extreme simplification of tree-based machine learning algorithms and naturally incorporates intuitive criteria for deals; as such, it is fully interpretable and explainable. By applying MASS to the Zephyr and Crunchbase datasets, we show that it outperforms LightGCN, a "black box" graph convolutional network algorithm. When similar companies have disjoint patenting activities, on the contrary, LightGCN turns out to be the most effective algorithm. This study provides a simple and powerful tool to model and predict M&amp;A deals, offering valuable insights to managers and practitioners for informed decision-making.</description>

      <title>Random matching in balanced bipartite graphs: The (un)fairness of draw mechanisms used in sports</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.09274v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The draw of some knockout tournaments requires finding a perfect matching in a balanced bipartite graph. The problem becomes challenging if there are draw constraints: the two field-proven procedures used in sports are known to be non-uniformly distributed, which may threaten fairness. Therefore, we compare the biases of both mechanisms, each of them having two forms, for reasonable subsets of balanced bipartite graphs up to 16 nodes. The UEFA Champions League Round of 16 draw is verified to apply the best design among the four available options. However, considerable scope remains to improve the performance of the known randomisation procedures.</description>
