      <title>II. Non-Linear Interacting Dark Energy: Analytical Solutions and Theoretical Pathologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate interacting dark energy (IDE) models with phenomenological, non-linear interaction kernels $Q$, specifically $Q_{1}=3H\delta \left(\frac{\rho_{\rm dm}\rho_{\rm de}}{\rho_{\rm dm}+\rho_{\rm de}}\right)$, $Q_{2}=3H\delta \left(\frac{\rho_{\rm dm}^2}{\rho_{\rm dm}+\rho_{\rm de}}\right)$, and $Q_{3}=3H\delta \left(\frac{\rho_{\rm de}^2}{\rho_{\rm dm}+\rho_{\rm de}}\right)$. Using dynamical system techniques developed in our companion paper on linear kernels, we derive new conditions that ensure positive and well-defined energy densities, as well as criteria to avoid future big rip singularities. We find that for $Q_{1}$, all densities remain positive, while for $Q_{2}$ and $Q_{3}$ negative values of either DM or DE are unavoidable if energy flows from DM to DE. We also show that for $Q_{1}$ and $Q_{2}$ a big rip singularity always arises in the phantom regime $w&lt;-1$, whereas for $Q_{3}$ this fate may be avoided if energy flows from DE to DM. In addition, we provide new exact analytical solutions for $\rho_{\rm dm}$ and $\rho_{\rm de}$ in the cases of $Q_{2}$ and $Q_{3}$, and obtain new expressions for the effective equations of state of DM, DE, the total fluid, and the reconstructed dynamical DE equation of state ($w_{\rm dm}^{\rm eff}$, $w_{\rm de}^{\rm eff}$, $w_{\rm tot}^{\rm eff}$, and $\tilde{w}$). Using these results, we discuss phantom crossings, evaluate how each kernel addresses the coincidence problem, and apply statefinder diagnostics to compare the models. These findings extend the theoretical understanding of non-linear IDE models and provide analytical tools for future observational constraints.</description>

      <title>I. Linear Interacting Dark Energy: Analytical Solutions and Theoretical Pathologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interacting dark energy (IDE) models, in which dark matter (DM) and dark energy (DE) exchange energy through a non-gravitational interaction, have long been proposed as candidates to address key challenges in modern cosmology. These include the coincidence problem, the $H_0$ and $S_8$ tensions, and, more recently, the hints of dynamical dark energy reported by the DESI collaboration. Given the renewed interest in IDE models, it is crucial to fully understand their parameter space when constraining them observationally, especially with regard to the often-neglected issues of negative energy densities and future big rip singularities. In this work, we present a comparative study of the general linear interaction $Q=3H(\delta_{\rm dm}\rho_{\rm dm} + \delta_{\rm de}\rho_{\rm de})$ and four special cases: $Q=3H\delta(\rho_{\rm dm}+\rho_{\rm de})$, $Q=3H\delta(\rho_{\rm dm}-\rho_{\rm de})$, $Q=3H\delta \rho_{\rm dm}$, and $Q=3H\delta \rho_{\rm de}$. For these five models, we perform a dynamical system analysis and derive new conditions that ensure positive, real, and well-defined energy densities throughout cosmic evolution, as well as criteria to avoid future big rip singularities. We obtain exact analytical solutions for $\rho_{\rm{dm}}$, $\rho_{\rm{de}}$, the effective equations of state ($w_{\mathrm{eff}}^{\rm{dm}}$, $w_{\mathrm{eff}}^{\rm{de}}$, $w_{\mathrm{eff}}^{\rm{tot}}$), and a reconstructed dynamical DE equation of state $\tilde{w}$. Using these results, we examine phantom crossings, address the coincidence problem, and apply the statefinder diagnostic to distinguish between models. We show that energy transfer from DM to DE inevitably produces negative energy densities and make future singularities more likely, while transfer from DE to DM avoids these pathologies and is thus theoretically favored.</description>

      <title>III. Interacting Dark Energy: Summary of Models, Pathologies, and Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an overview of the main results from our two companion papers that are relevant for observational constraints on interacting dark energy (IDE) models. We provide analytical solutions for the dark matter and dark energy densities, $\rho_{\rm dm}$ and $\rho_{\rm de}$, as well as the normalized Hubble function $h(z)$, for eight IDE models. These include five linear IDE models, namely $Q=3H(\delta_{\rm dm} \rho_{\rm dm} + \delta_{\rm de} \rho_{\rm de})$ and four special cases: $Q=3H\delta(\rho_{\rm dm}+\rho_{\rm de})$, $Q=3H\delta(\rho_{\rm dm}-\rho_{\rm de})$, $Q=3H\delta \rho_{\rm dm}$, and $Q=3H\delta \rho_{\rm de}$, together with three non-linear IDE models: $Q=3H\delta \left( \tfrac{\rho_{\rm dm} \rho_{\rm de}}{\rho_{\rm dm}+\rho_{\rm de}} \right)$, $Q=3H\delta \left( \tfrac{\rho_{\rm dm}^2}{\rho_{\rm dm}+\rho_{\rm de}} \right)$, and $Q=3H\delta \left( \tfrac{\rho_{\rm de}^2}{\rho_{\rm dm}+\rho_{\rm de}} \right)$. For these eight models, we present conditions to avoid imaginary, undefined, and negative energy densities. In seven of the eight cases, negative densities arise if energy flows from DM to DE, implying a strong theoretical preference for energy transfer from DE to DM. We also provide conditions to avoid future big rip singularities and evaluate how each model addresses the coincidence problem in both the past and the future. Finally, we propose a set of approaches and simplifying assumptions that can be used when constraining IDE models, by defining regimes that restrict the parameter space according to the behavior researchers are willing to tolerate.</description>

      <title>Measuring the properties of homogeneous turbulence in curved spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Turbulence in curved spacetimes in general, and in the vicinity of black holes (BHs) in particular, represents a poorly understood phenomenon that is often analysed employing techniques developed for flat spacetimes. We here propose a novel approach to study turbulence in strong gravitational fields that is based on the computation of structure functions on generic manifolds and is thus applicable to arbitrary curved spacetimes. In particular, we introduce, for the first time, a formalism to compute the characteristic properties of turbulence, such as the second-order structure function or the power spectral density, in terms of proper lengths and volumes and not in terms of coordinate lengths and volumes, as customarily done. By applying the new approach to the turbulent rest-mass density field from simulations of magnetised disc accretion onto a Kerr BH, we inspect in a rigorous way turbulence in regions close to the event horizon, but also in the disc, the wind, and in the jet. We demonstrate that the new approach can capture the typical behavior of an inertial-range cascade and that differences up to $40-80\%$ emerge in the vicinity of the event horizon with respect to the standard flat-spacetime approach. While these differences become smaller at larger distances, our study highlights that special care needs to be paid when analysing turbulence in strongly curved spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Chaos in Horndeski cosmologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze how a scalar field can affect the chaotic behaviour of homogeneous and isotropic Bianchi IX cosmologies. It is known that a massless, minimally coupled scalar field removes the chaos. However, in more general Horndeski theories, the situation is more complex. We find that in shift-symmetric $K$-essence theories, chaos persists if the scalar field contribution to the initial-value constraint is {\it subleading} compared to that of the anisotropies. In this case, solutions oscillate as they approach the singularity, just as in the vacuum case, and a similar behaviour is found when a non-minimal coupling is included. If the scalar field contribution is not subleading, then chaos is removed and the singularity is approached smoothly.
  An unusual and entirely new result appears when changing the sign in front of the scalar kinetic term, yielding the theory of a phantom scalar. If the scalar field is subleading, then solutions remain chaotic and oscillate when approaching the singularity, as before. However, if the scalar field is not subleading, solutions are also chaotic, but the spacetime singularity disappears, and the universe behaves as an apparently infinite sequence of anisotropic bounces. The spatial volume then oscillates within finite bounds, never reaching zero, while the amplitudes and positions of these oscillations appear completely random. To the best of our knowledge, this type of chaos has never been described.</description>

      <title>Genesis--Starobinsky inflation can explain the ACT data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel non-singular cosmological scenario within the framework of Horndeski gravity, consisting of three successive stages: (i) a Genesis phase, in which the Universe slowly expands from an asymptotically flat spacetime; (ii) a brief transition stage restoring General Relativity; and (iii) a Starobinsky inflationary phase. This construction is fully consistent within a viable parameter space: it remains weakly coupled, free from ghost and gradient instabilities, with luminal tensor and subluminal scalar perturbations throughout the entire evolution. Importantly, the Genesis phase induces characteristic corrections to the Starobinsky potential, which cannot be captured by simple $\sum_i c_i R^i$-type modifications. These corrections robustly enhance the scalar spectral index, thereby improving the agreement of Starobinsky inflation with recent CMB measurements, in particular the data from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT).</description>

      <title>Effective LQG dynamics of a thin shell and the fate of a collapsing star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective models inspired by loop quantum gravity typically resolve the central singularity by replacing it with a bounce of the matter density in the Planckian regime. In the specific model analyzed here, this bounce is generally followed by the formation of shell-crossing singularities. The purpose of this work is to provide a physically meaningful extension of spacetime beyond the shell-crossing singularity. To this end, we derive the dynamics of a dust thin shell within the effective Hamiltonian framework. The motion of the shell remains timelike throughout: after undergoing a quantum-gravitational bounce, it expands and eventually emerges from the white-hole vacuum region.</description>

      <title>A dynamical systems perspective on the thermodynamics of late-time cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A thermodynamic description of cosmological spacetimes may provide insights into the fundamentals of the cosmic evolution that remain otherwise obscure, in close analogy with 'black hole thermodynamics'. We investigate the thermodynamic properties of late-time cosmological evolution using the dynamical systems approach, focusing on the $\Lambda$CDM model and quintessence models with an exponential potential. Thermodynamic quantities obtained through the Hayward-Kodama formalism are mapped onto the phase space of these models, allowing us to investigate thermodynamic stability and phase transitions in a manner independent of the initial condition of the evolution of the universe. In both models, the universe inevitably undergoes a thermodynamic phase transition, marked by diverging specific heats, irrespective of its initial configuration. We further demonstrate that the thermodynamic stability can occur only during an accelerating phase of the universe. However, the necessary stability conditions are never satisfied anywhere in the phase space, rendering both models inherently thermodynamically unstable within the Hayward-Kodama framework. Importantly, our analysis highlights the dynamical system approach as a natural and powerful framework to probe the thermodynamic aspects of cosmological evolution.</description>

      <title>Big-Bounce in Quantum f(R)-Cosmology: Polymer Dynamics with Internal Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct the Hamiltonian formulation of the isotropic Universe in a generic metric f(R)-theory in the Jordan frame. We canonically quantize the Universe volume via a polymer formulation, and we adopt the scalar field naturally arising from this scenario as a physical clock. Being within the limit of cut-off values of the space volume, we are legitimized to neglect, at first approximation level, the self-interacting potential term associated with the scalar field. We first study the semi-classical polymer dynamics, outlining the emergence of a bouncing cosmology, both in the internal as well as in the synchronous time. In this latter time variable, we are also able to compare the obtained picture with that of a standard polymer Big-Bounce. We see that in the studied case, the collapsing and expanding branches are no longer symmetric with respect to the minimum volume configuration. Then, we fully quantize the system dynamics in the momentum representation, constructing a suitable dynamical Hilbert space and setting up the dynamics of localized wave packets. The mean value dynamics, both for the momentum and volume spaces, is characterized by a bouncing dynamics as described via the internal time, which closely resembles that one obtained in Loop Quantum Cosmology and Polymerization, respectively.</description>

      <title>Unique gravitational wave signatures of GLPV scalar-tensor theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study gravitational waves induced by scalar primordial fluctuations in Gleyzes-Langlois-Piazza-Vernizzi (GLPV), beyond Horndeski, scalar-tensor theories. We uncover, at the level of the action, a new scalar-scalar-tensor interaction, unique to GLPV models disconnected from Horndeski via disformal transformation. The new interaction leads to third derivatives in the source for scalar-induced tensor modes, which are absent in Horndeski-related theories. Such new higher-derivative terms lead to a further enhanced production of induced gravitational waves. We predict that for a scale-invariant primordial spectrum, the induced gravitational wave spectral density has a characteristic frequency dependence proportional to $f^5$. Such a fast-rising spectrum offers a potential unique signature of modified gravity in the early universe.</description>

      <title>Overcharging Extremal Rotating Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we use the weak cosmic censorship conjecture(WCC) to constrain black hole solutions in modified gravity theories. While Wald showed that extremal Kerr-Newman black holes in general relativity cannot be overcharged by test charged particles, this protection may fail in theories beyond general relativity. We have considered generic rotating black hole solutions beyond the Kerr-Newman family and examine particle absorption processes that could lead to overcharging and the emergence of naked singularities. Identifying regions of parameter space where WCC is violated allows us to place direct, physically motivated bounds on deviations from general relativity.</description>

      <title>Gaussian curvature and Lyapunov exponent as probes of black hole phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Gaussian curvature of unstable null orbits. The Gaussian curvature exhibits multivaluedness near the phase transition point of a first-order phase transition. Numerical investigations of Reissner-Nordstrom Anti-de Sitter (RN-AdS), Hayward-AdS, and Hayward-Letelier-AdS black holes demonstrate that this geometric multivalued region coincides precisely with the spinodal region calculated by black hole thermodynamics. Using the known relation $K=-\lambda^2$ linking orbital geometry to chaotic dynamics, we show that this geometric feature also satisfies the critical exponents predicted by mean-field theory, consistent with those derived from Lyapunov exponents. Our work demonstrates that Gaussian curvature can serve as an alternative effective tool to study the phase structure of black holes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the stability of the Weyl geometry considering an exact black hole solution. By calculating the geodesics of massless and massive scalar fields orbiting outside the Weyl black hole background and using the Lyapunov exponent, we show that chaotic instabilities appear in the asymptotically de Siter-like spacetime. Calculating the photon sphere's quasinormal modes (QNMs) of a scalar field perturbing the Weyl black hole, we find a relation connecting the QNMs with the Lyapunov exponent in the asymptotically de Siter-like spacetime. Furthermore, we study the anomalous decay rate of the QNMs connecting their behavior with the Lyapunov exponent.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In scalar-tensor theories, compact objects may experience spontaneous scalarization. Recently, it was shown that matter-induced spontaneous scalarization of neutron stars is predominantly associated with a first-order phase transition. Here we consider matter-induced spontaneous scalarization of boson stars. Employing a repulsive quartic potential for the bosonic matter, we find only first-order phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Marginal IR running of Gravity as a Natural Explanation for Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05246</link>

Abstract: We propose that the infrared (IR) running of Newton's coupling provides a simple and universal explanation for large--distance modifications of gravity relevant to dark matter phenomenology. Within the effective field theory (EFT) framework, we model $G(k)$ as a scale--dependent coupling governed by an anomalous dimension $\eta$. We show that the marginal case $\eta = 1$ is singled out by renormalization group (RG) and dimensional arguments, leading to a logarithmic potential and a $1/r$ force law at large distances, while smoothly recovering Newtonian gravity at short scales. The logarithmic correction is universal and regulator independent, indicating that the $1/r$ force arises as the robust IR imprint of quantum--field--theoretic scaling. This provides a principled alternative to particle dark matter, suggesting that galactic rotation curves and related anomalies may be understood as manifestations of the IR running of Newton's constant.</description>

      <title>First ICCUB Numerical Relativity Waveform Catalog of Eccentric Black Hole Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We release the first Numerical Relativity catalog of Institut de Ciencies del Cosmos at University of Barcelona (ICCUB) consisting of 128 simulations for black hole binaries. All simulations in this first release correspond to highly eccentric binaries with eccentricity $e = (0.62,0.79)$ which develop zoom-whirls up to three close passages before merger. We consider aligned, equal spin configurations in the range $\chi = (-0.5, 0.5)$ and equal mass ratios.
  For each simulation, we provide the modes $(\ell, m)$ of Weyl scalar $\psi_4^{(\ell,m)}$ extrapolated to $r = \infty$, with $\ell \leq 4$. In addition, we provide the corresponding strain modes obtained by computing a double time integral of the Weyl scalar modes. Moreover, we provide metadata and the parameter files required to reproduce our results using the open-source code Einstein Toolkit.
  A Python code that facilitates the access to the data is available on Git-Hub.</description>

      <title>Robustness of Sensitivity Evaluations for Gravitational Wave Detection Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of gravitational waves (GWs) from merging compact binaries has transformed modern astrophysics, driving innovation in detection methodologies. Whereas matched-filtering techniques have long been the standard, the growing volume of data from advanced observatories like LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA has spurred interest in machine learning (ML) solutions for their scalability and computational efficiency. As next-generation detectors approach reality, the development of reliable and adaptable search algorithms becomes increasingly urgent. This work examines the consistency of detection sensitivity in AresGW model 1, an ML-based pipeline, when applied to multiple month-long datasets consisting of real detector noise. By analyzing the number of waveform injections detected and the sensitive distance at different FAR thresholds, we evaluate the model's performance under low false alarm rates and investigate how sensitivity metrics fluctuate due to dataset variability. In addition, we evaluate the performance of our algorithm on data both with and without contamination of genuine GW signals. Our findings reveal notable performance variations, highlighting the challenges introduced by finite-duration datasets and emphasizing the need for more rigorous statistical validation. By identifying these challenges, we aim to clarify the practical limitations of both ML-based and traditional detection systems and inform future benchmarking standards for GW searches.</description>

      <title>Averaged dynamics of ultra-relativisitc charged particles beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1206.4184</link>
      <description>arXiv:1206.4184v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this thesis, we consider the suitability of using the charged cold fluid model in the description of ultra-relativistic beams. The method that we have used is the following. Firstly, the necessary notions of kinetic theory and differential geometry of second order differential equations are explained. Then an averaging procedure is applied to a connection associated with the Lorentz force equation. The result of this averaging is an affine connection on the space-time manifold. The corresponding geodesic equation defines the averaged Lorentz force equation. We prove that for ultra-relativistic beams described by narrow distribution functions, the solutions of both equations are similar. This fact justifies the replacement of the Lorentz force equation by the simpler {\it averaged Lorentz force equation}. After this, for each of these models we associate the corresponding kinetic model, which are based on the Vlasov equation and {\it averaged Vlasov equation} respectively. The averaged Vlasov equation is simpler than the original Vlasov equation. This fact allows us to prove that the differential operation defining the averaged charged cold fluid equation is controlled by the {\it diameter of the distribution function}, by powers of the {\it energy of the beam} and by the time of evolution $t$. We show that the Vlasov equation and the averaged Vlasov equation have similar solutions, when the initial conditions are the same. Finally, as an application of the {\it averaged Lorentz force equation} we re-derive the beam dynamics formalism used in accelerator physics from the Jacobi equation of the averaged Lorentz force equation.</description>

      <title>Equivalence Theorems and Double-Copy Structure in Scattering Amplitudes of Massive Kaluza-Klein States with Matter Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05199v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the scattering amplitudes of massive Kaluza-Klein (KK) states in compactified five-dimensional warped gauge and gravity theories. Focusing on tree-level $2\to2$ processes, we analyze the leading-order amplitudes involving bulk KK matter fields and KK gauge/gravitational Goldstone bosons. By imposing the gauge theory equivalence theorem (GAET) and the gravitational equivalence theorem (GRET) within warped KK theories, we systematically reconstruct the leading-order amplitudes for physical KK gauge bosons and gravitons, thereby circumventing the intricate energy cancellations inherent in physical amplitudes. Within this framework, the correspondence between GAET and GRET arises as a direct manifestation of the leading-order double-copy relation in the high-energy expansion. This connection provides a foundation for extending the BCJ double-copy construction to four-point amplitudes involving bulk KK matter fields, and further generalizes to arbitrary $N$-point cases, enabling a systematic derivation of the corresponding gravitational amplitudes with consistent incorporation of KK matter fields at leading order.</description>

      <title>Characteristic tensors for almost Finsler manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21744v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Almost Finsler manifolds and partial Finsler manifolds are introduced, extending the standard definition of a Finsler manifold to allow for a nontrivial slit containing points fixed under homogeneous scaling and for metrics where the fundamental tensor has nonpositive eigenvalues. The bipartite spaces offer examples of comparatively simple almost Finsler manifolds and partial Finsler manifolds with physics applications. Special cases are the $\bf{a}$ and $\bf{b}$ spaces, which have almost Finsler norms and partial Finsler norms formed from a Riemannian norm and a 1-form. The indicatrix union of the almost Finsler $\bf{a}$ manifolds equals the indicatrix union of Randers spaces. Characteristic tensors that vanish for bipartite spaces and $\bf{b}$ spaces are obtained and expressed using geometric quantities. These tensors are generalizations of the Matsumoto tensor, which vanishes on Randers and $\bf{a}$ spaces.</description>

      <title>A measure on the space of CFTs and pure 3D gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04554v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define a normalizable measure on the space of two-dimensional conformal field theories, which we interpret as a maximum ignorance ensemble. We test whether pure quantum gravity in AdS$_3$ is dual to the average over this ensemble. We find a negative answer, which implies that CFTs with a primary gap of order the central charge are highly atypical in our ensemble. We provide evidence that more generally, holographic CFTs are atypical in the space of all CFTs by finding similar results for permutation orbifolds: subgroups of $S_N$ with a good large $N$ limit are very sparse in the space of all subgroups. Along the way, we derive several new results on the space of CFTs. Notably we derive an upper bound on the spacing in central charge between CFTs, which is doubly exponentially small in the large central charge limit.</description>

      <title>Can "premature collapse" form black holes in the upper and lower mass gaps?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04574v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Observations of gravitational waves from binary black hole mergers, including the recent signals GW231123 and GW230529, have revealed multiple progenitor black holes in the so-called upper and lower mass gaps, respectively. It is generally assumed that massive stars cannot form black holes in the upper mass gap because pair instabilities in the late stage of stellar evolution disrupt the stars, whereas the lower mass gap refers to the gap between the maximum allowed neutron star mass and the smallest black hole mass expected to form in supernova explosions. Here we explore a "premature collapse" scenario in which upper mass gap stars collapse and form black holes before they reach the late stage of stellar evolution. The mechanism for triggering a premature collapse is the capture of a smaller black hole, possibly primordial in nature. A similar capture scenario can occur to produce black holes in the lower mass gap. At least for massive stars, typical stellar rotation rates would likely result in rapidly rotating black holes in such a scenario, naturally explaining the rapid spins inferred from GW231123. Even though our estimates hinge on several parameters with rather large uncertainties, they suggest that, at least in galactic disks, the likelihood of such a capture is small for stars in the upper mass gap, but may lead to a significant population of black holes in the lower mass gap and, in fact, even below the lower mass gap.</description>

      <title>Integral formulas for under/overdetermined differential operators via recovery on curves and the finite-dimensional cokernel condition I: General theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04617v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new versatile method for constructing solution operators (i.e., right-inverses up to a finite rank operator) for a wide class of underdetermined PDEs $P u = f$, which are regularizing of optimal order and, more interestingly, whose integral kernels have certain prescribed support properties. By duality, we simultaneously obtain integral representation formulas (i.e., left-inverses up to a finite rank operator) for overdetermined PDEs $P^{\ast} v = g$ with analogous properties, which lead to Poincar\'e- or Korn-type inequalities. Our method applies to operators such as the divergence, linearized scalar curvature, and linearized Einstein constraint operators (which are underdetermined), as well as the gradient, Hessian, trace-free part of the Hessian, Killing, and conformal Killing operators (which are overdetermined).
  The starting point for our construction is a condition - dubbed the recovery on curves condition (RC) - that leads to Green's functions for $P$ supported on prescribed curves. Then the desired integral solution operators (and, by duality, integral representation formulas) are obtained by taking smooth averages over a suitable family of curves. This procedure generalizes the previous constructions of Bogovskii, Oh-Tataru, and Reshetnyak. We furthermore identify a simple algebraic sufficient condition for (RC), namely, that the principal symbol $p(x, \xi)$ of $P$ is full-rank for all non-zero complex vectors $\xi$ (as opposed to real, as in ellipticity). When the principal symbol has constant coefficients, this is equivalent to (RC) and also to the condition that the formal cokernel of $P$ (without any boundary conditions) is finite-dimensional; for this reason, we call it the finite-dimensional cokernel condition (FC). We give a short proof that all operators above satisfy (FC), and thus (RC).
  Various applications will be considered in subsequent papers.</description>

Abstract: We derive the semi-classical gravitational dynamics from thermodynamics of local stretched light cones in 2-dimensional dilaton gravity, explicitly treating the backreaction of quantum matter through the conformal anomaly's effect on the generalized entropy. We also sketch the extension of this analysis to the conformal anomaly in 4-dimensional semi-classical gravity. In direct connection to this problem, we also tackle the appropriate definition of Wald entropy in thermodynamic derivation of equations of motion for classical scalar-tensor theories. For the class of Brans-Dicke theories, including 2-dimensional dilaton gravity, we show that the equations of motion follow from the dynamical Wald entropy associated with local causal horizons.</description>

      <title>Stochastic inflation with gradient interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stochastic inflation rests on the separate-universe approximation, i.e. the ability to describe long-wavelength fluctuations in an inflating universe as homogeneous perturbations of its background dynamics. Although this approximation is valid in most cases, it has been recently pointed out that it breaks down during transition periods between attractor and non-attractor phases. Such transitions are ubiquitous in single-field models giving rise to enhanced perturbations at small scales, that are required to form primordial black holes. The current inability to apply the stochastic-inflation program in such models is therefore one of the main obstacles to investigating the role of backreaction in primordial-black-hole scenarios. In this work, we show how gradient interactions can be incorporated in stochastic inflation, via a set of Langevin equations of higher dimension. We apply our formalism to a few cases of interest, including one with a sharp transition. In all cases, in the classical limit we show that gradient corrections as predicted from cosmological perturbation theory are properly recovered. We uncover the existence of a "pullback" effect by which the tails of the first-passage-time distributions are dampened by gradient interactions. We finally discuss the role of backreaction in the presence of gradient interactions.</description>

      <title>Bulk viscosity from early-time thermalization of cosmic fluids in light of DESI DR2 data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: If nonrelativistic dark matter and radiation are allowed to interact, reaching an approximate thermal equilibrium, this interaction induces a bulk viscous pressure changing the effective one-fluid description of the universe dynamics. By modeling such components as perfect fluids, a cosmologically relevant bulk viscous pressure emerges for dark matter particle masses in the range of $1\,\text{eV} - 10\,\text{eV}$ keeping thermal equilibrium with the radiation. Such a transient bulk viscosity introduces significant effects in the expansion rate near the matter-radiation equality (redshift $z_{\text{eq}} \sim 3400$) and at late times (leading to a higher inferred value of the Hubble constant $H_0$). We use the recent DESI DR2 BAO data to place an upper bound on the free parameter of the model $\tau_\text{eq}$ which represents the time scale in which each component follows its own internal perfect fluid dynamics until thermalization occurs. Our main result is encoded in the bound $\tau_\text{eq} &lt; 1.84 \times 10^{-10} $ s (2$\sigma$), with the corresponding dimensionless bulk coefficient $\tilde{\xi} H_0/H_{eq}&lt;5.94\times10^{-4}$ (2$\sigma$). In practice, this rules out any possible interaction between radiation and dark matter prior to the recombination epoch.</description>

      <title>Image of Quantum Improved Regular Kerr Black Hole and Parameter Constraints from EHT Observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15745v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum Improved Regular Kerr (QIRK) black hole is a rotating regular black hole model constructed based on the asymptotic safety method. The model eliminates the ring singularity and prevents the formation of closed timelike curves, while retaining well-defined thermodynamic properties. Given these properties, probing the observable features of the QIRK black hole is important. In this work, we numerically determine the region of parameter space in which the QIRK spacetime remains regular, admits an event horizon, and is free of closed timelike curves. Subsequently, we simulate images of a QIRK black hole surrounded by a thin accretion disk. We find the primary effect of the quantum correction parameter, $\widetilde{\omega}$, is a systematic reduction in the overall observed intensity, with only subtle effects on the image geometry. Using observational data from the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) for Sgr A* and M87*, we further constrain the parameters of the QIRK black hole. Moreover, since there exist QIRK parameters that are free of singularities and can admit closed timelike curves, we investigate the images of CTCs under these conditions. These results reveal the distinctive observational features of the QIRK spacetime and provide a quantitative basis for assessing its viability as an astrophysical candidate.</description>

Abstract: We analytically study isothermal spheres in the light of nonextensive statistical mechanics. The equations for the isothermal spheres are derived from the grand partition function of the gravitating particle system in the Tsallis statistical mechanics. The effect of nonextensive statistics appears in relatively dense state, which appears at the center of the isothermal sphere. The stability of the isothermal sphere in the general relativistic system is found to be sensitive to the parameter q in the Tsallis statistics.</description>

Abstract: Charged black holes are known to suffer from an interior instability associated with the presence of the Cauchy horizon. Recently, a hairy charged black hole was proposed that avoids the formation of a Cauchy horizon. It is natural to question whether this instability might manifest in the exterior solution. In this paper, we have analyzed the stability of this black hole. Our results show that vector perturbations are stable, along with the scalar sector for $l=0$. We have also computed the corresponding quasinormal modes (QNMs) and quasibound states (QBSs).</description>

      <title>Exploring gravitational impulse via quantum Boltzmann equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13678v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the gravitational impulse by using the generalized formulation of the quantum Boltzmann equation (QBE), wherein the initial states are taken as wave packets rather than plane waves. The QBE operates within an open quantum system framework. Using this approach, we can analyze the two-body gravitational scattering by considering one body as part of the environment and the other as the system. Through this procedure, we obtain the system's impulse up to the second order for two massive objects. Similarly, we apply the forward scattering of the QBE to the gravitational impulse of a photon due to a massive object, during which we consider the photon as the system and the massive object as the environment. In this methodology, we use the QBE to compute the time evolution of the momentum operator associated with the system. While the forward scattering term vanishes when considering point particles, we demonstrate its persistence when using wave packets to describe both massive particles and the photon field. The results reported here are entirely consistent with the previous approaches.</description>

      <title>Spherical accretion of a collisionless kinetic gas into a generic static black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10606v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a nontrivial extension of the problem of spherical accretion of a collisionless kinetic gas into the standard Schwarzschild black hole. This extension consists of replacing the Schwarzschild black hole by generic static and spherically symmetric black hole spacetimes with the aim of studying the effects of either modified gravitational theories beyond Einstein gravity or matter sources coupled to general relativity on the accretion process. This generalization also allows us to investigate the accretion into other types of black hole spacetimes, such as ones inspired by loop quantum gravity and string theory. To do so, we take into account a large class of static and spherically symmetric black holes whose spacetime is asymptotically flat with a positive total mass, has a regular Killing horizon, and satisfies appropriate monotonicity conditions of the metric functions. We provide the most general solution of the collisionless Boltzmann equation on such spacetimes by expressing the one-particle distribution function in terms of suitable symplectic coordinates on the cotangent bundle, and we calculate the relevant observables, such as particle current density and energy-momentum-stress tensor. Specializing to the case where the gas is described by an isotropic ideal fluid at rest at infinity, we compute the mass accretion rate and compression ratio, and we show that the tangential pressure is larger than the radial one at the horizon, indicating that the behavior of a collisionless gas is different from the one of an isotropic perfect fluid. As an example, we apply our generic formulae to two special black hole spacetimes, namely the Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole and a loop quantum corrected black hole. We explore the effects of the free parameters on the observables and accretion rate, and we compare the results with those corresponding to the Schwarzschild black hole.</description>

      <title>Barrow and Tsallis entropies after the DESI DR2 BAO data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12205v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modified cosmology based on Barrow entropy arises from the gravity-thermodynamics conjecture, in which the standard Bekenstein-Hawking entropy is replaced by the Barrow entropy of quantum-gravitational origin, characterized by the Barrow parameter $\Delta$. Interestingly, this framework exhibits similarities with cosmology based on Tsallis $\delta$-entropy, which, although rooted in a non-extensive generalization of Boltzmann-Gibbs statistics, features the same power-law deformation of the holographic scaling present in the Barrow case. We use observational data from Supernova Type Ia (SNIa), Cosmic Chronometers (CC), and Baryonic acoustic oscillations (BAO), including the recently released DESI DR2 data, in order to extract constraints on such scenarios. As we show, the best-fit value for the Barrow exponent $\Delta$ is found to be negative, while the zero value, which corresponds to $\Lambda$CDM paradigm, is allowed only in the range of $2\sigma $ for three out of four datasets. Additionally, for the case of the SN$_{0}$+OHD+BAO dataset, for the current Hubble function we obtain a value of $H_0= 72.2_{-0.9}^{+0.9}$, which may potentially alleviate the $H_0$ tension. Moreover, we compare our results with the Gaussian Process reconstruction of the dark-energy equation of state for the DESI + Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) + Union3 datasets. Finally, by applying information criteria such as the Akaike Information Criterion and the Bayes evidence, we compare the fitting efficiency of the scenario at hand with $\Lambda$CDM cosmology, showing that the latter is slightly favoured.</description>

      <title>Quantum Cosmology Without Singularities: A New Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02616v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The article is dedicated to a discussion regarding the role of Barrow's ''Zero Universes'' in quantum cosmology. In particular, we demonstrate that if quantum gravity effects are modeled by the quantum potential method associated with the ''many interacting universes'' (MIU) model, then the mere presence of the universes with a zero scale factor (the ``Zero universes'') produces a veritably remarkable outcome: the classical cosmological singularities of Big Bang, Big Crunch and Big Rip all fail to arise. In other words, those universes that are considered ill-posed at the classical level may turn out to be a necessary and sought-after ingredient in a future internally consistent quantum theory of gravity. Finally, we argue that the MIU quantization method might shed light on a number of other cosmological mysteries; for example, it might account for a decoherence which preceded the eternal inflation, and elucidate how the quantum superposition of vacuum decays occurring at different places might give birth to actual bubble universes there. In addition, the new method might help explain why our universe was born in an extremely low-entropy initial state required to trigger the initial inflation.</description>

      <title>Extending the micro-Hertz detection horizons via orbital resonance effect for geocentric gravitational wave antennas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.19185v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $\mu$Hz gravitational wave band holds crucial insights into coalescing supermassive black hole binaries and stochastic backgrounds but remains inaccessible due to technical challenges. We demonstrate that geocentric space-based GW detectors (e.g., TianQin, gLISA, GADFLI) can bridge this gap by considering orbital resonance effects, circumventing the need for prohibitively long baselines. When GW frequencies match with integer multiples of a satellite's orbital frequency, sustained tidal forces induce cumulative orbital deviations through resonant effects, which, combined with orbital modulation, improve detector sensitivity by 1-2 orders of magnitude in the $\mu$Hz band. Consequently, geocentric missions can detect SMBHBs across significantly expanded mass-redshift parameter space and track their inspiral-merger-ringdown evolution. Crucially, such observations could synergize with pulsar timing array data of the same binaries at earlier inspiral stages, enabling unprecedented joint tests of strong-field gravity and binary evolution. Our findings establish geocentric antennas as a cost-effective, near-term precursor for unlocking the $\mu$Hz GW astronomy.</description>

      <title>Regge poles of analogous rotating black holes in binary Bose-Einstein condensates: The gapped excitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15403v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the spectrum of the Regge poles (RPs), which are the counterparts of quasinormal modes, in a draining bathtub vortex within a two-component Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) system. We study the gapped excitations of the condensate with the spatially dependent energy gap term using a spatially tunable Rabi coupling, which will be treated as a perturbation. This model serves as an analogue of a rotating black hole surrounded by an environmental mass shell. We first compute the semiclassical scattering amplitude with the spatially independent mass effect due to the orbital interference. In the case of the mass-shell, bifurcation of the spectrum is observed, resulting in the destabilization of the RPs. We also study the migration of RPs by shifting the bump position. Our results show that the RPs of the co-rotating modes exhibit greater stability than those of the counter-rotating modes. Large migration and overtaking jumps of the overtone (fundamental RP) leave an imprint on the scattering amplitude at small (large) scattering angles. This can be observed in the scattering interference pattern in experiments.</description>

      <title>Traversable Wormholes in non-minimal Einstein-Yang-Mills Gravity: Geometry, Energy Conditions, and Gravitational Lensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02406v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work presents a new class of static, spherically symmetric traversable wormhole solutions within the framework of non-minimal Einstein-Yang-Mills (EYM) gravity, where the SU(2) Yang-Mills field is purely magnetic. By adopting a constant redshift function and introducing a direct coupling between the Ricci scalar and the Yang-Mills field strength, we investigate the role of the non-minimal coupling constant $\xi$ and the magnetic charge $Q$ in shaping the wormhole geometry. Our analysis shows that for small values of $\xi$, the flare-out and throat conditions can be satisfied, allowing physically viable traversable wormholes without requiring externally introduced exotic matter. The Arnowitt-Deser-Misner (ADM) mass is evaluated, revealing that for $\xi &lt; 0.01$ it grows monotonically with charge, whereas for $\xi \gtrsim 0.01$ it decreases with increasing charge, signaling a reduction in the total mass-energy of the system. An examination of the energy conditions indicates localized violations of the null and weak energy conditions at the throat, while the strong energy condition remains satisfied. Finally, the study of gravitational lensing confirms that the deflection angle of light is consistently positive, reflecting the overall attractive nature of the wormhole gravitational field. These results highlight the significant role of non-minimal gauge-gravity couplings in enabling traversable wormholes with distinct observational signatures.</description>

      <title>Construction of Rotating Sen Black Holes via the Newman-Janis Algorithm and Applications to Accretion Disks and Shadows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01226v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive a rotating Sen black hole (BH) solution from the nonrotating limit static metric of the Sen BH using the Newman-Janis algorithm (NJA) and investigate the thin accretion disk and shadow of the rotating Sen BH. The characteristics of the rotating Sen BH, including its horizon and ergosurface, are analyzed. The results of our analysis indicate that an increase in the effective charge $q_{m}$ leads to corresponding increases in the energy flux, radiation temperature, and spectral luminosity. It is observed that the BH shadow size decreases with an increase in the parameter $q_{m}$. Furthermore, by comparing the theoretically predicted shadow diameters with observational data from M87$^{*}$ and Sgr A$^{*}$, we constrain the viable range of model parameters. The BH inclination angles are set to $17^{\circ}$, $50^{\circ}$ and $90^{\circ}$ for the analysis. Our results indicate that, within the constrained parameter space consistent with both M87$^{*}$ and Sgr A$^{*}$, the shared parameter bounds derived from the rotating Sen BH are given by $0.133158M&lt;q_{m}&lt;0.215561M$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03627v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We find the inferred properties of the putative gravitational wave background in the second data release of the European Pulsar Timing Array to be in better agreement with theoretical expectations under the improved noise model. In particular, our improved noise models show consistency of the background's strain spectral index with the value of -2/3, favoring the population of supermassive black hole binaries as the origin of the background. Our results further suggest that the observed gravitational wave emission is the dominant source of the binary energy loss, with no evidence of environmental effects or eccentric orbits. At the reference gravitational wave frequency of yr$^{-1}$, we also find a lower power-law strain amplitude of the background than in previous data analyses. This mitigates some of the tensions of the strain amplitude with the expected number density and mass scale of binaries discussed in the literature. However, we show that it is mostly affected by strong covariance of the amplitude and the strain spectral index at yr$^{-1}$, whereas the strain amplitude at 0.1 yr$^{-1}$ and the strain amplitude at yr$^{-1}$ assuming a fixed spectral index of -2/3 remains unaffected. Our results highlight the importance of accurate noise models for correctly inferring properties of the gravitational wave background.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Holes and Second-order Gravitational Waves in Axion-like Hybrid Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00764v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the possibility that primordial black holes (PBHs) can be formed from large curvature perturbations generated during the waterfall phase transition in a hybrid inflation model driven by an axion-like particle (ALP) $\phi$. The model predicts a spectral index $n_s \simeq 0.964$ and a tensor-to-scalar ratio $r \simeq 0.003$, in agreement with Planck data and potentially testable by next generation cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiments such as CMB-S4 and LiteBIRD. We find that the PBH mass and the peak of the associated scalar-induced gravitational wave (SIGW) spectrum are correlated with the ALP mass. In particular, PBHs in the mass range $10^{-13}\, M_\odot$ can constitute either the entire dark matter (DM) content of the universe or a significant fraction of it. The predicted second-order GWs from this mechanism are within the sensitivity reach of future observatories like LISA and ET. The typical reheating temperature in the model is around $10^6 - 10^7$ GeV is consistent with Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) constraints.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01680v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze how the axion parameter, the Einstein-Maxwell-Scalar (EMS) coupling constant, and the charge density affect the chaotic properties of a charged hairy black hole, as characterized by the quantum Lyapunov exponent. We inject charged shock waves from the asymptotic boundary and compute the out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOCs). Due to the relevant deformation in the boundary theory induced by a bulk scalar field, the bulk solution flows to a more general Kasner spacetime near the black hole singularity. We examine the behavior of chaotic parameters, including the Lyapunov exponent, butterfly velocity, and scrambling time delay, under this deformation. We find that as the deformation parameter increases, the ratio of the quantum Lyapunov exponent to the surface gravity decreases. For sufficiently large deformation, the Lyapunov exponent in the deformed geometry can exceed that of the axion Reissner-Nordstrom case. We observe that boundary deformation generally reduces the scrambling time delay, with the EMS coupling having a significant effect on the delay. These results provide further insight into the role of boundary deformations in modifying chaotic properties in charged hairy black holes.</description>

      <title>Black Hole Entropy, Quantum Corrections and EFT Transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02655v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit and study quantum corrections to the supersymmetric entropy of BPS black holes in 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ effective field theories (EFTs), which can be obtained from Type IIA string theory compactified on a Calabi-Yau threefold. Macroscopically, these corrections arise from an infinite series of higher-derivative F-terms that encode certain modifications to the two-derivative supergravity effective action. Within the large volume regime, we analyze in detail the moduli dependence of these semi-classical contributions and explore their implications for the black hole entropy. As a byproduct, we show that the entropy captures, in a rather intricate way, the transition between four- and five-dimensional dual EFT descriptions. In fact, the expansion parameter $\alpha$ controlling the relevant asymptotic series can be related to the ratio of the black hole horizon and the Kaluza-Klein scale, given here by the inverse D0-brane mass. Furthermore, we are able to resum the series into a well-behaved convergent expression for all values of $\alpha$. This demonstrates, in turn, that (stable) black holes can, indeed, probe scales besides the quantum gravity cutoff. More precisely, by examining two representative BPS systems -- the D0-D2-D4 and D2-D6 black hole solutions -- we explicitly illustrate how highly non-local (perturbative) quantum effects resolve the divergences, ultimately leading to a well-defined entropy function. Additionally, in certain cases, we show that one can take a suitable decompactification limit to 5d and verify that the corrected entropy function reproduces the exact microstate counting of the underlying five-dimensional black string. Our results also clarify the role of non-perturbative quantum corrections, which, remarkably, do not modify any of our prior conclusions.</description>

Abstract: The quantum vacuum of the electromagnetic field is inherently entangled across distinct spatial sub-regions, resulting in non-trivial particle content across these sub-regions. However, accessing this particle content in a controlled laboratory experiment has remained out of experimental reach. Here we propose to overcome this challenge with a quantum mirror made from a two-dimensional sub-wavelength array of atoms that divides a photonic cavity. The arrays response to light is tunable between transmissive and reflective states by a control atom that is excited to a Rydberg state. We find that photon content from entangled sub-regions of the vacuum causes subtle frequency shifts that are accessible to sub-wavelength atom array platforms. This novel approach for probing vacuum particle content stems from the systems unique ability to create coherent dynamics of superpositions of transmissive and reflective states, providing a quantum-enhanced platform for observing particle content from entangled spatial sub-regions of the electromagnetic field vacuum.</description>

      <title>GW200208_222617 as an eccentric black-hole binary merger: properties and astrophysical implications</title>

Abstract: Detecting orbital eccentricity in a stellar-mass black-hole merger would point to a non-isolated formation channel. Eccentric binaries can form in dense stellar environments such as globular clusters or active galactic nuclei, or from triple stellar systems in the Galactic field. However, confidently measuring eccentricity is challenging -- short signals from high-mass eccentric mergers can mimic spin-induced precession, making the two effects hard to disentangle. This degeneracy weakens considerably for longer-duration signals. Here, GW200208_222617 provides a rare opportunity. Originating from a relatively low-mass binary with source-frame chirp mass $\sim20$ M$_\odot$, its gravitational-wave signal spanned $\sim14$ orbital cycles in band, with no indication of data quality issues. Previous analyses for quasi-circular binaries found no evidence for spin precession and, multiple subsequent studies found the data to favour an eccentric merger despite notable technical differences. All in all, we believe GW200208_222617 is the black-hole merger event from GWTC-3 with the least ambiguous detection of eccentricity. We present a critical discussion of properties and astrophysical interpretation of GW200208_222617 as an eccentric black-hole merger using models of field triples, globular clusters, and active galactic nuclei. We find that if GW200208_222617 was indeed eccentric, its origin is consistent with a field triple or globular cluster. Formation in the inner regions of an active galactic nucleus is disfavoured. The outer regions of such a disk remain a viable origin for GW200208_222617; we demonstrate how future detections of eccentric mergers formed in such environments could be powerful tools for constraining the disk geometry.</description>
