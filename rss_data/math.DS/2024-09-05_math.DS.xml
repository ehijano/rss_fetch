      <title>Discrete-time dynamics, step-skew products, and pipe-flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A discrete-time deterministic dynamical system is governed at every step by a predetermined law. However the dynamics can lead to many complexities in the phase space and in the domain of observables that makes it comparable to a stochastic process. This article presents two different ways of representing a dynamical system by stochastic processes. The first is a step-skew product system, in which a finite state Markov process drives a dynamics on Euclidean space. The second is a skew-product system, in which a deterministic, mixing flow intermittently drives a deterministic flow through a topological space created by gluing cylinders. This system is called a perturbed pipe-flow. We show how these three representations are interchangeable. The inter-connections also reveal how a deterministic chaotic system partitions the phase space at a local level, and also mixes the phase space at a global level.</description>

      <title>Les Canards de Turing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we study a system of reaction-diffusion equations in which the diffusivities are widely separated. We report on the discovery of families of spatially periodic canard solutions that emerge from {\em singular Turing bifurcations}. The emergence of these spatially periodic canards asymptotically close to the Turing bifurcations, which are reversible 1:1 resonant Hopf bifurcations in the spatial ODE system, is an analog in spatial dynamics of the emergence of limit cycle canards in the canard explosions that occur asymptotically close to Hopf bifurcations in time-dependent ODEs. In the full PDE system, we show that for most parameter values under study the Turing bifurcation is sub-critical, and we present the results of some direct numerical simulations showing that several of the different types of spatial canard patterns are attractors in the prototypical PDE.
  To support the numerical discoveries, we use geometric desingularization and geometric singular perturbation theory to demonstrate the existence of these families of spatially periodic canards. Crucially, in the singular limit, we study a novel class of {\em reversible folded singularities}. In particular, there are two reversible folded saddle-node bifurcations of type II (RFSN-II), each occurring asymptotically close to a Turing bifurcation. We derive analytical formulas for these singularities and show that their canards play key roles in the observed families of spatially periodic canard solutions. Then, for an interval of values of the bifurcation parameter further below the Turing bifurcation and RFSN-II point, the spatial ODE also has spatially periodic canard patterns, however these are created by a reversible folded saddle (instead of the RFSN-II). It also turns out that there is an interesting scale invariance, so that some components of some spatial canards exhibit nearly self-similar dynamics.</description>

      <title>State Space Kriging model for emulating complex nonlinear dynamical systems under stochastic excitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new surrogate model for emulating the behavior of complex nonlinear dynamical systems with external stochastic excitation. The model represents the system dynamics in state space form through a sparse Kriging model. The resulting surrogate model is termed state space Kriging (S2K) model. Sparsity in the Kriging model is achieved by selecting an informative training subset from the observed time histories of the state vector and its derivative with respect to time. We propose a tailored technique for designing the training time histories of state vector and its derivative, aimed at enhancing the robustness of the S2K prediction. We validate the performance of the S2K model with various benchmarks. The results show that S2K yields accurate prediction of complex nonlinear dynamical systems under stochastic excitation with only a few training time histories of state vector.</description>

      <title>Homoclinic Chaos Unveiling Quorum Sensing Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quorum sensing orchestrates bacterial communication, which is vital for bacteria's population behaviour. We propose a mathematical model that unveils chaotic dynamics within quorum sensing networks, challenging predictability. The model considers the interaction between autoinducers (molecular signalling) and two subtypes of bacteria. We analyze the different dynamical scenarios to find parameter regimes for long-term steady-state behaviour, periodic oscillations, and even chaos. In the latter case, we find that the complicated dynamics can be explained by the presence of homoclinic Shilnikov bifurcations.</description>

      <title>Uncountable Hyperfiniteness and The Random Ratio Ergodic Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the orbit equivalence relation of a free action of a locally compact group is hyperfinite (\`a la Connes-Feldman-Weiss) precisely when it is 'hypercompact'. This implies an uncountable version of the Ornstein-Weiss Theorem and that every locally compact group admitting a hypercompact probability preserving free action is amenable. We also establish an uncountable version of Danilenko's Random Ratio Ergodic Theorem. From this we deduce the 'Hopf dichotomy' for many nonsingular Bernoulli actions.</description>

      <title>Neighbourhood conditions for network stability with link uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The main result relates to structured robust stability analysis of an input-output model for networks with link uncertainty. It constitutes a collection of integral quadratic constraints, which together imply robust stability of the uncertain networked dynamics. Each condition is decentralized in the sense that it depends on model data pertaining to the neighbourhood of a specific agent. By contrast, pre-existing conditions for the network model are link-wise decentralized, with each involving conservatively more localized problem data. A numerical example is presented to illustrate the advantage of the new broader neighbourhood conditions.</description>

      <title>Homology and K-theory for self-similar actions of groups and groupoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nekrashevych associated to each self-similar group action an ample groupoid and a C*-algebra. We provide exact sequences to compute the homology of the groupoid and the K-theory of the C*-algebra in terms of the homology of the group and K-theory of the group C*-algebra via the transfer map and the virtual endomorphism. Complete computations are then performed for the Grigorchuk group, the Grigorchuk--Erschler group, Gupta--Sidki groups and many others. Results are proved more generally for self-similar groupoids. As a consequence of our results and recent results of Xin Li, we are able to show that R\"over's simple group containing the Grigorchuk group is rationally acyclic but has nontrivial Schur multiplier. We prove many more R\"over--Nekrashevych groups of self-similar groups are rationally acyclic.</description>

      <title>Noise-induced order in high dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Noise-induced phenomena in high-dimensional dynamical systems were investigated from a random dynamical systems point of view. In a class of generalized H\'enon maps, which are randomly perturbed delayed logistic maps, with monotonically increasing noise levels, we observed (i) an increase in the number of positive Lyapunov exponents from 4 to 5, and the emergence of characteristic periods at the same time, and (ii) a decrease in the number of positive Lyapunov exponents from 4 to 3, and an increase in Kolmogorov--Sinai entropy at the same time. Our results imply that simple concepts of noise-induced phenomena, such as noise-induced chaos and/or noise-induced order, may not describe those analogue in high dimensional dynamical systems, owing to coexistence of noise-induced chaos and noise-induced order.</description>

      <title>Waveform distortion for temperature compensation and synchronization in circadian rhythms: An approach based on the renormalization group method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Numerous biological processes accelerate as temperatures increase, but the period of circadian rhythms remains constant, known as temperature compensation, while synchronizing with the 24h light-dark cycle. We theoretically explores the possible relevance of waveform distortions in circadian gene-protein dynamics to the temperature compensation and synchronization. Our analysis of the Goodwin model provides a coherent explanation of most of temperature compensation hypotheses. Using the renormalization group method, we analytically demonstrate that the decreasing phase of circadian protein oscillations should lengthen with increasing temperature, leading to waveform distortions to maintain a stable period. This waveform-period correlation also occurs in other oscillators like Lotka-Volterra and van der Pol models. A reanalysis of known data nicely confirms our findings on waveform distortion and its impact on synchronization range. Thus we conclude that circadian rhythm waveforms are fundamental to both temperature compensation and synchronization.</description>

      <title>Ricci curvature and normalized Ricci flow on generalized Wallach spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02570v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We proved that the normalized Ricci flow does not preserve the positivity of Ricci curvature of Riemannian metrics on every generalized Wallach space with $a_1+a_2+a_3\le 1/2$, in particular on the spaces $\operatorname{SU}(k+l+m)/\operatorname{SU}(k)\times \operatorname{SU}(l) \times \operatorname{SU}(m)$ and $\operatorname{Sp}(k+l+m)/\operatorname{Sp}(k)\times \operatorname{Sp}(l) \times \operatorname{Sp}(m)$ independently on $k,l$ and $m$. The positivity of Ricci curvature is preserved for all original metrics with $\operatorname{Ric}&gt;0$ on generalized Wallach spaces $a_1+a_2+a_3&gt; 1/2$ if the conditions $4\left(a_j+a_k\right)^2\ge (1-2a_i)(1+2a_i)^{-1}$ hold for all $\{i,j,k\}=\{1,2,3\}$. We also established that the spaces $\operatorname{SO}(k+l+m)/\operatorname{SO}(k)\times \operatorname{SO}(l)\times \operatorname{SO}(m)$ satisfy the above conditions for $\max\{k,l,m\}\le 11$, moreover, additional conditions were found to keep $\operatorname{Ric}&gt;0$ in cases when $\max\{k,l,m\}\le 11$ is violated. Similar questions have also been studied for all other generalized Wallach spaces given in the classification of Yuri\u\i\ Nikonorov.</description>

      <title>Stability of standing periodic waves in the massive Thirring model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the spectral stability of the standing periodic waves in the massive Thirring model in laboratory coordinates. Since solutions of the linearized MTM equation are related to the squared eigenfunctions of the linear Lax system, the spectral stability of the standing periodic waves can be studied by using their Lax spectrum. Standing periodic waves are classified based on eight eigenvalues which coincide with the endpoints of the spectral bands of the Lax spectrum. Combining analytical and numerical methods, we show that the standing periodic waves are spectrally stable if and only if the eight eigenvalues are located either on the imaginary axis or along the diagonals of the complex plane.</description>

      <title>Upper bounds on the dimension of the global attractor of the 2D Navier-Stokes equations on the $\beta-$plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article establishes estimates on the dimension of the global attractor of the two-dimensional rotating Navier-Stokes equation for viscous, incompressible fluids on the $\beta$-plane. Previous results in this setting by M.A.H. Al-Jaboori and D. Wirosoetisno (2011) had proved that the global attractor collapses to a single point that depends only the longitudinal coordinate, i.e., zonal flow, when the rotation is sufficiently fast. However, an explicit quantification of the complexity of the global attractor in terms of $\beta$ had remained open. In this paper, such estimates are established which are valid across a wide regime of rotation rates and are consistent with the dynamically degenerate regime previously identified. Additionally, a decomposition of solutions is established detailing the asymptotic behavior of the solutions in the limit of large rotation.</description>

Abstract: For $n$-body problem with arbitrary positive masses, we prove there are regularizable collinear periodic solutions for any ordering of the masses, going from a simultaneous binary collision to another in half of a period with half of the masses moving monotonically to the right and the other half monotonically to the left. When the masses satisfy certain equality condition, the solutions have extra symmetry. This also gives a new proof of the existence of Schubart orbit, when $n=3$.</description>

      <title>Strong mixing for the periodic Lorentz gas flow with infinite horizon</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.04254v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish strong mixing for the $\mathbb Z^d$-periodic, infinite horizon, Lorentz gas flow for continuous observables with compact support. The essential feature of this natural class of observables is that their support may contain points with infinite free flights. Dealing with such a class of functions is a serious challenge and there is no analogue of it in the finite horizon case. The mixing result for the aforementioned class of functions is obtained via new results: 1) mixing for continuous observables with compact support consisting of configurations at a bounded time from the closest collision; 2) a tightness-type result that allows us to control the configurations with long free flights. To prove 1), we establish a mixing local limit theorem for the Sinai billiard flow with infinite horizon, previously an open question.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.08330v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well-known that $\epsilon$-stable sets have a deep connection with the topological entropy of dynamical systems. In the present paper, we investigate the relationships of three types of upper metric mean dimensions with potential between \emph{the blocks of $\epsilon$-stable sets, $\epsilon$-stable sets, the dispersion of preimages of $\epsilon$-stable sets} and the whole phase space. Besides, some chaotic phenomenons are revealed in infinite entropy systems.
  As an application of main results, we show tail entropy, preimage neighborhood entropy and topological entropy have the same metric mean dimension.</description>

Abstract: Let $H &lt; G$ both be noncompact connected semisimple real algebraic groups where the former is maximal proper and $\Gamma &lt; G$ be a lattice. Building on the work of Gorodnik-Weiss, we refine their techniques and obtain effective results. More precisely, we prove effective convergence of the distribution of dense $\Gamma$-orbits in $G/H$ to some limiting density on $G/H$ assuming effective equidistribution of regions of maximal horospherical orbits under one-parameter diagonal flows inside a dense $H$-orbit in $\Gamma \backslash G$. The significance of the effectivized argument is due to the recent effective equidistribution results of Lindenstrauss-Mohammadi-Wang for $\Delta(\operatorname{SL}_2(\mathbb R)) &lt; \operatorname{SL}_2(\mathbb R) \times \operatorname{SL}_2(\mathbb R)$ and $\operatorname{SL}_2(\mathbb R) &lt; \operatorname{SL}_2(\mathbb C)$ and arithmetic lattices $\Gamma$, and future generalizations in that direction.</description>

      <title>Extended invariant cones as Nonlinear Normal Modes of inhomogeneous piecewise linear systems</title>

Abstract: The aim of this paper is to explore the relationship between invariant cones and nonlinear normal modes in piecewise linear mechanical systems. As a key result, we extend the invariant cone concept, originally established for homogeneous piecewise linear systems, to a class of inhomogeneous continuous piecewise linear systems. The inhomogeneous terms can be constant and/or time-dependent, modeling nonsmooth mechanical systems with a clearance gap and external harmonic forcing, respectively. Using an augmented state vector, a modified invariant cone problem is formulated and solved to compute the nonlinear normal modes, understood as periodic solutions of the underlying conservative dynamics. An important contribution is that invariant cones of the underlying homogeneous system can be regarded as a singularity in the theory of nonlinear normal modes of continuous piecewise linear systems. In addition, we use a similar methodology to take external harmonic forcing into account. We illustrate our approach using numerical examples of mechanical oscillators with a unilateral elastic contact. The resulting backbone curves and frequency response diagrams are compared to the results obtained using the shooting method and brute force time integration.</description>

      <title>The natural flow and the critical exponent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.12665v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inspired by work of Besson-Courtois-Gallot, we construct a flow called the natural flow on a nonpositively curved Riemannian manifold $M$. As with the natural map, the $k$-Jacobian of the natural flow is directly related to the critical exponent $\delta$ of the fundamental group. There are several applications of the natural flow that connect dynamical, geometrical, and topological invariants of the manifold. First, we give $k$-dimensional linear isoperimetric inequalities when $k &gt; \delta$. This, in turn, produces lower bounds on the Cheeger constant. We resolve a recent conjecture of Dey-Kapovich on the non-existence of $k$-dimensional compact, complex subvarieties of complex hyperbolic manifolds with $2k &gt; \delta$. We also provide upper bounds on the homological dimension, generalizing work of Kapovich and work of Farb with the first two authors. Using different methods, we also give upper bounds on the cohomological dimension which partially resolves a conjecture of Kapovich. We also specialize to the setting of locally symmetric manifolds where we further refine our work. Finally, we introduce a new growth condition on the Bowen-Margulis measure that we call uniformly exponentially bounded that we connect to the cohomological dimension and which could be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic properties of infinitesimal characters and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06250v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inspired by classical results by Benoist, we introduce and study natural objects associated to an integrable tangent vector to the character variety $\mathfrak X(\Gamma,\mathsf G)$ of a semi-group $\Gamma$, with values on a semi-simple real algebraic group $\mathsf G$ of the non-compact type. We obtain non-empty interior of the cone of Jordan variations and, when $\mathsf G$ is split, we obtain double-density results associated to these variations, giving in particular non-empty interior of the set of length-normalized variations. We then apply the developed techniques to study pressure forms on the space of Anosov representations, in particular to higher-rank Teichm\"uller spaces. Among other things we exhibit an explicit functional $\varphi\in\mathfrak a^*$ whose pressure form is compatible with Goldman's symplectic form at the Fuchsian points of the Hitchin component. We finally exhibit a Diophantine equation that governs the degeneration of the Hausdorff dimension of higher-quasi-circles.</description>
