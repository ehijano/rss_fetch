      <title>Aperiodic sets of three types of convex polygons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sets of three types of convex pentagons that are aperiodic with no matching conditions on the edges are created from a chiral aperiodic monotile Tile(1, 1). This method divides the interior of Tile(1,1) into five convex polygons with five or more edges, and we have so far identified four methods.</description>

      <title>On Hadwiger's covering problem in small dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $H_n$ be the minimal number such that any $n$-dimensional convex body can be covered by $H_n$ translates of interior of that body. Similarly $H_n^s$ is the corresponding quantity for symmetric bodies. It is possible to define $H_n$ and $H_n^s$ in terms of illumination of the boundary of the body using external light sources, and the famous Hadwiger's covering conjecture (illumination conjecture) states that $H_n=H_{n}^s=2^n$.
  In this note we obtain new upper bounds on $H_n$ and $H_{n}^s$ for small dimensions $n$. Our main idea is to cover the body by translates of John's ellipsoid (the inscribed ellipsoid of the largest volume). Using specific lattice coverings, estimates of quermassintegrals for convex bodies in John's position, and calculations of mean widths of regular simplexes, we prove the following new upper bounds on $H_n$ and $H_n^s$: $H_5\le 933$, $H_6\le 6137$, $H_7\le 41377$, $H_8\le 284096$, $H_4^s\le 72$, $H_5^s\le 305$, and $H_6^s\le 1292$.
  For larger $n$, we describe how the general asymptotic bounds $H_n\le \binom{2n}{n}n(\ln n+\ln\ln n+5)$ and $H_n^s\le 2^n n(\ln n+\ln\ln n+5)$ due to Rogers and Shephard can be improved for specific values of $n$.</description>

      <title>Fixed point theorem for generalized Chatterjea type mappings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new type of mappings in metric space which are three-point analogue of the well-known Chatterjea type mappings, and call them generalized Chatterjea type mappings. It is shown that such mappings can be discontinuous as is the case of Chatterjea type mappings and this new class includes the class of Chatterjea type mappings. The fixed point theorem for generalized Chatterjea type mappings is proven.</description>

      <title>A note on faces of convex sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At the core of convex analysis, we find the concept of a face of a convex set, which was systematically studied by R. T. Rockafellar. With the exception of the one-point faces known as extreme points, faces received little attention in the theory of infinite-dimensional convexity, perhaps due to their lack of relative interior points. Circumventing this peculiarity, M. E. Shirokov and the present author explored faces generated by points. These faces possess relative interior points and they can serve as building blocks for general faces. Here we deepen this approach, taking into account ideas by E. M. Alfsen and L. E. Dubins. We also indicate possible application in probability theory.</description>

      <title>Inequalities for geometric mean distance metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a hyperbolic type metric $h_{G,c}$ introduced by Dovgoshey, Hariri, and Vuorinen. We find the best constant $c&gt;0$, for which this function $h_{G,c}$ is a metric in specific choices of $G$. We give several sharp inequalities between $h_{G,c}$ and other hyperbolic type metrics, and also offer a few results related to ball inclusion.</description>

      <title>Examples of Ricci limit spaces with infinite holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00619v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $n\geq 3$, $\lambda \in \mathbb{R} $, and $(X,h)$ be an $n$-dimensional smooth complete Riemannian manifold with ${\rm Ric}_h &gt; \lambda $.
  In this paper, we construct, for each given $\epsilon &gt;0$, a sequence of $(n+2)$-dimensional manifolds $(M_{i} ,g_i ) \stackrel{GH}{\longrightarrow} (X_\epsilon ,d_\epsilon ) $ with ${\rm Ric}_{g_i} &gt; \lambda $, such that $d_{GH} (X,X_\epsilon ) \leq \epsilon $, and $X_\epsilon $ is homeomorphic to the space obtained by removing an infinite number of balls from $X$. Hence $X_\epsilon $ has dense boundary with an infinite number of connected components. Moreover, $X_\epsilon $ has no open subset which is topologically a manifold. This generalizes Hupp-Naber-Wang's result (arxiv: 2308.03909) from $4$-dimensional case to the general case of dimension $n\geq 3$. Notably, the restriction $n\geq 3$ is essential, as Ricci limit spaces in $1$ and $2$ dimensions always have a dense open subset which is topologically a manifold.
  Our construction differs from that of Hupp-Naber-Wang. In their approach, Hupp-Naber-Wang considered doing an infinite number of blow-ups on the local complex surface structure of $X$, thus relying on the $4$-dimensional condition. However, our method involves removing an infinite number of balls from $X$, allowing us to construct in the general case of dimensions greater than or equal to $3$.
  As a corollary, we provide a solution to an open problem posed by Naber in the $3$-dimensional case. Note that the $3$-dimensional case is the only remaining unresolved case in Naber's problem. Consequently, Naber's question is resolved in all dimensions.</description>

      <title>A Rogers--Brascamp--Lieb--Luttinger inequality in the space of matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.13298v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider convex bodies in $M_{n,m}(\mathbb R)$, the space of matrices of $n$-rows and $m$-columns. A special case of fiber-symmetrization in $M_{n,m}(\mathbb R)$ was recently introduced in [5,6]. We prove a Rogers--Brascamp--Lieb--Luttinger type inequality with respect to this symmetrization, for quasi-concave functions and provide some applications.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic order of the quantization error for a class of self-similar measures with overlaps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01103v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\{f_i\}_{i=1}^N$ be a set of equi-contractive similitudes on $\mathbb{R}^1$ satisfying the finite-type condition. We study the asymptotic quantization error for self-similar measures $\mu$ associated with $\{f_i\}_{i=1}^N$ and a positive probability vector. With a verifiable assumption, we prove that the upper and lower quantization coefficient for $\mu$ are both bounded away from zero and infinity. This can be regarded as an extension of Graf and Luschgy's result on self-similar measures with the open set condition. Our result is applicable to a significant class of self-similar measures with overlaps, including Erd\"{o}s measure, the $3$-fold convolution of the classical Cantor measure and the self-similar measures on some $\lambda$-Cantor sets.</description>
