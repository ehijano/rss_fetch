      <title>Properties of the entropic risk measure EVaR in relation to selected distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entropic Value-at-Risk (EVaR) measure is a convenient coherent risk measure. Due to certain difficulties in finding its analytical representation, it was previously calculated explicitly only for the normal distribution. We succeeded to overcome these difficulties and to calculate Entropic Value-at-Risk (EVaR) measure for Poisson, compound Poisson, Gamma, Laplace, exponential, chi-squared, inverse Gaussian distribution and normal inverse Gaussian distribution with the help of Lambert function that is a special function, generally speaking, with two branches.</description>

      <title>Hilbert Space-Valued LQG Mean Field Games: An Infinite-Dimensional Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive study of Hilbert space-valued Linear-Quadratic-Gaussian (LQG) mean field games (MFGs), generalizing the classic LQG mean field game theory to scenarios where the state equations are driven by infinite-dimensional stochastic equations. In this framework, state and control processes take values in separable Hilbert spaces. Moreover, the state equations involve infinite dimensional noises, namely $Q$-Wiener processes. All agents are coupled through the average state of the population appearing in their linear dynamics and quadratic cost functional. In addition, the diffusion coefficient of each agent involves the state, control, and the average state processes. We first study the well-posedness of a system of coupled infinite-dimensional stochastic evolution equations, which forms the foundation of MFGs in Hilbert spaces. Next, we develop the Nash Certainty Equivalence principle and obtain a unique Nash equilibrium for the limiting Hilbert space-valued MFG. Finally, we establish the $\epsilon$-Nash property for the finite-player game in Hilbert space.</description>

      <title>Diversification quotients: Quantifying diversification via risk measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.13679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.13679v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish the first axiomatic theory for diversification indices using six intuitive axioms: non-negativity, location invariance, scale invariance, rationality, normalization, and continuity. The unique class of indices satisfying these axioms, called the diversification quotients (DQs), are defined based on a parametric family of risk measures. A further axiom of portfolio convexity pins down DQ based on coherent risk measures. DQ has many attractive properties, and it can address several theoretical and practical limitations of existing indices. In particular, for the popular risk measures Value-at-Risk and Expected Shortfall, the corresponding DQ admits simple formulas and it is efficient to optimize in portfolio selection. Moreover, it can properly capture tail heaviness and common shocks, which are neglected by traditional diversification indices. When illustrated with financial data, DQ is intuitive to interpret, and its performance is competitive against other diversification indices.</description>
