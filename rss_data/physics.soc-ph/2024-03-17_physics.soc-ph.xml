      <title>The long-term and disparate impact of job loss on individual mobility behaviour</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In today's interconnected world of widespread mobility, ubiquitous social interaction, and rapid information dissemination, the demand for individuals to swiftly adapt their behaviors has increased dramatically. Timely decision-making faces new challenges due to the necessity of using finely temporal-resolved anonymised individual data to keep up with fast-paced behavioural changes. To tackle this issue, we propose a general framework that leverages privacy-enhanced GPS data from mobile devices alongside census information to infer the employment status of individuals over time. By analysing the mobility patterns of employed and unemployed individuals, we unveil significant differences in behaviours between the two groups, showing a contraction in visited locations and a general decline in the exploratory behaviour of unemployed individuals. Remarkably, these differences intensify over time since job loss, particularly affecting individuals from more vulnerable demographic groups. These findings highlight the importance of early monitoring of unemployed individuals who may face enduring levels of distress. Overall, our findings shed light on the dynamics of employment-related behaviour, emphasizing the importance of implementing timely interventions to support the unemployed and vulnerable populations.</description>

      <title>Delayed interactions in the noisy voter model through the periodic polling mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of delayed interactions on the stationary distribution of the noisy voter model. We assume that the delayed interactions occur through the periodic polling mechanism and replace the original instantaneous two-agent interactions. In our analysis, we require that the polling period aligns with the delay in announcing poll outcomes. As expected, when the polling period is relatively short, the model with delayed interactions is effectively identical to the original model. As the polling period increases, oscillatory behavior emerges, but the model with delayed interactions still converges to stationary distribution. The stationary distribution resembles a Beta-binomial distribution, with its shape parameters scaling with the polling period. The observed scaling behavior is non-trivial. As the polling period increases, fluctuation damping also intensifies, yet there is a critical intermediate polling period for which fluctuation damping reaches its maximum intensity.</description>

      <title>A Big Data Approach to Understand Sub-national Determinants of FDI in Africa</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10239v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Various macroeconomic and institutional factors hinder FDI inflows, including corruption, trade openness, access to finance, and political instability. Existing research mostly focuses on country-level data, with limited exploration of firm-level data, especially in developing countries. Recognizing this gap, recent calls for research emphasize the need for qualitative data analysis to delve into FDI determinants, particularly at the regional level. This paper proposes a novel methodology, based on text mining and social network analysis, to get information from more than 167,000 online news articles to quantify regional-level (sub-national) attributes affecting FDI ownership in African companies. Our analysis extends information on obstacles to industrial development as mapped by the World Bank Enterprise Surveys. Findings suggest that regional (sub-national) structural and institutional characteristics can play an important role in determining foreign ownership.</description>

      <title>Modeling the Spread of COVID-19 in University Communities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mathematical and simulation models are often used to predict the spread of a disease and estimate the impact of public health interventions, and many such models have been developed and used during the COVID-19 pandemic. This paper describes a study that systematically compared models for a university community, which has a much smaller but more connected population than a state or nation. We developed a stochastic agent-based model, a deterministic compartment model, and a model based on ordinary differential equations. All three models represented the disease progression with the same susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) model. We created a baseline scenario for a population of 14,000 students and faculty and eleven other scenarios for combinations of interventions such as regular testing, contact tracing, quarantine, isolation, moving courses online, mask wearing, improving ventilation, and vaccination. We used parameter values from other epidemiological studies and incorporated data about COVID-19 testing in College Park, Maryland, but the study was designed to compare modeling approaches to each other using a synthetic population. For each scenario we used the models to estimate the number of persons who become infected over a semester of 119 days. We evaluated the models by comparing their predictions and evaluating their parsimony and computational effort. The agent-based model (ABM) and the deterministic compartment model (DCM) had similar results with cyclic flow of persons to and from quarantine, but the model based on ordinary differential equations failed to capture these dynamics. The ABM's computation time was much greater than the other two models' computation time. The DCM captured some of the dynamics that were present in the ABM's predictions and, like those from the ABM, clearly showed the importance of testing and moving classes on-line.</description>

      <title>Effects of group size and noise on cooperation in population evolution of dynamic groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16317v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a large population, the agents temporally form group of the Public Goods Game (PGG) one after another, and size of one group is randomly distributed at $g\in [g_l,g_h]$. Players in it have two strategies to be chosen to cooperate, or to defect for playing the PGG. Based on this structure we investigate the evolution of cooperation in PGG as a function of the noise level underlying strategy adoptions with the group size distribution. In the process of the evolution, the payoffs of cooperators(defectors) have related to the strategy selection implemented by the death-birth process. When at the little value of the noise ($K=0.1$), if the system has different initial concentrations of cooperation, a hybrid state with cooperators and defectors, and AllC state are observed. Moreover, the critical parameter of the multiplication factor $r$ is obtained, above the critical value of $r_c$ it induces a totally cooperative behavior, which is fitted well with analytical expressions. The larger uncertainty with the increase of the noise level is, the more he hesitate and unsure how to choose which strategy when a moderate multiplication factor $r$ is set. So, with a greater value of noise strength, a larger value of $r$ induces a totally cooperative behavior; however a small value of $r$ leads to the mixed states of cooperators and defectors, and between the intermediate values of $r$ players probably randomly choose to cooperate or to defect in an unstable sphere, where a hysteresis effect occurs for a bigger size distribution of group.</description>

      <title>Disparities in access to US quantum information education</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.08629v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Driven in large part by the National Quantum Initiative Act of 2018, quantum information science (QIS) coursework and degree programs are rapidly spreading across US institutions. Yet prior work suggests that access to quantum workforce education is unequally distributed, disproportionately benefiting students at private research-focused institutions whose student bodies are unrepresentative of US higher education as a whole. We use regression analysis to analyze the distribution of QIS coursework across 456 institutions of higher learning as of fall 2022, identifying statistically significant disparities across institutions in particular along the axes of institution classification, funding, and geographic distribution suggesting today's QIS education programs are largely failing to reach low-income and rural students. We also conduct a brief analysis of the distribution of emerging dedicated QIS degree programs, discovering much the same trends. We conclude with a discussion of implications for educators, policymakers, and education researchers including specific policy recommendations to direct investments in QIS education to schools serving low-income and rural students, leverage existing grassroots diversity and inclusion initiatives that have arisen within the quantum community, and update and modernize procedures for collecting QIS educational data to better track these trends.</description>
