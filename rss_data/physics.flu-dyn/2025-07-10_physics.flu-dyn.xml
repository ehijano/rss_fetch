      <title>FED-PV: A Large-Scale Synthetic Frame/Event Dataset for Particle-Based Velocimetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Particle-based velocimetry (PV) is a widely used technique for non-invasive flow field measurements in fluid mechanics. Existing PV measurements typically rely on a single type of particle recording. With advancements in deep learning and information fusion, incorporating multiple different particle recordings presents a promising avenue for next-generation PV measurement techniques. However, we argue that the lack of cross-modal datasets -- combining frame-based recordings and event-based recordings -- represents a significant bottleneck in the development of fusion measurement algorithms. To address this critical gap, we developed a dual-modal data generator FED-PV to synthesize frame-based images and event-based recordings of moving particles, resulting in a 350GB dataset generated using our approach. This generator and dataset will facilitate advancements in novel PV algorithms.</description>

      <title>Green function and singularities in Stokes flow confined by cylindrical walls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, the Green function for the Stokes flow in the interior, exterior, and annular regions bounded by cylindrical walls is derived as a function of the pole position and expressed invariantly both at the field and pole points. Specifically, the Green function is obtained using a cylindrical harmonic expansion of the Stokes flow within the bitensorial formulation. This formulation allows us to obtain higher-order singularities within the same domains, such as the confined Couplet and Stresslet, by simply differentiating the Green function at its pole. Moreover, the confined Sourcelet and its associated multipoles are derived from the Green function through a new method that enforces the reciprocal properties of the Stokes flow. The resulting singularities are then employed to address hydrodynamic problems involving active and passive colloids interacting with cylindrical walls, such as sedimenting particles in the annular cylindrical region and the attractive or repulsive hydrodynamic forces exerted by the cylindrical boundaries on a microswimmer.</description>

      <title>Role of Transient Dynamics in Dripping-Jetting Transition in Newtonian Fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dripping dynamics has been well studied over the past century and forms a classic example of chaotic system in physics. With an increase in the inlet flow rate, periodic droplet formation from a faucet becomes chaotic in terms of the droplet size and the length of the liquid column at the time of pinch-off. With a further increase in the flow rate, dripping regime transitions into jetting regime where the liquid column length is much longer than that observed in the dripping case. In general, dripping faucet is seen as a long time behavior of the system at fixed control parameters. In the steady state condition, different nonlinear behaviors such as periodic and chaotic formation of droplets are observed in the dripping and jetting regimes. It is known that dripping faucet shows chaotic dripping regime before jetting regime ensues. At a critical inlet velocity, $U_{m-d_j}$, we note that dripping to jetting transition occurs after several droplets have formed in the dripping regime. The transition behaviour can be characterized by the time evolution of the liquid jet length $L$ and droplet size $D_p$. Solution to slender jet equation show that the dripping-jetting transition region is a function of the fluid properties. Further, we show that perturbations in the inlet velocity can significantly modify the transient behavior of the dripping to jetting regime transition.</description>

      <title>Ideal incompressible axisymmetric MHD: Uncovering finite-time singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide compelling numerical evidence for the development of (potential) finite-time singularities in the three-dimensional (3D) axisymmetric, ideal, incompressible magnetohydrodynamic (IMHD) equations, in a wall-bounded cylindrical domain, starting from smooth initial data, for the velocity and magnetic fields. We demonstrate that the nature of the singularity depends crucially on the relative strength C of the velocity and magnetic fields at the time of initialisation: (i) if C &lt; 1, then the swirl components, at the wall, evolve towards square profiles that lead to the intensification of shear at the meridional plane (r = 1, z = L/2) and the development of a finite-time singularity; (ii) if C = 1, there is no temporal evolution; (iii) if C &gt; 1, then the swirl components, at the wall, evolve towards a cusp-type singularity. By examining the spatiotemporal evolution of the pressure, we obtain insights into the development of these singularities.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic thresholds of turbulence decay in transitional shear flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Linearly stable shear flows first transition to turbulence in the form of localised patches. At low Reynolds numbers, these turbulent patches tend to suddenly decay, following a memoryless process typical of rare events. How far in advance their decay can be forecasted is still unknown. We perform massive ensembles of simulations of pipe flow and a reduced order model of shear flows (Moehlis et al. 2004) and determine the first moment in time at which decay becomes fully predictable, subject to a given magnitude of the uncertainty on the flow state. By extensively sampling the chaotic sets, we find that, as one goes back in time from the point of inevitable decay, predictability degrades at greatly varying speeds. However, a well-defined (average) rate of predictability loss can be computed. This rate is independent of the uncertainty and also of the type of rare event, i.e. it applies to decay and to other extreme events. We leverage our databases to define thresholds that approximately separate phase-space regions of distinct decay predictability. Our study has implications for the development of predictive models, in particular it sets their theoretical limits. It also opens avenues to study the causes of extreme events in turbulent flows: a state which is predictable to produce an extreme event, it is causal to it from a probabilistic perspective.</description>

      <title>Surrogate Model for Heat Transfer Prediction in Impinging Jet Arrays using Dynamic Inlet/Outlet and Flow Rate Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a surrogate model designed to predict the Nusselt number distribution in an enclosed impinging jet arrays, where each jet function independently and where jets can be transformed from inlets to outlets, leading to a vast number of possible flow arrangements. While computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations can model heat transfer with high fidelity, their cost prohibits real-time application such as model-based temperature control. To address this, we generate a CNN-based surrogate model that can predict the Nusselt distribution in real time. We train it with data from implicit large eddy computational fluid dynamics simulations (Re &lt; 2,000). We train two distinct models, one for a five by one array of jets (83 simulations) and one for a three by three array of jets (100 simulations). We introduce a method to extrapolate predictions to higher Reynolds numbers (Re &lt; 10,000) using a correlation-based scaling. The surrogate models achieve high accuracy, with a normalized mean average error below 2% on validation data for the five by one surrogate model and 0.6% for the three by three surrogate model. Experimental validation confirms the model's predictive capabilities. This work provides a foundation for model-based control strategies in advanced thermal management applications.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the stability of an immersed elastic surface using the method of regularized Stokeslets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A linear stability analysis of an elastic surface immersed in a viscous fluid is presented. The coupled system is modeled using the method of regularized Stokeslets (MRS), a Lagrangian method for simulating fluid-structure interaction at zero Reynolds number. The linearized system is solved in a doubly periodic domain in a 3D fluid. The eigenvalues determine the theoretical critical time step for numerical stability for a forward Euler time integration, which are then verified numerically across several regularization functions, elastic models, and parameter choices. New doubly periodic regularized Stokeslets are presented, allowing for comparison of the stability properties of different regularization functions. The stability results for a common regularization function are approximated by a power law relating the regularization parameter and the surface discretization for two different elastic models. This relationship is empirically shown to hold in the different setting of a finite surface in a bulk fluid.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06239v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study low Reynolds number turbulence in a suspension of polar, extensile, self-propelled inertial swimmers. We review the bend and splay mechanisms that destabilize an ordered flock. The suspension is always unstable to bend perturbations. Using a minimal 1D model, we show that the splay-stable to splay-unstable transition occurs via a supercritical Hopf bifurcation. We perform high-resolution numerical simulations in 2D to study the varieties of turbulence present in this system transitioning from defect turbulence to concentration-wave turbulence depending on a single non-dimensional number, denoting the ratio of the splay-concentration wavespeed to the swimmer motility.</description>

Abstract: We present a microfluidic device that enables trapping, analysis, and on-demand release of individual microparticles through membrane deformation driven by pneumatic actuation. Inspired by Pachinko-style architectures, the system features an array of traps supported by a deformable PDMS membrane, actuated via pressure control in a pneumatic chamber bonded above. Unlike conventional rigid designs, our configuration enhances membrane flexibility using a wide elliptical cavity and suspended rectilinear flow guides. Device characterization was performed using confocal microscopy to measure membrane deformation under controlled negative pressure. The displacement profiles obtained were compared to several theoretical models, showing strong agreement with a thick-membrane approximation. Vertical membrane displacement exceeded 120 $\mu$m under -100 mbar, allowing release of 80 $\mu$m particles. We demonstrated rapid and repeatable particle trapping and release by applying coordinated fluidic and pneumatic pressures. The system was further integrated with a Python-based control interface using $\mu$Manager libraries, enabling automated sequences of particle trapping, imaging, and release. The protocol includes automated priming to eliminate air bubbles in the microchannels. This work introduces a robust and fully automated microfluidic platform capable of reversible microparticle immobilization. It is well suited for applications such as high-throughput screening, mechanobiology, or real-time imaging workflows that require precise control over individual object handling.</description>

      <title>From large-eddy simulations to deep learning: A U-net model for fast urban canopy flow predictions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of wind flow fields in urban canopies is crucial for ensuring pedestrian comfort, safety, and sustainable urban design. Traditional methods using wind tunnels and Computational Fluid Dynamics, such as Large-Eddy Simulations (LES), are limited by high costs, computational demands, and time requirements. This study presents a deep neural network (DNN) approach for fast and accurate predictions of urban wind flow fields, reducing computation time from an order of 10 hours on 32 CPUs for one LES evaluation to an order of 1 second on a single GPU using the DNN model. We employ a U-Net architecture trained on LES data including 252 synthetic urban configurations at seven wind directions ($0^{o}$ to $90^{o}$ in $15^{o}$ increments). The model predicts two key quantities of interest: mean velocity magnitude and streamwise turbulence intensity, at multiple heights within the urban canopy. The U-net uses 2D building representations augmented with signed distance functions and their gradients as inputs, forming a $256\times256\times9$ tensor. In addition, a Spatial Attention Module is used for feature transfer through skip connections. The loss function combines the root-mean-square error of predictions, their gradient magnitudes, and L2 regularization. Model evaluation on 50 test cases demonstrates high accuracy with an overall mean relative error of 9.3% for velocity magnitude and 5.2% for turbulence intensity. This research shows the potential of deep learning approaches to provide fast, accurate urban wind assessments essential for creating comfortable and safe urban environments.

      <title>Heat Transport and Dissipation in 2.5D Rotating Internally Heated and Cooled Convection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Models of astrophysical convection, such as mixing length theory, typically assume that the heat transport is independent of microphysical diffusivities. Such 'diffusion-free' behaviour is, however, not observed in numerical simulations employing standard fixed-flux or fixed-temperature boundary conditions, except possibly in extreme parameter regimes that are computationally expensive to achieve. Recent numerical and experimental work has suggested that internally heated and cooled convection can exhibit diffusion-free scalings in more numerically accessible regimes. Here, we present direct numerical simulations of 2.5D Cartesian rotating thermal convection driven by an internal heating and cooling function. The use of distributed heating and cooling functions alleviates sharp thermal boundary layers that would otherwise be present, allowing the flows to be simulated with modest computational resources. We show that for high Rossby numbers this set-up recovers mixing length theory scalings for the heat transport. The velocity amplitudes, in contrast, are observed to display diffusion-limited scalings. By comparing against boundary driven rotating convection, we show that internally heated cases have a larger fraction of their thermal dissipation occuring in the bulk of the fluid. We suggest this is connected to the increased convective efficiency observed in these cases. Our results indicate that 2.5D internally heated convection can be used as a computationally inexpensive test-bed to investigate some aspects of diffusion-free heat transport.</description>

      <title>On local and non-local energy transfers in Hall magnetohydrodynamic turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A systematic study of inertial energy cascade in three-dimensional Hall magnetohydrodynamic turbulence is conducted to probe into the locality of energy conserving triads and the subsequent transfers. Using direct numerical simulations, we calculate the shell-to-shell energy transfer rates corresponding to b-to-b (magnetic to magnetic) and j-to-b (current to magnetic) channels due to the Hall term, and convincingly show that both channels comprise of a combination of local and non-local energy transfers. A local inverse transfer is consistently observed at all scales of the b-to-b channel whereas for the j-to-b channel, the transfer due to local interactions shows a transition from a weak inverse to a strong direct cascade across the Hall scale. Calculating mediator-specific transfer rates, we also conclude that a considerable amount of local energy transfer is mediated by the non-local triads, especially at small-scales of j-to-b transfer. Assuming power-laws for the modal fields, we offer heuristic arguments for some of our observed results. The present study captures the intricate dynamics of energy transfer due to the Hall term and hence can be used to develop more insightful analytical models (shell models for example) for Hall magnetohydrodynamic cascade and to carefully segregate the local and the non-local heating in the space plasmas.</description>

      <title>The interplay of inertia and elasticity in polymeric flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.14752v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Addition of polymers modifies a turbulent flow in a manner that depends non-trivially on the interplay of fluid inertia, quantified by the Reynolds number $Re$, and the elasticity of the dissolved polymers, given by the Deborah number $De$. We use direct numerical simulations to study polymeric flows at different $Re$ and $De$ numbers, and uncover various features of their dynamics. Polymeric flows exhibit a multiscaling energy spectrum that is a function of $Re$ and $De$, owing to different dominant contributions to the total energy flux across scales. This behaviour is also manifested in the real space scaling of structure functions. We also shed light on how the addition of polymers results in slowing down the fluid non-linear cascade resulting in a depleted flux, as velocity fluctuations with less energy persist for longer times in polymeric flows. These velocity fluctuations exhibit intermittent, large deviations similar to that in a Newtonian flow at large $Re$, but differ more and more as $Re$ becomes smaller. This observation is further supported by the statistics of fluid energy dissipation in polymeric flows, whose distributions collapse on to the Newtonian at large $Re$, but increasingly differ from it as $Re$ decreases. We also show that polymer dissipation is significantly less intermittent compared to fluid dissipation, and even less so when elasticity becomes large. Polymers, on an average, dissipate more energy when they are stretched more, which happens in extensional regions of the flow. However, owing to vortex stretching, regions with large rotation rates also correlate with large polymer extensions, albeit to a relatively less degree than extensional regions.</description>

      <title>Scatterless interferences: Delay of laminar-to-turbulent flow transition by a lattice of subsurface phonons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18835v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Wave interference has historically relied on scattering objects placed within the wave domain. Here, we introduce a fundamentally new mechanism: scatterless interference induced by a lattice of subsurface phonon motion beneath a smooth wall interfacing with a transitioning boundary-layer flow. The subsurface consists of a wall-parallel lattice of wall-normal frequency-dependent phononic structural units, each designed to respond to local flow perturbations in an out-of-phase manner, suppressing them at the point of interaction. Collectively, the lattice induces interference effects that cause the kinetic energy of flow instabilities to decay downstream, thereby delaying laminar-to-turbulent transition. To guide the design of the phononic subsurface lattice, a Bloch-wave unit-cell analysis is developed for the flow perturbations, and direct numerical simulations validate the concept. This work establishes scatterless interference as a distinct physical phenomenon and represents a paradigm shift in the design of aerodynamic and hydrodynamic surfaces--moving beyond streamlined shaping to leveraging subsurface phonon engineering for drag reduction and enhanced performance.</description>

      <title>Bubble-assisted micromixing via thermally excited intrinsic air within microfluidic systems</title>

Abstract: The micromixing process in microfluidic devices is of central importance in quite a few applications, with microfluidic studies on carbon capture and environmental monitoring being two examples. High surface area to volume ratio in microscale flows outweighs the role of interfacial tension manipulation by means of introducing a secondary phase to the main flow in order to augment the typically diffusion-dominant mass transfer operation. In this paper, we introduce an easily integrable continuous flow micromixing scheme implemented on a simple Y-type microchannel based on thermally excited intrinsic air within microchannel. Thanks to the direct contact between the sputtered thin platinum microheater and the co-flowing streams, trapped air in the liquid and/or tiny crevices is employed to generate elongated bubbles with a millisecond lifespan, consuming less than 0.4 W of power and thereby enabling homogeneous mixing. The performance of the micromixer is characterized in terms of the mixing index (MI), and it is shown that immediately ahead of the microheater, the MI exceeds 95% for side-by-side flowing of water at different overall flowrates, namely 4, 10, and 20 uL/min. Interpreting the experimental results, supplemented by scaling arguments, we quantitatively describe the ephemeral role of emerging elongated bubbles in the micromixing process in which the Marangoni as well as Weber numbers are recognized as the characteristic local non-dimensional groups while the enhancing role of tiny daughter microbubbles on the micromixing downstream of the microchannel can be reflected in the Peclet and the Capillary numbers.</description>

      <title>Accurate calculation of bubble and droplet properties in diffuse-interface two-phase simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02420v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the challenge of accurately calculating droplet/bubble properties (e.g., volume, number) in diffuse-interface two-phase flow simulations. Currently, flood-fill algorithms can truncate a significant portion of the volume of droplets/bubbles contained within the diffuse interface region or artificially merge multiple droplets/bubbles. This error is also dependent on the volume fraction cutoff value, which is typically chosen to be 0.5 arbitrarily, in the flood-fill algorithms. We propose a simple volume-correction approach that incorporates an analytical approximation of the truncated volume to correct for the missing droplet/bubble volumes. This proposed method results in accurately recovering the dispersed phase volumes with minimal volume error over a wide range of volume fraction cutoff values; and hence, can also accurately recover the number of droplets/bubbles. This can be a valuable tool for accurate calculation of drop/bubble size distributions for analysis and for Eulerian-to-Lagrangian conversion of the dispersed phase in multi-scale modeling approaches.</description>

      <title>Direct Flow Simulations with Implicit Neural Representation of Complex Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08724v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Implicit neural representations have emerged as a powerful approach for encoding complex geometries as continuous functions. These implicit models are widely used in computer vision and 3D content creation, but their integration into scientific computing workflows, such as finite element or finite volume simulations, remains limited. One reason is that conventional simulation pipelines require explicit geometric inputs (meshes), forcing INR-based shapes to be converted to meshes--a step that introduces approximation errors, computational overhead, and significant manual effort. Immersed boundary methods partially alleviate this issue by allowing simulations on background grids without body-fitted meshes. However, they still require an explicit boundary description and can suffer from numerical artifacts, such as sliver cut cells. The shifted boundary method (SBM) eliminates the need for explicit geometry by using grid-aligned surrogate boundaries, making it inherently compatible with implicit shape representations. Here, we present a framework that directly couples neural implicit geometries with SBM to perform high-fidelity fluid flow simulations without any intermediate mesh generation. By leveraging neural network inference, our approach computes the surrogate boundary and distance vectors required by SBM on-the-fly directly from the INR, thus completely bypassing traditional geometry processing. We demonstrate this approach on canonical 2D and 3D flow benchmarks (lid-driven cavity flows) and complex geometries (gyroids, the Stanford bunny, and AI-generated shapes), achieving simulation accuracy comparable to conventional mesh-based methods. This work highlights a novel pathway for integrating AI-driven geometric representations into computational physics, establishing INRs as a versatile and scalable tool for simulations and removing a long-standing bottleneck in geometry handling.</description>
