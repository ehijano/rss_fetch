      <title>The resource theory of causal influence and knowledge of causal influence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding and quantifying causal relationships between variables is essential for reasoning about the physical world. In this work, we develop a resource-theoretic framework to do so. Here, we focus on the simplest nontrivial setting -- two variables that are causally ordered, meaning that the first has the potential to influence the second, without hidden confounding. First, we introduce the resource theory that directly quantifies causal influence of a functional dependence in this setting and show that the problem of deciding convertibility of resources and identifying a complete set of monotones has a relatively straightforward solution. Following this, we introduce the resource theory that arises naturally when one has uncertainty about the functional dependence. We describe a linear program for deciding the question of whether one resource (i.e., state of knowledge about the functional dependence) can be converted to another. Then, we focus on the case where the variables are binary. In this case, we identify a triple of monotones that are complete in the sense that they capture the partial order over the set of all resources, and we provide an interpretation of each.</description>

      <title>STARK denoises spatial transcriptomics images via adaptive regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10994v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an approach to denoising spatial transcriptomics images that is particularly effective for uncovering cell identities in the regime of ultra-low sequencing depths, and also allows for interpolation of gene expression. The method -- Spatial Transcriptomics via Adaptive Regularization and Kernels (STARK) -- augments kernel ridge regression with an incrementally adaptive graph Laplacian regularizer. In each iteration, we (1) perform kernel ridge regression with a fixed graph to update the image, and (2) update the graph based on the new image. The kernel ridge regression step involves reducing the infinite dimensional problem on a space of images to finite dimensions via a modified representer theorem. Starting with a purely spatial graph, and updating it as we improve our image makes the graph more robust to noise in low sequencing depth regimes. We show that the aforementioned approach optimizes a block-convex objective through an alternating minimization scheme wherein the sub-problems have closed form expressions that are easily computed. This perspective allows us to prove convergence of the iterates to a stationary point of this non-convex objective. Statistically, such stationary points converge to the ground truth with rate $\mathcal{O}(R^{-1/2})$ where $R$ is the number of reads. In numerical experiments on real spatial transcriptomics data, the denoising performance of STARK, evaluated in terms of label transfer accuracy, shows consistent improvement over the competing methods tested.</description>

      <title>The Cumulative Residual Mathai--Haubold Entropy and its Non-parametric Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10997v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the cumulative residual Mathai--Haubold entropy (CRMHE) and investigate its properties. We then propose a dynamic counterpart, the dynamic cumulative residual Mathai--Haubold entropy (DCRMHE), and establish its uniqueness in characterizing the distribution function. Non-parametric estimators for the CRMHE and DCRMHE are developed based on the kernel density estimation of the survival function. The efficacy of the estimators is assessed through a comprehensive Monte Carlo simulation study. The relevance of the proposed DCRMHE estimator is illustrated using two real-world datasets: on the failure times of 70 aircraft windshields and failure times of 40 randomly selected mechanical switches.</description>

      <title>Gaussian random field's anisotropy using excursion sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11085v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of detecting and estimating the anisotropy of a stationary real-valued random field from a single realization of one of its excursion sets. This setting is challenging as it relies on observing a binary image without prior knowledge of the field's mean, variance, or the specific threshold value.
  Our first contribution is to propose a generalization of Caba\~na's contour method to arbitrary dimensions by analyzing the Palm distribution of normal vectors along the excursion set boundaries. We demonstrate that the anisotropy parameters can be recovered by solving a smooth and strongly convex optimization problem involving the eigenvalues of the empirical covariance matrix of these normal vectors.
  Our second main contribution is a new, model-agnostic statistical test for isotropy in dimension two. We introduce a statistic based on the contour method which is asymptotically distributed as a chi-squared variable with two degrees of freedom under the null hypothesis of quasi-isotropy. Unlike existing methods based on Lipschitz-Killing curvatures, this procedure does not require knowledge of the random field's covariance structure.
  Extensive numerical experiments show that our test is well-calibrated and more powerful than model-based alternatives as well as that the estimation of the anisotropy parameters, including the directions, is robust and efficient. Finally, we apply this framework to test the quasi-isotropy of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) using the Planck data release 3 mission.</description>

      <title>Universal entrywise eigenvector fluctuations in delocalized spiked matrix models and asymptotics of rounded spectral algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11785v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the distribution of the top eigenvector $\widehat{v}$ of a spiked matrix model of the form $H = \theta vv^* + W$, in the supercritical regime where $H$ has an outlier eigenvalue of comparable magnitude to $\|W\|$. We show that, if $v$ is sufficiently delocalized, then the distribution of the individual entries of $\widehat{v}$ (not, we emphasize, merely the inner product $\langle \widehat{v}, v\rangle$) is universal over a large class of generalized Wigner matrices $W$ having independent entries, depending only on the first two moments of the distributions of the entries of $W$. This complements the observation of Capitaine and Donati-Martin (2018) that these distributions are not universal when $v$ is instead sufficiently localized. Further, for $W$ having entrywise variances close to constant and thus resembling a Wigner matrix, we show by comparing to the case of $W$ drawn from the Gaussian orthogonal or unitary ensembles that averages of entrywise functions of $\widehat{v}$ behave as they would if $\widehat{v}$ had Gaussian fluctuations around a suitable multiple of $v$. We apply these results to study spectral algorithms followed by rounding procedures in dense stochastic block models and synchronization problems over the cyclic and circle groups, obtaining the first precise asymptotic characterizations of the error rates of such algorithms.</description>

Abstract: We present a new method of linear regression based on principal components using Hilbert-space-valued covariates. We develop a computationally efficient approach to estimation and derive asymptotic theory for the regression parameter estimates under mild assumptions.

      <title>Simple and Sharp Generalization Bounds via Lifting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18682v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop an information-theoretic framework for bounding the supremum of stochastic processes, offering a simpler and sharper alternative to classical chaining and slicing arguments for generalization bounds. The key idea is a lifting argument that produces information-theoretic analogues of empirical process bounds, such as Dudley's entropy integral. Lifting introduces permutation symmetry, yielding sharp bounds when the classical Dudley integral is loose. This gives a simple proof of the majorizing measure theorem via the sharpness of Dudley's entropy integral for stationary processes, a result known well before the proof of the majorizing measure theorem. Furthermore, the information-theoretic formulation provides soft versions of classical localized complexity bounds in generalization theory, but is simpler and does not require the slicing argument. We apply this approach to empirical risk minimization over Sobolev ellipsoids, obtaining sharp convergence rates in settings where previous methods are suboptimal.</description>

      <title>Stopping Rules for Monte Carlo Methods of Martingale Difference Type</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.22690v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish a practical and easy-to-implement sequential stopping rule for the martingale central limit theorem, focusing on Monte Carlo methods for estimating the mean of a non-iid sequence of martingale difference type. Starting with an impractical scheme based on the standard martingale central limit theorem, we progressively address its limitations from implementation perspectives in the non-asymptotic regime. Along the way, we compare the proposed schemes with their counterparts in the asymptotic regime. The developed framework has potential applications in various domains. Numerical results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed stopping rules in terms of reliability and complexity.</description>

      <title>An Approximate Bayesian Approach to Optimal Input Signal Design for System Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04425v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The design of informatively rich input signals is essential for accurate system identification, yet classical Fisher-information-based methods are inherently local and often inadequate in the presence of significant model uncertainty and nonlinearity. This paper develops a Bayesian approach that uses the mutual information (MI) between observations and parameters as the utility function. To address the computational intractability of the MI, we maximize a tractable MI lower bound. The method is then applied to the design of an input signals for the identification of quasi-linear stochastic dynamical systems. Evaluating the MI lower bound requires inversion of large covariance matrices whose dimensions scale with the number of data points $N$. To overcome this problem, an algorithm that reduces the dimension of the matrices to be inverted by a factor of $N$ is developed, making the approach feasible for long experiments. The proposed Bayesian method is compared with the average D-optimal design method, a semi-Bayesian approach, and its advantages are demonstrated. The effectiveness of the proposed method is further illustrated through four examples, including atomic sensor models, where the input signals that generates large MI are especially important for reducing the estimation error.</description>
