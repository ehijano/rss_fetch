      <title>Hybrid Monetary Ecosystems: Integrating Stablecoins and Fiat in the Future of Currency Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With market capitalization exceeding USD 200 billion as of early 2025, stablecoins have evolved from a crypto-focused innovation into a vital component of the global monetary structure. This paper identifies the characteristics of stablecoins from an analytical perspective and investigates the role of stablecoins in forming hybrid monetary ecosystems where public (fiat, CBDC) and private (USDC, USDT, DAI) monies coexist. Through econometric analysis with multiple models, we find that stablecoins maintain strong peg stability, while each type also exhibiting distinctive responses to market variables such as trading volume and capitalization, depending on the mechanisms behind. We introduce a hybrid system design that proposes a two-layer structure where private stablecoin issuers are backed by central bank reserves, ensuring uniformity, security, and programmability. This model merges the advantages of decentralized finance and payment innovation while utilizing the Federal Reserve's institutional trust. A case study on the 2023 SVB-USDC depeg event illustrates how such a hybrid system could prevent panic-induced instability through transparent reserves, secured liquidity, and interoperable assets. Ultimately, this research concludes that a hybrid monetary model not only enhances financial inclusivity, scalability, and dollar utility in digital ecosystems but also strengthens systemic resilience, offering a credible blueprint for future digital dollar architectures.</description>

      <title>Pricing Carbon Allowance Options on Futures: Insights from High-Frequency Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17490v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Leveraging a unique dataset of carbon futures option prices traded on the ICE market from December 2015 until December 2020, we present the results from an unprecedented calibration exercise. Within a multifactor stochastic volatility framework with jumps, we employ a three-dimensional pricing kernel compensating for equity and variance components' risk to derive an analytically tractable and numerically practical approach to pricing. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to provide an estimate of the equity and variance risk premia for the carbon futures option market. We gain insights into daily option and futures dynamics by exploiting the information from tick-by-tick futures trade data. Decomposing the realized measure of futures volatility into continuous and jump components, we employ them as auxiliary variables for estimating futures dynamics via indirect inference. Our approach provides a realistic description of carbon futures price, volatility, and jump dynamics and an insightful understanding of the carbon option market.</description>
