      <title>Cosmological functions and their relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the non-metric gravity proposed by K. Krasnov, this is a theory in which the scalar constraint of the Ashtekar's formalism is modified in such way that the cosmological constant is replaced by a cosmological function that depends of the canonical variables $A_{a}{}^{i}$ and $E_{i}{}^{a}$, the General Relativity (GR) is the particular case when the cosmological function is a constant. Some years ago inspired by this theory Rosas-Rodr\'iguez proposed two cosmological functions, one for the Ashtekar's formalism and the other for the ADM formalism. In this paper we show that this cosmological functions are related thought the three-dimensional Ricci scalar.</description>

      <title>Tripartite measurement uncertainty in Schwarzschild space-time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effect of Hawking radiation on tripartite measurement uncertainty in a Schwarzschild black hole background is analyzed in this study. Two scenarios are examined: in the first, quantum memory particles approach a Schwarzschild black hole and are positioned near the event horizon, while the particle being measured remains in the asymptotically flat region. In the second scenario, the measured particle moves toward the black hole, and the quantum memories stay in the asymptotically flat region. The study considers two initial quantum states: GHZ and W states. The findings reveal that in both cases, measurement uncertainty increases steadily with rising Hawking temperature. When comparing the GHZ and W states, the GHZ state initially exhibits lower measurement uncertainty at low Hawking temperatures than the W state, indicating greater resilience to Hawking radiation. Additionally, when the quantum memories remain in the asymptotically flat region while the measured particle falls toward the black hole, the uncertainties for GHZ and W states do not align at high temperatures. The GHZ state consistently demonstrates lower measurement uncertainty, showcasing its superior robustness against Hawking radiation.</description>

      <title>Fast wavelet basis search for generic gravitational wave bursts in Pulsar Timing Array data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As we move into an era of more sensitive pulsar timing array data sets, we may be able to resolve individual gravitational wave sources from the stochastic gravitational wave background. While some of these sources, like orbiting massive black hole binaries, have well-defined waveform models, there could also be signals present with unknown morphology. This motivates the search for generic gravitational-wave bursts in a signal-agnostic way. However, these searches are computationally prohibitive due to the expansive parameter space. In this paper we present QuickBurst, an algorithm with a re-defined likelihood that lets us expedite Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling for a subset of the signal parameters by avoiding repeated calculations of costly inner products. This results in an overall speedup factor of $\sim$200 on realistic simulated datasets, which is sufficient to make generic gravitational-wave burst searches feasible on current and growing pulsar timing array datasets.</description>

      <title>On the maximally symmetric vacua of generic Lovelock gravities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We survey elementary features of Lovelock gravity and its maximally symmetric vacuum solutions. The latter is solely determined by the real roots of a dimension-dependent polynomial. We also recover the static spherically symmetric (black hole) solutions of Lovelock gravity using Palais' symmetric criticality principle. We show how to linearize the generic field equations of Lovelock models about a given maximally symmetric vacuum, which turns out to factorize into the product of yet another dimension-dependent polynomial and the linearized Einstein tensor about the relevant background. We also describe how to compute conserved charges using linearized field equations along with the relevant background Killing isometries. We further describe and discuss the special vacua which are defined by the simultaneous vanishing of the aforementioned polynomials.</description>

      <title>The quasinormal modes, pseudospectrum and time evolution of Proca fields in qOS-dS spacetime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the quasinormal modes, pseudospectrum and time evolution of a massive vector field around a quantum corrected black hole in de-Sitter spacetime. We start by parameterization and using orthonormal tetrads to get the effective potential. Methodologically we use the hyperboloidal framework together with discretizing the non-selfadjoint operator through Chebyshev-Gauss-Labatto grid to attain the QNMs. We explore the parametric instability of QNMs caused by quantum correction, cosmological constant and Proca mass, and these three factors show very different influences on the QNMs' migration flow. On the other hand, we discuss the instability of QNMs with arbitrary-shape perturbation and the effectiveness of numerical results through pseudospectrum. We use high frequency approximation to attain the expression of the time domain Green function and clarify the origin of two different stages in time evolution. Through numerical methods we confirm that no power-law late time tail is expected, and the possible impact on time evolution caused by quantum correction is discussed.</description>

      <title>Shadow behavior of an EMSG charged black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent shadow images of Sgr A and M87 captured by Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) collaboration confirms the existence of black holes or their possible alternatives in the center of galaxies. On the other hand, the new image of Sgr A in polarized light suggests a Magnetic field spiraling at the Edge of the Milky Way Central Black Hole. Due to the gravitational lensing effect, the bending of light in the background geometry of the black hole casts a shadow. In recent years, black holes and their properties have been vastly studied in the framework of General Relativity and other modified theories of gravity. One of the possibilities to generalize GR is Energy Momentum Squared Gravity (EMSG). It is important to mention that EMSG modifies all matter field equations, adding some non linear terms to Maxwell equations. EMSG theory as a modified theory of gravity predicts an asymptotically de Sitter charged black hole whose shadow cast and other related characteristics have not been examined yet. Hence we consider the EMSG charged black hole and investigate the shadow shape of this kind of black hole solution in confrontation with EHT results. In the case of non linear electrodynamics, the path of the photon is null on some effective metric. By deriving the effective metric of an EMSG charged black hole we study the null geodesics of the effective metric in the Hamilton Jacobi method. we find the photon orbits and compute the shadow size of this black hole. Then we examine how electric charge and the coupling constant of the EMSG affect the shadow size of the black hole in a positively accelerated expanding universe (with a positive cosmological constant). We explore the viable values of these parameters constrained by EHT data by comparing the shadow radius of an EMSG charged black hole with the shadow size of Sgr A.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the present paper, we outline and expound the fundamental and novel qualitative-cum-philosophical premises, principles, ideas, concepts, constructions and results that originate from our ongoing research project of applying the conceptual panoply and the technical machinery of Abstract Differential Geometry (ADG) to various persistently outstanding issues in Quantum Gravity (QG) research. At the end of the paper, we discuss the potential philosophical repercussions of two possible future research routes that the main stream of our applications of ADG to QG may bifurcate towards in view of three independent, but overlapping, research papers that are currently under development.</description>

      <title>No Warm Inflation From Sphaleron Heating With a Vanilla Axion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: At finite temperature, the coupling of an axion to non-Abelian gauge fields causes dissipation due to sphaleron heating. This mechanism is ideally suited for realizing warm inflation since it can lead to large thermal friction while preserving the flatness of the potential. We show, however, that requiring standard properties of an axion $-$ in particular a discrete shift symmetry and a potential generated non-perturbatively by instanton effects $-$ excludes the strong regime of warm slow-roll inflation, in which thermal friction dominates. The derivation of this result does not require any phenomenological input. While non-minimal (axion-like) models provide a way out, sphaleron heating with a standard axion is capable of enabling the weak regime of warm inflation.</description>

      <title>Diving inside holographic metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07748v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the gravitational dual of a fermionic field theory at finite temperature and charge density in two spatial dimensions, subject to a deformation by a relevant scalar operator. This makes a $(3+1)$-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell system coupled to a free fermion fluid, known as an electron cloud, undergo a holographic renormalization group flow. The inner (Cauchy) horizon is destroyed and the near-singularity metric instead adopts the form of a positive-$p_t$ Kasner cosmology, signaling the collapse of the Einstein-Rosen bridge. Previous studies have suggested that this collapse hinders direct probing of the singularity. Nonetheless, we propose and compute several CFT observables that characterize the interior and near-singularity geometries. These include the thermal $a$-function, which decays with a specific power of $p_t$ as nearly all CFT degrees of freedom are integrated out, and two-point correlators for neutral and charged operators, with the latter directly probing the singularity despite the positive-$p_t$. We also calculate characteristic velocities related to entanglement and complexity growth in the time-evolved thermofield double state, as well as the butterfly effect indicative of operator spreading. Notably, the deformed electron cloud features a Lifshitz IR fixed point and an additional Kasner trans-IR fixed point, absent in neutral RG flows.</description>

      <title>Particle motion and accretion disk around rotating accelerating black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07762v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the motion of test particles and the properties of accretion disks around rotating, accelerating black hole spacetimes with non-zero cosmological constants. To do so, we explore the impact of both rotation and acceleration on massive particle dynamics in motion around these configurations. In this respect, we derive the geodesic equations in the Pleba{\'n}ski-Demia{\'n}ski spacetime and analyse the characteristics of circular orbits, including the innermost and outermost stable circular orbits. Accordingly, we find that the acceleration parameter significantly influences the radii and angular momenta of these orbits. Further, we examine the precession of non-circular orbits and find that the precession is in the same direction as the black hole rotation regardless of the direction of the black hole spin. We also investigate the thermal spectra of geometrically thin, optically thick accretion disks described by the Novikov-Thorne model. We consider both co-rotating and counter-rotating disks and show that the radiative flux and luminosity are significantly larger for co-rotating disks. We compare the spectral features and luminosity of accretion disks around accelerating black holes with those around non-accelerating Kerr black holes, revealing that acceleration generally reduces the luminosity and flux of emitted light. Our results provide insights into the complex interplay between black hole acceleration, rotation, and the surrounding accretion disk dynamics.</description>

      <title>Probing non-minimal coupling through super-horizon instability and secondary gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07767v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the impact of scalar fluctuations ($\chi$) non-minimally coupled to gravity, $\xi\chi^2 R$, as a potential source of secondary gravitational waves (SGWs). Our study reveals that when reheating EoS $\wre &gt; 1/3$ and $\xi \gtrsim 1/6$, the super-horizon modes of scalar field experience a \textit{Tachyonic instability} during the reheating phase. Particularly for $\xi &gt;1$ such instability causes substantial growth in the scalar field amplitude leading to pronounced production of SGWs in an intermediate-frequency range that is strong enough to be detected by future gravitational wave detectors. Such growth in super-horizon modes of the scalar field and associated GW production may have a significant effect on the strength of the tensor fluctuation at the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) scales (parametrized by $r$) and the number of relativistic degrees of freedom (parametrized by $\dneff$) at the time of CMB decoupling. To prevent such overproduction, the PLANCK constraints on tensor-to-scalar ratio $r \leq 0.036$ and $\dneff \leq 0.284$ yield a strong upper bound on the value of $\xi$ depending upon the value of $\wre$ and reheating temperature $\Tre$. Taking into account all the observational constraints we found the value of $\xi$ should be $ \lesssim 4.0$ for any value of reheating temperature within $10^{-2} \lesssim \Tre \lesssim 10^{14}$ GeV, reheating equation of state within $ 1/2 \leq\wre \leq 1$, and for a wide range of inflationary energy scales. However, for $\wre &lt; 1/3$, $\xi$ is found to be unconstrained by any known observation. Finally, we identify the parameter regions in $(\Tre,\xi)$ plane which can be probed by the upcoming GW experiments namely BBO, DECIGO, LISA, and ET.</description>

Finally, we consider the possibility of using this type of spin-of-light gyroscope to measure gravitomagnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Is Lattice Quantum Gravity Asymptotically Safe? Making contact between Causal Dynamical Triangulations and the Functional Renormalization Group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compare the effective action of the scale factor obtained from lattice quantum gravity (in the form of Causal Dynamical Triangulations (CDT)) to the corresponding effective action obtained from the simplest Functional Renormalization Group (FRG) calculation. In this way, we can identify the generic infinite four-volume limit of the lattice theory in the so-called de Sitter phase with the Gaussian fixed-point limit or the IR fixed-point limit obtained by FRG. We also show how to identify a putative UV lattice gravity fixed point. Our Monte Carlo simulations of CDT allow for the existence of such a UV fixed point, although the data precision does not yet provide a proof of its existence. The concept of a correlation length relevant for the lattice gravity fixed points is argued to be different from the concept of correlation lengths encountered in field theories in a fixed spacetime background.</description>

      <title>Perturbing a quantum black hole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the analytic structure of correlators in the field theory dual to the quantum Ba\~{n}ados-Teitelboim-Zanelli (qBTZ) black hole, a braneworld model incorporating exact backreaction from quantum conformal matter. We first compute the quasi-normal mode (QNM) spectrum of operators with dimension $\Delta$ and spin $s=0,\pm 1/2$. The leading QNMs and their overtones display qualitatively different behavior depending on the branch of qBTZ solution; branch 1 is a conical singularity dressed with a horizon while branch 2 is a quantum-corrected BTZ black hole. Hence the relaxation of probe matter distinguishes the type of singularity cloaked by the horizon. We then turn to pole-skipping locations where Green's functions are not unique. At these points, frequency is proportional to temperature, but momentum exhibits complex temperature dependence due to quantum effects. Under the assumption that the pole-skipping point closest to the origin reflects quantum chaos, we infer the likely behavior of the quantum Lyapunov exponent and butterfly velocity in the dual theory. Finally, we examine pole collisions in complex momentum space, showing that quantum corrections imprint a unique signature on the analytic structure of the poles in retarded Green's functions, resulting in level-crossing phenomena that differ notably from the level-touching phenomena in the uncorrected BTZ geometry.</description>

      <title>Spectral Projections for Density Matrices in Quantum Field Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the spectral projection of density matrices in quantum field theory. With appropriate regularization, the spectral projectors of density matrices are expected to be well-defined. These projectors can be obtained using the Riesz projection formula, which allows us to compute both the density of eigenvalues and the expectation values of local operators in the projected states. We find that there are universal divergent terms in the expectation value of the stress energy tensor, where the coefficients depend universally on the density of eigenvalues and a function that describes the dependence of eigenvalues on boundary location. Using projection states, we can construct a series of new states in quantum field theories and discuss their general properties, focusing on the holographic aspects. We observe that quantum fluctuations are suppressed in the semiclassical limit. We also demonstrate that the fixed area state, previously constructed using gravitational path integrals, can be constructed by suitably superposition of appromiate amount of projection states. Additionally, we apply spectral projection to non-Hermitian operators, such as transition matrices, to obtain their eigenvalues and densities. Finally, we highlight potential applications of spectral projections, including the construction of new density and transition matrices and the understanding of superpositions of geometric states.</description>

      <title>Hydrostatic equilibrium of X-ray gas in HMG: four representative cases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08102v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) was originally proposed to model galaxy rotation curves without dark matter. However, MOND presents difficulties in explaining the Radial Acceleration Relation (RAR) observed in galaxy clusters, and moreover, it does not completely eliminate the need for dark matter, since it requires using sterile neutrinos to explain the observed hydrostatic equilibrium of the hot gas. Hyperconical Modified Gravity (HMG) offers a relativistic framework that recovers the success of MOND in galaxy rotation curves as a natural particular case, and it could potentially reconcile the above discrepancies without invoking any type of dark matter. This Letter analyses the performance of the HMG model for hydrostatic equilibrium in four representative systems: groups of NGC 533 and NGC 5044 galaxies, and clusters of Abell 2717 and Abell 2029. Specifically, we used high-resolution X-ray data with which gas density, temperature, and mass profiles were previously derived to constrain modified gravity models. Our results show that the hydrostatic equilibrium in the four systems is naturally adjusted to the HMG model without the need for fitting parameters or adding sterile neutrinos, which are required for MOND theories.</description>

      <title>Absence of one-loop effects on large scales from small scales in non-slow-roll dynamics II: Quartic interactions and consistency relations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08296v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove explicitly the absence of one-loop corrections to large scales from small scales in transient non-slow-roll dynamics. Specifically, we address loop corrections to the primordial power spectrum, relative to tree-level, that are independent of the ratio between the two scales. We review all the necessary components, adapted to our context, to express one-loop diagrams as three-point functions, emphasizing the crucial role played by quartic interactions. Notably, we include the quartic Hamiltonian induced by the cubic Lagrangian and quartic interactions that are ensured by diffeomorphism invariance. We then explicitly prove consistency relations for an arbitrary transient non-slow-roll phase involving operators with (time) derivatives. Finally, we calculate one-loop corrections by including contributions from the relevant cubic and quartic interactions, and express the final result as a total derivative term over comoving momenta, utilizing the consistency relations we established. This leads us to conclude that one-loop corrections to long-wavelength modes are unaffected by the physics of short and enhanced modes in non-slow-roll dynamics.</description>

Abstract: We consider trajectories of massless particles in the presence of charged black holes in asymptotically AdS spacetimes in arbitrary dimensions. We study the properties of the photon ring in the (near-)extremal limit and show that the photon ring can probe the near-horizon region in two different scenarios: in high enough number of spacetime dimensions or when the massless particle carries an electric charge. We propose a simple $\mathrm{i} \epsilon$-prescription for implementing the JWKB approximation and show its utility in various contexts. We calculate the quasi-normal modes for charged fields in the eikonal limit and show the emergence of a new time-scale of relaxation in the dual field theory side. In the near-extremal limit, we show generally that the time-scale of decay of the perturbations is governed by the chemical potential. We also verify our analytical results numerically. The $\mathrm{i} \epsilon$-prescription allows us to study the superradiant modes and the associated instabilities in the eikonal limit easily. We comment on some related aspects regarding near-extremal black holes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.05061v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The LIGO-Virgo analyses of signals from compact binary mergers observed so far have assumed isolated binary systems in a vacuum, neglecting the potential presence of astrophysical environments. We present here the first investigation of environmental effects on each of the events of GWTC-1 and two low-mass events from GWTC-2. We find no evidence for the presence of environmental effects. Most of the events decisively exclude the scenario of dynamical fragmentation of massive stars as their formation channel. GW170817 results in the most stringent upper bound on the medium density ($\lesssim 21\,\mathrm{g/cm^3}$). We find that environmental effects can substantially bias the recovered parameters in the vacuum model, even when these effects are not detectable. We forecast that the Einstein Telescope and B-DECIGO will be able to probe the environmental effects of accretion disks and superradiant boson clouds on compact binaries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11604v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate some FLRW cosmological models in the context of Metric-Affine $F(R,Q)$ gravity, as proposed in [arXiv:1205.52666]. Here, $R$ and $Q$ are the curvature and nonmetricity scalars using non-special connections, respectively. We get the modified field equations using a flat Friedmann-Lema\^{i}tre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metric. We then find a connection between the Hubble constant $H_{0}$, the density parameter $\Omega_{m0}$, and the other model parameters in two different situations involving scalars $u$ and $w$. Next, we used new observational datasets, such as the cosmic chronometer (CC) Hubble datasets and the Pantheon SNe Ia datasets, to determine the optimal model parameter values through MCMC analysis. Using these best-fit values of model parameters, we have discussed the results and behavior of the derived models. We have also discussed the AIC and BIC criteria for the derived models in the context of $\Lambda$CDM. We have found that the geometrical sector dark equation of state parameter $\omega_{de}$ behaves just like a dark energy candidate. We have found that both models are transit phase models and Model-I approaches to the Lambda CDM model in the late-time universe and Model-II approaches to quintessence scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19383v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider isolated horizons (Killing horizons up to the second order) whose null flow has the structure of a U(1) principal fiber bundle over a compact Riemann surface. We impose the vacuum Einstein equations (with the cosmological constant) and the condition that the spacetime Weyl tensor is of Petrov D type on the geometry of the horizons. We derive all the solutions in the case when the genus of the surface is $&gt;1$. By doing so for all the non-trivial bundles, we complete the classification. We construct the embedding spacetimes and show that they are locally isometric to the toroidal or hyperbolic generalization of the Taub-NUT-(anti-) de Sitter spacetimes for horizons of genus $1$ or $&gt;1$ respectively, after performing Misner's identification of the spacetime. The horizon bundle structure can be naturally extended to bundle structure defined on the entire spacetime.</description>

      <title>Dymnikova black hole from an infinite tower of higher-curvature corrections</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09063v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, in [arXiv:2403.04827], it was demonstrated that various regular black hole metrics can be derived within a theory featuring an infinite number of higher curvature corrections to General Relativity. Moreover, truncating this infinite series at the first few orders already yields a reliable approximation of the observable characteristics of such black holes [arXiv:2403.07848]. Here, we further establish the existence of another regular black hole solution, particularly the $D$-dimensional extension of the Dymnikova black hole, within the equations of motion incorporating an infinite tower of higher-curvature corrections. This solution is essentially nonperturbative in the coupling parameter, rendering the action, if it exists, incapable of being approximated by a finite number of powers of the curvature. In addition, we compute the dominant quasinormal frequencies of such black holes using both the Bernstein polynomial method and the 13th order WKB method with Pad\'e approximants, obtaining a high degree of agreement between them.</description>

      <title>Impact of gravitational waveform model systematics on the measurement of the Hubble constant</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18158v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Matching gravitational-wave observations of binary neutron stars with theoretical model predictions reveals important information about the sources, such as the masses and the distance to the stars. The latter can be used to determine the Hubble constant, the rate at which the Universe expands. One general problem of all astrophysical measurements is that theoretical models only approximate the real underlying physics, which can lead to systematic uncertainties introducing biases. However, the extent of this bias for the distance measurement due to uncertainties of gravitational waveform models is unknown. In this study, we analyze a synthetic population of 38 binary neutron star sources measured with Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo at design sensitivity. We employ a set of four different waveform models and estimate model-dependent systematic biases on the extraction of the Hubble constant using the bright siren method. Our results indicate that systematic biases are below statistical uncertainties for the current generation of gravitational-wave detectors.</description>

      <title>$F(Q)$ gravity with Gauss-Bonnet corrections: from early-time inflation to late-time acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12558v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that in the $f(Q)$ gravity with a non-metricity scalar $Q$, the curvatures in Einstein's gravity, that is, the Riemann curvature constructed from the standard Levi-Civita connection, could not be excluded or naturally appear. The first observation is that even in $f(Q)$ gravity, the conservation of the matter energy-momentum tensor is not described by the covariant derivatives in the non-metricity gravity but that is given by the Levi-Civita connection. The commutator of the covariant derivatives in Einstein's gravity inevitably induces the Riemann curvature. There is no symmetry nor principle which prohibits the Riemann curvature in non-metricity gravity. Based on this observation, we propose and investigate $f\left(Q, \mathcal{G} \right)$ gravity with the Gauss-Bonnet invariant $\mathcal{G}$ and its generalisations. We show how $f\left(Q, \mathcal{G} \right)$ models realising any given the Friedmann-Lema\^{i}tre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) spacetime can be reconstructed. We apply the reconstruction formalism to cosmology. Explicitly, the gravity models which realise slow roll or constant roll inflation, dark energy epoch as well as the unification of the inflation and dark energy are found. The dynamical autonomous system and the gravitational wave in the theory under investigation are discussed. It is found the condition that the de Sitter spacetime becomes the (stable) fixed point of the system.</description>

      <title>Ringdown amplitudes of nonspinning eccentric binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19442v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Closed-form expressions for the ringdown complex amplitudes of nonspinning unequal-mass binaries in arbitrarily eccentric orbits are presented. They are built upon 237 numerical simulations contained within the RIT catalog, through the parameterisation introduced in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 132, 101401]. Global fits for the complex amplitudes, associated to linear quasinormal mode frequencies of the dominant ringdown modes, are obtained in a factorised form immediately applicable to any existing quasi-circular model. Similarly to merger amplitudes, ringdown ones increase by more than 50% compared to the circular case for high impact parameters (medium eccentricities), while strongly suppressed in the low impact parameter (highly eccentric) limit. Such reduction can be explained by a transition between an "orbital-type" and an "infall-type" dynamics. The amplitudes (phases) fits accuracy lies around a few percent (deciradians) for the majority of the dataset, comparable to the accuracy of current state-of-the-art quasi-circular ringdown models, and well within current statistical errors of current LIGO-Virgo-Kagra ringdown observations. These expressions constitute another building block towards the construction of complete general-relativistic inspiral-merger-ringdown semi-analytical templates, and allow to extend numerically-informed spectroscopic analyses beyond the circular limit. Such generalisations are key to achieve accurate inference of compact binaries astrophysical properties, and tame astrophysical systematics within observational investigations of strong-field general relativistic dynamics.</description>

      <title>Estimating the possible QPOs of M87* from the parameters of a hairy Kerr black hole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01478v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the dynamics of the shock cone formed around the hairy Kerr black hole due to BHL accretion and investigate the QPO behaviors resulting from the black hole-cone interaction, aiming to predict the QPO frequencies that may occur around the M87* black hole. To achieve this, we use the hairy Kerr black hole parameters consistent with the observed shadow parameters of M87* as initial conditions in numerical simulations, revealing the structure of the resulting shock cone and QPOs in a strong gravitational field. Numerical calculations show that the deviation of the hairy Kerr black hole from the Kerr metric and the hair parameters significantly influence the complex behavior of the resulting QPOs. It is found that the Lense-Thirring effect and the pressure modes trapped within the cone lead to the excitation of QPOs. The hair parameter has been observed to suppress the resulting QPO frequencies. The Lense-Thirring effect, in a strong gravitational field with a black hole spin parameter of a/M &gt; 0.7, also suppresses other modes and generates high-frequency QPOs. It is predicted that the QPO frequencies observed around the M87* black hole could span a wide range from nHz to mHz. Using both Kerr and hairy Kerr gravities, the QPO frequencies formed around the M87* black hole can be explained. Especially in cases where the black hole is spinning rapidly, PSD analyses have shown very distinct low-frequency QPOs and resonance conditions in both gravities. By comparing the results obtained from numerical calculations with observational and analytical results, we discuss the observability of the QPO frequencies that may occur around the M87* black hole.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19654v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the quasi-normal modes (QNMs) of a scalar field in the background of a large class of quantum black holes that can be formed from gravitational collapse of a dust fluid in the framework of effective loop quantum gravity. The loop quantum black holes (LQBHs) are characterized by three free parameters, one of which is the mass parameter, while the other two are purely due to quantum geometric effects. Among these two quantum parameters, one is completely fixed by black hole thermodynamics and its effects are negligible for macroscopic black holes, while the second parameter is completely free (in principle). In the studies of the QNMs of such LQBHs, we pay particular attention to the difference of the QNMs between LQBHs and classical ones, so that they can be observed for the current and forthcoming gravitational wave observations, whereby place the LQBH theory directly under the test of observations.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the observational signatures of traversable Simpson-Visser wormholes illuminated by luminous celestial spheres and orbiting hot spots. We demonstrate that when light sources and observers are on the same side of the wormholes, the images of the wormholes mimic those of black holes. However, when the light sources are positioned on the opposite side from observers, photons traversing the wormhole throat generate distinct observational signatures. Specifically, unlike black hole images, the wormhole images are confined within the critical curve, resulting in smaller centroid variations. Furthermore, the light curve of hot spots can exhibit additional peaks.</description>

Abstract: Given on the $2$-sphere Bartnik data (prescribed metric and mean curvature) that is a small perturbation of the corresponding data for the standard unit sphere in Euclidean space, we estimate to second order, in the size of the perturbation, the mass of the asymptotically flat static vacuum extension (unique up to diffeomorphism) which is a small perturbation of the flat metric on the exterior of the unit ball in Euclidean space and induces the prescribed data on the boundary sphere. As an application we obtain a new upper bound on the Bartnik mass of small metric spheres to fifth order in the radius.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.09946v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the data-driven holographic transport models without translation symmetry, focusing on the real part of frequency-dependent shear viscosity, $\eta_{\mathrm{re}}(\omega)$. We develop a radial flow equation of the shear response and establish its relation to $\eta _{\mathrm{re}}(\omega)$ for a wide class of holographic models. This allows us to determine $\eta _{\mathrm{re}}(\omega )$ of a strongly coupled field theory by the black hole metric and the graviton mass. The latter serves as the bulk dual to the translation symmetry breaking on the boundary. We convert the flow equation to a Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (Neural ODE), which is a neural network with continuous depth and produces output through a black-box ODE solver. Testing the Neural ODE on three well-known holographic models without translation symmetry, we demonstrate its ability to accurately learn either the metric or mass when given the other. Additionally, we illustrate that the learned metric can be used to predict the derivative of entanglement entropy $S$ with respect to the size of entangling region $l$.</description>

Abstract: We study closed universes in simple models of two dimensional gravity, such as Jackiw-Teiteilboim (JT) gravity coupled to matter, and a toy topological model that captures the key features of the former. We find there is a stark contrast, as well as some connections, between the perturbative and non-perturbative aspects of the theory. We find rich semi-classical physics. However, when non-perturbative effects are included there is a unique closed universe state in each theory. We discuss possible meanings and interpretations of this observation.</description>

      <title>Observational Constraints on the Parameters of Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz Gravity</title>

Abstract: This study investigates the accelerated cosmic expansion within the Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz Model. To constrain the cosmological parameters of this model, we incorporate 17 Baryon Acoustic Oscillation points, 31 Cosmic Chronometer points, 40 Type Ia Supernovae points, 24 quasar Hubble diagram points, and 162 Gamma Ray Bursts points, along with the latest Hubble constant measurement (R22). We treat $r_{d}$ as a free parameter to extract $H_{0}$ and $r_{d}$ using late-time datasets, aiming for optimal fitting values in each model. Treating $r_{d}$ as free improves precision, reduces bias, and enhances dataset compatibility. The obtained values of $H_{0}$ and $r_{d}$ are compared to the $\Lambda$CDM model, showing consistency with previous estimates from Planck and SDSS studies. The Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) favor the Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz model, with the $\Lambda$CDM model having the lowest AIC. Additionally, we conduct $\Delta$AIC and $\Delta$BIC analyses to assess model preference.} Validation using the reduced $\chi_{red}^{2}$ statistic indicates satisfactory fits for the Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz model, while recognizing $\Lambda$CDM as the preferred model. Extensions of the analysis warrant further investigation.</description>

      <title>Canonical aspects of pregeometric vector-based first order gauge theory</title>

Abstract: A recently proposed pregeometric auxiliary vector mediated gauge theory is studied in its canonical domain, by performing the Legendre transform on a curved background and by considering its covariant phase space, with further application to duality. The constraints become differential equations, but the Dirac-Bergmann algorithm appears consistent with electromagnetic degrees of freedom, metric background permitting. Solving the consistency conditions provides a preferred direction in an intermediary form of spontaneous symmetry breaking. In parallel, the covariant phase space defines the symplectic structure, and establishes the conserved currents and quantum phenomenology with the generated background. The formalism immediately allows to study the parent path integrals of dual theories, with quartic Proca to Kalb-Ramond inequivalence and Maxwell-Chern-Simons path integral consistency as practical applications, while the differential geometry gives a global description of the issue of Yang-Mills duality rotations. Properties of degenerate metric geometry are discussed throughout, and the viability of inherent backgrounds leads into the fundamental question of background independence in all physical theories.</description>

      <title>Identifying Black Holes Through Space Telescopes and Deep Learning</title>

Abstract: The EHT has captured a series of images of black holes. These images could provide valuable information about the gravitational environment near the event horizon. However, accurate detection and parameter estimation for candidate black holes are necessary. This paper explores the potential for identifying black holes in the ultraviolet band using space telescopes. We establish a data pipeline for generating simulated observations and present an ensemble neural network model for black hole detection and parameter estimation. The model achieves mean average precision [0.5] values of 0.9176 even when reaching the imaging FWHM ($\theta_c$) and maintains the detection ability until $0.54\theta_c$. The parameter estimation is also accurate. These results indicate that our methodology enables super-resolution recognition. Moreover, the model successfully detects the shadow of M87* from background noise and other celestial bodies and estimates its inclination and positional angle. Our work demonstrates the feasibility of detecting black holes in the ultraviolet band and provides a new method for black hole detection and further parameter estimation.</description>

      <title>Quantum charged black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07192v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Within the framework of braneworld holography, we construct a quantum charged black hole localized on a three-dimensional anti-de Sitter (AdS) brane that intersects the asymptotic boundary of the four-dimensional AdS spacetime at the conformal defects and incorporates quantum backreaction effects from the conformal field theory (CFT) on the brane. This quantum charged black hole is an exact solution of the semiclassical gravitational equation corresponding to a theory with higher curvature gravity and nonminimally coupled nonlinear gauge field. In the framework of double holography, we investigate the thermodynamics of the quantum charged black hole from three perspectives: a pure bulk perspective, in which four-dimensional classical Einstein gravity couples to Maxwell electrodynamics and a codimension-one tensional brane; a brane perspective, where semiclassical higher curvature gravity is subject to quantum backreaction from the holographic CFT on the brane, yielding a quantum charged black hole; and a boundary perspective, where the defect CFT is coupled to a boundary CFT at the asymptotic boundary and the degrees of freedom for defect quantum conformal matter is considered. In so doing, we obtain doubly holographic formulations of both the first law of thermodynamics and the Smarr (energy) relations for the quantum charged black holes.</description>

      <title>Imprints of Supermassive Black Hole Evolution on the Spectral and Spatial Anisotropy of Nano-Hertz Stochastic Gravitational-Wave Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14508v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The formation and evolution of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) remains an open question in the field of modern cosmology. The detection of nanohertz (n-Hz) gravitational waves via pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) in the form of individual events and the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) offers a promising avenue for studying SMBH evolution across cosmic time, with SGWB signal being the immediately detectable signal with the currently accessible telescope sensitivities. By connecting the galaxy properties in the large scale (Gpc scale) cosmological simulation such as \texttt{MICECAT} with the small scale ($\sim$ Mpc scale) galaxy simulations from \texttt{ROMULUS}, we show that different scenarios of galaxy-SMBH evolution with redshift leads to a frequency-dependent spatial anisotropy in the SGWB signal. The presence of slow evolution of the SMBHs in the Universe leads to a pronounced blue anisotropic spectrum of the SGWB. In contrast, if SMBHs grow faster in the Universe in lighter galaxies, the frequency-dependent spatial anisotropy exhibits a more flattened anisotropic spectrum. This additional aspect of the SGWB signal on top of the monopole SGWB signal, can give insight on how the SMBHs form in the high redshift Universe and its interplay with the galaxy formation from future measurements.</description>

      <title>Towards bit threads in general gravitational spacetimes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04092v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The concept of the generalized entanglement wedge was recently proposed by Bousso and Penington, which states that any bulk gravitational region $a$ possesses an associated generalized entanglement wedge $E(a)\supset a$ on a static Cauchy surface $M$ in general gravitational spacetimes, where $E(a)$ may contain an entanglement island $I(a)$. It suggests that the fine-grained entropy for bulk region $a$ is given by the generalized entropy $S_{\text{gen}}(E(a))$. Motivated by this proposal, we extend the quantum bit thread description to general gravitational spacetimes, no longer limited to the AdS spacetime. By utilizing the convex optimization techniques, a dual flow description for the generalized entropy $S_{\text{gen}}(E(a))$ of a bulk gravitational region $a$ is established on the static Cauchy surface $M$, such that $S_{\text{gen}}(E(a))$ is equal to the maximum flux of any flow that starts from the boundary $\partial M$ and ends at bulk region $a$, or equivalently, the maximum number of bit threads that connect the boundary $\partial M$ to the bulk region $a$. In addition, the nesting property of flows is also proved. Thus the basic properties of the entropy for bulk regions, i.e. the monotonicity, subadditivity, Araki-Lieb inequality and strong subadditivity, can be verified from flow perspectives by using properties of flows, such as the nesting property. Moreover, in max thread configurations, we find that there exists some lower bounds on the bulk entanglement entropy of matter fields in the region $E(a)\setminus a$, particularly on an entanglement island region $I(a) \subset (E(a)\setminus a)$, as required by the existence of a nontrivial generalized entanglement wedge. Our quantum bit thread formulation may provide a way to investigate more fine-grained entanglement structures in general spacetimes.</description>

      <title>The Cosmological Switchback Effect II</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04397v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent developments in static patch holography proposed that quantum gravity in de Sitter space admits a dual description in terms of a quantum mechanical theory living on a timelike surface near the cosmological horizon. In parallel, geometric observables associated with the Einstein-Rosen bridge of a black hole background were suggested to compute the computational complexity of the state dual to a gravitational theory. In this work, we pursue the study of the complexity=volume and complexity=action conjectures in a Schwarzschild-de Sitter geometry perturbed by the insertion of a shockwave at finite boundary times. This analysis extends previous studies that focused either on the complexity=volume 2.0 conjecture, or on the case of a shockwave inserted along the cosmological horizon. We show that the switchback effect, describing the delay in the evolution of complexity in reaction to a perturbation, is a universal feature of the complexity proposals in asymptotically de Sitter space. The geometric origin of this phenomenon is related to the causal connection between the static patches of de Sitter space when a positive pulse of null energy is inserted in the geometry.</description>

      <title>Galactic Rotation Curves of LSB Galaxies using core-halo FDM configurations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17984v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we construct galactic halos in order to fit the rotation curves (RCs) of a sample of low surface brightness (LSB) galaxies. These halos are made of Fuzzy Dark Matter (FDM) with a multimode expansion of non-spherical modes that in average contribute to the appropriate density profile consisting of a core and an envelope needed to fit the rotation curves. The coefficients of the expansion are calculated using a genetic algorithm, that minimizes the difference between the spatial average density of the multimode order parameter describing the FDM and the target dark matter density that fits the RCs. The FDM halos are constructed assuming a solitonic core at the center and two types of envelopes, Navarro-Frenk-White and Pseudo-Isothermal density profiles. The resulting FDM configurations are then evolved in order to show how the average density changes in time due to the secular dynamical evolution, along with a condensation process that lead to the growth of the solitonic core.</description>

      <title>$N$-bein formalism for the parameter space of quantum geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19468v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work introduces a geometrical object that generalizes the quantum geometric tensor; we call it $N$-bein. Analogous to the vielbein (orthonormal frame) used in the Cartan formalism, the $N$-bein behaves like a ``square root'' of the quantum geometric tensor. Using it, we present a quantum geometric tensor of two states that measures the possibility of moving from one state to another after two consecutive parameter variations. This new tensor determines the commutativity of such variations through its anti-symmetric part. In addition, we define a connection different from the Berry connection, and combining it with the $N$-bein allows us to introduce a notion of torsion and curvature \`{a} la Cartan that satisfies the Bianchi identities. Moreover, the torsion coincides with the anti-symmetric part of the two-state quantum geometric tensor previously mentioned, and thus, it is related to the commutativity of the parameter variations. We also describe our formalism using differential forms and discuss the possible physical interpretations of the new geometrical objects. Furthermore, we define different gauge invariants constructed from the geometrical quantities introduced in this work, resulting in new physical observables. Finally, we present two examples to illustrate these concepts: a harmonic oscillator and a generalized oscillator, both immersed in an electric field. We found that the new tensors quantify correlations between quantum states that were unavailable by other methods.</description>
