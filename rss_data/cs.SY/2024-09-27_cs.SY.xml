      <title>Stereographic Projection of Probabilistic Frequency-Domain Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the stereographic projection of points along the Nyquist plots of single input single output (SISO) linear time invariant (LTI) systems subject to probabilistic uncertainty. At each frequency, there corresponds a complex-valued random variable with given probability distribution in the complex plane. The chordal distance between the stereographic projections of this complex value and the corresponding value for a nominal model, as per the well-known Nu-Gap metric of Vinnicombe, is also a random quantity. The main result provides the cumulative density function (CDF) of the chordal distance at a given frequency. Such a stochastic distance framework opens up a fresh and a fertile research direction on probabilistic robust control theory.</description>

      <title>Semantic model for the description of energy data in the Module Type Package</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modular production systems that employ the Module Type Package (MTP) to describe module interfaces can, at present, only communicate energy data through proprietary solutions. Due to this limitation, users face additional effort when calculating energy KPIs for modules or determining the energy efficiency of modules. To address this issue, we present a model that facilitates energy data to be described semantically and uniformly in the MTP on the basis of an industrial standard (OPC 34100). MTPs incorporating this model can transmit semantically consistent energy data from modules to the process control system, making the data available for further applications, such as monitoring or optimization.</description>

      <title>On the Output Redundancy of LTI Systems: A Geometric Approach with Application to Privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines the properties of output-redundant systems, that is, systems possessing a larger number of outputs than inputs, through the lenses of the geometric approach of Wonham et al. We begin by formulating a simple output allocation synthesis problem, which involves ``concealing" input information from a malicious eavesdropper having access to the system output, while still allowing for a legitimate user to reconstruct it. It is shown that the solvability of this problem requires the availability of a redundant set of outputs. This very problem is instrumental to unveiling the fundamental geometric properties of output-redundant systems, which form the basis for our subsequent constructions and results. As a direct application, we demonstrate how output allocation can be employed to effectively protect the information of input information from certain output eavesdroppers with guaranteed results.</description>

      <title>Discontinuous Reception with Adjustable Inactivity Timer for IIoT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Discontinuous reception (DRX) is a key technology for reducing the energy consumption of industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) devices. Specifically, DRX allows the devices to operate in a low-power mode when no data reception is scheduled, and its effectiveness depends on the proper configuration of the DRX parameters. In this paper, we characterize the DRX process departing from a semi-Markov chain modeling. We detail two ways to set DRX parameters to minimize the device power consumption while meeting a mean delay constraint. The first method exhaustively searches for the optimal configuration. In contrast, the second method uses a low-complexity metaheuristic to find a sub-optimal configuration, thus considering ideal and practical DRX configurations. Notably, within the DRX parameters, the inactivity timer (IT) is a caution time that specifies how long a device remains active after the last information exchange. Traditionally, a device implementing DRX will restart the IT after each data reception as a precedent to a low-power mode. The usual approach lies in restarting the IT whenever new data is received during this cautious period, which might sometimes needlessly extend the active time. Herein, we propose a more efficient method in which the transmit base station (BS) explicitly indicates restarting the timer through the control channel only when appropriate. The decision is taken based on the BS's knowledge about its buffer status. We consider Poisson and bursty traffic models, which are typical in IIoT setups, and verify the suitability of our proposal for reducing the energy consumption of the devices without significantly compromising the communication latency through extensive numerical simulations. Specifically, energy-saving gains of up to 30% can be obtained regardless of the arrival rate and delay constraints.</description>

      <title>Observer-Based Discontinuous Communication in the Secondary Control of AC Microgrids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes an observer-based event-driven approach to decrease the overuse of communication networks. The suggested approach aims to estimate the required data for sharing between units in line with as much communication reduction as possible. In other words, the proposed approach effectively determines which state variables should be shared (observer concept) among the units during specific time intervals (event-triggered concept). This strategy significantly reduces the overall communication load. It is shown that the estimation error remains bounded and Zeno behavior, characterized by an endless number of transmissions occurring within a limited time frame, does not occur. The proposed methodology can be systematically applied to any communication-based secondary controller in alternating current (AC) microgrids. Simulation results demonstrate a high degree of precision in estimating the states under the proposed approach. Also, the secondary controller performance under the proposed method is evaluated in MATLAB/Simulink environment.</description>

      <title>Distributed Invariant Unscented Kalman Filter based on Inverse Covariance Intersection with Intermittent Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the problem of distributed state estimation (DSE) over sensor networks on matrix Lie groups, which is crucial for applications where system states evolve on Lie groups rather than vector spaces. We propose a diffusion-based distributed invariant Unscented Kalman Filter using the inverse covariance intersection (DIUKF-ICI) method to address target tracking in 3D environments. Unlike existing distributed UKFs confined to vector spaces, our approach extends the distributed UKF framework to Lie groups, enabling local estimates to be fused with intermediate information from neighboring agents on Lie groups. To handle the unknown correlations across local estimates, we extend the ICI fusion strategy to matrix Lie groups for the first time and integrate it into the diffusion algorithm. We demonstrate that the estimation error of the proposed method is bounded. Additionally, the algorithm is fully distributed, robust against intermittent measurements, and adaptable to time-varying communication topologies. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated through extensive Monte-Carlo simulations.</description>

      <title>Control Industrial Automation System with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional industrial automation systems require specialized expertise to operate and complex reprogramming to adapt to new processes. Large language models offer the intelligence to make them more flexible and easier to use. However, LLMs' application in industrial settings is underexplored. This paper introduces a framework for integrating LLMs to achieve end-to-end control of industrial automation systems. At the core of the framework are an agent system designed for industrial tasks, a structured prompting method, and an event-driven information modeling mechanism that provides real-time data for LLM inference. The framework supplies LLMs with real-time events on different context semantic levels, allowing them to interpret the information, generate production plans, and control operations on the automation system. It also supports structured dataset creation for fine-tuning on this downstream application of LLMs. Our contribution includes a formal system design, proof-of-concept implementation, and a method for generating task-specific datasets for LLM fine-tuning and testing. This approach enables a more adaptive automation system that can respond to spontaneous events, while allowing easier operation and configuration through natural language for more intuitive human-machine interaction.

      <title>End-to-end guarantees for indirect data-driven control of bilinear systems with finite stochastic data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we propose an end-to-end algorithm for indirect data-driven control for bilinear systems with stability guarantees. We consider the case where the collected i.i.d. data is affected by probabilistic noise with possibly unbounded support and leverage tools from statistical learning theory to derive finite sample identification error bounds. To this end, we solve the bilinear identification problem by solving a set of linear and affine identification problems, by a particular choice of a control input during the data collection phase. We provide a priori as well as data-dependent finite sample identification error bounds on the individual matrices as well as ellipsoidal bounds, both of which are structurally suitable for control. Further, we integrate the structure of the derived identification error bounds in a robust controller design to obtain an exponentially stable closed-loop. By means of an extensive numerical study we showcase the interplay between the controller design and the derived identification error bounds. Moreover, we note appealing connections of our results to indirect data-driven control of general nonlinear systems through Koopman operator theory and discuss how our results may be applied in this setup.</description>

      <title>Effect of electric vehicles, heat pumps, and solar panels on low-voltage feeders: Evidence from smart meter profiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electric vehicles (EVs), heat pumps (HPs) and solar panels are low-carbon technologies (LCTs) that are being connected to the low-voltage grid (LVG) at a rapid pace. One of the main hurdles to understand their impact on the LVG is the lack of recent, large electricity consumption datasets, measured in real-world conditions. We investigated the contribution of LCTs to the size and timing of peaks on LV feeders by using a large dataset of 42,089 smart meter profiles of residential LVG customers. These profiles were measured in 2022 by Fluvius, the distribution system operator (DSO) of Flanders, Belgium. The dataset contains customers that proactively requested higher-resolution smart metering data, and hence is biased towards energy-interested people. LV feeders of different sizes were statistically modelled with a profile sampling approach. For feeders with 40 connections, we found a contribution to the feeder peak of 1.2 kW for a HP, 1.4 kW for an EV and 2.0 kW for an EV charging faster than 6.5 kW. A visual analysis of the feeder-level loads shows that the classical duck curve is replaced by a night-camel curve for feeders with only HPs and a night-dromedary curve for feeders with only EVs charging faster than 6.5 kW. Consumption patterns will continue to change as the energy transition is carried out, because of e.g. dynamic electricity tariffs or increased battery capacities. Our introduced methods are simple to implement, making it a useful tool for DSOs that have access to smart meter data to monitor changing consumption patterns.</description>

      <title>On the Interplay of Clustering and Evolution in the Emergence of Epidemic Outbreaks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In an increasingly interconnected world, a key scientific challenge is to examine mechanisms that lead to the widespread propagation of contagions, such as misinformation and pathogens, and identify risk factors that can trigger large-scale outbreaks. Underlying both the spread of disease and misinformation epidemics is the evolution of the contagion as it propagates, leading to the emergence of different strains, e.g., through genetic mutations in pathogens and alterations in the information content. Recent studies have revealed that models that do not account for heterogeneity in transmission risks associated with different strains of the circulating contagion can lead to inaccurate predictions. However, existing results on multi-strain spreading assume that the network has a vanishingly small clustering coefficient, whereas clustering is widely known to be a fundamental property of real-world social networks. In this work, we investigate spreading processes that entail evolutionary adaptations on random graphs with tunable clustering and arbitrary degree distributions. We derive a mathematical framework to quantify the epidemic characteristics of a contagion that evolves as it spreads, with the structure of the underlying network as given via arbitrary {\em joint} degree distributions of single-edges and triangles. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to jointly analyze the impact of clustering and evolution on the emergence of epidemic outbreaks. We supplement our theoretical finding with numerical simulations and case studies, shedding light on the impact of clustering on contagion spread.</description>

      <title>Optimal control of stochastic reaction networks with entropic control cost and emergence of mode-switching strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17488v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Controlling the stochastic dynamics of biological populations is a challenge that arises across various biological contexts. However, these dynamics are inherently nonlinear and involve a discrete state space, i.e., the number of molecules, cells, or organisms. Additionally, the possibility of extinction has a significant impact on both the dynamics and control strategies, particularly when the population size is small. These factors hamper the direct application of conventional control theories to biological systems. To address these challenges, we formulate the optimal control problem for stochastic population dynamics by utilizing a control cost function based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence. This approach naturally accounts for population-specific factors and simplifies the complex nonlinear Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation into a linear form, facilitating efficient computation of optimal solutions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by applying it to the control of interacting random walkers, Moran processes, and SIR models, and observe the mode-switching phenomena in the control strategies. Our approach provides new opportunities for applying control theory to a wide range of biological problems.</description>

      <title>GLinSAT: The General Linear Satisfiability Neural Network Layer By Accelerated Gradient Descent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17500v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ensuring that the outputs of neural networks satisfy specific constraints is crucial for applying neural networks to real-life decision-making problems. In this paper, we consider making a batch of neural network outputs satisfy bounded and general linear constraints. We first reformulate the neural network output projection problem as an entropy-regularized linear programming problem. We show that such a problem can be equivalently transformed into an unconstrained convex optimization problem with Lipschitz continuous gradient according to the duality theorem. Then, based on an accelerated gradient descent algorithm with numerical performance enhancement, we present our architecture, GLinSAT, to solve the problem. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first general linear satisfiability layer in which all the operations are differentiable and matrix-factorization-free. Despite the fact that we can explicitly perform backpropagation based on automatic differentiation mechanism, we also provide an alternative approach in GLinSAT to calculate the derivatives based on implicit differentiation of the optimality condition. Experimental results on constrained traveling salesman problems, partial graph matching with outliers, predictive portfolio allocation and power system unit commitment demonstrate the advantages of GLinSAT over existing satisfiability layers.</description>

      <title>Scene Understanding in Pick-and-Place Tasks: Analyzing Transformations Between Initial and Final Scenes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With robots increasingly collaborating with humans in everyday tasks, it is important to take steps toward robotic systems capable of understanding the environment. This work focuses on scene understanding to detect pick and place tasks given initial and final images from the scene. To this end, a dataset is collected for object detection and pick and place task detection. A YOLOv5 network is subsequently trained to detect the objects in the initial and final scenes. Given the detected objects and their bounding boxes, two methods are proposed to detect the pick and place tasks which transform the initial scene into the final scene. A geometric method is proposed which tracks objects' movements in the two scenes and works based on the intersection of the bounding boxes which moved within scenes. Contrarily, the CNN-based method utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network to classify objects with intersected bounding boxes into 5 classes, showing the spatial relationship between the involved objects. The performed pick and place tasks are then derived from analyzing the experiments with both scenes. Results show that the CNN-based method, using a VGG16 backbone, outscores the geometric method by roughly 12 percentage points in certain scenarios, with an overall success rate of 84.3%.</description>

      <title>Model-Free versus Model-Based Reinforcement Learning for Fixed-Wing UAV Attitude Control Under Varying Wind Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17896v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper evaluates and compares the performance of model-free and model-based reinforcement learning for the attitude control of fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles using PID as a reference point. The comparison focuses on their ability to handle varying flight dynamics and wind disturbances in a simulated environment. Our results show that the Temporal Difference Model Predictive Control agent outperforms both the PID controller and other model-free reinforcement learning methods in terms of tracking accuracy and robustness over different reference difficulties, particularly in nonlinear flight regimes. Furthermore, we introduce actuation fluctuation as a key metric to assess energy efficiency and actuator wear, and we test two different approaches from the literature: action variation penalty and conditioning for action policy smoothness. We also evaluate all control methods when subject to stochastic turbulence and gusts separately, so as to measure their effects on tracking performance, observe their limitations and outline their implications on the Markov decision process formalism.</description>

      <title>PhantomLiDAR: Cross-modality Signal Injection Attacks against LiDAR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) is a pivotal sensor for autonomous driving, offering precise 3D spatial information. Previous signal attacks against LiDAR systems mainly exploit laser signals. In this paper, we investigate the possibility of cross-modality signal injection attacks, i.e., injecting intentional electromagnetic interference (IEMI) to manipulate LiDAR output. Our insight is that the internal modules of a LiDAR, i.e., the laser receiving circuit, the monitoring sensors, and the beam-steering modules, even with strict electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) testing, can still couple with the IEMI attack signals and result in the malfunction of LiDAR systems. Based on the above attack surfaces, we propose the PhantomLiDAR attack, which manipulates LiDAR output in terms of Points Interference, Points Injection, Points Removal, and even LiDAR Power-Off. We evaluate and demonstrate the effectiveness of PhantomLiDAR with both simulated and real-world experiments on five COTS LiDAR systems. We also conduct feasibility experiments in real-world moving scenarios. We provide potential defense measures that can be implemented at both the sensor level and the vehicle system level to mitigate the risks associated with IEMI attacks.

      <title>Intelligent Energy Management: Remaining Useful Life Prediction and Charging Automation System Comprised of Deep Learning and the Internet of Things</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of battery is an important parameter to know the battery's remaining life and need for recharge. The goal of this research project is to develop machine learning-based models for the battery RUL dataset. Different ML models are developed to classify the RUL of the vehicle, and the IoT (Internet of Things) concept is simulated for automating the charging system and managing any faults aligning. The graphs plotted depict the relationship between various vehicle parameters using the Blynk IoT platform. Results show that the catboost, Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), and hybrid model developed could classify RUL into three classes with 99% more accuracy. The data is fed using the tkinter GUI for simulating artificial intelligence (AI)-based charging, and with a pyserial backend, data can be entered into the Esp-32 microcontroller for making charge discharge possible with the model's predictions. Also, with an IoT system, the charging can be disconnected, monitored, and analyzed for automation. The results show that an accuracy of 99% can be obtained on models MLP, catboost model and similar accuracy on GRU model can be obtained, and finally relay-based triggering can be made by prediction through the model used for automating the charging and energy-saving mechanism. By showcasing an exemplary Blynk platform-based monitoring and automation phenomenon, we further present innovative ways of monitoring parameters and automating the system.</description>

      <title>Deblur e-NeRF: NeRF from Motion-Blurred Events under High-speed or Low-light Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17988v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The stark contrast in the design philosophy of an event camera makes it particularly ideal for operating under high-speed, high dynamic range and low-light conditions, where standard cameras underperform. Nonetheless, event cameras still suffer from some amount of motion blur, especially under these challenging conditions, in contrary to what most think. This is attributed to the limited bandwidth of the event sensor pixel, which is mostly proportional to the light intensity. Thus, to ensure that event cameras can truly excel in such conditions where it has an edge over standard cameras, it is crucial to account for event motion blur in downstream applications, especially reconstruction. However, none of the recent works on reconstructing Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) from events, nor event simulators, have considered the full effects of event motion blur. To this end, we propose, Deblur e-NeRF, a novel method to directly and effectively reconstruct blur-minimal NeRFs from motion-blurred events generated under high-speed motion or low-light conditions. The core component of this work is a physically-accurate pixel bandwidth model proposed to account for event motion blur under arbitrary speed and lighting conditions. We also introduce a novel threshold-normalized total variation loss to improve the regularization of large textureless patches. Experiments on real and novel realistically simulated sequences verify our effectiveness. Our code, event simulator and synthetic event dataset will be open-sourced.</description>

      <title>A Sim-to-Real Vision-based Lane Keeping System for a 1:10-scale Autonomous Vehicle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, several competitions have highlighted the need to investigate vision-based solutions to address scenarios with functional insufficiencies in perception, world modeling and localization. This article presents the Vision-based Lane Keeping System (VbLKS) developed by the DEI-Unipd Team within the context of the Bosch Future Mobility Challenge 2022. The main contribution lies in a Simulation-to-Reality (Sim2Real) GPS-denied VbLKS for a 1:10-scale autonomous vehicle. In this VbLKS, the input to a tailored Pure Pursuit (PP) based control strategy, namely the Lookahead Heading Error (LHE), is estimated at a constant lookahead distance employing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). A training strategy for a compact CNN is proposed, emphasizing data generation and augmentation on simulated camera images from a 3D Gazebo simulator, and enabling real-time operation on low-level hardware. A tailored PP-based lateral controller equipped with a derivative action and a PP-based velocity reference generation are implemented. Tuning ranges are established through a systematic time-delay stability analysis. Validation in a representative controlled laboratory setting is provided.</description>

      <title>Robust Adaptive MPC Using Uncertainty Compensation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.13743v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents an uncertainty compensation-based robust adaptive model predictive control (MPC) framework for linear systems with both matched and unmatched nonlinear uncertainties subject to both state and input constraints. In particular, the proposed control framework leverages an L1 adaptive controller (L1AC) to compensate for the matched uncertainties and to provide guaranteed uniform bounds on the error between the states and control inputs of the actual system and those of a nominal i.e., uncertainty-free, system. The performance bounds provided by the L1AC are then used to tighten the state and control constraints of the actual system, and a model predictive controller is designed for the nominal system with the tightened constraints. The proposed control framework, which we denote as uncertainty compensation-based MPC (UC-MPC), guarantees constraint satisfaction and achieves improved performance compared with existing methods. Simulation results on a flight control example demonstrate the benefits of the proposed framework.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Control of an Inverted Pendulum by a Reinforcement Learning-based LQR Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.04436v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inverted pendulums constitute one of the popular systems for benchmarking control algorithms. Several methods have been proposed for the control of this system, the majority of which rely on the availability of a mathematical model. However, deriving a mathematical model using physical parameters or system identification techniques requires manual effort. Moreover, the designed controllers may perform poorly if system parameters change. To mitigate these problems, recently, some studies used Reinforcement Learning (RL) based approaches for the control of inverted pendulum systems. Unfortunately, these methods suffer from slow convergence and local minimum problems. Moreover, they may require hyperparameter tuning which complicates the design process significantly. To alleviate these problems, the present study proposes an LQR-based RL method for adaptive balancing control of an inverted pendulum. As shown by numerical experiments, the algorithm stabilizes the system very fast without requiring a mathematical model or extensive hyperparameter tuning. In addition, it can adapt to parametric changes online.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Abstractions for Control Systems via Random Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10668v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: At the intersection of dynamical systems, control theory, and formal methods lies the construction of symbolic abstractions: these typically represent simpler, finite-state models whose behavior mimics that of an underlying concrete system but are easier to analyse. Building an abstraction usually requires an accurate knowledge of the underlying model: this knowledge may be costly to gather, especially in real-life applications. We aim to bridge this gap by building abstractions based on sampling finite length trajectories. To refine a controller built for the abstraction to one for the concrete system, we newly define a notion of probabilistic alternating simulation, and provide Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) guarantees that the constructed abstraction includes all behaviors of the concrete system and that it is suitable for control design, for arbitrarily long time horizons, leveraging scenario theory. Our method is then tested on several numerical benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Metaplasticity for Continual Learning with Memristors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08718v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Edge devices operating in dynamic environments critically need the ability to continually learn without catastrophic forgetting. The strict resource constraints in these devices pose a major challenge to achieve this, as continual learning entails memory and computational overhead. Crossbar architectures using memristor devices offer energy efficiency through compute-in-memory and hold promise to address this issue. However, memristors often exhibit low precision and high variability in conductance modulation, rendering them unsuitable for continual learning solutions that require precise modulation of weight magnitude for consolidation. Current approaches fall short to address this challenge directly and rely on auxiliary high-precision memory, leading to frequent memory access, high memory overhead, and energy dissipation. In this research, we propose probabilistic metaplasticity, which consolidates weights by modulating their update probability rather than magnitude. The proposed mechanism eliminates high-precision modification to weight magnitudes and, consequently, the need for auxiliary high-precision memory. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed mechanism by integrating probabilistic metaplasticity into a spiking network trained on an error threshold with low-precision memristor weights. Evaluations of continual learning benchmarks show that probabilistic metaplasticity achieves performance equivalent to state-of-the-art continual learning models with high-precision weights while consuming ~ 67% lower memory for additional parameters and up to ~ 60x lower energy during parameter updates compared to an auxiliary memory-based solution. The proposed model shows potential for energy-efficient continual learning with low-precision emerging devices.</description>

      <title>Convection-Enabled Boundary Control of a 2D Channel Flow</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15958v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nonlinear convection, the source of turbulence in fluid flows, may hold the key to stabilizing turbulence by solving a specific cubic polynomial equation. We consider the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in a two-dimensional channel. The tangential and normal velocities are assumed to be periodic in the streamwise direction. The pressure difference between the left and right ends of the channel is constant. Moreover, we consider no-slip boundary conditions, that is, zero tangential velocity, at the top and bottom walls of the channel, and normal velocity actuation at the top and bottom walls. We design the boundary control inputs to achieve global exponential stabilization, in the L2 sense, of a chosen Poiseuille equilibrium profile for an arbitrarily large Reynolds number. The key idea behind our approach is to select the boundary controllers such that they have zero spatial mean (to guarantee mass conservation) but non-zero spatial cubic mean. We reveal that, because of convection, the time derivative of the L2 energy of the regulation error is a cubic polynomial in the cubic mean of the boundary inputs. Regulation is then achieved by solving a specific cubic equation, using the Cardano root formula. The results are illustrated via a numerical example.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16899v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Personalized content on social platforms can exacerbate negative phenomena such as polarization, partly due to the feedback interactions between recommendations and the users. In this paper, we present a control-theoretic recommender system that explicitly accounts for this feedback loop to mitigate polarization. Our approach extends online feedback optimization - a control paradigm for steady-state optimization of dynamical systems - to develop a recommender system that trades off users engagement and polarization reduction, while relying solely on online click data. We establish theoretical guarantees for optimality and stability of the proposed design and validate its effectiveness via numerical experiments with a user population governed by Friedkin-Johnsen dynamics. Our results show these "network-aware" recommendations can significantly reduce polarization while maintaining high levels of user engagement.</description>

      <title>Data-based approaches to learning and control by similarity between heterogeneous systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03175v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes basic definitions of similarity and similarity indexes between admissible behaviors of heterogeneous host and guest systems and further presents a similarity-based learning control framework by exploiting the offline sampled data. By exploring helpful geometric properties of the admissible behavior and decomposing it into the subspace and offset components, the similarity indexes between two admissible behaviors are defined as the principal angles between their corresponding subspace components. By reconstructing the admissible behaviors leveraging sampled data, an efficient strategy for calculating the similarity indexes is developed, based on which a similarity-based learning control framework is proposed. It is shown that, with the application of similarity-based learning control, the host system can directly accomplish the same control tasks by utilizing the successful experience provided by the guest system, without having to undergo the trial-and-error process. All results in this paper are supported by simulation examples.</description>

      <title>Safe stabilization using generalized Lyapunov barrier function</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13624v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses the safe stabilization problem, focusing on controlling the system state to the origin while avoiding entry into unsafe state sets. The current methods for solving this issue rely on smooth Lyapunov and barrier functions, which do not always ensure the existence of an effective controller even when such smooth functions are created. To tackle this challenge, we introduce the concept of a generalized (nonsmooth) Lyapunov barrier function (GenLBF), which guarantees the existence of a safe and stable controller. We outline a systematic approach for constructing a GenLBF, including a technique for efficiently calculating the upper generalized derivative of the GenLBF. Using the constructed GenLBF, we propose a method for certifying safe stabilization of autonomous systems and design a piecewise continuous feedback control to achieve safe stabilization of non-autonomous systems. A general controller refinement strategy is further proposed to help the state trajectory escape from undesired local points occurring in systems with special physical structure. A thorough theoretical analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of our method in addressing the safe stabilization problem for systems with single or multiple bounded unsafe state sets. Extensive simulations of linear and nonlinear systems further illustrate the efficacy of the proposed method and its superiority over the smooth control Lyapunov barrier function method.</description>

      <title>Applications of Lifted Nonlinear Cuts to Convex Relaxations of the AC Power Flow Equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17541v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that valid inequalities, or lifted nonlinear cuts (LNC), can be projected to tighten the Second Order Cone (SOC), Convex DistFlow (CDF), and Network Flow (NF) relaxations of the AC Optimal Power Flow (AC-OPF) problem. We conduct experiments on 36 cases from the PGLib-OPF library for two objective functions, (1) power generation maximization and (2) generation cost minimization. Significant optimality gap improvements are shown for the maximization problem, where the LNC strengthen the SOC and CDF relaxations in 100% of the test cases, with average and maximum differences in the optimality gaps of 23.1% and 93.5% respectively. The NF relaxation is strengthened in 79.2% of test cases, with average and maximum differences in the optimality gaps of 3.45% and 21.2% respectively. We also study the trade-off between relaxation quality and solve time, demonstrating that the strengthened CDF relaxation outperforms the strengthened SOC formulation in terms of runtime and number of iterations needed, while the strengthened NF formulation is the most scalable with the lowest relaxation quality provided by these LNC.</description>

      <title>The Top Manifold Connectedness of Quantum Control Landscapes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15139v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The control of quantum systems has been proven to possess trap-free optimization landscapes under the satisfaction of proper assumptions. However, many details of the landscape geometry and their influence on search efficiency still need to be fully understood. This paper numerically explores the path-connectedness of globally optimal control solutions forming the top manifold of the landscape. We randomly sample a plurality of optimal controls in the top manifold to assess the existence of a continuous path at the top of the landscape that connects two arbitrary optimal solutions. It is shown that for different quantum control objectives including state-to-state transition probabilities, observable expectation values and unitary transformations, such a continuous path can be readily found, implying that these top manifolds are fundamentally path-connected. The significance of the latter conjecture lies in seeking locations in the top manifold where an ancillary objective can also be optimized while maintaining the full optimality of the original objective that defined the landscape.</description>

Abstract: We propose the use of latent space generative world models to address the covariate shift problem in autonomous driving. A world model is a neural network capable of predicting an agent's next state given past states and actions. By leveraging a world model during training, the driving policy effectively mitigates covariate shift without requiring an excessive amount of training data. During end-to-end training, our policy learns how to recover from errors by aligning with states observed in human demonstrations, so that at runtime it can recover from perturbations outside the training distribution. Additionally, we introduce a novel transformer-based perception encoder that employs multi-view cross-attention and a learned scene query. We present qualitative and quantitative results, demonstrating significant improvements upon prior state of the art in closed-loop testing in the CARLA simulator, as well as showing the ability to handle perturbations in both CARLA and NVIDIA's DRIVE Sim.</description>
