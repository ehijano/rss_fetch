      <title>GuitarFlow: Realistic Electric Guitar Synthesis From Tablatures via Flow Matching and Style Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Music generation in the audio domain using artificial intelligence (AI) has witnessed steady progress in recent years. However for some instruments, particularly the guitar, controllable instrument synthesis remains limited in expressivity. We introduce GuitarFlow, a model designed specifically for electric guitar synthesis. The generative process is guided using tablatures, an ubiquitous and intuitive guitar-specific symbolic format. The tablature format easily represents guitar-specific playing techniques (e.g. bends, muted strings and legatos), which are more difficult to represent in other common music notation formats such as MIDI. Our model relies on an intermediary step of first rendering the tablature to audio using a simple sample-based virtual instrument, then performing style transfer using Flow Matching in order to transform the virtual instrument audio into more realistic sounding examples. This results in a model that is quick to train and to perform inference, requiring less than 6 hours of training data. We present the results of objective evaluation metrics, together with a listening test, in which we show significant improvement in the realism of the generated guitar audio from tablatures.</description>

      <title>Streaming Generation for Music Accompaniment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Music generation models can produce high-fidelity coherent accompaniment given complete audio input, but are limited to editing and loop-based workflows. We study real-time audio-to-audio accompaniment: as a model hears an input audio stream (e.g., a singer singing), it has to also simultaneously generate in real-time a coherent accompanying stream (e.g., a guitar accompaniment). In this work, we propose a model design considering inevitable system delays in practical deployment with two design variables: future visibility $t_f$, the offset between the output playback time and the latest input time used for conditioning, and output chunk duration $k$, the number of frames emitted per call. We train Transformer decoders across a grid of $(t_f,k)$ and show two consistent trade-offs: increasing effective $t_f$ improves coherence by reducing the recency gap, but requires faster inference to stay within the latency budget; increasing $k$ improves throughput but results in degraded accompaniment due to a reduced update rate. Finally, we observe that naive maximum-likelihood streaming training is insufficient for coherent accompaniment where future context is not available, motivating advanced anticipatory and agentic objectives for live jamming.</description>

      <title>M-CIF: Multi-Scale Alignment For CIF-Based Non-Autoregressive ASR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Continuous Integrate-and-Fire (CIF) mechanism provides effective alignment for non-autoregressive (NAR) speech recognition. This mechanism creates a smooth and monotonic mapping from acoustic features to target tokens, achieving performance on Mandarin competitive with other NAR approaches. However, without finer-grained guidance, its stability degrades in some languages such as English and French. In this paper, we propose Multi-scale CIF (M-CIF), which performs multi-level alignment by integrating character and phoneme level supervision progressively distilled into subword representations, thereby enhancing robust acoustic-text alignment. Experiments show that M-CIF reduces WER compared to the Paraformer baseline, especially on CommonVoice by 4.21% in German and 3.05% in French. To further investigate these gains, we define phonetic confusion errors (PE) and space-related segmentation errors (SE) as evaluation metrics. Analysis of these metrics across different M-CIF settings reveals that the phoneme and character layers are essential for enhancing progressive CIF alignment.</description>

      <title>FOA Tokenizer: Low-bitrate Neural Codec for First Order Ambisonics with Spatial Consistency Loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural audio codecs have been widely studied for mono and stereo signals, but spatial audio remains largely unexplored. We present the first discrete neural spatial audio codec for first-order ambisonics (FOA). Building on the WavTokenizer architecture, we extend it to support four-channel FOA signals and introduce a novel spatial consistency loss to preserve directional cues in the reconstructed signals under a highly compressed representation. Our codec compresses 4-channel FOA audio at 24 kHz into 75 discrete tokens per second, corresponding to a bit rate of 0.9 kbps. Evaluations on simulated reverberant mixtures, non-reverberant clean speech, and FOA mixtures with real room impulse responses show accurate reconstruction, with mean angular errors of 13.76{\deg}, 3.96{\deg}, and 25.83{\deg}, respectively, across the three conditions. In addition, discrete latent representations derived from our codec provide useful features for downstream spatial audio tasks, as demonstrated on sound event localization and detection with STARSS23 real recordings.</description>

      <title>PromptReverb: Multimodal Room Impulse Response Generation Through Latent Rectified Flow Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Room impulse response (RIR) generation remains a critical challenge for creating immersive virtual acoustic environments. Current methods suffer from two fundamental limitations: the scarcity of full-band RIR datasets and the inability of existing models to generate acoustically accurate responses from diverse input modalities. We present PromptReverb, a two-stage generative framework that addresses these challenges. Our approach combines a variational autoencoder that upsamples band-limited RIRs to full-band quality (48 kHz), and a conditional diffusion transformer model based on rectified flow matching that generates RIRs from descriptions in natural language. Empirical evaluation demonstrates that PromptReverb produces RIRs with superior perceptual quality and acoustic accuracy compared to existing methods, achieving 8.8% mean RT60 error compared to -37% for widely used baselines and yielding more realistic room-acoustic parameters. Our method enables practical applications in virtual reality, architectural acoustics, and audio production where flexible, high-quality RIR synthesis is essential.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Multimodal Large Language Models on Core Music Perception Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) claim "musical understanding" via evaluations that conflate listening with score reading. We benchmark three SOTA LLMs (Gemini 2.5 Pro, Gemini 2.5 Flash, and Qwen2.5-Omni) across three core music skills: Syncopation Scoring, Transposition Detection, and Chord Quality Identification. Moreover, we separate three sources of variability: (i) perceptual limitations (audio vs. MIDI inputs), (ii) exposure to examples (zero- vs. few-shot manipulations), and (iii) reasoning strategies (Standalone, CoT, LogicLM). For the latter we adapt LogicLM, a framework combining LLMs with symbolic solvers to perform structured reasoning, to music. Results reveal a clear perceptual gap: models perform near ceiling on MIDI but show accuracy drops on audio. Reasoning and few-shot prompting offer minimal gains. This is expected for MIDI, where performance reaches saturation, but more surprising for audio, where LogicLM, despite near-perfect MIDI accuracy, remains notably brittle. Among models, Gemini Pro achieves the highest performance across most conditions. Overall, current systems reason well over symbols (MIDI) but do not yet "listen" reliably from audio. Our method and dataset make the perception-reasoning boundary explicit and offer actionable guidance for building robust, audio-first music systems.</description>

      <title>SAO-Instruct: Free-form Audio Editing using Natural Language Instructions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative models have made significant progress in synthesizing high-fidelity audio from short textual descriptions. However, editing existing audio using natural language has remained largely underexplored. Current approaches either require the complete description of the edited audio or are constrained to predefined edit instructions that lack flexibility. In this work, we introduce SAO-Instruct, a model based on Stable Audio Open capable of editing audio clips using any free-form natural language instruction. To train our model, we create a dataset of audio editing triplets (input audio, edit instruction, output audio) using Prompt-to-Prompt, DDPM inversion, and a manual editing pipeline. Although partially trained on synthetic data, our model generalizes well to real in-the-wild audio clips and unseen edit instructions. We demonstrate that SAO-Instruct achieves competitive performance on objective metrics and outperforms other audio editing approaches in a subjective listening study. To encourage future research, we release our code and model weights.</description>

      <title>TwinShift: Benchmarking Audio Deepfake Detection across Synthesizer and Speaker Shifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Audio deepfakes pose a growing threat, already exploited in fraud and misinformation. A key challenge is ensuring detectors remain robust to unseen synthesis methods and diverse speakers, since generation techniques evolve quickly. Despite strong benchmark results, current systems struggle to generalize to new conditions limiting real-world reliability. To address this, we introduce TWINSHIFT, a benchmark explicitly designed to evaluate detection robustness under strictly unseen conditions. Our benchmark is constructed from six different synthesis systems, each paired with disjoint sets of speakers, allowing for a rigorous assessment of how well detectors generalize when both the generative model and the speaker identity change. Through extensive experiments, we show that TWINSHIFT reveals important robustness gaps, uncover overlooked limitations, and provide principled guidance for developing ADD systems. The TWINSHIFT benchmark can be accessed at https://github.com/intheMeantime/TWINSHIFT.</description>

      <title>Low-Resource Audio Codec (LRAC): 2025 Challenge Description</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While recent neural audio codecs deliver superior speech quality at ultralow bitrates over traditional methods, their practical adoption is hindered by obstacles related to low-resource operation and robustness to acoustic distortions. Edge deployment scenarios demand codecs that operate under stringent compute constraints while maintaining low latency and bitrate. The presence of background noise and reverberation further necessitates designs that are resilient to such degradations. The performance of neural codecs under these constraints and their integration with speech enhancement remain largely unaddressed. To catalyze progress in this area, we introduce the 2025 Low-Resource Audio Codec Challenge, which targets the development of neural and hybrid codecs for resource-constrained applications. Participants are supported with a standardized training dataset, two baseline systems, and a comprehensive evaluation framework. The challenge is expected to yield valuable insights applicable to both codec design and related downstream audio tasks.</description>

      <title>Learning Linearity in Audio Consistency Autoencoders via Implicit Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Audio autoencoders learn useful, compressed audio representations, but their non-linear latent spaces prevent intuitive algebraic manipulation such as mixing or scaling. We introduce a simple training methodology to induce linearity in a high-compression Consistency Autoencoder (CAE) by using data augmentation, thereby inducing homogeneity (equivariance to scalar gain) and additivity (the decoder preserves addition) without altering the model's architecture or loss function. When trained with our method, the CAE exhibits linear behavior in both the encoder and decoder while preserving reconstruction fidelity. We test the practical utility of our learned space on music source composition and separation via simple latent arithmetic. This work presents a straightforward technique for constructing structured latent spaces, enabling more intuitive and efficient audio processing.</description>

      <title>ISA-Bench: Benchmarking Instruction Sensitivity for Large Audio Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Audio Language Models (LALMs), which couple acoustic perception with large language models (LLMs) to extract and understand diverse information from audio, have attracted intense interest from both academic and industrial communities. However, existing LALMs are highly sensitive to how instructions are phrased, affecting both (i) instruction-following rates and (ii) task performance. Yet, no existing benchmarks offer a systematic and comprehensive evaluation of this sensitivity. We introduce ISA-Bench, a dynamic benchmark evaluating instruction sensitivity for LALMs along three axes: instruction description, output format, and task composition. We assess recent open-source and proprietary LALMs using ISA-Bench, profiling both compliance and accuracy under controlled instruction variations. Experimental results reveal that even state-of-the-art LALMs suffer significant instruction sensitivity, leading to degraded performance on fundamental audio understanding tasks. To mitigate this issue, we fine-tune Qwen2-Audio on a specifically constructed complex instruction-variant dataset, achieving a marked improvement in instruction-following performance. However, this also induces nontrivial catastrophic forgetting: the model loses some previously mastered task capabilities when exposed to new instruction styles. Our benchmark provides a standardized basis for assessing and improving instruction sensitivity in LALMs, underscoring the need for instruction-robust audio understanding in real-world pipelines.</description>

      <title>DialoSpeech: Dual-Speaker Dialogue Generation with LLM and Flow Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis, particularly those leveraging large language models (LLMs), have significantly improved expressiveness and naturalness. However, generating human-like, interactive dialogue speech remains challenging. Current systems face limitations due to the scarcity of dual-track data and difficulties in achieving naturalness, contextual coherence, and interactional dynamics, such as turn-taking, overlapping speech, and speaker consistency, in multi-turn conversations. To address these challenges, we propose DialoSpeech, a dual-track architecture combining a large language model with Chunked Flow Matching for expressive, human-like dialogue speech synthesis. DialoSpeech generates natural multi-turn conversations with coherent speaker turns and natural overlaps, supporting both Chinese and English and cross-lingual speech synthesis. We introduce a data processing pipeline to construct dual-track dialogue datasets, facilitating scalable training and experimental validation. Experiments show that our model outperforms baselines, offering a solution for generating human-like spoken dialogues.

      <title>Quantifying Multimodal Imbalance: A GMM-Guided Adaptive Loss for Audio-Visual Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current mainstream approaches to addressing multimodal imbalance primarily focus on architectural modifications and optimization-based, often overlooking a quantitative analysis of the imbalance degree between modalities. To address this gap, our work introduces a novel method for the quantitative analysis of multi-modal imbalance, which in turn informs the design of a sample-level adaptive loss function.We begin by defining the "Modality Gap" as the difference between the Softmax scores of different modalities (e.g., audio and visual) for the ground-truth class prediction. Analysis of the Modality Gap distribution reveals that it can be effectively modeled by a bimodal Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). These two components are found to correspond respectively to "modality-balanced" and "modality-imbalanced" data samples. Subsequently, we apply Bayes' theorem to compute the posterior probability of each sample belonging to these two distinct distributions.Informed by this quantitative analysis, we design a novel adaptive loss function with three objectives: (1) to minimize the overall Modality Gap; (2) to encourage the imbalanced sample distribution to shift towards the balanced one; and (3) to apply greater penalty weights to imbalanced samples. We employ a two-stage training strategy consisting of a warm-up phase followed by an adaptive training phase.Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on the public CREMA-D and AVE datasets, attaining accuracies of $80.65\%$ and $70.90\%$, respectively. This validates the effectiveness of our proposed methodology.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Attention Sinks and Massive Activations in Audio-Visual Speech Recognition with LLMS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently advanced auditory speech recognition (ASR), visual speech recognition (VSR), and audio-visual speech recognition (AVSR). However, understanding of their internal dynamics under fine-tuning remains limited. In natural language processing, recent work has revealed attention sinks, tokens that attract disproportionately high attention, and associated massive activations in which some features of sink tokens exhibit huge activation in LLMs. In this work, we are the first to study these phenomena in multimodal speech recognition. Through a detailed analysis of audio-visual LLMs, we identify attention sinks and massive activations not only at the BOS token but also at intermediate low-semantic tokens across ASR, VSR, and AVSR. We show that massive activations originate in the MLP layers and correspond to fixed feature indices across all sink tokens. We further show that intermediate sink tokens exhibit high cosine similarity to the BOS token, thereby amplifying attention and activation. Building on these insights, we introduce a simple decorrelation loss that reduces cosine similarity between BOS and other tokens, effectively mitigating intermediate sinks and massive activations. Furthermore, our method improves word error rate (WER) under high audio-visual feature downsampling while remaining stable at lower downsampling rates.</description>

      <title>Arabic Little STT: Arabic Children Speech Recognition Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The performance of Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems fundamentally depends on high-quality training data. However, low-resource languages like Arabic suffer from severe data scarcity. Moreover, the absence of child-specific speech corpora is an essential gap that poses significant challenges. To address this gap, we present our created dataset, Arabic Little STT, a dataset of Levantine Arabic child speech recorded in classrooms, containing 355 utterances from 288 children (ages 6 - 13). We further conduct a systematic assessment of Whisper, a state-of-the-art automatic speech recognition (ASR) model, on this dataset and compare its performance with adult Arabic benchmarks. Our evaluation across eight Whisper variants reveals that even the best-performing model (Large_v3) struggles significantly, achieving a 0.66 word error rate (WER) on child speech, starkly contrasting with its sub 0.20 WER on adult datasets. These results align with other research on English speech. Results highlight the critical need for dedicated child speech benchmarks and inclusive training data in ASR development. Emphasizing that such data must be governed by strict ethical and privacy frameworks to protect sensitive child information. We hope that this study provides an initial step for future work on equitable speech technologies for Arabic-speaking children. We hope that our publicly available dataset enrich the children's demographic representation in ASR datasets.</description>

      <title>LibriConvo: Simulating Conversations from Read Literature for ASR and Diarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce LibriConvo, a simulated multi-speaker conversational dataset based on speaker-aware conversation simulation (SASC), designed to support training and evaluation of speaker diarization and automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems. Unlike prior resources that mostly rely on semantically disconnected utterances and implausible temporal gaps, LibriConvo ensures semantic coherence and realistic conversational timing. Our pipeline leverages CallHome with external VAD for reliable boundaries, applies compression to reduce unnaturally long silences, and organizes LibriTTS utterances by book to maintain contextual consistency. Acoustic realism is enhanced via a novel room impulse response selection procedure that ranks speaker-microphone configurations by spatial plausibility, balancing realism and diversity. The dataset comprises 240.1 hours across 1,496 dialogues with 830 unique speakers, split in a speaker-disjoint manner for robust evaluation. Baselines show that the sortformer model outperforms the pyannote pipeline in diarization, while a fine-tuned Fast Conformer-CTC XLarge with Serialized Output Training achieves 7.29\% WER for ASR, surpassing zero-shot Whisper-large-v3. LibriConvo provides a valuable resource for advancing multi-speaker speech processing research with realistic conversational dynamics and controlled experimental conditions.</description>

      <title>SoulX-Podcast: Towards Realistic Long-form Podcasts with Dialectal and Paralinguistic Diversity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23541v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis have significantly improved speech expressiveness and naturalness. However, most existing systems are tailored for single-speaker synthesis and fall short in generating coherent multi-speaker conversational speech. This technical report presents SoulX-Podcast, a system designed for podcast-style multi-turn, multi-speaker dialogic speech generation, while also achieving state-of-the-art performance in conventional TTS tasks.
  To meet the higher naturalness demands of multi-turn spoken dialogue, SoulX-Podcast integrates a range of paralinguistic controls and supports both Mandarin and English, as well as several Chinese dialects, including Sichuanese, Henanese, and Cantonese, enabling more personalized podcast-style speech generation. Experimental results demonstrate that SoulX-Podcast can continuously produce over 90 minutes of conversation with stable speaker timbre and smooth speaker transitions. Moreover, speakers exhibit contextually adaptive prosody, reflecting natural rhythm and intonation changes as dialogues progress. Across multiple evaluation metrics, SoulX-Podcast achieves state-of-the-art performance in both monologue TTS and multi-turn conversational speech synthesis.</description>

      <title>Memristive Nanowire Network for Energy Efficient Audio Classification: Pre-Processing-Free Reservoir Computing with Reduced Latency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19611v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Efficient audio feature extraction is critical for low-latency, resource-constrained speech recognition. Conventional preprocessing techniques, such as Mel Spectrogram, Perceptual Linear Prediction (PLP), and Learnable Spectrogram, achieve high classification accuracy but require large feature sets and significant computation. The low-latency and power efficiency benefits of neuromorphic computing offer a strong potential for audio classification. Here, we introduce memristive nanowire networks as a neuromorphic hardware preprocessing layer for spoken-digit classification, a capability not previously demonstrated. Nanowire networks extract compact, informative features directly from raw audio, achieving a favorable trade-off between accuracy, dimensionality reduction from the original audio size (data compression) , and training time efficiency. Compared with state-of-the-art software techniques, nanowire features reach 98.95% accuracy with 66 times data compression (XGBoost) and 97.9% accuracy with 255 times compression (Random Forest) in sub-second training latency. Across multiple classifiers nanowire features consistently achieve more than 90% accuracy with more than 62.5 times compression, outperforming features extracted by conventional state-of-the-art techniques such as MFCC in efficiency without loss of performance. Moreover, nanowire features achieve 96.5% accuracy classifying multispeaker audios, outperforming all state-of-the-art feature accuracies while achieving the highest data compression and lowest training time. Nanowire network preprocessing also enhances linear separability of audio data, improving simple classifier performance and generalizing across speakers. These results demonstrate that memristive nanowire networks provide a novel, low-latency, and data-efficient feature extraction approach, enabling high-performance neuromorphic audio classification.</description>

      <title>$\texttt{AVROBUSTBENCH}$: Benchmarking the Robustness of Audio-Visual Recognition Models at Test-Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00358v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While recent audio-visual models have demonstrated impressive performance, their robustness to distributional shifts at test-time remains not fully understood. Existing robustness benchmarks mainly focus on single modalities, making them insufficient for thoroughly assessing the robustness of audio-visual models. Motivated by real-world scenarios where shifts can occur $\textit{simultaneously}$ in both audio and visual modalities, we introduce $\texttt{AVROBUSTBENCH}$, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the test-time robustness of audio-visual recognition models. $\texttt{AVROBUSTBENCH}$ comprises four audio-visual benchmark datasets, $\texttt{AUDIOSET-2C}$, $\texttt{VGGSOUND-2C}$, $\texttt{KINETICS-2C}$, and $\texttt{EPICKITCHENS-2C}$, each incorporating 75 bimodal audio-visual corruptions that are $\textit{co-occurring}$ and $\textit{correlated}$. Through extensive evaluations, we observe that state-of-the-art supervised and self-supervised audio-visual models exhibit declining robustness as corruption severity increases. Furthermore, online test-time adaptation (TTA) methods, on $\texttt{VGGSOUND-2C}$ and $\texttt{KINETICS-2C}$, offer minimal improvements in performance under bimodal corruptions. We further propose $\texttt{AV2C}$, a simple TTA approach enabling on-the-fly cross-modal fusion by penalizing high-entropy samples, which achieves improvements on $\texttt{VGGSOUND-2C}$. We hope that $\texttt{AVROBUSTBENCH}$ will steer the development of more effective and robust audio-visual TTA approaches. Our code is available $\href{https://github.com/sarthaxxxxx/AV-C-Robustness-Benchmark}{here}$.</description>

      <title>Detect Any Sound: Open-Vocabulary Sound Event Detection with Multi-Modal Queries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16343v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Most existing sound event detection~(SED) algorithms operate under a closed-set assumption, restricting their detection capabilities to predefined classes. While recent efforts have explored language-driven zero-shot SED by exploiting audio-language models, their performance is still far from satisfactory due to the lack of fine-grained alignment and cross-modal feature fusion. In this work, we propose the Detect Any Sound Model (DASM), a query-based framework for open-vocabulary SED guided by multi-modal queries. DASM formulates SED as a frame-level retrieval task, where audio features are matched against query vectors derived from text or audio prompts. To support this formulation, DASM introduces a dual-stream decoder that explicitly decouples event recognition and temporal localization: a cross-modality event decoder performs query-feature fusion and determines the presence of sound events at the clip-level, while a context network models temporal dependencies for frame-level localization. Additionally, an inference-time attention masking strategy is proposed to leverage semantic relations between base and novel classes, substantially enhancing generalization to novel classes. Experiments on the AudioSet Strong dataset demonstrate that DASM effectively balances localization accuracy with generalization to novel classes, outperforming CLAP-based methods in open-vocabulary setting (+ 7.8 PSDS) and the baseline in the closed-set setting (+ 6.9 PSDS). Furthermore, in cross-dataset zero-shot evaluation on DESED, DASM achieves a PSDS1 score of 42.2, even exceeding the supervised CRNN baseline.

      <title>PESTO: Real-Time Pitch Estimation with Self-supervised Transposition-equivariant Objective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01488v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce PESTO, a self-supervised learning approach for single-pitch estimation using a Siamese architecture. Our model processes individual frames of a Variable-$Q$ Transform (VQT) and predicts pitch distributions. The neural network is designed to be equivariant to translations, notably thanks to a Toeplitz fully-connected layer. In addition, we construct pitch-shifted pairs by translating and cropping the VQT frames and train our model with a novel class-based transposition-equivariant objective, eliminating the need for annotated data. Thanks to this architecture and training objective, our model achieves remarkable performances while being very lightweight ($130$k parameters). Evaluations on music and speech datasets (MIR-1K, MDB-stem-synth, and PTDB) demonstrate that PESTO not only outperforms self-supervised baselines but also competes with supervised methods, exhibiting superior cross-dataset generalization. Finally, we enhance PESTO's practical utility by developing a streamable VQT implementation using cached convolutions. Combined with our model's low latency (less than 10 ms) and minimal parameter count, this makes PESTO particularly suitable for real-time applications.</description>

      <title>EmoSteer-TTS: Fine-Grained and Training-Free Emotion-Controllable Text-to-Speech via Activation Steering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03543v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Text-to-speech (TTS) has shown great progress in recent years. However, most existing TTS systems offer only coarse and rigid emotion control, typically via discrete emotion labels or a carefully crafted and detailed emotional text prompt, making fine-grained emotion manipulation either inaccessible or unstable. These models also require extensive, high-quality datasets for training. To address these limitations, we propose EmoSteer-TTS, a novel training-free approach, to achieve fine-grained speech emotion control (conversion, interpolation, erasure) by activation steering. We first empirically observe that modifying a subset of the internal activations within a flow matching-based TTS model can effectively alter the emotional tone of synthesized speech. Building on this insight, we then develop a training-free and efficient algorithm, including activation extraction, emotional token searching, and inference-time steering, which can be seamlessly integrated into a wide range of pretrained models (e.g., F5-TTS, CosyVoice2, and E2-TTS). In addition, to derive effective steering vectors, we construct a curated emotional speech dataset with diverse speakers. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EmoSteer-TTS enables fine-grained, interpretable, and continuous control over speech emotion, outperforming the state-of-the-art (SOTA). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first method that achieves training-free and continuous fine-grained emotion control in TTS. Demo samples are available at https://emosteer-tts-demo.pages.dev/.</description>

      <title>ARIONet: An Advanced Self-supervised Contrastive Representation Network for Birdsong Classification and Future Frame Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00522v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Automated birdsong classification is essential for advancing ecological monitoring and biodiversity studies. Despite recent progress, existing methods often depend heavily on labeled data, use limited feature representations, and overlook temporal dynamics essential for accurate species identification. In this work, we propose a self-supervised contrastive network, ARIONet (Acoustic Representation for Interframe Objective Network), that jointly optimizes contrastive classification and future frame prediction using augmented audio representations. The model simultaneously integrates multiple complementary audio features within a transformer-based encoder model. Our framework is designed with two key objectives: (1) to learn discriminative species-specific representations for contrastive learning through maximizing similarity between augmented views of the same audio segment while pushing apart different samples, and (2) to model temporal dynamics by predicting future audio frames, both without requiring large-scale annotations. We validate our framework on four diverse birdsong datasets, including the British Birdsong Dataset, Bird Song Dataset, and two extended Xeno-Canto subsets (A-M and N-Z). Our method consistently outperforms existing baselines and achieves classification accuracies of 98.41%, 93.07%, 91.89%, and 91.58%, and F1-scores of 97.84%, 94.10%, 91.29%, and 90.94%, respectively. Furthermore, it demonstrates low mean absolute errors and high cosine similarity, up to 95\%, in future frame prediction tasks. Extensive experiments further confirm the effectiveness of our self-supervised learning strategy in capturing complex acoustic patterns and temporal dependencies, as well as its potential for real-world applicability in ecological conservation and monitoring.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.11507v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sampling, the technique of reusing pieces of existing audio tracks to create new music content, is a very common practice in modern music production. In this paper, we tackle the challenging task of automatic sample identification, that is, detecting such sampled content and retrieving the material from which it originates. To do so, we adopt a self-supervised learning approach that leverages a multi-track dataset to create positive pairs of artificial mixes, and design a novel contrastive learning objective. We show that such method significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art baselines, that is robust to various genres, and that scales well when increasing the number of noise songs in the reference database. In addition, we extensively analyze the contribution of the different components of our training pipeline and highlight, in particular, the need for high-quality separated stems for this task.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.02265v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of pitch estimation using Self Supervised Learning (SSL). The SSL paradigm we use is equivariance to pitch transposition, which enables our model to accurately perform pitch estimation on monophonic audio after being trained only on a small unlabeled dataset. We use a lightweight ($&lt;$ 30k parameters) Siamese neural network that takes as inputs two different pitch-shifted versions of the same audio represented by its Constant-Q Transform. To prevent the model from collapsing in an encoder-only setting, we propose a novel class-based transposition-equivariant objective which captures pitch information. Furthermore, we design the architecture of our network to be transposition-preserving by introducing learnable Toeplitz matrices.
  We evaluate our model for the two tasks of singing voice and musical instrument pitch estimation and show that our model is able to generalize across tasks and datasets while being lightweight, hence remaining compatible with low-resource devices and suitable for real-time applications. In particular, our results surpass self-supervised baselines and narrow the performance gap between self-supervised and supervised methods for pitch estimation.</description>

      <title>FocalCodec: Low-Bitrate Speech Coding via Focal Modulation Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04465v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models have revolutionized natural language processing through self-supervised pretraining on massive datasets. Inspired by this success, researchers have explored adapting these methods to speech by discretizing continuous audio into tokens using neural audio codecs. However, existing approaches face limitations, including high bitrates, the loss of either semantic or acoustic information, and the reliance on multi-codebook designs when trying to capture both, which increases architectural complexity for downstream tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce FocalCodec, an efficient low-bitrate codec based on focal modulation that utilizes a single binary codebook to compress speech between 0.16 and 0.65 kbps. FocalCodec delivers competitive performance in speech resynthesis and voice conversion at lower bitrates than the current state-of-the-art, while effectively handling multilingual speech and noisy environments. Evaluation on downstream tasks shows that FocalCodec successfully preserves sufficient semantic and acoustic information, while also being well-suited for generative modeling. Demo samples and code are available at https://lucadellalib.github.io/focalcodec-web/.</description>

      <title>Nes2Net: A Lightweight Nested Architecture for Foundation Model Driven Speech Anti-spoofing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05657v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Speech foundation models have significantly advanced various speech-related tasks by providing exceptional representation capabilities. However, their high-dimensional output features often create a mismatch with downstream task models, which typically require lower-dimensional inputs. A common solution is to apply a dimensionality reduction (DR) layer, but this approach increases parameter overhead, computational costs, and risks losing valuable information. To address these issues, we propose Nested Res2Net (Nes2Net), a lightweight back-end architecture designed to directly process high-dimensional features without DR layers. The nested structure enhances multi-scale feature extraction, improves feature interaction, and preserves high-dimensional information. We first validate Nes2Net on CtrSVDD, a singing voice deepfake detection dataset, and report a 22% performance improvement and an 87% back-end computational cost reduction over the state-of-the-art baseline. Additionally, extensive testing across four diverse datasets: ASVspoof 2021, ASVspoof 5, PartialSpoof, and In-the-Wild, covering fully spoofed speech, adversarial attacks, partial spoofing, and real-world scenarios, consistently highlights Nes2Net's superior robustness and generalization capabilities. The code package and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/Liu-Tianchi/Nes2Net.</description>

      <title>OpenS2S: Advancing Fully Open-Source End-to-End Empathetic Large Speech Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05177v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Empathetic interaction is a cornerstone of human-machine communication, due to the need for understanding speech enriched with paralinguistic cues and generating emotional and expressive responses. However, the most powerful empathetic LSLMs are increasingly closed off, leaving the crucial details about the architecture, data and development opaque to researchers. Given the critical need for transparent research into the LSLMs and empathetic behavior, we present OpenS2S, a fully open-source, transparent and end-to-end LSLM designed to enable empathetic speech interactions. Based on our empathetic speech-to-text model BLSP-Emo, OpenS2S further employs a streaming interleaved decoding architecture to achieve low-latency speech generation. To facilitate end-to-end training, OpenS2S incorporates an automated data construction pipeline that synthesizes diverse, high-quality empathetic speech dialogues at low cost. By leveraging large language models to generate empathetic content and controllable text-to-speech systems to introduce speaker and emotional variation, we construct a scalable training corpus with rich paralinguistic diversity and minimal human supervision. We release the fully open-source OpenS2S model, including the dataset, model weights, pre-training and fine-tuning codes, to empower the broader research community and accelerate innovation in empathetic speech systems.

      <title>Audio Does Matter: Importance-Aware Multi-Granularity Fusion for Video Moment Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04273v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Video Moment Retrieval (VMR) aims to retrieve a specific moment semantically related to the given query. To tackle this task, most existing VMR methods solely focus on the visual and textual modalities while neglecting the complementary but important audio modality. Although a few recent works try to tackle the joint audio-vision-text reasoning, they treat all modalities equally and simply embed them without fine-grained interaction for moment retrieval. These designs are counter-practical as: Not all audios are helpful for video moment retrieval, and the audio of some videos may be complete noise or background sound that is meaningless to the moment determination. To this end, we propose a novel Importance-aware Multi-Granularity fusion model (IMG), which learns to dynamically and selectively aggregate the audio-vision-text contexts for VMR. Specifically, after integrating the textual guidance with vision and audio separately, we first design a pseudo-label-supervised audio importance predictor that predicts the importance score of the audio, and accordingly assigns weights to mitigate the interference caused by noisy audio. Then, we design a multi-granularity audio fusion module that adaptively fuses audio and visual modalities at local-, event-, and global-level, fully capturing their complementary contexts. We further propose a cross-modal knowledge distillation strategy to address the challenge of missing audio modality during inference. To evaluate our method, we further construct a new VMR dataset, i.e., Charades-AudioMatter, where audio-related samples are manually selected and re-organized from the original Charades-STA to validate the model's capability in utilizing audio modality. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our method, achieving state-of-the-art with audio-video fusion in VMR methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/HuiGuanLab/IMG.</description>

      <title>Pindrop it! Audio and Visual Deepfake Countermeasures for Robust Detection and Fine Grained-Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08141v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The field of visual and audio generation is burgeoning with new state-of-the-art methods. This rapid proliferation of new techniques underscores the need for robust solutions for detecting synthetic content in videos. In particular, when fine-grained alterations via localized manipulations are performed in visual, audio, or both domains, these subtle modifications add challenges to the detection algorithms. This paper presents solutions for the problems of deepfake video classification and localization. The methods were submitted to the ACM 1M Deepfakes Detection Challenge, achieving the best performance in the temporal localization task and a top four ranking in the classification task for the TestA split of the evaluation dataset.</description>

      <title>ReFESS-QI: Reference-Free Evaluation For Speech Separation With Joint Quality And Intelligibility Scoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21014v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Source separation is a crucial pre-processing step for various speech processing tasks, such as automatic speech recognition (ASR). Traditionally, the evaluation metrics for speech separation rely on the matched reference audios and corresponding transcriptions to assess audio quality and intelligibility. However, they cannot be used to evaluate real-world mixtures for which no reference exists. This paper introduces a text-free reference-free evaluation framework based on self-supervised learning (SSL) representations. The proposed framework utilize the mixture and separated tracks to predict jointly audio quality, through the Scale Invariant Signal to Noise Ratio (SI-SNR) metric, and speech intelligibility through the Word Error Rate (WER) metric. We conducted experiments on the WHAMR! dataset, which shows a WER estimation with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 17% and a Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) of 0.77; and SI-SNR estimation with an MAE of 1.38 and PCC of 0.95. We further demonstrate the robustness of our estimator by using various SSL representations.</description>

      <title>WhaleVAD-BPN: Improving Baleen Whale Call Detection with Boundary Proposal Networks and Post-processing Optimisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21280v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While recent sound event detection (SED) systems can identify baleen whale calls in marine audio, challenges related to false positive and minority-class detection persist. We propose the boundary proposal network (BPN), which extends an existing lightweight SED system. The BPN is inspired by work in image object detection and aims to reduce the number of false positive detections. It achieves this by using intermediate latent representations computed within the backbone classification model to gate the final output. When added to an existing SED system, the BPN achieves a 16.8 % absolute increase in precision, as well as 21.3 % and 9.4 % improvements in the F1-score for minority-class d-calls and bp-calls, respectively. We further consider two approaches to the selection of post-processing hyperparameters: a forward-search and a backward-search. By separately optimising event-level and frame-level hyperparameters, these two approaches lead to considerable performance improvements over parameters selected using empirical methods. The complete WhaleVAD-BPN system achieves a cross-validated development F1-score of 0.475, which is a 9.8 % absolute improvement over the baseline.</description>
