      <title>About the Rankin and Berg\'e-Martinet Constants from a Coding Theory View Point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Rankin constant $\gamma_{n,l}$ measures the largest volume of the densest sublattice of rank $l$ of a lattice $\Lambda\in \RR^n$ over all such lattices of rank $n$. The Berg\'e-Martinet constant $\gamma'_{n,l}$ is a variation that takes into account the dual lattice. Exact values and bounds for both constants are mostly open in general. We consider the case of lattices built from linear codes, and look at bounds on $\gamma_{n,l}$ and $\gamma'_{n,l}$. In particular, we revisit known results for $n=3,4,5,8$ and give lower and upper bounds for the open cases $\gamma_{5,2},\gamma_{7,2}$ and $\gamma'_{5,2},\gamma'_{7,2}$.</description>

      <title>Universal Training of Neural Networks to Achieve Bayes Optimal Classification Accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work invokes the notion of $f$-divergence to introduce a novel upper bound on the Bayes error rate of a general classification task. We show that the proposed bound can be computed by sampling from the output of a parameterized model. Using this practical interpretation, we introduce the Bayes optimal learning threshold (BOLT) loss whose minimization enforces a classification model to achieve the Bayes error rate. We validate the proposed loss for image and text classification tasks, considering MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and IMDb datasets. Numerical experiments demonstrate that models trained with BOLT achieve performance on par with or exceeding that of cross-entropy, particularly on challenging datasets. This highlights the potential of BOLT in improving generalization.</description>

      <title>Distributed Nonparametric Estimation: from Sparse to Dense Samples per Terminal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider the communication-constrained problem of nonparametric function estimation, in which each distributed terminal holds multiple i.i.d. samples. Under certain regularity assumptions, we characterize the minimax optimal rates for all regimes, and identify phase transitions of the optimal rates as the samples per terminal vary from sparse to dense. This fully solves the problem left open by previous works, whose scopes are limited to regimes with either dense samples or a single sample per terminal. To achieve the optimal rates, we design a layered estimation protocol by exploiting protocols for the parametric density estimation problem. We show the optimality of the protocol using information-theoretic methods and strong data processing inequalities, and incorporating the classic balls and bins model. The optimal rates are immediate for various special cases such as density estimation, Gaussian, binary, Poisson and heteroskedastic regression models.</description>

      <title>Some observations on the ambivalent role of symmetries in Bayesian inference problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07975v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We collect in this note some observations on the role of symmetries in Bayesian inference problems, that can be useful or detrimental depending on the way they act on the signal and on the observations. We emphasize in particular the need to gauge away unobservable invariances in the definition of a distance between a signal and its estimator, and the consequences this implies for the statistical mechanics treatment of such models, taking as a motivating example the extensive rank matrix factorization problem.</description>

      <title>Orthogonal Delay-Doppler Division Multiplexing Modulation with Hierarchical Mode-Based Index Modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08026v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The orthogonal time frequency space with index modulation (OTFS-IM) offers flexible tradeoffs between spectral efficiency (SE) and bit error rate (BER) in doubly selective fading channels. While OTFS-IM schemes demonstrated such potential, a persistent challenge lies in the detection complexity. To address this problem, we propose the hierarchical mode-based index modulation (HMIM). HMIM introduces a novel approach to modulate information bits by IM patterns, significantly simplifying the complexity of maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation with Gaussian noise. Further, we incorporate HMIM with the recently proposed orthogonal delay-Doppler division multiplexing (ODDM) modulation, namely ODDM-HMIM, to exploit the full diversity of the delay-Doppler (DD) channel. The BER performance of ODDM-HMIM is analyzed considering a maximum likelihood (ML) detector. Our numerical results reveal that, with the same SE, HMIM can outperform conventional IM in terms of both BER and computational complexity. In addition, we propose a successive interference cancellation-based minimum mean square error (SIC-MMSE) detector for ODDM-HMIM, which enables low-complexity detection with large frame sizes.</description>

      <title>Decoding Quantum LDPC Codes using Collaborative Check Node Removal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08036v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The fault tolerance of quantum devices requires on-par contributions from error-correcting codes and suitable decoders.
  One of the most explored error-correcting codes is the family of Quantum Low-Density Parity Check (QLDPC) codes.
  Although faster than many of the reported decoders for QLDPC codes, iterative decoders fail due to the colossal degeneracy and short cycles intrinsic to these codes.
  We present a strategy to improve the performance of the iterative decoders based on a collaborative way to use the message passing of the iterative decoders and check node removal from the code's Tanner graph.
  We use the concept of bit separation and generalize it to qubit separation.
  This gives us a metric to analyze and improve the decoder's performance towards harmful configurations of QLDPC codes.
  We present a simple decoding architecture to overcome iterative decoding failures by increasing the separation of trapped qubits without incurring any significant overhead.</description>

      <title>Iterated Entropy Derivatives and Binary Entropy Inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14743v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We embark on a systematic study of the $(k+1)$-th derivative of $x^{k-r}H(x^r)$, where $H(x):=-x\log x-(1-x)\log(1-x)$ is the binary entropy and $k&gt;r\geq 1$ are integers. Our motivation is the conjectural entropy inequality $\alpha_k H(x^k)\geq x^{k-1}H(x)$, where $0&lt;\alpha_k&lt;1$ is given by a functional equation. The $k=2$ case was the key technical tool driving recent breakthroughs on the union-closed sets conjecture. We express $ \frac{d^{k+1}}{dx^{k+1}}x^{k-r}H(x^r)$ as a rational function, an infinite series, and a sum over generalized Stirling numbers. This allows us to reduce the proof of the entropy inequality for real $k$ to showing that an associated polynomial has only two real roots in the interval $(0,1)$, which also allows us to prove the inequality for fractional exponents such as $k=3/2$. The proof suggests a new framework for proving tight inequalities for the sum of polynomials times the logarithms of polynomials, which converts the inequality into a statement about the real roots of a simpler associated polynomial.</description>

      <title>Joint Beamforming Optimization and Mode Selection for RDARS-Aided MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11205v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has emerged as a cost-effective solution for green communications in 6G. However, its further extensive use has been greatly limited due to its fully passive characteristics. Considering the appealing distribution gains of distributed antenna systems (DAS), a flexible reconfigurable architecture called reconfigurable distributed antenna and reflecting surface (RDARS) is proposed. RDARS encompasses DAS and RIS as two special cases and maintains the advantages of distributed antennas while reducing the hardware cost by replacing some active antennas with low-cost passive reflecting surfaces. In this paper, we present a RDARS-aided uplink multi-user communication system and investigate the system transmission reliability with the newly proposed architecture. Specifically, in addition to the distribution gain and the reflection gain provided by the connection and reflection modes, respectively, we also consider the dynamic mode switching of each element which introduces an additional degree of freedom (DoF) and thus results in a selection gain. As such, we aim to minimize the total sum mean-square-error (MSE) of all data streams by jointly optimizing the receive beamforming matrix, the reflection phase shifts and the channel-aware placement of elements in the connection mode. Numerical results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed architecture compared to the conventional fully passive RIS or DAS. Furthermore, some insights about the practical implementation of RDARS are provided.</description>

Abstract: The pursuit of higher data rates and efficient spectrum utilization in modern communication technologies necessitates novel solutions. In order to provide insights into improving spectral efficiency and reducing latency, this study investigates the maximum channel coding rate (MCCR) of finite block length (FBL) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) faster-than-Nyquist (FTN) channels. By optimizing power allocation, we derive the system's MCCR expression. Simulation results are compared with the existing literature to reveal the benefits of FTN in FBL transmission.</description>

      <title>Information Rates of Successive Interference Cancellation for Optical Fiber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15240v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Joint detection and decoding (JDD) achieves rates based on information theory but is too complex to implement for many channels with memory or nonlinearities. Successive interference cancellation (SIC) at the receiver, combined with multistage encoding at the transmitter, is a method that lets one use coded modulation for memoryless channels to approach JDD rates. A SIC-based receiver is presented to compensate for inter-channel interference in long-haul optical fiber links. Simulations for 1000 km of standard single-mode fiber with ideal distributed Raman amplification, single-polarization transmission, and circularly symmetric complex Gaussian (CSCG) modulation show that SIC attains the achievable information rates (AIRs) of JDD using surrogate channel models with correlated phase and additive noise (CPAN). Moreover, the AIRs of ring constellations are compared to those of CSCG modulation. Simulations show that 32 rings, 16 SIC-stages, and Gaussian message passing on the factor graph of the CPAN surrogate model achieve the JDD rates of CSCG modulation. The computational complexity scales in proportion to the number of SIC-stages, where one stage has complexity similar to separate detection and decoding.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Robustness and Security in ISAC Network Design: Leveraging Transmissive Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface with RSMA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06767v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel transmissive reconfigurable intelligent surface transceiver-enhanced robust and secure integrated sensing and communication network. A time-division sensing communication mechanism is designed for the scenario, which enables communication and sensing to share wireless resources. To address the interference management problem and hinder eavesdropping, we implement rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA), where the common stream is designed as a useful signal and an artificial noise, while taking into account the imperfect channel state information and modeling the channel for the illegal users in a fine-grained manner as well as giving an upper bound on the error. We introduce the secrecy outage probability and construct an optimization problem with secrecy sum-rate as the objective functions to optimize the common stream beamforming matrix, the private stream beamforming matrix and the timeslot duration variable. Due to the coupling of the optimization variables and the infinity of the error set, the proposed problem is a nonconvex optimization problem that cannot be solved directly. In order to address the above challenges, the block coordinate descent-based second-order cone programming algorithm is used to decouple the optimization variables and solving the problem. Specifically, the problem is decoupled into two subproblems concerning the common stream beamforming matrix, the private stream beamforming matrix, and the timeslot duration variable, which are solved by alternating optimization until convergence is reached. To solve the problem, S-procedure, Bernstein's inequality and successive convex approximation are employed to deal with the objective function and non-convex constraints. Numerical simulation results verify the superiority of the proposed scheme in improving the secrecy energy efficiency and the Cram\'{e}r-Rao boundary.</description>

      <title>On the Performance of Short Binary BCH Codes for Ultra-Low Latency Wireless Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18725v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, polar codes have been considered for communication systems that require high re-liability and ultra-low latency, such as sixth generation (6G) wireless communications. This paper presents simulation results showing that short binary extended BCH (eBCH) codes with low-complexity decoding outperform polar codes for lengths 64 and 128. In the simulations, polar mapping under additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) is assumed and ordered-statistics decoding (OSD) of eBCH codes is compared with CRC-aided successive-cancellation list decoding (SCLD-CRC) of polar codes of the same lengths and rates. The results indicate that short-length binary eBCH codes achieve lower average bit error rate values (higher reliability) and thus should be considered as strong candidates in communication systems requiring extremely low latency, i.e., short code lengths of up to 128 bits. The eBCH simulation results are obtained with OSD and re-processing order equal to one so that complexity is comparable to SCLD-CRC. Specifically, error performances are quantified of length-64 and selected length-128 eBCH codes with order-1 OSD and polar codes with SCLD-CRC for the same rates and lengths. These results serve to verify that short binary eBCH codes do indeed outperform short polar codes with comparable decoding complexity.</description>

Abstract: In this article, for a finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$ and a natural number $l,$ let $\mathcal{R}$ denote the product ring $\mathbb{F}_q^l.$ Firstly, for an automorphism $\Theta$ of $\mathcal{R},$ a $\Theta$-derivation $\Delta_\Theta$ of $\mathcal{R}$ and for a unit $\mathbf{a}$ in $\mathcal{R},$ we study $(\Theta, \Delta_\Theta, \mathbf{a})$-cyclic codes over $\mathcal{R}.$ In this direction, we give an algebraic characterization of a $(\Theta, \Delta_\Theta, \mathbf{a})$-cyclic code over $\mathcal{R}$, determine its generator polynomial, and find its decomposition over $\mathbb{F}_q.$ Secondly, we give a necessary and sufficient condition for a $(\Theta, 0, \mathbf{a})$-cyclic code to be Euclidean dual-containing code over $\mathcal{R}.$ Thirdly, we study Gray maps and obtain several MDS and optimal linear codes over $\mathbb{F}_q$ as Gray images of $(\Theta, \Delta_\Theta, \mathbf{a})$-cyclic codes over $\mathcal{R}.$ Moreover, we determine orthogonality preserving Gray maps and construct Euclidean dual-containing codes with good parameters. Lastly, as an application, we construct MDS and almost MDS quantum codes by employing the Euclidean dual-containing and annihilator dual-containing CSS constructions.</description>

      <title>Movable Antenna Enhanced Integrated Sensing and Communication Via Antenna Position Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07318v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose an integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system aided by the movable-antenna (MA) array, which can improve the communication and sensing performance via flexible antenna movement over conventional fixed-position antenna (FPA) array. First, we consider the downlink multiuser communication, where each user is randomly distributed within a given three-dimensional zone with local movement. To reduce the overhead of frequent antenna movement, the antenna position vector (APV) is designed based on users' statistical channel state information (CSI), so that the antennas only need to be moved in a large timescale. Then, for target sensing, the Cramer-Rao bounds (CRBs) of the estimation mean square error for different spatial angles of arrival (AoAs) are derived as functions of MAs' positions. Based on the above, we formulate an optimization problem to maximize the expected minimum achievable rate among all communication users, with given constraints on the maximum acceptable CRB thresholds for target sensing. An alternating optimization algorithm is proposed to iteratively optimize one of the horizontal and vertical APVs of the MA array with the other being fixed. Numerical results demonstrate that our proposed MA arrays can significantly enlarge the trade-off region between communication and sensing performance compared to conventional FPA arrays with different inter-antenna spacing. It is also revealed that the steering vectors of the designed MA arrays exhibit low correlation in the angular domain, thus effectively reducing channel correlation among communication users to enhance their achievable rates, while alleviating ambiguity in target angle estimation to achieve improved sensing accuracy.</description>

      <title>An in-depth study of the power function $x^{q+2}$ over the finite field $\mathbb{F}_{q^2}$: the differential, boomerang, and Walsh spectra, with an application to coding theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07710v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $q = p^m$, where $p$ is an odd prime number and $m$ is a positive integer. In this paper, we examine the finite field $\mathbb{F}_{q^2}$, which consists of $q^2$ elements. We first present an alternative method to determine the differential spectrum of the power function $f(x) = x^{q+2}$ on $\mathbb{F}_{q^2}$, incorporating several key simplifications. This methodology provides a new proof of the results established by Man, Xia, Li, and Helleseth in Finite Fields and Their Applications 84 (2022), 102100, which not only completely determine the differential spectrum of $f$ but also facilitate the analysis of its boomerang uniformity.
  Specifically, we determine the boomerang uniformity of $f$ for the cases where $q \equiv 1$ or $3$ (mod $6$), with the exception of the scenario where $p = 5$ and $m$ is even. Furthermore, for $p = 3$, we investigate the value distribution of the Walsh spectrum of $f$, demonstrating that it takes on only four distinct values. Using this result, we derive the weight distribution of a ternary cyclic code with four Hamming weights. The article integrates refined mathematical techniques from algebraic number theory and the theory of finite fields, employing several ingredients, such as exponential sums, to explore the cryptographic analysis of functions over finite fields. They can be used to explore the differential/boomerang uniformity across a wider range of functions.</description>

      <title>Private Collaborative Edge Inference via Over-the-Air Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21151v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider collaborative inference at the wireless edge, where each client's model is trained independently on its local dataset. Clients are queried in parallel to make an accurate decision collaboratively. In addition to maximizing the inference accuracy, we also want to ensure the privacy of local models. To this end, we leverage the superposition property of the multiple access channel to implement bandwidth-efficient multi-user inference methods. We propose different methods for ensemble and multi-view classification that exploit over-the-air computation (OAC). We show that these schemes perform better than their orthogonal counterparts with statistically significant differences while using fewer resources and providing privacy guarantees. We also provide experimental results verifying the benefits of the proposed OAC approach to multi-user inference, and perform an ablation study to demonstrate the effectiveness of our design choices. We share the source code of the framework publicly on Github to facilitate further research and reproducibility.</description>

      <title>Efficient Distribution Matching of Representations via Noise-Injected Deep InfoMax</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06993v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep InfoMax (DIM) is a well-established method for self-supervised representation learning (SSRL) based on maximization of the mutual information between the input and the output of a deep neural network encoder. Despite the DIM and contrastive SSRL in general being well-explored, the task of learning representations conforming to a specific distribution (i.e., distribution matching, DM) is still under-addressed. Motivated by the importance of DM to several downstream tasks (including generative modeling, disentanglement, outliers detection and other), we enhance DIM to enable automatic matching of learned representations to a selected prior distribution. To achieve this, we propose injecting an independent noise into the normalized outputs of the encoder, while keeping the same InfoMax training objective. We show that such modification allows for learning uniformly and normally distributed representations, as well as representations of other absolutely continuous distributions. Our approach is tested on various downstream tasks. The results indicate a moderate trade-off between the performance on the downstream tasks and quality of DM.</description>

      <title>Parsings of Stationary Processes, Stopping Times and the Fundamental Pointwise Convergence Theorems of Ergodic Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02615v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The idea of a parsing of a stationary process according to a collection of words is introduced, and the basic framework required for the asymptotic analysis of these parsings is presented. We demonstrate how the pointwise ergodic theorem and the Shannon-McMillan-Breiman theorem can be deduced from their respective weaker convergence in probability versions combined with our observations regarding parsings, where the parsings are done according to collections that originate in stopping times tailored for that purpose.</description>

      <title>Approximation Rates in Fr\'echet Metrics: Barron Spaces, Paley-Wiener Spaces, and Fourier Multipliers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04023v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Operator learning is a recent development in the simulation of Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) by means of neural networks. The idea behind this approach is to learn the behavior of an operator, such that the resulting neural network is an (approximate) mapping in infinite-dimensional spaces that is capable of (approximately) simulating the solution operator governed by the PDE. In our work, we study some general approximation capabilities for linear differential operators by approximating the corresponding symbol in the Fourier domain. Analogous to the structure of the class of H\"ormander-Symbols, we consider the approximation with respect to a topology that is induced by a sequence of semi-norms. In that sense, we measure the approximation error in terms of a Fr\'echet metric, and our main result identifies sufficient conditions for achieving a predefined approximation error. Secondly, we then focus on a natural extension of our main theorem, in which we manage to reduce the assumptions on the sequence of semi-norms. Based on existing approximation results for the exponential spectral Barron space, we then present a concrete example of symbols that can be approximated well.</description>
