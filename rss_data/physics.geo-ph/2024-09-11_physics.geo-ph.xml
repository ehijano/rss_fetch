      <title>Reduced-order modeling for complex 3D seismic wave propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Elastodynamic Green's functions are an essential ingredient in seismology as they form the connection between direct observations of seismic waves and the earthquake source. They are also fundamental to various seismological techniques including physics-based ground motion prediction and kinematic or dynamic source inversions. In regions with established 3D models of the Earth's elastic structure, 3D Green's functions can be computed using numerical simulations of seismic wave propagation. However, such simulations are computationally expensive which poses challenges for real-time ground motion prediction. Here, we use a reduced-order model (ROM) approach that enables the rapid evaluation of approximate Green's functions. The ROM technique developed approximates three-component surface velocity wavefields obtained from numerical simulations of seismic wave propagation. We apply our ROM approach to a 50 km x 40 km area in the greater Los Angeles area accounting for topography, site effects, 3D subsurface velocity structure, and viscoelastic attenuation. The ROM constructed for this region enables rapid computation (0.001 CPU hours) of complete, high-resolution, 0.5 Hz surface velocity wavefields that are accurate for a shortest wavelength of 1.0 km. Using leave-one-out cross validation, we measure the accuracy of our Green's functions in both the time-domain and frequency-domain. Averaged across all sources and receivers, the error in the rapid seismograms is less than 0.01 cm/s. We demonstrate that the ROM can accurately and rapidly reproduce simulated seismograms for generalized moment tensor sources in our region, as well as kinematic sources by using a finite fault model of the 1987 Mw 5.9 Whittier Narrows earthquake as an example. We envision that our rapid, approximate Green's functions will be useful for constructing rapid ground motion synthetics with high spatial resolution.</description>

      <title>Thermal and magnetic evolution of an Earth-like planet with a basal magma ocean</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Earth's geodynamo has operated for over 3.5 billion years. The magnetic field is currently powered by thermocompositional convection in the outer core, which involves the release of light elements and latent heat as the inner core solidifies. However, since the inner core nucleated no more than 1.5 billion years ago, the early dynamo could not rely on these buoyancy sources. Given recent estimates of the thermal conductivity of the outer core, an alternative mechanism may be required to sustain the geodynamo prior to nucleation of the inner core. One possibility is a silicate dynamo operating in a long-lived basal magma ocean. Here, we investigate the structural, thermal, buoyancy, and magnetic evolution of an Earth-like terrestrial planet. Using modern equations of state and melting curves, we include a time-dependent parameterization of the compositional evolution of an iron-rich basal magma ocean. We combine an internal structure integration of the planet with energy budgets in a coupled core, basal magma ocean, and mantle system. We determine the thermocompositional convective stability of the core and the basal magma ocean, and assess their respective dynamo activity using entropy budgets and magnetic Reynolds numbers. Our conservative nominal model predicts a transient basal magma ocean dynamo followed by a core dynamo after 1 billion years. The model is sensitive to several parameters, including the initial temperature of the core-mantle boundary, the parameterization of mantle convection, the composition of the basal magma ocean, the radiogenic content of the planet, as well as convective velocity and magnetic scaling laws. We use the nominal model to constrain the range of basal magma ocean electrical conductivity and core thermal conductivity that sustain a dynamo.</description>

      <title>Learning Generative Models for Lumped Rainfall-Runoff Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.09904v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study presents a novel generative modeling approach to rainfall-runoff modeling, focusing on the synthesis of realistic daily catchment runoff time series in response to catchment-averaged climate forcing. Unlike traditional process-based lumped hydrologic models that depend on predefined sets of variables describing catchment physical properties, our approach uses a small number of latent variables to characterize runoff generation processes. These latent variables encapsulate the intrinsic properties of a catchment and can be inferred from catchment climate forcing and discharge data. By sampling from the latent variable space, the model generates runoff time series that closely resemble real-world observations. In this study, we trained the generative models using neural networks on data from over 3,000 global catchments and achieved prediction accuracies comparable to current deep learning models and various conventional lumped models, both within the catchments from the training set and from other regions worldwide. This suggests that the runoff generation process of catchments can be effectively captured by a low-dimensional latent representation. Yet, challenges such as equifinality and optimal determination of latent variables remain. Future research should focus on refining parameter estimation methods and exploring the physical meaning of these latent dimensions to improve model applicability and robustness. This generative approach offers a promising alternative for hydrological modeling that requires minimal assumptions about the physical processes of the catchment.</description>

      <title>When Geoscience Meets Foundation Models: Towards General Geoscience Artificial Intelligence System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06799</link>

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has significantly advanced Earth sciences, yet its full potential in to comprehensively modeling Earth's complex dynamics remains unrealized. Geoscience foundation models (GFMs) emerge as a paradigm-shifting solution, integrating extensive cross-disciplinary data to enhance the simulation and understanding of Earth system dynamics. These data-centric AI models extract insights from petabytes of structured and unstructured data, effectively addressing the complexities of Earth systems that traditional models struggle to capture. The unique strengths of GFMs include flexible task specification, diverse input-output capabilities, and multi-modal knowledge representation, enabling analyses that surpass those of individual data sources or traditional AI methods. This review not only highlights the key advantages of GFMs, but also presents essential techniques for their construction, with a focus on transformers, pre-training, and adaptation strategies. Subsequently, we examine recent advancements in GFMs, including large language models, vision models, and vision-language models, particularly emphasizing the potential applications in remote sensing. Additionally, the review concludes with a comprehensive analysis of the challenges and future trends in GFMs, addressing five critical aspects: data integration, model complexity, uncertainty quantification, interdisciplinary collaboration, and concerns related to privacy, trust, and security. This review offers a comprehensive overview of emerging geoscientific research paradigms, emphasizing the untapped opportunities at the intersection of advanced AI techniques and geoscience. It examines major methodologies, showcases advances in large-scale models, and discusses the challenges and prospects that will shape the future landscape of GFMs.</description>

      <title>Monitoring of water volume in a porous reservoir using seismic data: Validation of a numerical model with a field experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14605v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As global groundwater levels continue to decline rapidly, there is a growing need for advanced techniques to monitor and manage aquifers effectively. This study focuses on validating a numerical model using seismic data from a small-scale experimental setup designed to estimate water volume in a porous reservoir. Expanding on previous work with synthetic data, we analyze seismic data acquired from a controlled experimental site in Laukaa, Finland. By employing neural networks, we directly estimate water volume from seismic responses, bypassing the traditional need for separate determinations, for example, of reservoir water table level and porosity. The study models wave propagation through a coupled poroviscoelastic-viscoelastic medium using a three-dimensional discontinuous Galerkin method. The proposed methodology is validated against experimental data, aiming to improve precision in mapping current water volumes and contributing to the development of sustainable groundwater management practices.</description>
