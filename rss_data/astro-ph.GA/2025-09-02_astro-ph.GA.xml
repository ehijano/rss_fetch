      <title>Accelerated calibration of semi-analytic galaxy formation models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an accelerated calibration framework for semi-analytic galaxy formation models, demonstrated with Galacticus. Rather than fitting directly to properties such as the low-redshift stellar mass function (SMF) - which requires evolving thousands of halos per likelihood evaluation - we construct a fast likelihood from the stellar-to-halo mass relation (SHMR; mean and scatter) evaluated at a small set of target halo masses, reducing each evaluation to simulating only tens of galaxies. We sample the posterior over Galacticus parameters with Markov Chain Monte Carlo and show that the resulting calibration reproduces the low-redshift SMF. We then extend the method to additional datasets, using a higher-redshift SHMR and the low-redshift stellar mass-size relation as examples, and assess performance for large scale structure survey-relevant properties: stellar masses, sizes, and emission-line strengths. The SMF matches data well at low redshift, but toward higher redshift the model yields too few massive galaxies and too many low-mass galaxies. Size evolution with redshift is approximately correct, but the mass-size relation is too flat, producing massive galaxies that are too small. The H$\alpha$ luminosity function is well reproduced at z~2, but by z~0.4 the model overproduces highly star-forming, H$\alpha$-bright systems. These discrepancies suggest the model lacks sufficient flexibility (e.g. in gas cooling/recycling or feedback) to reconcile all datasets simultaneously. Our strategy complements emulator-based methods for calibrating semi-analytic models by enabling rapid, low-cost scans of model choices and parameterisations - a capability we envision leveraging to supply calibrated starting points for more detailed follow-up inference.</description>

      <title>The Nature of Post-Starburst Galaxies: Real Deal or Masquerading Impostors?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Post-starburst galaxies (PSBs) are a population of rapidly quenched galaxies that have experienced a recent starburst. Several aspects of the origin and nature of PSBs are currently debated. For example, some PSBs unexpectedly host substantial molecular gas despite their low star-formation activity. Furthermore, the relative role of galaxy mergers, interaction, and stellar or black hole feedback in the formation of PSBs remains unclear. We investigate the nature of PSBs at z=0.7 and z=1 selected via rest-frame optical photometric properties, using the FIREbox cosmological simulation. The fraction of PSBs in FIREbox is in reasonable agreement with observational estimates. However, only ~10% of PSBs in FIREbox are `true' PSBs with temporarily quenched star-formation activity. Most galaxies selected as PSBs in FIREbox are impostors, having star-formation rates and gas masses that are comparable to those of non-PSB galaxies with similar stellar masses. Furthermore, PSBs rich in molecular gas are almost exclusively impostors. `True' PSBs and impostors differ on average in their mid-to-near infrared ratio but with significant scatter. By combining the impostor frequency among star forming galaxies in FIREbox with observational estimates, we predict that more than 70% of `true' PSBs in the Universe should originate from massive black hole feedback.</description>

      <title>SQuIGG$\vec{L}$E: Buried star formation cannot explain the rapidly fading CO(2-1) luminosity in massive, $z\sim0.7$ post-starburst galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observational and theoretical studies have long held that rapid gas consumption in starbursts is responsible for the formation of quiescent galaxies. However, studies of recently quenched ``post-starburst" galaxies have discovered that a number of them are surprisingly luminous in CO, challenging this assumption. We present deep ALMA CO(2-1) observations of 50 massive ($\log(M_\star/M_\odot)\sim11.2$) post-starburst galaxies from the SQuIGG$\vec{L}$E sample at $z\sim0.7$. We detect a large fraction (27/50) of the galaxies in CO(2-1). Furthermore, we find that the CO luminosity correlates with the age of the recent starburst, suggesting a gas-removal timescale of $\lesssim140$ Myr, an order of magnitude shorter than is implied by their rest optical star formation rates. We perform new spectral energy distribution fits incorporating mid- and far-IR photometry to test whether dust-obscured star formation can explain this trend. We find that while allowing for buried star formation can raise star formation rates by $\sim0.5$ dex, for almost all galaxies it is neither required to fit the observed IR SED, nor is it sufficient to explain the observed depletion trend. Even the combination of significant buried star formation and ULIRG-like $\alpha_{CO}$ is not enough to explain this decay in CO luminosity. Furthermore, there is no strong evidence to support either of those modifications to the depletion time. Therefore, it remains a distinct possibility that the age-CO luminosity trend should not be interpreted as an evolutionary sequence, and that gas-rich SQuIGG$\vec{L}$E galaxies will soon rejuvenate.</description>

      <title>ProMage: fast galaxy magnitudes emulation combining SED forward-modelling and machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present ProMage, a feed-forward neural network that emulates the computation of observer- and rest-frame magnitudes from the generative galaxy SED package ProSpect. The network predicts magnitudes conditioned on input galaxy physical properties, including redshift, star formation history, gas and dust parameters. ProMage accelerates magnitude computation by a factor of $10^4$ compared to ProSpect, while achieving per-mille relative accuracy for $99\%$ of sources in the test set across the $g,r,i,z,y$ Hyper Suprime-Cam bands. This acceleration is key to enabling fast inference of galaxy physical properties in next-generation Stage IV surveys and to generating large catalogue realisations in forward-modelling frameworks such as GalSBI-SPS.</description>

      <title>Quasar Radiative Feedback May Suppress Galaxy Growth on Intergalactic Scales at $z = 6.3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present observational evidence that intense ionizing radiation from a luminous quasar suppresses nebular emission in nearby galaxies on intergalactic scales at $z=6.3$. Using JWST/NIRCam grism spectroscopy from the SAPPHIRES and EIGER programs, we identify a pronounced decline in [O III] $\lambda5008$ luminosity relative to the UV continuum ($L_{5008}/L_{1500}$) among galaxies within $\sim$10 comoving Mpc (cMpc) of the quasar J0100$+$2802, the most UV-luminous quasar known at this epoch ($M_{1450}=-29.26$). While $L_{1500}$ remains roughly constant with transverse distance, $L_{5008}$ increases significantly, suggesting suppression of very recent star formation toward the quasar. The effect persists after controlling for completeness, local density, and UV luminosity, and correlates with the projected photoionization-rate profile $\Gamma_{\mathrm{qso}}$. A weaker but directionally consistent suppression in $L_{5008}/L_{1500}$ is also observed along the line of sight. The transverse suppression radius ($\sim$8-10 cMpc) implies a recent radiative episode with a cumulative duration $\sim$4.5 Myr, shorter than required for thermal photoheating to dominate and thus more naturally explained by rapid H$_2$ photodissociation and related radiative processes. Environmental effects alone appear insufficient to explain the signal. Our results provide direct, geometry-based constraints on large-scale quasar radiative feedback and recent quasar lifetimes.</description>

      <title>The intragroup light in KiDS+GAMA groups: A stacking analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galaxy groups and clusters assembled through dynamical interactions of smaller systems, resulting in the formation of a diffuse stellar halo known as the intragroup or intracluster light (IGL/ICL). By preserving the records of these interactions, the IGL/ICL provides valuable insight into the growth history of galaxy groups and clusters. Groups are especially interesting because they represent the link between galactic haloes and massive clusters. However, the low surface brightness of this diffuse light makes it extremely challenging to detect individually. Recent deep wide-field imaging surveys allow us to push such measurements to lower brightness limits by stacking data for large ensembles of groups. In this work, we present a special-purpose pipeline to reprocess individual $r-$band Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS) exposures to optimise the IGL detection. Using an initial sample of 2385 groups with at least five spectroscopically-confirmed member galaxies from the Galaxy and Mass Assembly (GAMA) survey and reprocessed deep images from the KiDS, we present the first robust measurement of IGL from a large group sample (~ 750) down to 31-32 mag/arcsec$^2$ (varying in different stacked bins). We also compare our stacked IGL measurements to predictions from matched mock observations from the Hydrangea cosmological hydrodynamic simulations. Systematics in the imaging data can affect IGL measurements, even with our special-purpose pipeline. However, with a large sample and optimised analysis, we can place well-constrained upper and lower limits on the IGL fraction (3 - 21 per cent) for our group ensemble across $0.09\leq z\leq 0.27$ and $12.5\leq \log_{10}[M_{200}/\mathrm{M}_\odot] \leq 14.0$. This work explores the potential performance of stacked statistical analysis of diffuse light in large samples of systems from next-generation observational programs, such as $Euclid$ and LSST.</description>

      <title>Binding energy distributions of alcohols, thiols, and their precursors on interstellar water ice surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Binding energy (BE) is a critical parameter in astrochemical modeling, governing the retention of species on interstellar dust grains and their subsequent chemical evolution. However, conventional models often rely on single-valued BEs, overlooking the intrinsic distribution arising from diverse adsorption sites. In this study, we present BEs for monohydric alcohols, thiols, and their plausible precursors, including aldehydes and thioaldehydes. We incorporate a distribution of BEs to capture the realistic variation in adsorption strengths. The quantum chemical calculations provide a range of BE values rather than a single estimate, ensuring a more precise description of molecular diffusion and surface chemistry. The BE trend of analogous species provides qualitative insight into the dominant reaction pathways and key precursors that drive the formation of larger molecules under interstellar conditions. Oxygen-bearing species generally exhibit higher BEs than their sulfur analogues, primarily due to stronger interactions, further influencing molecular adsorption and reactivity. We implemented BE distributions in astrochemical models, revealing significant effects on predicted abundances and establishing a more accurate framework for future astrochemical modeling.</description>

      <title>Parallel Application of Slitless Spectroscopy to Analyze Galaxy Evolution (PASSAGE): Survey Overview</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During the second half of Cycle 1 of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), we conducted the Parallel Application of Slitless Spectroscopy to Analyze Galaxy Evolution (PASSAGE) program. PASSAGE received the largest allocation of JWST observing time in Cycle 1, 591 hours of NIRISS observations to obtain direct near-IR imaging and slitless spectroscopy. About two thirds of these were ultimately executed, to observe 63 high-latitude fields in Pure Parallel mode. These have provided more than ten thousand near-infrared grism spectrograms of faint galaxies.
  PASSAGE brings unique advantages in studying galaxy evolution: A) Unbiased spectroscopic search, without prior photometric pre-selection. By including the most numerous galaxies, with low masses and strong emission lines, slitless spectroscopy is the indispensable complement to any pre-targeted spectroscopy; B) The combination of several dozen independent fields to overcome cosmic variance; C) Near-infrared spectral coverage, often spanning the full range from 1.0--2.3 $\mu$m, with minimal wavelength gaps, to measure multiple diagnostic rest-frame optical lines, minimizing sensitivity to dust reddening; D) JWST's unprecedented spatial resolution, in some cases using two orthogonal grism orientations, to overcome contamination due to blending of overlapping spectra; E) Discovery of rare bright objects especially for detailed JWST followup. PASSAGE data are public immediately, and our team plans to deliver fully-processed high-level data products.
  In this PASSAGE overview, we describe the survey and data quality, and present examples of these accomplishments in several areas of current interest in the evolution of emission-line galaxy properties, particularly at low masses.</description>

      <title>The Role of Stellar Mass and Star Formation in Shaping X-ray Emission of Radio-Loud and Radio-Quiet AGN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galaxy evolution and extragalactic astronomy research depend on an understanding of the interactions between active galactic nuclei (AGN) and their host galaxies. We investigate the relationships between X-ray luminosity (Lx), star formation rate (SFR), and stellar mass (M) in distinct samples of radio-loud (RL) and radio-quiet (RQ) AGN. Using data from 4XMM-DR11, SDSS-DR16, and the DESI AGN Host Galaxies VAC, we examine how these key properties correlate within each AGN population. Our analysis reveals different behaviors: RL-AGN show a strong, statistically significant Lx-SFR correlation but no significant link with M, suggesting that accretion and star formation are coupled, possibly independent of host mass. In contrast, RQ-AGN display moderate, significant positive correlations across all parameters, consistent with joint growth driven by a shared cold gas supply.These results suggest that radio-loud AGN might slow down star formation in their galaxies, while radio-quiet AGN seem to grow together with it.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic Observations and Emission-Line Diagnoses for H ii Regions in the Late-Type Spiral Galaxy NGC 2403</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Being ionized nebulae where star formation events take place, H ii regions are not only natural laboratories for studying physical processes of star formation and photoionization but also signatures reflecting evolution of their internal stellar populations and hosting galaxies. In this paper, we present a comprehensive analysis of spectral emission-line data for H ii regions in the nearby spiral galaxy NGC 2403, aimed at gaining deep insight into underlying properties and evolution for the H ii regions and the galaxy. The spectroscopic data are obtained through observations with the 2.16 m telescope at National Astronomical Observatories of China and a collection of published data in the literature. Photoionization modeling is combined in the analysis for diagnosing the spectral features and interpreting the observational data with certain physical mechanisms. Results of this work not only involve estimates of a set of parameters such as metallicity, the ionization parameter, etc., and evolution stages for the H ii regions in NGC 2403 but also reveal distinct characteristics of different spectral features and their sensitivities to specific parameters, which provides an instructive implication for proper usages of emission-line diagnostics for H ii regions or galaxies nearby and far away.</description>

      <title>Hunting pre-stellar cores with APEX: overview</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: [Abridged] $Context.$ Pre-stellar cores are centrally concentrated starless cores on the verge of star formation and they represent the initial conditions for star and planet formation. Pre-stellar cores host an active organic chemistry and isotopic fractionation, kept stored into thick icy mantles, which can be inherited by the future protoplanetary disks and planetesimals. So far, only a few have been studied in detail, with special attention being paid to L1544 in the Taurus Molecular Cloud. $Aims.$ The aim is to identify nearby ($&lt;$200 pc) pre-stellar cores in an unbiased way, to build a sample that can then be studied in detail. $Methods.$ We first used the Herschel Gould Belt Survey archival data, selecting all those starless cores with central H$_2$ number densities higher than or equal to 3$\times$10$^5$ cm$^{-3}$, the density of L1544 within the Herschel beam. The selected 40 (out of 1746) cores have then been observed in N$_2$H$^+$(3-2) and N$_2$D$^+$(4-3) using the APEX antenna. $Results.$ A total of 17 bona-fide (i.e., with a deuterium fraction larger than 10%) pre-stellar cores have been identified. Other 16 objects can also be considered pre-stellar, as they are dynamically evolved starless cores, but their deuterium fraction is relatively low ($&lt;$10%). The remaining 7 objects have been found associated with very young stellar objects. $Conclusions.$ Dust continuum emission, together with spectroscopic observations of N$_2$H$^+$(3-2) and N$_2$D$^+$(4-3), is a powerful tool to identify pre-stellar cores in molecular clouds. Detailed modeling of the physical structure of the objects is now required for reconstructing the chemical composition as a function of radius. This work has provided a statistically significant sample of 33 pre-stellar cores, a crucial step in the understanding of the process of star and planet formation.</description>

      <title>Origin of the power-law profile in a core-collapsing galactic globular-cluster model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observed galactic globular clusters reveal power-law structural profiles in the inner halos around the core-collapse stage. However, the origin of the power-law has not been explained in an acceptable manner. The present paper applies the Buckingham's Pi theorem to the orbit-averaged Fokker-Plank (OAFP) model of equal masses to study the inner-halo structure of a core-collapsing isotropic star cluster. We first prove that an infinite OAFP model evolves self-similarly because of the principle of covariance. We then show that the inner halo must form a power-law profile in a finite OAFP model that has complete similarity so that the principle of covariance and conservation laws hold. The conventional assumption that inner halos are self-similar and stationary is unnecessary to explain the power-law profiles.</description>

      <title>A Stellar Dynamical Mass for the Central Black Hole in MCG$-$06-30-15</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the stellar dynamical mass of the central black hole in the nearby Seyfert galaxy MCG$-$06-30-15 using the Schwarzschild orbit-superposition method implemented in the open-source code FORSTAND. We obtained spatially resolved $K$-band nuclear stellar spectra for this galaxy with SINFONI on the VLT. We extracted the bulk stellar kinematics using Gauss$-$Hermite (GH) parameterization of the line-of-sight velocity distributions. A multicomponent surface brightness profile of the galaxy was determined from an $HST$ medium-band $V$ image. Our best-fit models indicate a black hole mass of $M_{BH}=(4.4\pm1.4) \times 10^7 M_{\odot}$ and a stellar mass-to-light ratio of $M/L$=($3.0\pm0.3$) $M_{\odot}$/$L_{\odot}$, within 1$\sigma$ confidence intervals. Our constraint on $M_{BH}$ agrees with an upper limit on the mass from stellar dynamics based on the Jeans Anisotropic Method, but is $\sim$10 times larger than the reported mass from reverberation mapping. However, our best-fit $M_{BH}$ may be systematically biased high due to the counter-rotating disk in the nucleus of MCG$-$06-30-15 and the inability of the GH parameterization to fully describe such a complicated set of stellar kinematics. In addition, a dynamical $M_{BH}$ value depends heavily on the assumed source distance, which is not yet accurately constrained for this galaxy. MCG$-$06-30-15 is only the fourth galaxy in which we can compare $M_{BH}$ from stellar dynamical modeling with that from reverberation mapping. A direct comparison of $M_{BH}$ allows us to identify and investigate the possible sources of bias associated with different mass measurement techniques, which may influence our understanding of black hole and galaxy coevolution across cosmological timescales.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Stellar Feedback and Cloud Structure in the $\rho$ Ophiuchi A Region with ALMA and JWST: Discovery of Substellar Cores, C$^{18}$O Striations, and Protostellar Outflows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In clustered star-forming regions, stellar feedback-such as HII regions/photon-dominated regions (PDRs), and protostellar jets/outflows-shapes cloud structures and influences star formation. Using high-resolution ALMA millimeter and JWST infrared data, we analyze the cloud structure and the impact of stellar feedback in the nearest dense cluster-forming region Oph A. All 6 known Class 0/I and 2 of 6 Flat Spectrum/Class II objects are detected in the 1.3 mm dust continuum. Additionally, we newly detected 7 substellar cores, three of which show compact near-infrared emission, suggesting they are young substellar objects. The remaining cores, with masses of 0.01 Msun and high densities, are likely gravitationally bound. They appear connected by faint CO finger-like structures extending from the triple Class 0 system VLA1623-2417 Aa+Ab+B, suggesting they may have been ejected from the close binary VLA1623 Aa+Ab. 12CO and near-infrared data reveal multiple protostellar outflows. From the comparison, we identified several new outflows/jets, and shocked structures associated to the GSS30 large bipolar bubble. Strong 12CO emission traces the eastern edge of the Oph A ridge, forming part of the expanding HII/PDR bubble driven by the nearby Herbig Be star S1. The northern ridge appears blown out, with warm gas flowing toward GSS 30, injecting additional turbulent momentum. Several C18O striations in the S1 bubble align with magnetic fields, and position-velocity diagrams show wave-like patterns, possibly reflecting magnetohydrodynamic waves. Stellar feedback significantly influences Oph A's cloud structure.</description>

      <title>Electron temperature relations in low metallicity, diffuse, and extraplanar gas of starburst galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we test the validity of $T_e$ - $T_e$ relations in resolved (10-200~pc) measurements of four nearby, low-metallicity (7.25 $\leq$ 12+log(O/H) $\leq$ 8.33), low-mass (10$^{6.78}$ $\leq$ M$_*$/M$_\odot$ $\leq$ 10$^{8.7}$), starburst (10$^{-4.5}$ $\leq$ sSFR $\leq$ 10$^{-0.3}$) galaxies. We obtain VLT/X-Shooter spectra of NGC~5253, NGC~0625, SBS~0335-052E and IC~2828, targeting regions within these galaxies with bright point-like sources and diffuse gas. Our observations are designed to extend from the galaxy midplane into extraplanar gas likely belonging to galactic winds. We measure electron temperatures from five different auroral lines: [NII]~$\lambda$5755, [OII]~$\lambda\lambda$7319,30, [SII]~$\lambda\lambda$4069,76, [SIII]~$\lambda$6312, and [OIII]~$\lambda$4363. We compare the resulting $T_e$ - $T_e$ relations with previous studies of HII regions in nearby spiral galaxies. Our results show that $T_e$ - $T_e$ relations in low-metallicity starburst galaxies do not significantly deviate from $T_e$ - $T_e$ relations in HII regions of local spiral galaxies. We do not find significant differences in the diffuse, extraplanar gas. These results suggest that auroral lines provide a reliable metallicity diagnostic not only for high-redshift galaxies but also for the extended diffuse gas in extreme environments like outflows.</description>

      <title>Sieging HELM's deep: PRIMA unveils the far-infrared properties of highly extincted low-mass galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although the majority of star-forming galaxies show a tight correlation between stellar mass and dust extinction, recent James Webb Space Telescope observations have revealed a peculiar population of Highly Extincted Low-Mass (HELM) galaxies, which could revolutionise our understanding of dust production mechanisms. To fully understand the dust content of these galaxies, which are a minority of the overall galaxy population, far-infrared observations over large areas are pivotal. In this paper, we derive the expected PRIMAger, the far-IR (24-235$\mu m$) imaging camera proposed for the Probe far-IR Mission for Astrophysics, fluxes for a set of photometric candidates HELM galaxies. Taking into account a deep survey of 1000h over $1\rm\, deg^{2}$, we expect to detect around $3.1 \times 10^4$ HELM sources in at least one PRIMAger filter, 100 of which are at z=1-1.5. For 32% of this sample, there will be observations in at least four PRIMAger filters, covering at least the 90 to $240\mu m$ wavelength range, which will allow us to obtain a detailed fit of the dust emission and estimate the dust mass.</description>

      <title>Probing the resolved K-S relation in nearby galaxies: Insights from UVIT and ALMA observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines the resolved Kennicutt Schmidt (rKS) relation, defined as the connection between the star formation rate surface density (Sigma SFR) and the molecular gas mass surface density (Sigma H2) in the high-density central regions of three nearby barred spiral galaxies hosting AGN: NGC 1365, NGC 1433, and NGC 1566. Utilising high-resolution archival data from AstroSat/UVIT for UV imaging and the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) for CO(2-1) molecular gas mapping, we explore recent star formation and gas distribution with a spatial resolution of about 120 to 132 pc. Our findings reveal a sublinear rKS law, with slopes ranging from about 0.17 to 0.71. Notably, NGC 1566 exhibits a robust rKS relation consistent with previous studies, while NGC 1365 and NGC 1433 show weaker correlations. These differences are likely due to the smaller number of identified star-forming regions in these galaxies compared to NGC 1566, as well as the central molecular gas concentrations and varying star formation activity in their bars and nuclear regions. These results also support the idea that the rKS relation deviates from linearity in extreme environments, such as starburst galaxies and galactic centres. Additionally, we find a generally low median star formation efficiency (SFE) within the bars of these galaxies, suggesting that while bars may drive nuclear starbursts and contribute to bulge growth, they do not significantly increase SFE. Furthermore, a negative correlation between SFE and Sigma H2 is observed across the sample, both within and outside the bar regions, suggesting that higher Sigma H2 may lead to lower SFE in the central regions of these galaxies. Our findings highlight that Sigma H2 plays a primary role in shaping the observed trends in SFE, rather than the presence of a bar itself.</description>

      <title>The JCMT Gould Belt Survey Complete Core Catalogue: Core mass function variations between nearby molecular clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a catalogue of dense cores identified in James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) Gould Belt Survey SCUBA-2 observations of nearby star-forming clouds. We identified 2257 dense cores using the getsources algorithm, of which 59% are starless, and 41% are potentially protostellar. 71% of the starless cores are prestellar core candidates, suggesting a prestellar core lifetime similar to that of Class 0/I YSOs. Higher-mass clouds have a higher fraction of prestellar cores compared to protostars, suggesting a longer average prestellar core lifetime. We assessed completeness by inserting critically-stable Bonnor--Ebert spheres into a blank SCUBA-2 field: completeness scales as distance squared, with an average mass recovery fraction of $73\pm6$% for recovered sources. We calculated core masses and radii, and assessed their gravitational stability using the Bonnor-Ebert criterion. Maximum starless core mass scales with cloud complex mass with an index $0.58\pm 0.13$, consistent with the behaviour of maximum stellar masses in embedded clusters. We performed least-squares and Monte Carlo modelling of the core mass functions (CMFs) of our starless and prestellar core samples. The CMFs can be characterised using log-normal distributions: we do not sample the full range of core masses needed to create the stellar Initial Mass Function (IMF). The CMFs of the clouds are not consistent with being drawn from a single underlying distribution. The peak mass of the starless core CMF increases with cloud mass; the prestellar CMF of the more distant clouds has a peak mass $\sim 3\times$ the log-normal peak for the system IMF, implying a $\sim 33$% prestellar core-to-star efficiency.</description>

      <title>Cascading from the winds to the disk: the universality of supernovae-driven turbulence in different galactic interstellar mediums</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Star-forming galaxies are in a state of turbulence, with one of the principle components of the turbulence sourced by the constant injection of momentum from supernovae (SNe) explosions. Utilizing high-resolution stratified, gravito-hydrodynamical models of SNe-driven turbulence with interstellar medium (ISM) cooling and heating, we explore how SNe-driven turbulence changes across different galactic conditions, parameterized by the galactic mass and potential, SNe-driving rate, and seeding functions. We show that even though the underlying ISM changes between starburst and Milky Way analogue models, the velocity fluctuations in the turbulence of both models, but not the kinetic energy fluctuations, can be normalized into a universal, single cascade, $u^2(k) \propto k^{-3/2}$, where $u$ is the velocity and $k$ is the wavemode, indicating that the structure of the turbulence is robust to significant changes in the ISM and SNe seeding. Moreover, the cascades connect smoothly from the winds into the galactic disk, pushing the outer-scale of the turbulence, $\ell_{\rm cor}$, to over $\ell_{\rm cor} \approx 6 \ell_0$, where $\ell_0$ is the gaseous scale-height. By providing an analytical model for the sound speed spectrum, $c_s^2(k)$, in the weak-cooling, adiabatic limit, we show that it is the compressible turbulent modes, $u_c$, that control the volume-filling phase structure of the galactic disks in our models, with $c_s^2(k) \propto k^{-2} \propto u_c^2(k)$. This may indicate that galactic turbulence does not only have highly-universal features across different galaxies, but also directly sets the volume-filling hot and warm phase structure of the underlying galactic ISM through turbulent compressible modes.</description>

      <title>Mysteries of Capotauro - investigating the puzzling nature of an extreme F356W-dropout</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: JWST has uncovered a diverse population of extreme near-infrared dropouts, including ultra high-redshift ($z&gt;15$) galaxy candidates, dust-obscured galaxies challenging dust production theories, sources with strong Balmer breaks - possibly compact AGN in dense environments - and cold, sub-stellar Galactic objects. This work presents Capotauro, a F356W-dropout in the CEERS survey with F444W AB magnitude of $\sim27.68$ and a sharp $&gt;3$ mag flux drop between $3.5{-}4.5\,\mu$m, undetected below $3.5\,\mu$m. We combine JWST/NIRCam, MIRI, and NIRSpec/MSA data with HST/ACS and WFC3 observations to perform a spectro-photometric analysis of Capotauro using multiple SED-fitting codes. Our setup tests $z\geq15$ as well as $z&lt;10$ dusty, Balmer-break or strong-line galaxy solutions, and the possibility of Capotauro being a Milky Way sub-stellar object. Among extragalactic options, our analysis favors interpreting the sharp drop as a Lyman break at $z\sim32$, consistent with the epoch of formation of the first stars and black holes, with only $\sim0.5\%$ of the posterior volume at $z&lt;25$. Lower-redshift solutions struggle to reproduce the extreme break, suggesting that if Capotauro lies at $z&lt;10$, it must show a non-standard combination of strong dust attenuation and/or Balmer breaks, making it a peculiar interloper. Alternatively, its properties match a very cold (Y2-Y3 type) brown dwarf or a free-floating exoplanet with a record-breaking combination of low temperature and large distance ($T_{\mathrm{eff}}&lt;300\,\mathrm{K}$, $d\gtrsim130\,\mathrm{pc}$, up to $\sim2\,\mathrm{kpc}$). While current data cannot determine its nature, Capotauro emerges as a remarkably unique object in all plausible scenarios, and a compelling target for follow-up.</description>

      <title>Galaxy-halo internal alignments across cosmic time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Investigations of intrinsic alignments suggest a link between the alignment of a central galaxy's major axis with the galaxy distribution and its internal galaxy-halo shape alignment. In contrast, blue central galaxies typically exhibit almost no alignment signal, owing to a stronger internal misalignment with their halo. We investigated how the internal alignment between the principal axes of the stellar and dark matter components evolves over time as a function of the total mass of central galaxies at z=0. In particular, we aim to understand why disk-dominated, blue central galaxies often show weak or absent alignment signals with the galaxy distribution in their group and in the larger-scale cosmic structure. We used data from the IllustrisTNG300-1 run and selected a sample of bright central galaxies at z=0. We computed the principal axes of the stellar and dark matter components, along with their angular momenta, to obtain the various alignment angles analyzed in this study. Also, we used the merger trees to determine the number of major mergers between z=20 and z=0, and to track their shapes along their main branch. We examined secondary dependencies of the galaxy-halo alignment on properties such as color and merger history. We analyzed how shape alignments relate to the dynamical coupling between the angular momentum directions of the stellar and dark matter components. The results show that massive centrals tend to align with the shape of their inner halo, and they are typically red and have undergone numerous mergers. Lower-mass red centrals, and those that have experienced many mergers exhibit the strongest evolution toward alignment. Blue centrals, in contrast, are more strongly influenced by the link between the stellar and dark matter angular momenta, such that they evolve toward either alignment or misalignment with both the shape and angular momentum of the inner halo.</description>

      <title>Azimuthal offsets in spiral arms of nearby galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiral arms play a central role in disc galaxies, but their dynamical nature remains a long-standing open question. Azimuthal offsets between molecular gas and star formation are expected if gas crosses spiral arms, as predicted by quasi-stationary density wave theory. In this work, we measure offsets between CO and Halpha peaks in radial bins for 24 galaxies from the PHANGS survey that display a well-delineated spiral structure. The offsets exhibit substantial scatter, implying that star formation is not exclusively initiated at a coherent spiral shock. We define offsets such that positive values mean Halpha peaks lie ahead of CO peaks in the direction of galactic rotation. With this convention, 14 galaxies show mean positive CO-Halpha offsets, typically of a few hundred parsecs. In four of these 14 galaxies (17% of the total), offsets become smaller with increasing radius, as expected for a single quasi-stationary spiral density wave. Ten galaxies (42%) show positive mean offsets but no clear correlation with radius, which is compatible with multiple overlapping modes. In the remaining ten galaxies (42%), we find no significantly positive offsets, which could point to transient dynamical spirals or material arms, where gas and stars co-rotate with the spiral perturbation. Across the full sample, we find mostly positive offsets between CO peaks and the gravitational potential minimum, confirming that gas often crosses the spiral perturbation. For the four galaxies with clear positive offsets and a radial trend, we derived pattern speeds in good agreement with the literature. Overall, our results suggest that even well-delineated spirals in the local Universe can arise from a variety of underlying dynamical mechanisms.</description>

Abstract: We explore whether Local Group dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxies might have hosted Earth-like planets dwelling unexposed for several billions of years to major galactic threats to life, such as supernovae and gamma-ray bursts. To this aim, we developed a novel semiempirical model that exploits the observed chemical abundances and star formation histories of a selected sample of local dSphs, to explore whether their stars may have (i) reached the minimum metallicity to trigger planet formation and (ii) avoided exposure to destructive events long enough to provide time for possible biological development. From our work two scenarios emerge. If planet formation is possible for ${\rm[Fe/H]}\lesssim-1$, then in all dSphs with $5\times10^{3}L_{\odot}\leq L_V\leq2\times10^{7}L_{\odot}$ a fraction $\approx0.1\%-10\%$ of stars might have safely hosted terrestrial planets for more than $1$ Gyr. In this scenario, ancient ultra-faint dwarf galaxies (UFDs, $L_V\leq10^{5}L_{\odot}$) would have been the first to reach this condition in the history of the Local Group. Conversely, if planets form for ${\rm[Fe/H]}\geq-0.6$ then they should not exist in UFDs, while only $\approx0.001\%-0.1\%$ of stars in dSphs with $L_V\geq3\times10^{5}L_{\odot}$ would host planets dwelling in safe conditions for long times. Interestingly, we find a "luminosity sweet spot" at $L_V\sim10^{6}L_{\odot}$ where dSphs in our sample safely host terrestrial planets up to $4$ Gyr and in any planet formation scenario explored. In conclusion, planet formation at low metallicity is key to understanding which types of galaxies might have formed Earth-like planets that dwelt unexposed to galactic threats over several billions of years, first in the history of the Local Group.</description>

      <title>The near infrared SED of young star clusters in the FEAST galaxies: Missing ingredients at 1 - 5 $\mu$m</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a combined HST and JWST 0.2 - to - 5 $\mu$m analysis of the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of emerging young star clusters (eYSCs) in four nearby galaxies from the Feedback in Emerging extrAgalactic Star clusTers (FEAST) survey: M51, M83, NGC 628, and NGC 4449. These clusters, selected for their bright Pa$\alpha$ and 3.3 $\mu$m polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission, are still associated to their natal gas cloud and have been largely missed in previous HST optical campaigns. We modeled their SEDs using the CIGALE fitting code and identified: i) a systematic flux excess at 1.5 - 2.5 $\mu$m that is not accounted for by current stellar population models; ii) the preference for a set of dust model parameters that is not aligned with expectations from self-consistent analyses of star-forming regions, suggesting model shortcomings also in the 3 - 5 $\mu$m. The near-infrared (NIR) excess is most prominent in low-mass ($\leq 3000$ M$_\odot$) and young ($\leq 6$ Myr) clusters. Additionally, we see that the SED fitting analysis wrongly assigns ages $\geq 6$ Myr to a fraction of strong Pa$\alpha$ emitters with equivalent widths suggestive of significantly younger ages. A parallel analysis with the slug code suggests that stochastic initial mass function (IMF) sampling of pre-main-sequence stars combined with extinction might partially reduce the gap. We conclude that the inclusion of young stellar object SEDs, along with more realistic sampling of the cluster IMF, might be needed to fully account for the stellar population and dust properties of eYSCs.</description>

      <title>Recovering the Dust Mass Budget with PRIMA</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving a complete picture of galaxy evolution is a primary goal of extragalactic astrophysics. To accomplish this ambitious task, a wealth of multi-wavelength surveys have been devoted to assess the cosmic evolution of the cold gas and of the stellar mass across cosmic time. In this cosmic census, one elusive component is represented by interstellar dust. In this work, we exploit the IR mission PRIMA (covering wavelengths from 24 $\mu$m to 235 $\mu$m) to perform a deep survey (1000h on 1 deg$^2$) aimed at estimating the still poorly known dust mass function (DMF) at $z \sim 0.5 - 5$. We consider the spectro-photometric realization of the SPRITZ simulation and we compute the dust masses using single temperature Modified Grey Body functions. We show how PRIMA alone, thanks to its unprecedented sensitivities, will constrain the DMF at $z &lt; 1.5$, in terms of mass and faint-end slope. At $z &gt; 1.5$, we stress the key synergy with current or future sub-millimeter facilities, such as the JCMT/SCUBA-2, AtLAST, LMT and ALMA telescopes, that will allow us to probe the R$-$J regime of PRIMA selected galaxies. Finally, PRIMA, thanks to its large photometric coverage, will be able for the first time to constrain strictly the warm dust properties of a two component dust model.</description>

      <title>Understanding the Evolution of Black Hole Accretion and Dust out to z=4 with a Deep Imaging Extragalactic Survey with PRIMA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cosmic evolution of obscured star formation, dust properties and production mechanisms, and the prevalence of dust-obscured AGN out to high redshifts are currently some of the hot topics in astrophysics. While much progress has been made in the early days with Spitzer and Herschel, these facilities have not reached the necessary depths to observe the mid-IR light of high-redshift (z &gt; 3) galaxies. Recently, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has filled in the blue side of the rest-frame mid-IR. The Atacama Large (Sub)Millimeter Array (ALMA), on the other hand, provides excellent sensitivity in the far-IR regime, allowing the study of dust and gas properties at high redshifts. Filling the wavelength gap between JWST and ALMA is crucial to progress our understanding of early galaxy evolution - and this will be an important goal in the next decades. The Probe far-IR Mission for Astrophysics (PRIMA), with sensitive imaging and spectroscopic capabilities at 24-240$\mu$m and currently in Phase A study, will achieve this and provide insights into early galaxy evolution, Black Hole growth, and dust production mechanisms. Here we present PRIDES, a possible deep and wide-area survey over 1.6 square-degrees of the COSMOS field with PRIMA to study these science cases.</description>

      <title>Investigating the role of magnetic fields in the formation and evolution of striations in interstellar clouds with PRIMA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Striations are diffuse, linear, quasi-periodic, and magnetized structures located in the outskirts of molecular clouds. These structures seem to play an important role during the earliest stages of star formation. Theoretical models suggest that magnetic fields play an important role in the formation of striations. With its unprecedented resolution and sensitivity, the polarization module of the PRIMAger instrument onboard the PRIMA space observatory will enable studies related to the magnetic properties of striations in nearby molecular clouds. We plan to target three nearby ($\lesssim 350$ pc) molecular clouds (the Polaris Flare, Taurus, and Musca) with prominent striations that are strongly coupled to the large-scale magnetic field properties, as traced by low-resolution sub-millimeter polarization data. We will search for the unique imprint of the passage of magnetohydrodynamic waves in the polarization angle maps, which traces the magnetic field morphology, in bands 3 (172$\mu$m) and 4 (235$\mu$m) of PRIMAger. Each of the target regions is approximately 1 square degree in size. All three regions combined, can be mapped to more than five-sigma detection in averaged polarized intensity in $\sim 59$ hours. The proposed survey promises to provide important information on the early phases of star formation.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Baryonic Effects on the Dynamical Masses Inferred Using Satellite Kinematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Satellite kinematics offers a powerful method to infer dynamical halo masses and has been demonstrated to yield tight constraints on the galaxy-halo connection. However, previous studies have assumed that the halos in which the satellites orbit are composed solely of dark matter, neglecting the role of baryons. Here, we develop an analytical model incorporating stars, gas, and the adiabatic response of dark matter to assess the impact of baryonic effects on the inference from satellite kinematics. The model covers halos in the mass range $10^{12}-10^{15}M_\odot$ and is tuned to agree with well-established observational scaling relations. In addition, the model uses simple functional forms for the mass fractions of ejected baryons and diffuse halo stars, calibrated to the median trends in the EAGLE hydrodynamical simulations. We find that baryonic effects mainly result in a reduction of the satellite line-of-sight velocity dispersion due to the ejection of baryons and the resulting response of the dark matter halo. The effect is minimal (less than 1%) for the most massive halos, but reaches ~5-6% for halos in the mass range $10^{12}-10^{13}M_\odot$, and up to 8% in extreme cases. We propose a simple formalism for correcting the satellite line-of-sight velocity dispersion for baryonic effects, and for marginalizing over the uncertainties. We integrate this correction function into BASILISK, a Bayesian hierarchical inference method applied to satellite kinematics data extracted from large redshift surveys, and find that this shifts central galaxies to higher inferred halo masses at fixed luminosity by up to ~0.3 dex. In a forthcoming work, we demonstrate that these few-percent level baryonic effects can have a non-negligible impact on the inference of cosmological parameters, motivating a novel approach to constraining the efficiency of feedback processes associated with galaxy formation.</description>

      <title>Multiple star-forming episodes of intermediate-redshift galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive and analyse the star formation histories of 393 intermediate-redshift (0.1 $\leq$ z $\leq$ 0.9) galaxies with stellar masses between $\sim$10$^{8}$ - 10$^{12}$ M$_{\odot}$. We probe a cosmic time of approximately 6 Gyr and a range of environments, from field (low-density systems) to rich groups (high-density systems). We find that the galaxies' stellar mean ages, metallicities, and star formation rates (SFRs) follow similar trends to galaxies as those characterising the nearby Universe. We modelled the derived SFRs, quantifying and characterising the number of star-forming episodes (SFEs). We found that more than 85$\%$ of the galaxies have more than one event of star formation, typically described with an exponentially decaying SFR and subsequent Gaussian-like episode(s) of star formation. We also observe that massive galaxies have fewer SFEs than low-mass systems and that they form their stellar mass and reach quiescence faster than lower mass galaxies. Moreover, the history of mass assembly for the most massive galaxies in the sample can be described with only one episode of star formation in the early Universe, which we detected as an exponential decrease that was longer in duration than subsequent SF events. This early event has typically been completed by z$\sim$3 and it accounts for a high fraction of the total stellar mass, from $\sim$40$\%$ for low-mass galaxies to more than 50$\%$ for higher-mass galaxies. We also analysed the dependence of stellar population parameters with the various environments probed by the sample, finding no significant correlations between different group environments; however, our field galaxies are generally distinct from group galaxies in terms of the mass, metallicity, stellar ages, and formation timescales. We discuss possible biases in the sample selection and examine how representative our galaxies are of the overall galaxy population.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a dynamical and chemical study of the centre of a massive early-type strong-lens galaxy ESO286-G022 (SNL-1). Analysing new data obtained through the adaptive-optics-assisted Narrow-Field Mode of VLT/MUSE, we aim to measure the mass distribution and internal properties of SNL-1 at $\sim 50\ {\rm pc}$ resolution. In particular, we aim to address the tension in the reported IMF measurements of SNL-1 between strong-lens/dynamical and spectral-fitting techniques. We fit a triaxial orbital dynamical model to the measured stellar kinematics, including constraining the mass of the (resolved) central supermassive black-hole. The dynamical model is consistent with the mass-to-light ratio expected for a Kroupa-like IMF. We also employ a highly-flexible spectral-fitting technique, which instead favours a Salpeter-like IMF (low-mass slope $\alpha\approx 2.3$) over the same spatial region. To conclude, we discuss possible origins of this discrepancy, both intrinsic and technical.</description>

      <title>FEAST: JWST/NIRCam view of the Resolved Stellar Populations of the Interacting Dwarf Galaxies NGC~4485/NGC~4490</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present new JWST/NIRCam observations of the interacting dwarf galaxy system NGC 4485/NGC 4490 (a.k.a. Arp 269), obtained as part of the Cycle 1 Feedback in Emerging extrAgalactic Star clusTers (FEAST) program. NGC 4485 and NGC 4490 form the closest known pair of interacting late-type dwarf galaxies (at $\sim 7.4$ Mpc), excluding the Magellanic Clouds. Near-infrared color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) reveal a wide range of stellar populations in both galaxies, including young ($\lesssim 200$ Myr) upper main sequence stars, core helium-burning stars, and oxygen-rich asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars. We also identify intermediate-age ($\sim 200$ Myr -- $1$ Gyr) carbon-rich AGB stars and a well-populated old ($\gtrsim 1$ Gyr) red giant branch (RGB). The CMDs show two distinct bursts of star formation beginning $\sim 30$ Myr and $\sim 200$ Myr ago, the latter consistent with the most recent pericenter passage predicted by N-body simulations. The spatial distribution of stars reveals a tidal bridge extending from NGC 4485 and connecting to the disk of NGC 4490. Compact star-forming regions are seen along NGC 4490's spiral arms, possibly originating from its infrared nucleus. A significant metallicity gradient is observed in the young stellar populations forming the bridge. These findings suggest that during the last pericenter passage, gas was stripped from NGC 4485 via tidal forces or ram pressure, accreted by NGC 4490, and mixed with in-situ material, fueling ongoing star formation. This system provides a unique nearby laboratory for studying how tidal interactions shape the star formation and chemical enrichment history of dwarf galaxies.</description>

      <title>The Diversity and Evolution of Dust Attenuation Curves from Redshift z ~ 1 to 9</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The UV-optical dust attenuation curve is key to interpreting the intrinsic properties of galaxies and provides insights into the nature of dust grains and their geometry relative to stars. In this work, we constrain the UV-optical slope of the stellar attenuation curve using a spectroscopic-redshift sample of ~3300 galaxies at z~1-9, to characterize the diversity and redshift evolution of stellar attenuation curves and to gain insight into dust production and evolution at high redshifts. The sample is constructed from three JWST/NIRCam grism surveys in GOODS and A2744 fields, with a wealth of JWST/NIRCam and HST photometry. With constraints from spectroscopic redshifts and emission line fluxes, we use the Prospector SED fitting code with a flexible dust model. We find that the attenuation curve slope varies strongly with Av at all redshifts, becoming flatter at higher attenuation. We find no strong correlation between attenuation curve slope and size or axis ratio, and the trends with stellar mass and star-formation rate are largely driven by their correlation with Av. We find strong evidence that at fixed Av, the curve becomes flatter with increasing redshift. On average, the attenuation curves derived here are shallower than those at z~0 and than the SMC curve. The highest redshift galaxies at z=7-9 (124 galaxies, a significantly larger sample than in previous studies) show slopes even flatter than the Calzetti curve, implying reduced UV obscuration and lower IR luminosities than expected from an SMC dust curve, by as large as an order of magnitude. Hydrodynamical simulations that couple dust growth to gas chemical enrichment successfully reproduce the different loci of high- and low-redshift galaxies in the slope-Av diagram, suggesting that dust in high-redshift galaxies is increasingly dominated by large grains produced in supernova ejecta with limited ISM processing at early times.</description>

      <title>Mapping Magnetic Fields from Clouds to Cores with PRIMAger</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-resolution, wide-area mapping of magnetic field geometries within molecular clouds, and the star-forming filaments and cores within them, is crucial in order to understand the role of magnetic fields in the star formation process. We therefore propose an unbiased survey of star-forming molecular clouds within 0.5 kpc of the Earth in polarized light with the PRIMAger Polarimetry Imager. We will map magnetic fields over entire molecular clouds at linear resolutions of $\sim10^{-3}-10^{-2}$ pc ($\sim10^{3}-10^{4}$ au) in PRIMAger Bands PPI1 - PPI4, thereby resolving magnetic field structure both within individual star-forming filaments and cores, and in the most diffuse regions of molecular clouds. These multi-wavelength polarimetric observations will allow us to systematically investigate both the wide range of open questions about the role of magnetic fields in star formation and the evolution of the interstellar medium, and interstellar dust grain properties. The time required to map the area observed by the \textit{Herschel} Gould Belt Survey (160 deg$^{2}$) to the cirrus confusion limit in polarized light is 170 hours. This will give a 5-$\sigma$ detection of 20% polarized low-density cirrus emission, with surface brightnesses in polarized intensity of 1.0-2.4\,MJy/sr across the PRIMAger bands, and will ensure detection of polarized emission at all higher column densities. This time estimate can be simply scaled up in order to map magnetic fields in a larger sample of molecular clouds, including more distant regions of higher-mass star formation.</description>

Abstract: We relate the optical attenuation inferred by the Balmer decrement, $A_{V\mathrm{,BD}}$, and by the SED-fitting, $A_{V\mathrm{,SED}}$, to the dust distribution and gas surface density throughout the disc of galaxies, down to scales smaller than 0.5 kpc. We investigate five nearby star-forming spirals with available FUV to sub-mm observations, along with atomic and molecular gas surface density maps and optical integral-field spectroscopic data. We use the CIGALE SED-fitting code to map the dust mass surface density ($\Sigma_\mathrm{dust}$) and $A_{V,\mathrm{SED}}$ of different stellar populations. For each pixel, we independently estimate the attenuation from the BD.
  We find that both $\Sigma _\mathrm{dust}$ and $A_{V,\mathrm{BD}}$ trace better the molecular and total gas mass surface density, rather than the atomic gas. Since regions sampled in this study have high molecular fractions, atomic gas surface densities, indicative of molecular gas shielding layers, decrease as the mean dust-to-gas ratio increases from galaxy to galaxy. The fitted attenuation towards young stars, $A^\mathrm{young}_{V,\mathrm{SED}}$, is in good agreement with $A_{V,\mathrm{BD}}$ and it can then be used to trace the attenuation in star forming galaxies where integral-field observations are not available. We estimate the ratio of $A_{V,\mathrm{BD}}$ over the total stellar $A_{V,\mathrm{SED}}$ and find it slightly larger than what has been found in previous studies. Finally, we investigate which dust distribution reproduces better the estimated $A_{V,\mathrm{BD}}$ and $A_{V,\mathrm{SED}}$. We find that the attenuation towards old stars is consistent with the expectations for a standard galactic disc, where the stellar and dust distributions are mixed, while $A_{V, \mathrm{BD}}$ and the $A^\mathrm{young}_{V, \mathrm{SED}}$ are between the values expected for a foreground dust screen and a mixed configuration.</description>

      <title>Searching for missing interstellar oxygen in the far-infrared</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Study of interstellar elemental depletion poses an important problem in the interstellar matter that at least a quarter of the total oxygen ($\sim 160$ ppm relative to hydrogen) is not accounted for in any known form of oxygen in the translucent or dense interstellar medium (ISM). Detailed analysis of the absorption feature of water ice at 3 $\mu$m suggests that one fifth of the missing oxygen may reside in 3 $\mu$m-sized water ice grains. However, the 3 $\mu$m feature becomes complex and weak for grains larger than 3 $\mu$m, and thus the NIR spectroscopy is not the best means to study the presence of large ice grains reliably. Here we show that sensitive observations of the far-infrared (FIR) features of water ice at 44 and 62 $\mu$m enable us to constrain the amount of crystalline water ice grains up to 5 $\mu$m or even larger sizes unambiguously. Oxygen is one of the key elements in the ISM chemistry, and [O I] 63 $\mu$m is a dominant cooling line in the neutral ISM. Understanding the actual form of the missing oxygen in the ISM is crucial for the study of the ISM and star-formation process. To detect the FIR features of the crystalline water ice over the expected strong continuum, a sensitive FIR spectrograph represented by PRIMA/FIRESS is indispensable. Since the feature is broad, the low spectral resolution of $R \sim 130$ is sufficient, but accurate relative calibration better than 1% is required.</description>

      <title>The ALMA-QUARKS survey: Extensive detection of acetamide in multiple high-mass star-forming regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Acetamide (CH$_{3}$CONH$_{2}$), a key interstellar amide and a methyl derivative of formamide (NH$_{2}$CHO), has been sparsely detected, limiting insights into its prebiotic relevance. We present the first systematic survey for acetamide toward 52 hot molecular cores using ALMA Band 6 data. Acetamide has been detected in 10 cores, markedly expanding the inventory of known emitters. The derived column densities of acetamide range from $(2.5\pm0.9)\times10^{14}$ to $(1.5\pm0.6)\times10^{16}$ cm$^{-2}$, compared to formamide's $(1.1\pm0.1)\times10^{15}$ to $(6.9\pm0.4)\times10^{16}$ cm$^{-2}$. The nearly constant abundance ratios (~3-9) and strong abundance correlation between the two amides across sources suggest a chemically linked formation pathway, likely on grain surfaces. The presence of peptide-like molecules in these regions implies that complex organic species can survive star formation processes, offering a potential pathway toward prebiotic chemistry. These findings constrain the dominant grain surface formation routes of acetamide, confirm its broader prevalence in highmass star-forming regions, and underscore the importance of targeted amide surveys in tracing the chemical evolution toward prebiotic complexity.</description>

      <title>Investigations of MWISP Clumps: 13CO Clump Source Catalog and Physical Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first comprehensive catalogs of $^{13}$CO clumps from the Milky Way Imaging Scroll Painting (MWISP) project. By developing an equivalent global detection scheme integrated with the FacetClumps algorithm, we successfully extract 71,661 molecular clumps across a high-resolution $^{13}$CO data cube spanning 2310 deg$^2$ from the MWISP Phase I survey. To determine accurate distances, we design an automatic hierarchical distance decision method using signal regions as fundamental objects, effectively resolving the kinematic distance ambiguity problem and obtaining reliable measurements for 97.94% of the sample. Statistical analysis reveals that 65.3% of clumps are gravitationally bound, accounting for approximately 96.3% of the statistical total mass. Scaling relation analysis across multiple surveys reveals universal power-law behaviors in clump populations. Maser-associated clumps exhibit modified parameter distributions and scaling relations, revealing how active star formation alters clump dynamics and structure. These extensive catalogs establish a foundation for investigating molecular clump properties, star formation processes, and Galactic evolution.</description>

      <title>Need for PRIMA to understand the nature and ISM physical conditions of HST-dark galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the main open issues in galaxy formation and evolution is the early assembly of the most massive galaxies and their contribution to the stellar mass and star formation rate densities at early epochs. Massive red sources already in place at z &gt; 2 to 3 have been found in deep Spitzer-IRAC and ALMA surveys. They are often called optically and near-IR dark, or HST-dark, being undetected even in the deepest HST frames. The submillimeter (i.e., ALMA) detection of these sources confirms their high-z dusty nature: they are massive (e.g., log(M*/Msun) &gt; 10) and dusty star-forming galaxies with estimated redshifts in the 2.5 to 7 range. They seem to lie mostly below the main sequence (MS) of star-forming galaxies and show gas depletion times &lt;1 Gyr. Imaging with the PRIMA/PRIMAger instrument over the full 25 to 265 micron range will allow us to characterize their still uncovered spectral energy distributions between JWST and ALMA spectral windows, probing their dust content and properties (e.g., temperature, mass), whereas spectroscopic observations with FIRESS will be the key to investigate the nature of their powering source (e.g., AGN or star formation) and to study the physics of their ISM, by detecting and measuring fine structure lines in the mid- and far-IR domain.</description>

      <title>The radial variation of the silicate-to-carbon ratio in M31 probed by PRIMA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The properties of interstellar dust grains are being scrutinized more than ever before, with the advent of large facilities. Infrared emission from dust grains is a powerful asset than can help constrain their physical and chemical properties. Among these, the relative ratio of carbon-rich to silicate-rich grains remains one that has not yet been investigated thoroughly, due to the lack of dedicated instruments and modeling limitations. In this paper, we quantify the modeling degeneracies inherent to constraining the far-infrared (far-IR) slope of the dust emission spectral energy distribution. Used as a proxy for the silicate-to-carbon ratio, we find that recovering the far-IR slope is affected by the estimate of the local radiation field, and the input abundances of different grain species. We show that PRIMA's Hyperspectral Imaging will lead to better constrained local radiation fields which will aid -- together with PRIMA's polarization capabilities -- to better constrain the silicate-to-carbon ratio in M31, and how it spatially varies within the galaxy.</description>

      <title>A bar stability criterion distinguishing between modified gravity and dark matter in galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a study on the distinguishability of dark matter and Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) at galactic scales based on the stability criterion proposed by Efstathiou, Lake, and Negroponte (ELN criterion). First, we test the statistical validity of this stability criterion against the presence of bars within the SPARC and CALIFA databases, successfully identifying $\sim 70\%$ of barred galaxies. Then, we employ a series of N-body galaxy simulations to exhibit a direct observable difference between the dark matter and MOND theoretical frameworks, at least in gas-poor galaxies. We present N-body models that satisfy the stability requirement of the ELN criterion, and so are stable against bar formation in the presence of a dark matter halo, and that do actually exhibit bar instabilities in MOND. On the other hand, the question of how to inhibit bar formation in gas-poor galaxies in MOND is posed, and requires a detailed investigation of the external field effect.</description>

      <title>Detection of 'super-virial' gas in the Circumgalactic medium of the Milky Way towards PKS 2155-304</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first simultaneous detection of four distinct highly ionized $z=0$ absorbing phases using Chandra and XMM-Newton grating spectra toward the blazar PKS 2155$\hbox{-}$304. We detect the MgXII K$\alpha$ absorption line for the first time in the circumgalactic medium (CGM) of the Milky Way. Along with MgXII K$\alpha$, we detect SiXIV K$\alpha$ absorption, which are the tell-tale signatures of the hot 'super-virial' gas in the CGM. Both from the model-independent calculations and hybrid-ionization modeling, we infer four phases at distinct temperatures, hot 'super-virial' ($5.4^{+1.9}_{-0.8} \times 10^7$ K), warm-hot 'virial' ($1.8^{+0.3}_{-0.2} \times 10^6$ K), warm 'sub-virial' ($2.2\pm 0.5 \times 10^5$ K), and cool phase ($&lt;1.7 \times 10^5$ K). The warm-hot and hot phases are $\alpha$-enhanced, and [C/O] and [Ne/O] are super-solar in the warm-hot phase, while [Mg/O] and [Si/O] are super-solar in the hot phase. The low-ionization lines are blue-shifted (v$_{\rm los} \approx -100$ km s$^{-1}$), whereas the high-ionization lines are red-shifted. It suggests a scenario of infalling sub-virial, quasi-static virial, and outflowing super-virial phases along this sightline. Earlier studies on individual sightlines were confined to the Northern Hemisphere. Our sightline is located in the Southern hemisphere, demonstrating that hot super-virial gas is also present at Southern Galactic latitudes as well. This confirms a more widespread distribution of the super-virial gas across both hemispheres.</description>

      <title>The ALPINE-CRISTAL-JWST Survey: Revealing Less Massive Black Holes in High-Redshift Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a systematic search for broad-line active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in the ALPINE-CRISTAL-JWST sample of 18 star-forming galaxies ($M_\star&gt;10^{9.5}~M_{\odot}$) at redshifts $z=4.4-5.7$. Using JWST/NIRSpec IFU, we identify 7 AGN candidates through the detection of broad \Ha\ emission lines from 33 aperture spectra centred on photometric peaks. These candidates include one highly robust AGN detection with FWHM $\sim$ 2800 \kms\ and six showing broad components with FWHM $\sim 600-1600$ \kms, with two in a merger system. We highlight that only broad-line detection is effective since these candidates uniformly lie within narrow emission-line ratio diagnostic diagrams where star-forming galaxies and AGNs overlap. The broad-line AGN fraction ranges from 5.9\% to 33\%, depending on the robustness of the candidates. Assuming that the majority are AGNs, the relatively high AGN fraction is likely due to targeting high-mass galaxies, where simulations demonstrate that broad-line detection is more feasible. Their black hole masses range from $10^6$ to $10^{7.5}~M_{\odot}$ with $0.1 \lesssim L_{\rm bol}/L_{\rm Edd}\lesssim 1$. Counter to previous JWST studies at high redshift that found overmassive black holes relative to their host galaxies, our candidates lie close to or below the local $M_{\rm BH}-M_\star$ scaling relations, thus demonstrating the effect of selection biases. This study provides new insights into AGN-host galaxy co-evolution at high redshift by identifying faint broad-line AGNs in galaxy samples, highlighting the importance of considering mass-dependent selection biases and the likelihood of a large population of AGNs being undermassive and just now being tapped by JWST.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The QCD phase transition in the early universe may provide primordial black hole nuclei for globular clusters. We consider the accretion and star formation that follow, once 1000 solar mass nuclei have formed. When such a nucleus has formed, it remains. Whether these are common in the oldest globular clusters is one decidedly challenging question for the model, which is, as yet, unanswered; another is a possible contribution to the cosmic gravitational radiation background.</description>

      <title>SDSS J1001+5027: Strong microlensing-induced chromatic variation caught in the act</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conducted long-term monitoring of the doubly imaged gravitationally lensed quasar SDSS J1001+5027 consisting of spectro-photometric observations separated by $\sim$120 days (time delay between both quasar images), as well as test and auxiliary data. This monitoring approach allowed us to reliably find a strong microlensing-induced chromatic variation of the quasar continuum in the period 2022$-$2025. The ongoing microlensing event has caused the delay-corrected spectral flux ratio in 2025 to have a dramatic changing look, opening the door to very promising observations of the system in the coming years. These future follow-up observations of such a rare event are expected to provide critical information to discuss, among other things, the structure of the inner accretion flow towards the central supermassive black hole in SDSS J1001+5027.</description>

      <title>Primordial black holes in the main lensing galaxy of FBQ 0951+2635</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although dark matter in galaxies may consist of elementary particles different from those that make up ordinary matter and that would be smoothly distributed (still undetected), the so-called primordial black holes (PBHs) formed soon after the initial Big Bang are also candidates to account for a certain fraction of mass in galaxies. In this paper, we focused on the main lensing galaxy ($z$ = 0.260) of the doubly imaged gravitationally lensed quasar FBQ 0951+2635 ($z$ = 1.246) for probing possible PBH populations. Assuming that the mass of the galaxy is due to smoothly distributed matter (SDM), stars, and PBHs, the 16-yr observed microlensing variability was compared in detail with simulated microlensing signals generated by 90 different physical scenarios. Among other details, the simulated signals were sampled as the observed one, and the observed variability in its entirety and over the long term were used separately for comparison. While none of the scenarios considered can reproduce the overall observed signal, the observed long-term variability favours a small mass fraction in PBHs with a mass of the order of the mean stellar mass. Furthermore, it is possible to obtain strong constraints on the galaxy mass fraction in Jupiter-mass PBHs, provided that a reverberation-based measurement of the source size is available and relatively small. To constrain the mass fraction in $\sim$10 $\rm{M_{\odot}}$ PBHs, light curves five times longer are probably required.</description>

      <title>Signal Drop in Magnification Profiles: Combining Lensing Simulations and Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational lensing magnification bias is a valuable tool for studying mass density profiles, with submillimetre galaxies (SMGs) serving as ideal background sources. The satellite distribution in galaxy clusters also provides insights into their mass distribution.This study aims to investigate the signal drop in mass density profiles from magnification bias measurements, assessing the role of satellite galaxies through observational data and lensing simulations. Using a stacking technique, we analyze the radial distribution of satellites in clusters and measure the magnification bias on background SMGs via angular cross-correlations. A gravitational lensing simulator aids in interpreting the results. Our analysis confirms that satellite distributions align with a Navarro-Frenk-White profile on large scales but exceeding it in the inner part. However, the lack of a similar signal drop at $\sim$10 arcseconds as in the lensing measurements suggests a strong lensing effect from massive central galaxies. The study provides new insights into the mass density profiles derived from gravitational lensing and their relation to satellite distributions within galaxy clusters. The introduction of a gravitational lensing simulator helps explain the emergence of an ``Einstein Gap'' induced by strong lensing effects associated to a change in the apparent position of the sources that suppresses the expected signal. These findings provide a deeper understanding of how satellite galaxies influence gravitational lensing and offer a framework for improving mass density profile estimations in future studies.</description>

      <title>A High Incidence of Mid-infrared Variability in Local Ultraluminous Infrared Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore mid-infrared (MIR) variability in local ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs; infrared luminsoity $L_{\rm IR}&gt;10^{12}\ L_\odot$) utilizing the $\sim$11 years of photometry from the NEOWISE multi-epoch catalog of {\it Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer} ({\it WISE}). We identify 30 variable ULIRGs with statistically significant MIR variability. The variability is observed on timescales of a few years, implying that the MIR-emitting regions are compact ($\lesssim 1$ pc). The difference between maximum and minimum $W2$ (4.6 ${\rm \mu}$m) band luminosity ($\Delta L_{\rm W2}$) of the 30 variable ULIRGs range from $\Delta L_{W2}$ = $7\times10^{42}$ to $5\times 10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$. The $\Delta L_{W2}$ of 25 variable ULIRGs out of 30 are greater than $\Delta L_{W2}$ = $1\times10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$, surpassing the MIR luminosity {range} observed in known supernovae (SNe; $L_{\rm 3.6\ {\rm \mu m}}$ and $L_{\rm 4.5\ {\rm \mu m}}$ &lt; 10$^{42.3}$ erg s$^{-1}$). Therefore, the MIR variabilities in these 25 ULIRGs are most likely driven by tidal disruption events (TDEs) or intrinsic changes in their active galactic nuclei (AGN) torus emission. Our sample includes hard X-ray detected AGNs (e.g., UGC 05101) and previously reported TDE candidates (IRAS F01004-2237, IRAS 05189-2524). All 25 also exhibit at least one AGN signature(s) besides the MIR variability, suggesting that even if the MIR variability originates from TDEs, the black holes responsible are likely AGNs. Our results suggest that MIR variability is an effective tool for detecting buried AGNs and highlights the intense nuclear activity in ULIRGs.</description>

      <title>Supermassive black hole growth from stellar binary encounters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growth of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) remains a central problem in astrophysics, with current observations providing only limited constraints on the underlying mechanisms. One possible growth channel is stellar accretion via the Hill's mechanism, wherein a SMBH tidally breaks up a passing binary star, capturing and eventually accreting a member of the binary. We adopt a model to predict capture rates from parameters that include the central number density of stars, the stellar velocity dispersion, the binary fraction, and black hole mass. We then use this model to estimate the growth of SMBHs across a range of galactic environments. In a data set of 30 galaxies of various types and masses, we identify two candidates with SMBHs for which stellar accretion may be a driver of recent growth. Closer to home, a recent analysis of observed hypervelocity stars from the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) implicates binary star interactions with a massive black hole. Every hypervelocity star produced in this way leaves a bound partner that may be accreted, providing an active growth channel for the LMC's black hole.</description>

      <title>CAPOS: the bulge Cluster APOgee Survey IX. Spectroscopic Analysis of the Bulge Globular Cluster Terzan 2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first detailed spectroscopic analysis of the heavily extincted bulge globular cluster Terzan 2 (Ter 2) based on high-resolution near-infrared spectra obtained as part of the CAPOS (the bulge Cluster APOgee Survey) project. CAPOS focuses on surveying clusters within the Galactic Bulge, using the APOGEE-2S spectrograph, part of the SDSS-IV survey, a component of the second generation Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE-2). For the spectral analysis, we use the Brussels Automatic Code for Characterizing High accUracy Spectra (BACCHUS) code which provides line-by-line elemental abundances. We derive abundances for Fe-peak (Fe, Ni), $\alpha$-(O, Mg, Si, Ca, Ti), light-(C, N), odd-Z(Al), and the s-process element (Ce) for four members of the cluster. Our analysis yields a mean metallicity of [Fe/H]= $-$0.84 $\pm$ 0.04, with no evidence for an intrinsic variation. We detect a significant abundance variation only in C and N, indicating the presence of multiple populations. Ter 2 exhibits a typical $\alpha$-enrichment, that follows the trend of Galactic GCs. Additionally, our dynamical analysis reveals that Terzan 2 is a bulge globular cluster with a chaotic orbit that is influenced by the Galactic bar but not trapped by it, displaying both prograde and retrograde motions within the inner bulge region. Overall, the chemical patterns observed in Terzan 2 are in good agreement with those of other CAPOS bulge clusters of similar metallicity.</description>

      <title>How far have metals reached? Reconciling statistical constraints and enrichment models at Reionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The incidence of quasar absorption systems and the space density of their galaxies are proportional, the proportionality factor being the mean absorbing cross section. In this paper we use redshift parameterizations of these two statistics to predict the cosmic evolution of an equivalent-width ($W_r$) radial profile model, tailored for the low-ionization species Mg II and O I. Our model provides an excellent match with well-sampled, low-redshift Mg II equivalent-width/impact-parameter pairs from the literature. We then focus on the evolution of various quantities between the Reionization and Cosmic Noon eras. Our findings are: (1) The extent of Mg II and hence the amount of cool ($T\sim 10^4$ K), enriched gas in the average halo decreases continuously with cosmic time after $z \approx 6$--$8$. This effect is more pronounced in $W_r^{2796}\lesssim 0.3$ {\AA} systems (outermost layers of the model) and, in general, affects O I more than Mg II, probably due to the onset of photoionization by the UV background. (2) The line density of $W_r^{2796}\gtrsim 1$ {\AA} systems (model inner layers) constantly increases in synchrony with the star formation rate density until it reaches a peak at Cosmic Noon. The line density of $W_r^{2796}\lesssim 0.3$ {\AA} systems, on the other hand, remains constant or decreases over the same period. (3) At the end of Reionization, the filling factor is low enough that the winds have not yet reached neighboring halos. This implies that the halos are self-enriched, as suggested by semi-analytic models. We discuss how these statistical predictions can be reconciled with early metal enrichment models and offer a practical comparison point for future analyses of quasar absorption lines at $z&gt;6$.</description>

      <title>Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the High-redshift Universe: Prospect of the PRIMA FIRESS low-resolution spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integrated luminosity from the features of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) exceeds the luminosity from atomic and molecular emission lines in the star-forming regions in galaxies and is a potential tracer of galaxy-scale star formation and molecular gas content of the high-redshift universe. We simulate the observable PAH spectra using the PRobe far-Infrared Mission for Astrophysics far-infrared enhanced survey spectrometer (FIRESS) and investigate the capability of the FIRESS low-resolution spectroscopy for observing PAH emission spectrum from high-redshift galaxies. Our investigation suggests that (1) PRIMA observations of PAH emission are $\gtrsim10$ times more efficient at detecting galaxies than the VLA observations of CO(1-0) for galaxies with the same infrared luminosity, (2) PRIMA/FIRESS can detect the PAH emission from galaxies with $L_{IR}\sim10^{12}L_{\odot}$ up to the end of reionization (and possibly beyond, if $L_{IR}\sim10^{13}L_{\odot}$), (3) the PAH band ratios measured from a full spectral fitting and from a simple flux "clipping" method are different and vary depending on the interstellar radiation field strength, and (4) PRIMA/FIRESS can also be used as the PAH mapping instrument to measure star formation and redshift of the galaxies in high-redshift protoclusters.</description>

      <title>PRIMA Vista: far-infrared polarimetry to unveil small-scale magnetohydrodynamics in extragalactic observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic fields are a fundamental part of the interstellar medium (ISM) and remain a challenge for building a comprehensive understanding of galactic properties. Their study requires far-infrared polarimetric observations, which provide an unrivaled probe of the dynamics, magnetization, and structure of the coldest and densest interstellar gas and dust at small scales in galaxies, where mass and star formation reside. We use high-resolution magnetohydrodynamical simulations of a face-on Milky Way-like galaxy and show that the alignment of magnetic fields with ISM structures and the turbulence at 100 pc scales decrease with increasing magnetization. We make predictions for extragalactic observations by the proposed PRobefarInfrared Mission for Astrophysics (PRIMA) telescope, comparing them with Stratospheric Observatory For Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA) observations similar to those of the Survey of extragALactic magnetiSm with SOFIA (SALSA). PRIMA will be able to better measure magnetic alignment trends inaccessible by SOFIA. We find that PRIMA will better sample magnetic turbulence, especially in dense environments, and will be able to measure the unresolved intrinsic magnetic field orientations to approximately 6 deg precision. PRIMA will also be capable of resolving observables such as the polarized fraction or the magnetic alignment down to scales comparable to the resolution of our simulations (about 10 pc) for galaxies up to 0.5 Mpc away. The polarization-dispersion relation shows that PRIMA observations will suffer from significantly reduced beam depolarization. Furthermore, PRIMA will recover the correlation between increasing the magnetic alignment parameter and local polarization fraction. Overall, observations of local galaxies with PRIMA will better characterize interstellar magnetism and constrain ISM and galaxy models, advancing our understanding of magnetism in the universe.</description>

      <title>Chemodynamics of Bo\"otesI with $S^{5}$: Revised Velocity Gradient, Dark Matter Density, and Galactic Chemical Evolution Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We combine new spectroscopic observations of the ultra faint dwarf galaxy (UFD) Bo\"otes I (Boo I) from the Southern Stellar Stream Spectroscopic Survey ($S^{5}$) with $\sim$15 years of archival spectroscopic data to create the largest sample of stellar kinematics and metallicities to date in any Milky Way UFD. Our combined sample includes 148 members extending out to $\sim$7 half-light radii ($r_h$), including 24 newly confirmed members, 18 binary candidates, 15 RR Lyrae stars, and 92 [Fe/H] measurements. Using this larger and more spatially extended sample, we provide updated constraints on Boo I's systemic properties, including its radial population gradients. Properly accounting for perspective rotation effects in a UFD for the first time, we detect a $4\sigma$ line-of-sight velocity gradient of $1.2\pm0.3$ km s$^{-1}$ $r_h^{-1}$ aligned along Boo I's orbit and discuss its potential tidal origins. We also infer a metallicity gradient of $-0.10\pm0.02$ dex $r_h^{-1}$ in agreement with previous studies. Using an axisymmetric Jeans model, we provide updated constraints on Boo I's dark matter density profile, which weakly favor a cusped ($\gamma=1.0^{+0.5}_{-0.6}$) dark matter profile. Lastly, we re-analyze Boo I's metallicity distribution function with a one-zone galactic chemical evolution model and place new constraints on its rapid, inefficient star formation and strong galactic outflows.</description>

      <title>Is feedback-free star formation possible?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been suggested that, if the free-fall time of star-forming clouds is shorter than the lifetime ($\approx 3 $ Myr) of massive stars exploding as supernovae (SN), a large fraction of the cloud gas can be converted into stars during an allegedly `feedback-free' phase. Here, we show that radiation pressure from Ly$\alpha$ photons produced in the pre-SN phase can instead erase feedback-free conditions, and severely limit the star formation efficiency (SFE). We find that, for a constant star formation rate, all clouds with gas surface density $(37-1.7 \times 10^5)\ M_\odot\ \rm pc^{-2}$ have $\epsilon_* &lt; 0.08$. Higher SFE values can only be reached if Ly$\alpha$-driven shells fragment and form stars. While advanced RHD simulations are required to establish the importance of this effect, adopting an optimistic guess, we find that the SFE increases with cloud surface density, rising from $\epsilon_*=0.023$ at $\Sigma_g = 37\ M_\odot\ \mathrm{pc^{-2}}$ to $\epsilon_*=0.27$ at $\Sigma_g = 1.7 \times 10^5\ M_\odot\ \mathrm{pc^{-2}}$. Given the optimistic assumptions adopted, these numbers should be regarded as upper limits. We conclude that Ly$\alpha$ radiation pressure strongly limits the SFE, even at solar metallicities, erasing the possibility that a feedback-free star formation mode with $\epsilon_* \gtrsim 0.4$ exists in the pre-SN phase. This conclusion remains valid even when other effects such as dust destruction of Ly$\alpha$ photons, presence of HII regions, velocity gradients, atomic recoil, and turbulence are considered.</description>

      <title>Dissociative electron attachment to the HNC$_3$ molecule</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dissociative electron attachment (DEA) to the HNC$_3$ is modeled theoretically using a first-principles approach. In HNC$_3$+$e^-$ collisions, there is a low-energy resonance, which has a repulsive character along the H+NC$_3$ coordinate and becomes a bound electronic state of the HNC$_3^-$ anion near the equilibrium of HNC$_3$. The anion state dissociates without a potential barrier towards C$_3$N$^-$+H. The cross section and the rate coefficient of the process were computed. The obtained rate coefficient at low temperatures is $5\times 10^{-9}$cm$^3$/s at 300~K. Such a value of the DEA rate coefficient makes the DEA process by three orders of magnitude more efficient in producing negative molecular ions in the interstellar space than the radiative electron attachment (REA). It is suggested that negative molecular carbon-chain ions, observed in the interstellar medium, are produced by DEA rather than REA.</description>

      <title>GraViT: Transfer Learning with Vision Transformers and MLP-Mixer for Strong Gravitational Lens Discovery</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational lensing offers a powerful probe into the properties of dark matter and is crucial to infer cosmological parameters. The Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) is predicted to find O(10^5) gravitational lenses over the next decade, demanding automated classifiers. In this work, we introduce GraViT, a PyTorch pipeline for gravitational lens detection that leverages extensive pretraining of state-of-the-art Vision Transformer (ViT) models and MLP-Mixer. We assess the impact of transfer learning on classification performance by examining data quality (source and sample size), model architecture (selection and fine-tuning), training strategies (augmentation, normalization, and optimization), and ensemble predictions. This study reproduces the experiments in a previous systematic comparison of neural networks and provides insights into the detectability of strong gravitational lenses on that common test sample. We fine-tune ten architectures using datasets from HOLISMOKES VI and SuGOHI X, and benchmark them against convolutional baselines, discussing complexity and inference-time analysis.</description>

      <title>Emulating Global 21 cm Cosmology Observations from the Lunar Far Side to Achieve Quick and Reliable Physical Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efforts are underway to measure the global 21 cm signal from neutral hydrogen, which is a powerful probe of the early universe, using NASA radio telescopes on the far side of the Moon. Physics-based models of the signal are computationally expensive to perform Bayesian multi-parameter inferences, for which we have developed novel, publicly-available neural network emulators utilizing a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network and a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN). $\texttt{21cmLSTM}$ is currently the most accurate emulator in the community by leveraging the signal's temporally-correlated structure, and $\texttt{21cmKAN}$ maintains similar accuracy while training 75 times faster, by learning expressive functional transformations. Each emulator can fit realistic mock signals and obtain unbiased physical parameter constraints, with $\texttt{21cmKAN}$ able to complete end-to-end training and inference in under 30 minutes. The implementation of machine learning tools like these in data analysis pipelines is important to fully exploit upcoming measurements of the cosmological 21 cm signal.</description>

      <title>The Aromatic Infrared Bands around the Wolf-Rayet Binary WR140 Revealed by JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01026v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have analyzed the aromatic infrared bands (AIBs) in the 6-11.2 $\mu$m range around the Wolf-Rayet binary WR140 (d=1.64 kpc) obtained with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) Medium-Resolution Spectrometer (MRS). In WR140's circumstellar environment, we have detected AIBs at 6 $\mu$m and 7.7 $\mu$m which are attributed to C-C stretching modes. These features have been detected in the innermost dust shell (Shell1; ~2100 au from WR140), the subsequent dust shell (Shell2; ~5200 au), and ``off-shell'' regions in the MRS coverage. The 11.2 $\mu$m AIB, which is associated with the C-H out-of-plane bending mode, has been tentatively detected in Shell2 and the surrounding off-shell positions around Shell2. We compared the AIB features from WR140 to spectra of established AIB feature classes A, B, C, and D. The detected features around WR140 do not agree with these established classes. The peak wavelengths and full width half maxima (FWHMs) of the 6 $\mu$m and 7.7 $\mu$m features are, however, consistent with those of R Coronae Borealis (RCB) stars with hydrogen-poor conditions. We discuss a possible structure of carbonaceous compounds and environments where they form around WR140. It is proposed that hydrogen-poor carbonaceous compounds initially originate from the carbon-rich WR wind, and the hydrogen-rich stellar wind from the companion O star may provide hydrogen to these carbonaceous compounds.</description>

      <title>A magnetic white dwarf formed through a binary merger within 35 million years</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01069v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: White dwarfs (WDs) represent the final evolutionary stage of most stars, typically originating from progenitor stars with masses below approximately 8 $M_{\odot}$ to 10 $M_{\odot}$. Formation through single-star evolution generally requires at least 25 Myr, with the youngest WDs often near the Chandrasekhar limit of 1.4 $M_{\odot}$. In contrast, WDs formed via binary channels, such as mergers or mass transfer, can develop smaller masses in a shorter timescale and may exhibit unique characteristics, including strong surface magnetic fields and rapid rotation. Accurately determining the ages of these WDs is essential for understanding their formation. A valuable method involves studying WDs in star clusters, where member stars share the same age and chemical composition, allowing for precise constraints on the formation times and metallicities of the WDs' progenitors. Here we report a WD found in the open cluster RSG 5, which is only 35 Myr old. The WD's mass is lower than 1.05 $M_{\odot}$, indicating it may not have formed through single-star evolution. The WD possesses an exceptionally strong surface magnetic field ($\ge 200$ MG), a short rotational period ($\sim 6.5$ min), and, most notably, a co-rotating half-ring of ionized circumstellar debris. This distinctive feature provides evidence for a binary merger origin, a scenario further substantiated by our stellar evolution models.</description>

      <title>An AGB star as the source of the abundance pattern of hyper-metal-poor star HE 1327-2326</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01302v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Abridged. HE 1327-2326 (HE 1327), with [Fe/H]=-5.2, is one of the most metal-poor stars detected and a candidate to be the offspring of the first stars. Numerous efforts have been made to match its abundance pattern. However, no model satisfactorily explains its entire surface chemical composition. The high CNO pattern with [N/Fe]&gt;[C/Fe]&gt;[O/Fe], the light element 'slide' (between Na and Si), and the presence of Sr and Ba in HE 1327 is reminiscent of those asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars that undergo third dredge-up, hot bottom burning, and s-processing, suggesting that AGBs may have been progenitors of the star. We assume that, where HE 1327 formed, the interstellar medium was well-mixed, and adopt an initial stellar composition based on the observed chemical evolution of the early universe. We calculated models of hyper-metal-poor AGB stars and compared their yields to the observed abundances of HE 1327. Our 3 Msun models match 13 of the 14 measured elements in HE1327. They are also consistent with the seven elements with upper limits. The only discrepancy is O, underproduced by 0.5-1.0 dex. Unlike the SN models, the AGB models also match Sr and Ba. Our model predicts high abundances of P and Pb, which would be useful in testing the AGB scenario. We propose that HE 1327 is the oldest known object that shows nucleosynthetic evidence of the first AGB stars. With lifetimes as short as 200 Myr, these stars may have formed and polluted the universe very early. Recent Pop III star formation simulations support their formation, and their strong N production is qualitatively consistent with recent JWST observations showing high N/O ratios just 440 Myr after the Big Bang. Importantly, our results also suggest that the interstellar medium may have shown some degree of homogeneity and mixing even at these early epochs.</description>

      <title>No evidence of intrinsic linear polarization in Nova Vel 2025 (V572 Vel)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01489v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on polarimetric observations of V572 Vel (Nova Vel 2025) conducted on June 26th and July 21st, 2025, shortly after its nova eruption was discovered. Our measurements in the I$_C$ band revealed an average linear polarization of 1.60$\pm$0.03\% at position angle of 132.2\degr. To distinguish between intrinsic and interstellar polarization, we also measured 86 field stars in the nova's vicinity, finding an average polarization of 1.25$\pm$0.61\% at a nearly identical position angle of 132\degr. The strong consistency between the nova's polarization and that of the surrounding field stars suggests that the observed polarization is predominantly interstellar in origin. We found no significant evidence of an intrinsic polarization component, which would typically arise from an asymmetric distribution of ejected material. Further multi-band observations are recommended to confirm these findings.</description>

      <title>Numerical solutions of the complete two-body system in QUMOND</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to the non-linearity of the QUMOND field equations, in the modelling of binaries so far the two-body system is replaced by an effective one-body system, where the central particle contains the total mass of both binary components and is orbited by a massless test particle. In this work, the discrepancy between the effective one-body treatment and the complete two-body solution in QUMOND is quantified. Particles are treated as limits of Dirac sequences. Then, the QUMOND contribution to the total kinematical acceleration of a particle is expressed as a Green's integral which is calculated numerically. In the non-linear transition regime the kinematical acceleration of the effective one-body system with a total mass of 2 Msun is up to a factor of 1.44 higher than the Newtonian acceleration, whereas the acceleration is only boosted by a factor of 1.2--1.3 in the two-body system in the case of the simple transition function.</description>

      <title>An Accurate Comprehensive Approach to Substructure: IV. Dynamical Friction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In three previous Papers we analysed the origin of the properties of halo substructure found in simulations. This was achieved by deriving them analytically in the peak model of structure formation, using the statistics of nested peaks (with no free parameter) plus a realistic model of subhalo stripping and shock-heating (with only one parameter). However, to simplify the treatment we neglected dynamical friction (DF). Here, we revisit that work by including it. That is done in a fully analytic manner, i.e. avoiding the integration of subhalo orbital motions. This leads to simple accurate expressions for the abundance and radial distribution of subhaloes of different masses, which disentangle the effects of DF from those of tidal stripping and shock-heating. This way we reproduce and explain the results of simulations and extend them to haloes of any mass, redshift and formation times in the desired cosmology.</description>

      <title>Onset of CN Emission in 3I/ATLAS: Evidence for Strong Carbon-Chain Depletion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01647v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interstellar objects provide a direct window into the environmental conditions around stars other than the Sun. The recent discovery of 3I/ATLAS, the second interstellar comet ever observed, offers a unique opportunity to investigate the physical and chemical properties of interstellar objects and to compare them with those of comets in our own Solar System. In this Letter we present the results of a 10-night spectroscopic and photometric monitoring campaign with the 2.4 m Hiltner and 1.3 m McGraw-Hill telescopes at the MDM Observatory. The campaign was conducted between August 8 and 17 while 3I/ATLAS was inbound at heliocentric distances of 3.2 - 2.9 au. Our observations captured the onset of optical gas-driven activity. Nightly spectra reveal a weak CN emission feature in the coma of 3I/ATLAS, absent during the first nights but steadily strengthening thereafter. We measure a CN production rate of $\sim$8$\times$10$^{23}$ s$^{-1}$, towards the lower end of activity observed in Solar System comets. Simultaneous photometry also indicates a small but measurable increase in the coma's radial profile and increasing $r$-band $Af\rho$ with values in the order of $\sim300$ cm. Our upper limit on the C$_2$-to-CN ratio ($\log Q(\mathrm{C}_2)/Q(\mathrm{CN})&lt;-1.05$) places 3I/ATLAS among the most carbon-chain depleted comets known. The derived gas-to-dust production ratio of $\log Q (\mathrm{CN})/Af\rho&lt;21.49$ is likewise at the low end of the Solar System comet distribution. Further observations of 3I/ATLAS are required to verify the apparent carbon-chain depletion and to explore whether such composition represents a recurring trait of the interstellar comet population.</description>

      <title>Gravitational memory meets astrophysical environments: exploring a new frontier through osculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first study of how dark matter environments influence nonlinear gravitational memory from intermediate-mass-ratio binaries. Incorporating dark matter effects-gravitational potential, dynamical friction, and accretion-we compute nonlinear memory for both bound and unbound orbits under dark matter minispikes and Navarro-Frenk-White profiles. For quasi-circular orbits within a minispike profile, we further account empirically for the evolution of the dark matter density. Our findings reveal significant deviations from the vacuum case, with important implications for the detectability of gravitational memory by future gravitational wave observatories. These results underscore the role of astrophysical environments in shaping gravitational memory, strengthening its interpretation as a hereditary imprint of past binary evolution and providing a novel bridge between dark matter physics and memory effects.</description>

      <title>Synergy between Roman and PRIMA imaging capabilities for large extragalactic surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01686v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Roman Space Telescope will be instrumental for characterizing the physical properties of galaxies and understanding their evolution across time. However, a complete view of galaxy star formation activity will only be possible with the addition of far-infrared observations that a telescope such as PRobe far-Infrared Mission for Astrophysics (PRIMA) will be able to provide. Indeed, PRIMA's far-infrared camera will be highly sensitive to dust emission, whereas Roman will probe the stellar emission in rest-frame optical and ultraviolet of distant galaxies. Our aim here is to evaluate the advantage of combining large PRIMA and Roman extragalactic surveys to retrieve the physical properties of galaxies and compare them with what we would obtain using either dataset separately. To do so, we use the Code Investigating Galaxy Emission photometric modeling code to generate a far-ultraviolet to a far-infrared synthetic set of dusty star-forming galaxies at redshifts from 1.5 to 2.5, simulating the observations from the main extragalactic surveys of PRIMA and Roman. We find that the PRIMA + Roman observations can reliably retrieve the star formation rate, stellar masses, and dust luminosity.</description>

      <title>The PRIMA promise of deciphering interstellar dust evolution with observations of the nearby Universe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper develops a few science cases, using the PRIMA far-IR probe, aimed at achieving several breakthroughs in our understanding of the dust properties and their evolution. We argue that the specific observational capabilities of PRIMA, namely its unprecedented sensitivity over the whole far-IR range and the possibility to obtain continuous spectra between wavelengths 24 and 235 microns, are essential to progress in our understanding of the physics of the interstellar medium and galaxy evolution. Our science cases revolve around observations of nearby galaxies. We discuss the importance of detecting the IR emission of the diffuse interstellar medium of these galaxies, including very low-metallicity systems. We also discuss the opportunity of detecting various solid-state features to understand the mineralogy of interstellar grains. Finally, we stress the unique opportunity brought by the possible simultaneous measures of both the dust continuum and the far-IR fine-structure gas lines. These science cases could be distributed in a few large programs.</description>

      <title>PRIMA: PRIMAger, a far-infrared hyperspectral and polarimetric instrument</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The PRobe far-Infrared Mission for Astrophysics (PRIMA) is an infrared observatory for the next decade, currently in Phase A, with a 1.8m telescope actively cooled to 4.5K. On board, an infrared camera, PRIMAger, equipped with ultra-sensitive kinetic inductance detector (KID) arrays, will provide observers with coverage of mid-infrared to far-infrared wavelengths from 24 to 264 microns. PRIMAger will offer two imaging modes: the Hyperspectral mode will cover the 24-84 microns wavelength range with a spectral resolution R=8, while the Polarimetric mode will provide polarimetric imaging in 4 broad bands, from 80 to 264 microns. These observational capabilities have been tailored to answer fundamental astrophysical questions such as black hole and star-formation co-evolution in galaxies, the evolution of small dust grains over a wide range of redshifts, and the effects of interstellar magnetic fields in various environments, as well as to open a vast discovery space with versatile photometric and polarimetric capabilities. PRIMAger is being developed by an international collaboration bringing together French institutes (Laboratoire d'Astrophysique de Marseille and CEA) through the center National d'Etudes Spatiales (CNES, France), the Netherlands Institute for Space Research (SRON, Netherlands), and the Cardiff University (UK) in Europe, as well as the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) and Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) in the USA.</description>

      <title>Alignment of spiral and elliptical galaxies from Siena Galaxy Atlas with filaments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02062v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The properties of galaxies are known to have been influenced by the large-scale structures that they inhabit. Theory suggests that galaxies acquire angular momentum during the linear stage of structure formation, and hence predict alignments between the spin of halos and the nearby structures of the cosmic web. In this study, we use the largest catalog of galaxies publicly available - the Siena Galaxy Atlas - to study the alignment of the spin normals of elliptical and spiral galaxies with filaments constructed by applying the Bisous process on galaxies ($z \le$ 0.2) from SDSS - DR12. Our sample comprises 32517 disk and 18955 elliptical galaxies that are within 2 Mpc of any filament spine. We find that the spin normals of elliptical galaxies exhibit a strong perpendicular alignment with respect to the orientation of the host filaments, inconsistent with random distributions by up to $\approx$ 13 $\sigma$. The spin axis of spiral galaxies shows a much weaker but nonzero alignment signal with their host filaments of $ \approx$ 2.8$\sigma$ when compared with random. These numbers depend on exactly how the significance is measured, as elucidated in the text. Furthermore, the significance of the alignment signal is examined as a function of distance from the filament spine. Spiral galaxies reach a maximum signal between 0.5 and 1 Mpc. elliptical galaxies reach their maximum significance between 0.2 and 0.5 Mpc. We also note that with a tailored selection of galaxies, as a function of both i) distance from the filaments \&amp; as a ii) function of absolute luminosity, the alignment significance can be maximized.</description>

      <title>Measuring metal sulfides in interstellar dust with PRIMA</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sulfur is known to undergo severe depletion when moving from diffuse clouds to the denser regimes of the interstellar medium in molecular clouds. The form in which sulfur gets depleted onto dust grains, however, remains a mystery. One possibility is that sulfur gets locked in interstellar dust in the form of sulfide minerals. Recently, metal sulfides such as NaS and MgS have been detected in a shocked molecular cloud in the Galactic Center, suggesting that these molecules could represent an important reservoir of sulfur in dust grains. In this contribution, we discuss the prospect of observing metal sulfides such as MgS and FeS in absorption experiments carried out with the FIRESS instrument onboard PRIMA using its low resolution observing mode. Our estimates show that the molecular bands of MgS and FeS found between 20 and 50 ${\mu}$m could be detected in absorption with S/N ${\geq}$ 5 for sources brighter than 200 mJy in just 1 h of observing time against low-mass protostellar objects. This science case, therefore, has the potential to unveil the main reservoir of sulfur in interstellar dust, constraining in what form sulfur is incorporated into minor bodies of our solar system.</description>

These will survey large areas of the sky for transient mm sources as a byproduct of their observations, producing regular mm-transient alerts. The results from current experiments show they can detect a wide variety of mm transients ranging from Galactic stars to extragalactic sources associated with AGNs and other energetic phenomena, and moving Solar System objects such as asteroids. These results, and theoretical predictions, indicate that future mm/submm facilities will detect many kinds of transient, including flaring stars, protostars, GRBs, TDEs, neutron star mergers, FBOTs, and SNe. New classes of mm-variable may be uncovered by CMB experiments, and transient searches at other wavelengths, such as the optical LSST survey, will produce additional targets to followup with PRIMA. Predicted rates for extragalactic mm transients to be detected by CMB experiments range from 10s to 1000s of events over the lifetime of these projects. CMB-S4 is most relevant for PRIMA, producing $\sim$100 extragalactic transients per year. Galactic transients and variable sources will also be detected, but the most common Galactic transients, flaring stars, operate on such short timescales that direct follow-up with PRIMA will not be feasible. Variable accretion rates in forming protostars, conversely, produce long term brightness variations that will be ideal monitoring targets. The addition of mid- and far-IR data points for all these sources can determine much about their radiation mechanisms and underlying physics. PRIMA followup of representative examples of various mm-transient and variable sources will thus have a powerful impact on our understanding of a wide range of astrophysical phenomena.</description>

      <title>Eccentricity distribution of extreme mass ratio inspirals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02394v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present realistic eccentricity distributions for extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs) forming via the two-body relaxation channel in nuclear star clusters, tracking their evolution up to the final plunge onto the central Schwarzschild massive black hole (MBH). We find that EMRIs can retain significant eccentricities at plunge, with a distribution peaking at $e_\mathrm{pl} \approx0.2$, and a considerable fraction reaching much higher values. In particular, up to $20\%$ of the forming EMRIs feature $e_\mathrm{pl} &gt; 0.5$ for central MBH masses $M_\bullet$ in the range $10^5 \mathrm{M_\odot} \leq M_\bullet \leq 10^6 \mathrm{M_\odot}$, partially due to EMRIs forming at large semi-major axes and "cliffhanger EMRI", usually neglected in literature. This highlights the importance of accounting for eccentricity in waveform modeling and detection strategies for future space-based gravitational wave observatories such as the upcoming Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). Furthermore, we find that the numerical fluxes in energy and angular momentum currently implemented in the FastEMRIWaveforms (FEW) package may not adequately sample the full parameter space relevant to low-mass MBHs ($M_\bullet &lt; 10^6 \mathrm{M_\odot}$), potentially limiting its predictive power in that regime. Specifically, for $M_\bullet=10^5 \mathrm{M_\odot}$ we find that about $75\%$ ($50 \%$) of EMRIs at 2 years (6 months) from plunge fall outside the currently available flux parameter space. Our findings motivate the development of extended flux grids and improved interpolation schemes to enable accurate modeling of EMRIs across a broader range of system parameters.</description>

      <title>Disentangling Target Lines from Interlopers and Continuum with Neural Networks: A SPHEREx Intensity Mapping Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02414v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Line-intensity mapping (LIM) traces the large-scale distribution of matter by measuring fluctuations in aggregate line emission from unresolved galaxies and the intergalactic medium, providing a powerful probe of both astrophysics and cosmology. However, interpreting LIM data is limited by our ability to disentangle the signal of a target spectral line from continuum emission and interloper lines, which are emissions from other redshifts that fall within the observed frequency band. Astrophysical modeling uncertainties further complicate matters, leaving the relative amplitudes of the map components poorly understood. In this paper, we present a neural-network (NN) approach to separate the three map components at the level of the angular power spectrum, explicitly accounting for uncertainties in their relative amplitudes. As test cases, we generate SPHEREx-like maps with variable interloper line luminosities across multiple frequency channels, with and without pixel-wise scatter and continuum contributions. We find that cross-channel correlations are essential for robust NN performance when scatter is present. The NN exhibits a hierarchy in residual errors: brighter components yield smaller residuals, and the dimmest the highest. Without continuum emission, the network recovers the target power spectrum to within $2.5\%$, while partially correcting the interloper spectra. With continuum included, the NN accurately reconstructs the power spectra of the continuum and target line, within $2\%$ and $6\%$, respectively, but fails to recover those of the interlopers. Reducing pixel-level scatter further improves performance, lowering residual errors to $1\%$ (continuum) and $3\%$ (target line).</description>

      <title>Can an Anti-de Sitter Vacuum in the Dark Energy Sector Explain JWST High-Redshift Galaxy and Reionization Observations?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02431v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope's (JWST) discovery of an unexpectedly high abundance of UV-bright galaxies at redshifts $z &gt; 10$ poses a significant challenge to the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. This work tests whether this tension can be resolved solely by modifying the cosmological background, without invoking significant evolution in the astrophysical properties of early galaxies. We investigate an alternative framework featuring the presence of an anti-de Sitter vacuum in the dark energy sector, a model that naturally arises in quantum gravity models like string theory and can enhance early structure formation. Using a self-consistent semi-analytical model that couples galaxy evolution with reionization, we confront this scenario with a wide range of observations. We first show that while a model tailored to fit the high-$z$ UV luminosity functions (UVLFs) shows promise, it is in strong tension with well-established cosmological constraints from the CMB and other low-redshift probes. Conversely, models within this framework that are consistent with these constraints provide only a modest boost to structure formation and fail to reproduce the observed JWST galaxy abundances at $z &gt; 10$. While these models remain consistent with the cosmic reionization history, our primary result is that this class of cosmological modifications is insufficient on its own to explain the galaxy excess. Our study underscores the critical importance of holistic testing for any beyond-$\Lambda$CDM proposal; apparent success in one observational regime does not guarantee overall viability. By demonstrating the limitations of a purely cosmological solution, our results strengthen the case that evolving astrophysical properties are a necessary ingredient for solving the challenge of early galaxy formation.</description>

      <title>Exploring giant barium stars: $^{12}\rm{C}/^{13}\rm{C}$ ratio and elemental abundances of carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Barium (Ba) stars belong to binary systems that underwent mass transfer events. As a consequence, their envelopes were enriched with material synthesized in the interiors of their evolved companions via \textit{slow} neutron-capture nucleosynthesis, the $s$-process. As post-interacting binaries, Ba stars figure as powerful tracers of the $s$-process. In this study, we conduct a classical local thermodynamic equilibrium analysis for a sample of 180 Ba giant stars to find complementary insights for the $s$-process, in form of elemental abundances of carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen, as well as the $^{12}\rm{C}/^{13}\rm{C}$ ratio. We found carbon abundances systematically larger than those observed in normal giants, with [C/Fe] ratios ranging within from $-0.30$ to $+0.60$~dex. As expected, the [C/Fe] ratios increase for lower metallicity regimes and are strongly correlated with the average $s$-process abundances. Nitrogen abundances have a flat behavior around $\rm{[N/Fe]}\sim+0.50$~dex and are moderately correlated with sodium abundances. Except for HD~107541, the entire sample shows $\rm{C/O}&lt;1$. We found $^{12}\rm{C}/^{13}\rm{C}&lt;20$ for $\sim80\%$ of the sampled stars and $^{12}\rm{C}/^{13}\rm{C}&gt;60$ for three objects.</description>

      <title>The Far-Infrared Enhanced Survey Spectrometer (FIRESS) for PRIMA: Approach and Estimated Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02518v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the architectural concept for the Far-Infrared Enhanced Survey Spectrometer (FIRESS) for the Probe Mission for far-IR Astrophysics (PRIMA). FIRESS spans the 24--235 micron range with four R ~ 100 slit-fed grating modules, each coupling to a 24 (spatial) by 84 (spectral) pixel array of kinetic inductance detectors (KIDs). All four arrays are read out simultaneously, and a point source of interest can be coupled to two of the four bands at a time. A Fourier transform module can be engaged over a portion of the FIRESS slits to create a high-resolution mode in which the light is intercepted, processed by the interferometer then reinserted into the path to the grating modules for detection. We provide a simulation and description of the technique that will be used to obtain high-resolution spectra. We identify the most important system requirements imposed by the detector system, finding that they are met with the existing design. Finally, we present our performance modeling, including both direct estimates given our current design status, as well as durable guidelines for developing general-observer programs.</description>

      <title>On the origin of V-shaped polarisation spectra in molecular clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.17211v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend previous theoretical works to gain a better understanding of the origin of observed polarisation degree spectra of molecular clouds, which show a so-called V-shape, i.e. a pronounced minimum around 350~$\mu$m. For this purpose, we present results of two-phase dust models investigated with POLARIS. We also provide a guideline to calculate individual dust temperatures for different grain types in POLARIS. We show that V-shaped polarisation spectra can only be obtained if two dust phases, one dense and cold as well as one warm and dilute phase, are present along the line of sight. We find that the V-shape is the stronger pronounced the larger the density and temperature contrast between both phases is. In contrast to previous results, no correlation between the alignment efficiency of silicate grains and the dust temperature is required; carbonaceous grains are in general assumed to be not aligned with the magnetic field. By matching our model results with actual observations of V-shaped polarisation spectra, we show that in UV-illuminated regions (here the warm and dilute phase) carbon grain destruction might take place. This leads to a more pronounced V-shape with a minimum around 300~$\mu$m. In addition, we show that the dust spectral index and temperature of silicate grains affects the steepness of the polarisation spectrum at long wavelengths. Finally, we present a first polarisation spectrum obtained from a 3D, magneto-hydrodynamical molecular cloud simulation. It shows a flattening or even weakly pronounced minimum around 350~$\mu$m demonstrating the potential of such complex 3D simulations to study polarisation spectra.</description>

      <title>The accreted stellar haloes of Milky Way-mass galaxies as a probe of the nature of the dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05899v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Galactic stellar haloes are largely composed of the remnants of galaxies accreted during the assembly of their host galaxies, and hence their properties reflect the mass spectrum and post-accretion evolution of their satellites. As the nature of dark matter (DM) can affect both, we explore how the properties of the accreted stellar component vary across cold (CDM), warm (WDM) and self-interacting (SIDM) models. We do this by studying accreted stellar populations around eight MW-mass haloes using cosmological hydrodynamical simulations based on the EAGLE galaxy formation model, in which we find that the accreted stellar mass remains similar across models. Contrary to WDM, which only presents minor differences relative to CDM, the distribution of accreted stars in SIDM changes significantly within $0.05R_{200}$ ($10\,\mathrm{kpc}$). The central density reduces to $\langle \rho^{\mathrm{SIDM}}_{\mathrm{exsitu}} / \rho^{\mathrm{CDM}}_{\mathrm{exsitu}} \rangle = 0.3$ and has a shallower radial dependence, with logarithmic density slopes of $\langle \alpha_{\mathrm{SIDM}} \rangle = -1.4$ vs $\langle \alpha_{\mathrm{CDM}} \rangle = -1.7$. Additionally, stars are on more tangential orbits than their CDM counterparts, with a change in the velocity anisotropy of $\langle \Delta \beta \rangle = - 0.2$. Finally, SIDM stellar haloes have the largest number and prominence of overdensities in radius vs radial velocity space. This is due to a combination of shorter stellar halo progenitor merging timescales and shallower host potentials, with the former resulting in less time for dynamical friction and radialisation to operate. In summary, we show that the phase-space structure of galactic stellar haloes encode key information that can be used to distinguish and rule out different DM models.</description>

      <title>1000-10,000 M$_\odot$ Primordial Stars Created the Nitrogen Excess in GS 3073 at $z = 5.55$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04435v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The advent of the James Webb Space Telescope has revealed a wealth of new galaxies just a few hundred Myr after the Big Bang. Some of these galaxies exhibit unusual N/O ratios that are difficult to explain with stellar populations today. While Wolf-Rayet stars in multiple-burst populations, very massive or rapidly-rotating primordial stars, general relativistic explosions of metal-enriched supermassive stars, or the precursors of globular clusters can in principle account for the nitrogen excess in the galaxies GN-z11 and CEERS 1019, no known stars or supernovae can explain the far higher N/O ratio of 0.46 in GS 3073 at redshift $z =$ 5.55. Here we show that the extreme nitrogen abundances in GS 3073 can be produced by 1000 - 10,000 M$_{\odot}$ primordial (Pop III) stars. We find that these are the only candidates that can account for its large N/O ratios and its C/O and Ne/O ratios. GS 3073 is thus the first conclusive evidence in the fossil abundance record of the existence of supermassive Pop III stars at cosmic Dawn.</description>

      <title>Optical+NIR analysis of a Newly Confirmed Einstein ring at z$\sim$1 from the Kilo-Degree Survey: Dark matter fraction, total and dark matter density slope and IMF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10180v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the spectroscopic confirmation of a bright blue Einstein ring in the Kilo Degree Survey (KiDS) footprint: the Einstein ``blue eye''. Spectroscopic data from X-Shooter at the Very Large Telescope (VLT) show that the lens is a typical early-type galaxy (ETG) at $z_l=0.9906$, while the background source is a Ly$\alpha$ emitter at $z_s=2.823$. The reference lens modeling was performed on a high-resolution $Y-$band adaptive-optics image from HAWK-I at VLT. Assuming a singular isothermal ellipsoid (SIE) total mass density profile, we inferred an Einstein radius $R_{Ein}=10.47 \pm 0.06$ kpc. The average slope of the total mass density inside the Einstein radius, as determined by a joint analysis of lensing and isotropic Jeans equations is $\gamma_{tot}=2.14^{+0.06}_{-0.07}$, showing no systematic deviation from the slopes of lower redshift galaxies, This can be the evidence of ETGs developing through dry mergers plus moderate dissipationless accretion. Stellar population analysis with 8-band ($gri$ZYJHK$s$) photometries from KiDS and VIKING shows that the total stellar mass of the lens is $M*=(3.95\pm 0.35)\times 10^{11} M_\odot$ (Salpeter Initial Mass Function, IMF), implying a dark matter fraction inside the effective radius to be $f_{\rm DM}=0.307\pm 0.151$. We finally explored the dark matter halo slope and found a strong degeneracy with the dynamic stellar mass. Dark matter adiabatic contraction is needed to explain the posterior distribution of the slope unless IMF heavier than Salpeter is assumed.</description>

      <title>The Complex Magnetic Field of the Extreme Galactic Center: PRIMA Science Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11344v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) of the Galactic Center (GC) region of the Milky Way contains a substantial fraction of the molecular mass of the Galaxy &gt;10e7 solar masses yet exhibits an order of magnitude lower star formation efficiency (SFE) than expected given the high densities found in this region. There are multiple possible explanations for the depressed SFE in the CMZ, like feedback, strong turbulence, longer free-fall timescales, and high magnetic field strengths. It is currently unclear which of these mechanisms is the dominant inhibitor of star formation in the CMZ. It is important to understand the star formation process in the extreme environment of the CMZ because it is the only Galactic nuclear region we are able to study at high spatial resolutions with current observatories. One way to determine the relative importance of the different SFE inhibiting mechanisms is through multi-spatial and multi-frequency polarimetric observations of the CMZ. Such observations will provide insight into the behavior of the magnetic field in this unique environment. These observations will complement radio observations of non-thermal structures revealing the magnetic field morphology and polarization. The PRobe far--Infrared Mission for Astrophysics (PRIMA) will be uniquely capable of contributing to such explorations by providing unique resolutions and frequencies for polarimetric observations. The PRIMAger instrument will yield polarimetric observations covering the wavelength range 80 -- 261 um with beam sizes ranging from 11 -- 28'', capabilities that complement existing and upcoming observatories.</description>

      <title>Euclid Quick Data Release (Q1). Exploring galaxy morphology across cosmic time through Sersic fits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15309v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the results of the single-component S\'ersic profile fitting for the magnitude-limited sample of \IE$&lt;23$ galaxies within the 63.1 deg$^2$ area of the Euclid Quick Data Release (Q1). The associated morphological catalogue includes two sets of structural parameters fitted using \texttt{SourceXtractor++}: one for VIS \IE images and one for a combination of three NISP images in \YE, \JE and \HE bands. We compare the resulting S\'ersic parameters to other morphological measurements provided in the Q1 data release, and to the equivalent parameters based on higher-resolution \HST imaging. These comparisons confirm the consistency and the reliability of the fits to Q1 data. Our analysis of colour gradients shows that NISP profiles have systematically smaller effective radii ($R_{\rm e}$) and larger S\'ersic indices ($n$) than in VIS. In addition, we highlight trends in NISP-to-VIS parameter ratios with both magnitude and $n_{\rm VIS}$. From the 2D bimodality of the $(u-r)$ colour-$\log(n)$ plane, we define a $(u-r)_{\rm lim}(n)$ that separates early- and late-type galaxies (ETGs and LTGs). We use the two subpopulations to examine the variations of $n$ across well-known scaling relations at $z&lt;1$. ETGs display a steeper size--stellar mass relation than LTGs, indicating a difference in the main drivers of their mass assembly. Similarly, LTGs and ETGs occupy different parts of the stellar mass--star-formation rate plane, with ETGs at higher masses than LTGs, and further down below the Main Sequence of star-forming galaxies. This clear separation highlights the link known between the shutdown of star formation and morphological transformations in the Euclid imaging data set. In conclusion, our analysis demonstrates both the robustness of the S\'ersic fits available in the Q1 morphological catalogue and the wealth of information they provide for studies of galaxy evolution with Euclid.</description>

      <title>The Lyman-alpha and Continuum Origins Survey. I. Survey description and Ly$\alpha$ imaging</title>

Abstract: Understanding the mechanisms driving the escape of ionizing or Lyman continuum (LyC) emission from the interstellar medium of galaxies is necessary to constrain the evolution of reionization, and the sources responsible for it. While progress has been made into identifying the global galaxy properties linked to the escape fraction of ionizing radiation, $f_{esc}^{LyC}$, little is currently known about how spatially resolved galaxy properties impact this parameter. We present Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging data obtained as part of the Lyman $\alpha$ and Continuum Origins Survey (LaCOS). LaCOS consists of HST imaging in 5 filters covering rest-frame optical and UV bands for a subsample of 42 galaxies in the Low redshift Lyman Continuum Survey, 22 being Lyman continuum emitters ($f_{esc}^{LyC}=0.01-0.49$). Here, we describe the sample, observations and data reduction, and investigate connections between global and sub-kpc Lyman $\alpha$ (Ly$\alpha$) emission, and $f_{esc}^{LyC}$. We confirm the correlation between $f_{esc}^{LyC}$ and EW$_{Ly\alpha}$ , and the anticorrelation with $r_{50}$, when using values obtained via global photometry. We also find correlations previously found with spectroscopy with global photometric $L_{Ly\alpha}$, $f_{esc}^{Ly\alpha}$, $\Sigma_{SFR}$ , and $f_{esc}^{LyC}$, but with a smaller degree of correlation ($\overline{|\Delta\tau|}\sim0.1$). We find correlations are strongest between $Ly\alpha$ observables ($L_{\rm Ly\alpha}$, EW$_{\rm Ly\alpha}$) and $f_{\rm esc}^{\rm LyC}$ when measured in a small aperture around the brightest UV source in each galaxy. We interpret these results as evidence that LyC photons escaping on the line-of-sight are contributed by a small number of UV-bright compact regions in most galaxies in LaCOS.</description>

      <title>Premature supermassive black hole mergers in cosmological simulations of structure formation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17549v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The co-evolution of massive black holes (BHs) and their host galaxies is well-established within the hierarchical galaxy formation paradigm. Large-scale cosmological simulations are an ideal tool to study the repeated BH mergers, accretion and feedback that conspire to regulate this process. While such simulations are of fundamental importance for understanding the complex and intertwined relationship between BHs and their hosts, they are plagued with numerical inaccuracies at the scale of individual BH orbits. To quantify this issue, taking advantage of the $(100 \, h^{-1}\,\text{cMpc})^3$ FABLE simulation box, we track all individual BH mergers and the corresponding host galaxy mergers as a function of cosmic time. We demonstrate that BH mergers frequently occur prematurely, well before the corresponding merger of the host galaxies is complete, and that BHs are sometimes erroneously displaced from their hosts during close galaxy encounters. Correcting for these artefacts results in substantial macrophysical delays, spanning over several Gyrs, which are additional to any microphysical delays arising from unresolved BH binary hardening processes. We find that once the macrophysical delays are accounted for, high-mass BH merger events are suppressed, affecting the predictions for the BH population that may be observable with LISA and pulsar timing arrays. Furthermore, including these macrophysical delays leads to an increase in the number of observable dual active galactic nuclei, especially at lower redshifts, with respect to FABLE. Our results highlight the pressing need for more accurate modelling of BH dynamics in cosmological simulations of galaxy formation as we prepare for the multi-messenger era.</description>

      <title>Mapping Nearby Galaxies with Apache Point Observatory: Group and field galaxies' morphologies in the colour-magnitude plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01776v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study involves the use of integral field spectroscopy (IFS) data from Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory (MaNGA) to investigate whether the morphology influences the environmental dependence of galaxies' colours and the colour-magnitude planes. The galaxies are classified into six morphologies (Elliptical, Lenticular, Early-type, Intermediate-type, Late-type spirals and Irregular) and further in field and group environments. The distributions of colours ($B-V, B-R, u-g, g-r, r-i$ and $i-z$) are compared between field and group environments and then the colour-magnitude planes are analysed. It is observed that Intermediate and Late-types spirals preferentially exist in field environments while Early-type spirals exist in groups. The colours and colour-magnitude planes of Elliptical, Lenticular, Early-type and Intermediate-type spirals depend on the environment while for the Late-type and Irregular galaxies, their dependence on the environment is very weak. The study concludes that the dependence of colours and colour-magnitude planes on the environment is influenced by morphology.</description>

      <title>Insights into the dependence of galaxy properties on the environment with explainable machine learning models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06815v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Galaxies reside within dark matter halos, but their properties are influenced not only by their halo properties but also by the surrounding environment. We construct an interpretable neural network framework to characterize the surrounding environment of galaxies and investigate the extent to which their properties are affected by neighboring galaxies in IllustrisTNG300 data ($z=0$). Our models predict galaxy properties (stellar mass and star formation rate) given dark matter subhalo properties of both host subhalo and of surrounding galaxies, which serve as an explainable, flexible galaxy-halo connection model. We find that prediction accuracy peaks when incorporating only the nearest neighboring galaxy for stellar mass prediction, while star formation rate prediction benefits from information from up to the third-nearest neighbor. We determine that environmental influence follows a clear hierarchical pattern, with the nearest neighbor providing the dominant contribution that diminishes rapidly with additional neighbors. We confirm that central and satellite galaxies, as well as different galaxy categories based on mass and star-forming activity, exhibit distinct environmental dependencies. Environmental dependence for low-mass galaxies ($\log(M_*/M_\odot) &lt; 10$) shows 35-50% environmental contribution compared to just 8-30% for massive centrals, while satellite galaxies experience consistently stronger environmental effects than centrals across all populations. Furthermore, we find that the most significant attribute from neighboring subhalos for predicting target galaxy properties is its distance to the nearest neighboring galaxy. These quantitative results offer guidance for constructing more sophisticated empirical and semi-analytic models of galaxy formation that explicitly include environmental dependence as a function of galaxy type and mass.</description>

      <title>Probing Self-Interacting Dark Matter via Gravitational-Wave Background from Eccentric Supermassive Black Hole Mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09219v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The nature of dark matter is still mysterious despite various astronomical evidence. As a possible candidate, self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) can potentially resolve some issues appearing in cold dark matter paradigm. Here we investigate how SIDM around supermassive black holes (SMBH) in galaxy centers may form a density spike and imprint in the spectrum shape of stochastic gravitational-wave background from SMBH binaries (SMBHBs). Employing a refined dynamical friction formula and consistently evolving the orbital dynamics, we demonstrate that current pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) data is sensitive to the cross section of SIDM with $\sigma(v)/m_\chi\lesssim0.66\,\mathrm{cm}^2/\mathrm{g}$, comparable to other astrophysical probes. We also highlight the importance of including the eccentricity of SMBHBs in the parameter inference, which would affect the results significantly. Our findings reveal the promising potential of PTAs observations in probing the nature of dark matter.</description>

      <title>The HST Legacy Archival Uniform Reduction of Local Group Imaging (LAURELIN). I. Photometry and Star Formation Histories for 36 Ultra-faint Dwarf Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18252v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present uniformly measured resolved stellar photometry and star formation histories (SFHs) for 36 nearby ($\lesssim$ 400 kpc) ultra-faint dwarf galaxies (UFDs; $-7.1 \le M_V \le +0.0$) from new and archival HST imaging. We measure homogeneous distances to all systems via isochrone fitting and find good agreement ($\le$ 2%) for the 18 UFDs that have literature RR Lyrae distances. From the ensemble of SFHs, we find: (i) an average quenching time (here defined as the lookback time by which 80% of the stellar mass formed, $\tau_{80}$) of 12.48 $\pm$ 0.18 Gyr ago ($z = 4.6_{-0.5}^{+0.6}$), which is compatible with reionization-based quenching scenarios; and (ii) modest evidence of a delay ($\lesssim$ 800 Myr) in quenching times of UFDs thought to be satellites of the LMC or on their first infall, relative to long-term Galactic satellites, which is consistent with previous findings. We show that robust SFH measurement via the ancient main sequence turnoff (MSTO) requires a minimum effective luminosity (i.e., luminosity within the observed field of view) of $M_V \leq -2.5$, which corresponds to $\sim$100 stars around the MSTO. We also find that increasing the S/N above $\sim$100 at the MSTO does not improve SFH precision, which remains dominated by stochastic effects associated with the number of available stars. A main challenge driving the precision of UFD SFHs is limitations in the accuracy of foreground dust maps. We make all photometry catalogs public as the first data release of a larger HST archival program targeting all dwarf galaxies within $\sim$1.3 Mpc.</description>

      <title>H${\beta}$ line shape and radius-luminosity relation in 2.5D FRADO</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01159v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Galaxies with active galactic nuclei (AGN) exhibit broad emission lines as a key spectral feature. The shape of emission-line profiles depends on the complex dynamics of discrete clouds within a spatially extended region known as the Broad Line Region (BLR). The distribution of cloud positions within BLR, or the geometry of BLR indeed, is directly linked to measurements of time lags of BLR. In this paper, we convolve a large grid of physically-based simulations of cloud distributions in BLR with photon-flux weighted emissivity of BLR clouds to investigate the generic shape of spectral line profiles. More importantly, we extract the time-delay histograms of corresponding models to calculate the size of BLR. Our physical model is based on the assumption that the clouds are launched by the radiation pressure acting on dust in the atmosphere of the outer disk. It has very few global parameters. The model is appropriate for the low ionization part of the BLR, as it was shown by earlier model tests. It uses a non-hydrodynamical single-cloud approach to the BLR dynamics. In this way we simulate the distribution of positions and velocities of the clouds. We found that the width of line profiles gets broader with black hole mass, or with viewing angle, and gets narrower with accretion rate. The blue wing of the emission line profiles becomes more pronounced with increasing black hole mass and accretion rate, consistent with the formation and intensification of an outflow structure. We also found that the peak time-delays rather than averaged delay values better represents the observational trend and also the scatter in the radius-luminosity relation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03888v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Relativistic jets from AGN are an important driver of feedback in galaxies. They interact with their environments over a wide range of physical scales during their lifetime, and an understanding of these interactions is crucial for unraveling the role of supermassive blackholes in shaping galaxy evolution. The impact of such jets have been traditionally considered in the context of heating the large-scale environments. However, in the last few decades there has been additional focus on the immediate impact of jet feedback on the host galaxy itself. In this review we outline the development of various numerical simulations since the onset of studies of jets to the present day, where sophisticated numerical techniques have been employed to study jet feedback including a range of physical processes. The jets can act as an important agent of injecting energy in the host's ISM, as confirmed both in observations of multi-phase gas, as well as in simulations. Such interactions have the potential to impact the kinematics of the gas as well as its star formation. We summarize the recent results from simulations of jet feedback on kpc scales, and outline the broader implications for observations and galaxy evolution.</description>

      <title>KRIOS: A new basis-expansion $N$-body code for collisional stellar dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13636v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The gravitational $N$-body problem is a nearly universal problem in astrophysics which, despite its deceptive simplicity, still presents a significant computational challenge. For collisional systems such as dense star clusters, the need to resolve individual encounters between $N$ stars makes the direct summation of forces - with quadratic complexity - almost infeasible for systems with $N\gtrsim 10^6$ particles over many relaxation times. At the same time, the most common Monte Carlo $N$-body algorithm - that of H\'enon - assumes the cluster to be spherically symmetric. This greatly limits the study of many important features of star clusters, including triaxiality, rotation, and the production of tidal debris. In this paper, we present a new hybrid code, KRIOS, that combines 3D collisionless relaxation using an adaptive self-consistent field method with collisional dynamics handled via H\'enon's method. We demonstrate that KRIOS can accurately model the long-term evolution of clusters and provide its complete phase-space information over many relaxation times. As a test of our new code, we present detailed comparisons to well-known results from stellar dynamics: (i) the collisional evolution of a family of Plummer spheres with varying anisotropy and rotation to core collapse, and (ii) the emergence of the radial-orbit instability in radially anisotropic star clusters, including its non-spherical effects.</description>

      <title>COS-EDGES: Co-rotation and Kinematic Stratification of the Multi-Phase CGM Around Edge-On Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11613v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first results from the COS-EDGES survey, targeting the kinematic connection between the ISM and multi-phase circumgalactic medium (CGM) in nine isolated, edge-on galaxies at z~0.2, each probed along its major axis by a background quasar at impact parameters of 13-38kpc. Using VLT/UVES and HST/COS quasar spectra, we analyse MgI, MgII, HI, CII, CIII, and OVI absorption relative to galaxy rotation curves from Keck/LRIS and Magellan/MagE spectra. We find that at lower $D/R_{vir}$ ($D/R_{vir}\leq 0.2$), over 80% of absorption in all ions lies on the side of systemic velocity matching disk rotation, and the optical-depth-weighted median velocity ($v_{abs}$) is consistent with the peak rotation speed. At higher $D/R_{vir}$ ($D/R_{vir} &gt; 0.2$), the kinematics diverge by ionisation state: For low ionisation gas, the amount of co-rotating absorption remains &gt;80%, yet $v_{abs}$ drops to 60% of the galaxy rotation speed. For high ionisation gas (OVI), only 60% of the absorption is consistent with co-rotation and $v_{abs}$ drops to 20% of the rotation speed. Furthermore, the velocity widths, corresponding to 50% of the total optical depth ($\Delta v_{50}$) for low ionisation gas is 1.8 times larger in the inner halo than at larger radii, while for CIII and OVI $\Delta v_{50}$ remains unchanged with distance. These results suggest a radially dependent CGM kinematic structure: the inner halo hosts cool, dynamically broad gas tightly coupled to disk rotation, whereas beyond 0.2$R_{vir}$, particularly traced by OVI and HI, the CGM shows weaker rotational alignment and lower velocity dispersion. Therefore, low-ionisation gas likely traces extended co-rotating gas, inflows and/or recycled accretion, while high-ionisation gas reflects a mixture of co-rotating, lagging, discrete collisionally ionised structures, indicating a kinematic stratification of the multi-phase CGM.

      <title>Continuum Reverberation Mapping of Accretion Disks Surrounding Supermassive Black Hole Binaries: Observational Signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21671v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has remained challenging to reliably identify sub-parsec supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs), despite them being expected to be ubiquitous. We propose a new method using multi-band continuum reverberation mapping to identify low-mass-ratio SMBHBs in active galactic nuclei. The basic principle is that, due to the presence of a low-density cavity between the mini-disks and the circumbinary disk, the continuum emissions show a deficit at certain wavelengths, leading to a distinguishing feature in the relation between the inter-band time lag and wavelengths $\tau(\lambda)$. Specifically, the relation appears flat at short wavelengths because of the truncated sizes of the mini-disks and transits to a power law $\lambda^{4/3}$ at long wavelength stemming from the circumbinary disk. This transition feature is distinct from the uniform relation $\lambda^{4/3}$ of the standard accretion disk around a single black hole. Using the lamp-post scenario and assuming that only the secondary black hole is active in a low-mass-ratio SMBHB, we design a simple continuum reverberation model to calculate the transfer function of the accretion disks and the resulting $\tau(\lambda)$ relations for various SMBHB orbital parameters. The transition wavelength typically can lie at UV/optical bands, mainly depending on the total mass and orbital separation of the SMBHB. We apply our SMBHB model to the intensive multiwavelength monitoring data of the SMBHB candidate PG1302-102 and find that the SMBHB model can reproduce the inter-band time lags. Remarkably, the inferred total mass and orbital period from the SMBHB fitting are consistent with values derived from other independent methods.</description>

      <title>JADES-GS-z14-1: A Compact, Faint Galaxy at $z\approx14$ with Weak Metal Lines from Extremely Deep JWST MIRI, NIRCam, and NIRSpec Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22858v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: JWST has shed light on galaxy formation and metal enrichment within 300 Myr of the Big Bang. While luminous galaxies at $z &gt; 10$ often show significant [O III]$\lambda\lambda$4959, 5007 emission lines, it remains unclear whether such features are prevalent among fainter, more typical galaxies due to observational limits. We present deep imaging and spectroscopy of JADES-GS-z14-1 at $z_\mathrm{spec}=13.86^{+0.04}_{-0.05}$, currently the faintest spectroscopically confirmed galaxy at $z\approx 14$. It serendipitously received 70.7 hours of MIRI/F770W imaging in the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES), the deepest MIRI exposure for any high-redshift galaxy to date. Nonetheless, we detect only tentative F770W emission of $7.9\pm2.8$ nJy at $2.8\sigma$ significance, constraining the total equivalent width of [O III]$\lambda\lambda$4959, 5007 + H$\beta$ to $520^{+400}_{-380}$ A, weaker than most $z &gt; 10$ galaxies with MIRI detections. This source is unresolved across 16 NIRCam bands, implying a physical radius $\lesssim50$ pc. NIRSpec/PRISM spectroscopy totaling 56 hours reveals no rest-frame ultraviolet emission lines above $3 \sigma$. Stellar population synthesis suggests a stellar mass $\sim4\times 10^{7}$ $\mathrm{M_\odot}$ and a star formation rate $\sim 2$ $\mathrm{M_\odot yr^{-1}}$. The absence of strong metal emission lines despite intense star formation suggests a gas-phase metallicity below 10% solar and potentially a high escape fraction of ionizing photons. These deep observations provide rare constraints on faint, early galaxies, tracing the onset of chemical enrichment and ionization in the early Universe.</description>

      <title>Notes on the formaldehyde masers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14490v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The questions of the rarity of the 4.8 GHz formaldehyde masers and the non-detection of 14.5 GHz formaldehyde masers are addressed from a theoretical point of view. The pumping free-free radiation fields were obtained using the photo-ionization code Cloudy to simulate hyper-compact HII regions. Implementation of these free-free radiation fields in solving the rate equations shows that the free-free radiation fields of some hyper-compact HII regions are ineffective to invert the 4.8 GHz transition. Investigation of the variation of the inversion of the 4.8 GHz and 14.5 GHz transitions with radial distance revealed that there are regions where only the 4.8 GHz transition is inverted. It is also shown that the projection of the masing region toward the edge of a hyper-compact may explain the non-detection of 14.5 GHz masers. The attenuation of the 4.8 GHz and 14.5 GHz masers in the molecular envelope is investigated. It is found that attenuation can be significant. Comparison of the velocities of the 4.8 GHz masers with the centre velocities of associated 4.8 GHz absorption features shows that the maser emission lies at the edge of the absorption features. This suggests that the masers may be associated with kinematic structures such as rotating toroids.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Radial Migration on Disk Galaxy SFHs: I. Biases in Spatially Resolved Estimates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18367v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Knowledge of the spatially resolved star formation history (SFH) of disk galaxies provides crucial insight into disk assembly, quenching, and chemical evolution. However, most reconstructions, both for the Milky Way and for external galaxies, implicitly assume that stars formed at their present-day radii. Using a range of zoom-in cosmological simulations, we show that stellar radial migration introduces strong and systematic biases in such SFH estimates. In the inner disk (R &lt; h_d), early star formation is typically underestimated by 25-50% and late star formation overestimated, giving the misleading impression of prolonged, moderate activity. An exception occurs in the very central bin considered (~ 0.4h_d), which is consistently overestimated due to a net inflow of inward migrators. At intermediate radii and in the outer disk, migration drives the opposite trend: intermediate-age populations are overestimated by 100-200% as stars born in the inner disk migrate outward, whereas genuinely in-situ populations are underestimated by ~ 50% as they themselves continue to migrate. The net effect is that SFH peaks are suppressed and broadened, and the true rate of inside-out disk growth is systematically underestimated. These distortions affect all galaxies in our sample and have direct implications for interpreting spatially resolved SFHs from IFU surveys such as CALIFA and MaNGA, where present-day radii are often used as proxies for stellar birth sites. Correcting these biases will require accounting for disk mass, bar presence, disk kinematics and morphology, while recent birth-radius estimation techniques for Milky Way stars offer a promising path forward.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Radial Migration on Disk Galaxy SFHs: II. The Role of bar strength, disk thickness, and merger history</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19340v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reconstructing the star formation history (SFH) of disk galaxies is central to understanding their growth and evolution, yet such estimates can be strongly biased by stellar radial migration - the redistribution of angular momenta over cosmic time. Using 186 Milky Way (MW) and Andromeda (M31) analogues from the TNG50 cosmological simulation, we compare star formation rates (SFRs) inferred from present-day stellar positions with those based on stellar birth radii to quantify the magnitude, spatial structure, and temporal evolution of migration-induced biases. We find that radial migration systematically produces artificial star formation in regions that had not yet formed stars. Notably, about 80% of galaxies exhibit outer-disk stars older than 10 Gyr, implying that these populations must have migrated from the inner disk. Similar effects appear in about 45% of galaxies at intermediate radii during early epochs, and in 30% of quenched inner disks within the past 4 Gyr. Migration also smooths SFHs, washing out localized bursts and periods of suppressed star formation by dispersing stars across neighboring radii. The strength and imprint of these distortions depend sensitively on galactic structure and evolutionary history: strong bars drive mean SFR overestimates of up to 75% in the inner disk and 150% in the outskirts; thinner, dynamically cold disks suffer average outer-disk biases up to 160%; while thick disks exhibit typical inner-disk biases up to 125%. Merger timing further modulates these patterns. Our results demonstrate that failing to account for stellar migration can lead to severe misinterpretations of when and where stars formed, with direct implications for the chemical and evolutionary histories of the MW and external galaxies.</description>

      <title>MEGA: Spectrophotometric SED Fitting of Little Red Dots Detected in JWST MIRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20177v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze eight spectroscopically confirmed Little Red Dots (LRDs) at redshifts $z = 5.1-8.7$ with JWST/NIRCam, NIRSpec, and MIRI data. The LRDs have red NIRCam colors, F150W-F444W $&gt;$ 1, but flat NIRCam-MIRI colors, $-0.5 &lt; \mathrm{F444W - F770W} &lt; 0.5$, suggesting weak warm/hot dust components. The LRDs have $-1.0 &lt; {F1000W - F1500W} &lt; 1.1$, suggestive of non-uniform rest near-IR properties within the sample. We model the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of the LRDs using the CIGALE and Prospector codes to assess how the differing templates impact the interpretation for LRDs for cases of: (1) models with star-forming stellar populations only; (2) active galactic nuclei (AGN) dominated models; and (3) composite AGN and star-forming models. Using the Bayesian information criterion, we find that six of the eight LRDs favor AGN models compared to star-forming models, though no model reproduces all of the observed properties. Two LRDs with pronounced Balmer-breaks and broad H$\alpha$ have SEDs that are reproduced with hot, dense-gas ($\log T/\mathrm{K}=5-5.7$, $\log n/\mathrm{cm^{-3}} = 9-11$) models with low dust attenuation ($A(V)\simeq 0.5$ mag). However, these models require an additional thermal component (800-1400 K) to account for the MIRI data, and fail to reproduce the rest-UV and narrow [OIII] emission. The total bolometric emission from the dense-gas models, and possibly CIGALE AGN models, appear consistent with literature constraints in the far-IR and radio, and require $\log L_{bol}/L_\odot&lt;12$. These results suggest that our LRDs cannot be modeled entirely with standard templates, but instead require a novel treatment of gas conditions, AGN and star-formation.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Radial Metallicity Gradient-Age Relation in the Milky Way's Thin and Thick Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20386v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Galactic disks typically exhibit a negative radial metallicity gradient, indicating faster enrichment in the inner regions. Recent studies report that this gradient becomes flatter with increasing stellar age in the Milky Way's (MW) thin disk, while the thick disk exhibits a mildly positive gradient across all ages. In this work, we revisit the metallicity gradient-age relation (MGAR) in both the thin and thick disks of the MW. We use spectroscopic data from LAMOST DR8 and stellar ages calibrated with asteroseismology. Our results show a steadily flattening MGAR in the thin disk and confirm a positive gradient $\sim0.013\,\mathrm{dex\,kpc^{-1}}$ in the thick disk. The flattening in the thin disk may be caused by large-scale radial migration induced by transient spiral arms, or by a time-dependent steepening of the interstellar medium (ISM) metallicity gradient as suggested by recent FIRE2 simulations. The positive gradient in the thick disk may reflect early enrichment of the outer regions by strong feedback or starburst-driven outflows in a turbulent, gas-rich proto-disk. These findings suggest distinct chemodynamical evolution paths for the MW's thin and thick disks and provide valuable constraints for future models of Galactic chemical evolution.</description>

      <title>A direct black hole mass measurement in a Little Red Dot at the Epoch of Reionization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21748v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent discoveries of faint active galactic nuclei (AGN) at the redshift frontier have revealed a plethora of broad \Halpha emitters with optically red continua, named Little Red Dots (LRDs), which comprise 15-30\% of the high redshift broad line AGN population. Due to their peculiar spectral properties and X-ray weakness, modeling LRDs with standard AGN templates has proven challenging. In particular, the validity of single-epoch virial mass estimates in determining the black hole (BH) masses of LRDs has been called into question, with some models claiming that masses might be overestimated by up to 2 orders of magnitude, and other models claiming that LRDs may be entirely stellar in nature. We report the direct, dynamical BH mass measurement in a strongly lensed LRD at $z = 7.04$. The combination of lensing with deep spectroscopic data reveals a rotation curve that is inconsistent with a nuclear star cluster, yet can be well explained by Keplerian rotation around a point mass of 50 million Solar masses, consistent with virial BH mass estimates from the Balmer lines. The Keplerian rotation leaves little room for any stellar component in a host galaxy, as we conservatively infer $M_{\rm BH}/M_{*}&gt;2$. Such a ''naked'' black hole, together with its near-pristine environment, indicates that this LRD is a massive black hole seed caught in its earliest accretion phase.</description>

Abstract: Star clusters are interesting laboratories to study star formation, single and binary stellar evolution, and stellar dynamics. We have used the exquisite data from $Gaia$'s data release 3 (DR3) to study 21 relatively rich and nearby open clusters with member numbers ($N_{\rm{cl}}$)$&gt;500$. We have developed a non-parametric method to identify cluster members. Our method works well for clusters located in both sparse and crowded environments, hence, can be applied to a wide variety of star clusters. Since the member classification scheme does not make any assumptions on the expected distributions of potential cluster members, our method can identify members associated with clusters that are oddly shaped or have complex internal spatial or kinematic structures. In addition, since the membership determination does not depend on the proximity to any well-defined sequences on the color-magnitude diagram, this method easily identifies straggler members. Furthermore, for each of these clusters, we estimate essential cluster properties including age, metallicity, distance, and reddening using detailed Markov-Chain Monte Carlo parameter estimation. We report the full posteriors for these important cluster properties for all clusters in our study.</description>

Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) are lensed by matter, offering a unique probe of both the large-scale structure of the Universe and the fundamental properties of GW propagation. GWs can also be affected by wave optics effects when their wavelength is comparable to the size of the lens. While this regime has been well studied in the Newtonian approximation, the role of strong gravitational fields remains largely unexplored. This is particularly relevant for lensing by intermediate and supermassive black holes (BHs), which can occur near active galactic nuclei or in compact triple systems. In this work, we analyze the lensing of GWs by a non-rotating BH and compare our results to the Newtonian point-mass approximation. We construct frequency-dependent amplification factors that incorporate strong-field effects, revealing explicit polarization mixing and absorption by the event horizon. Using a fiducial GW event, we explore key phenomenological signatures of BH lensing, highlighting new observational opportunities to probe strong gravitational fields through GW lensing.</description>

Abstract: We use the Illustris-TNG simulation to investigate the anisotropic distribution of subhalos in/around dark matter halo pairs. We measure the position angle ($\theta$) of each subhalo by the angle between the line connecting it to the nearest host halo and the line connecting the paired halos, and examine $P(\cos\theta)$ (the distribution of $\cos\theta$ of all subhalos) for halo pairs with various separations ($d_{\text{sep}}$), primary halo masses ($M_p$) and secondary-to-primary halo mass ratios ($M_s/M_p$). We find that $P(\cos\theta)$ generally exhibits a combined result of two distinct features: the `bulging' distribution characterized by an overabundance along the pairwise direction, and the `lopsided' distribution showing an overabundance in the region between the paired halos. The bulging signal is stronger for halo pairs with larger $d_{\text{sep}}$ and smaller $M_p$, while the lopsidedness strengthens as $M_p$ increases. Both signals depend weakly on $M_s/M_p$, and are primarily contributed by subhalos that are relatively distant from host halos. Remarkably, these measurements can be broadly reproduced by the overlap effect, provided the spatial alignment of halos is properly taken into account. Our findings suggest distinct origins: lopsidedness arises from simple halo overlap, while bulging reflects alignment with large-scale filaments. We examine the impact of projection and selection effects by conducting the same analysis in two dimensions and in a mock catalog that replicates the selection effects of the SDSS galaxy sample. We find that the 3D-to-2D projection significantly suppresses the bulging distribution, with particularly strong effects at large $d_{\text{sep}}$, small $M_p$, and large $M_s/M_p$.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning-Based Analytical Expressions for Gray-Body Factors and Application to Primordial Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18270v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Symbolic Regression (SR) is a machine learning approach that explores the space of mathematical expressions to identify those that best fit a given dataset, balancing both accuracy and simplicity. We apply SR to the study of Gray-Body Factors (GBFs), which play a crucial role in the derivation of Hawking radiation and are recognized for their computational complexity. We explore simple analytical forms for the GBFs of the Schwarzschild Black Hole (BH). We compare the results obtained with different approaches and quantify their consistency with those obtained by solving the Teukolsky equation. As a case study, we apply our pipeline, which we call \texttt{ReGrayssion}, to the study of Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) as Dark Matter (DM) candidates, deriving constraints on the abundance from observations of diffuse extragalactic $\gamma$-ray background. These results highlight the possible role of SR in providing human-interpretable, approximate analytical GBF expressions, offering a new pathway for investigating PBH as a DM candidate.</description>

      <title>The Lyman-$\alpha$ emitter bispectrum as a probe of reionization morphology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17188v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ly$\alpha$ emitters (LAEs) have now been discovered out to redshift $z=13$, and are valuable probes of the reionization history at redshifts beyond the reach of other currently available tracers. Most inferences of the neutral hydrogen fraction from LAE observations rely on one-point and two-point statistics like the luminosity function and the power spectrum. We present here an analysis of the bispectrum of high-redshift LAEs and demonstrate its sensitivity to the Epoch of Reionization. We use the Sherwood-Relics suite of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations post-processed with the GPU-based radiative transfer code ATON-HE to generate realistic LAE mock catalogues for a wide range of reionization models, varying the ionization history and the source populations, including contributions of AGN to hydrogen reionization. We demonstrate that the bispectrum provides greater sensitivity than the power spectrum to both the timing and spatial morphology of reionization. Using reduced-$\chi^2$ analysis we further show that the bispectrum also responds more strongly to variations in source population and AGN contribution, apparently more efficiently capturing morphological features missed by two-point statistics. The redshift evolution of the bispectrum reflects the increased clustering of ionizing sources at earlier epochs. The sensitivity of the bispectrum to peculiar velocities underscores the importance of velocity corrections in comparisons to observations. Our findings demonstrate that the LAE bispectrum is a powerful higher-order statistic for probing reionization through current and future LAE surveys using telescopes such as Subaru and JWST.</description>

      <title>Testing Light Unaffiliated Mass Clumps in MACS 0416 on galaxy and galaxy cluster scales using JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16034v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Light unaffiliated mass clumps (LUMCs), i.e. dark matter (DM) components without any stellar counterparts, have been reported in strong lensing mass reconstructions of MACS 0416, both on galaxy and galaxy cluster scales. On galaxy cluster scale, the most recent parametric study based on 303 multiple images features a LUMC, in the south of the cluster. On galaxy scale, the most recent GRALE non-parametric study based on 237 multiple images features two LUMCs, M1 and M2. Given the implications of these findings in the context of structure formation and evolution, we test these features parametrically, using LENSTOOL. First, we show that a mass model where each large scale DM component introduced in the modelling is associated with a stellar counterpart can reproduce the 303 multiple images, removing the need for any cluster scale LUMC in \lens. We then update the GRALE model using the 303 multiple images, finding that one of the two galaxy scale LUMC, M1, is no longer significant, while M2 remains. We test M2 by explicitely including it in our parametric model. We find that the inclusion of this LUMC does not improve the global RMS, but mildly improves locally the RMS for one multiple image located close to M2. Besides, the preferred mass for M2 corresponds to the lowest mass allowed by the adopted prior. M2 is therefore not strongly favoured by a parametric approach but it is not ruled out. We present a comparison of parametric and non-parametric models in the M2 area. Both approaches show very similar surface mass density at this location, with a 5-6 % difference between the mass maps. The difference is that GRALE favors a distinct mass substructure when LENSTOOL favors a more diffuse mass distribution. We have been able to propose a parametric mass model without including any LUMCs, providing further evidences for DM being associated with light in clusters.</description>

      <title>Search for spatial coincidences between galaxy mergers and Fermi-LAT 4FGL-DR4 sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03970v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a systematic search for spatial association between a high confidence sample of 3,166 morphologically selected galaxy mergers drawn from the initial convolutional neural network (CNN) catalog of 328,151 candidate mergers and refined through SDSS cross-matching and the Fermi Large Area Telescope Fourth Source Catalog Data Release 4 (4FGL-DR4) catalog of gamma-ray sources detected by the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT). Using a conservative 4$\sigma$ positional uncertainty threshold and a Poisson based statistical framework, we identify 21 statistically significant associations with match probabilities $p &lt; 0.05$. Among these are known classes of gamma-ray emitters such as Flat-Spectrum Radio Quasars (FSRQs), BL Lacertae objects (BLL), and radio galaxies bolstering the hypothesis that merger driven processes can fuel high energy activity. Intriguingly, five of the associated sources remain unclassified in 4FGL-DR4, hinting at a possible link between galaxy mergers and a hitherto unrecognized population of gamma-ray sources. The dominance of AGN like matches supports the scenario in which mergers trigger accretion onto central supermassive black holes, initiating AGN activity observable at gamma-ray energies. Moreover, the recurrent presence of unassociated sources among secure matches underscores the potential of merger catalogs as physically motivated priors in gamma-ray source identification efforts. This work constitutes the first dedicated effort to explore associations between gamma-ray sources and a large, morphologically selected sample of galaxy mergers catalog, opening new avenues for understanding the role of galaxy interactions in high-energy astrophysics.</description>

      <title>Attempting an accurate age estimate of the open cluster NGC 6633 using CoRoT and Gaia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19767v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Asteroseismology of solar-like oscillations in giant stars allow the derivation of their masses and radii. For members of open clusters, this provides an age of the cluster that should be identical to the one derived from the colour-magnitude diagram, but independent of the uncertainties that are present for that type of analysis. We aim to identify and measure the properties of giant members of the open cluster NGC6633, and combine these with asteroseismic measurements to derive a precise and self-consistent cluster age. Importantly, we wish to constrain the effects of rotational mixing on stellar evolution, since assumptions about internal mixing can have a significant impact on stellar age estimates. We identify five giant members of NGC6633 using photometry and Gaia data, supplemented by spectroscopic literature measurements. These are combined with asteroseismic measurements from CoRoT data and compared to stellar-model isochrones. This constrains the interior mixing to a low level and enables the most precise, accurate and self-consistent age estimate so far for this cluster. Asteroseismology of the giants and the cluster colour-magnitude diagram provide self-consistent masses of the giant members and their radii constrain the stellar interior mixing to a low level. The [C/N] ratios and Li abundances also suggest that rotation has had very little influence on the evolution of the stars in NGC 6633. This results in an age estimate of 0.55+0.05-0.10 Gyr for NGC6633. Four giant members appear to be in the helium-core burning evolutionary phase as also expected from evolutionary timescales. For the largest giant, the evidence remains inconclusive. A comparison to other age and mass estimates for the same stars in the literature uncovers biases for automated age estimates of helium-core burning stars.</description>

      <title>The fate of rotating massive stars across cosmic times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21233v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The initial mass and metallicity of stars both have a strong impact on their fate. Stellar axial rotation also has a strong impact on the structure and evolution of massive stars. In this study, we exploit the large grid of GENEC models, covering initial masses from 9 to 500 $M_{\odot}$ and metallicities ranging from $Z=10^{-5}$ (nearly zero) to 0.02 (supersolar), to determine the impact of rotation on their fate across cosmic times. Using the carbon-oxygen core mass and envelope composition as indicators of their fate, we predict stellar remnants, supernova engines, and spectroscopic supernova types for both rotating and non-rotating stars. We derive rates of the different supernova and remnant types considering two initial mass functions to help solve puzzles such as the absence of observed pair-instability supernovae. We find that rotation significantly alters the remnant type and supernova engine, with rotating stars favouring black hole formation at lower initial masses than their non-rotating counterparts. Additionally, we confirm the expected strong metallicity dependence of the fates with a maximum black hole mass predicted to be below 50 $M_{\odot}$ at SMC or higher metallicities. A pair-instability mass gap is predicted between about 90 and 150 $M_{\odot}$, with the most massive black holes below the gap found at the lowest metallicities. Considering the fate of massive single stars has far-reaching consequences across many different fields within astrophysics, and understanding the impact of rotation and metallicity will improve our understanding of how massive stars end their lives, and their impact on the universe.</description>

      <title>Hyper Suprime-Cam Y3 results: photo-$z$ bias calibration with lensing shear ratios and cosmological constraints from cosmic shear</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21681v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an independent calibration of the photometric redshift (photo-$z$) distributions for source galaxies in the HSC-Y3 weak lensing survey using small-scale galaxy-galaxy lensing. By measuring the tangential shear around spectroscopic lens galaxies from GAMA, SDSS, and DESI, divided into fifteen narrow redshift bins, we compute shear ratios that are sensitive to the mean redshift of source galaxies. Using a blinded analysis, we derive constraints on the photo-$z$ bias parameters in source bins 2, 3 and 4, achieving signal-to-noise ratios of 59, 75, and 62, respectively. Our constraints for $\Delta z_2$, $\Delta z_3$ and $\Delta z_4$ are consistent with those from HSC-Y3 cosmic shear modeling. We observe a mild shift in the $\Delta z_3$-$\Delta z_4$ plane due to the heterogeneous depth of the lens sample, which disappears when using only DESI-DR1 lenses. Combining shear-ratio measurements with cosmic shear data, we obtain joint constraints on cosmological parameters: $\Omega_{\rm m} = 0.286_{-0.074}^{+0.038}$ and $S_8 = 0.760_{-0.145}^{+0.044}$, consistent with cosmic shear-only results. This work demonstrates the utility of small-scale lensing as an independent probe for calibrating photometric redshift bias in weak lensing cosmology.</description>
