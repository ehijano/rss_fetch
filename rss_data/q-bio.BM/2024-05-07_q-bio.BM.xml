      <title>Materials Discovery with Extreme Properties via Reinforcement Learning-Guided Combinatorial Chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.11833v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The goal of most materials discovery is to discover materials that are superior to those currently known. Fundamentally, this is close to extrapolation, which is a weak point for most machine learning models that learn the probability distribution of data. Herein, we develop reinforcement learning-guided combinatorial chemistry, which is a rule-based molecular designer driven by trained policy for selecting subsequent molecular fragments to get a target molecule. Since our model has the potential to generate all possible molecular structures that can be obtained from combinations of molecular fragments, unknown molecules with superior properties can be discovered. We theoretically and empirically demonstrate that our model is more suitable for discovering better compounds than probability distribution-learning models. In an experiment aimed at discovering molecules that hit seven extreme target properties, our model discovered 1,315 of all target-hitting molecules and 7,629 of five target-hitting molecules out of 100,000 trials, whereas the probability distribution-learning models failed. Moreover, it has been confirmed that every molecule generated under the binding rules of molecular fragments is 100% chemically valid. To illustrate the performance in actual problems, we also demonstrate that our models work well on two practical applications: discovering protein docking molecules and HIV inhibitors.</description>

      <title>Emergence of multiphase condensates from a limited set of chemical building blocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.18142v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Biomolecules composed of a limited set of chemical building blocks can co-localize into distinct, spatially segregated compartments known as biomolecular condensates. While many condensates are known to form spontaneously via phase separation, it has been unclear how immiscible condensates with precisely controlled molecular compositions assemble from a small number of chemical building blocks. We address this question by establishing a connection between the specificity of biomolecular interactions and the thermodynamic stability of coexisting condensates. By computing the minimum interaction specificity required to assemble condensates with target molecular compositions, we show how to design heteropolymer mixtures that produce compositionally complex condensates using only a small number of monomer types. Our results provide insight into how compositional specificity arises in naturally occurring multicomponent condensates and demonstrate a rational algorithm for engineering complex artificial condensates from simple chemical building blocks.</description>

      <title>Graph Diffusion Transformer for Multi-Conditional Molecular Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13858v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inverse molecular design with diffusion models holds great potential for advancements in material and drug discovery. Despite success in unconditional molecule generation, integrating multiple properties such as synthetic score and gas permeability as condition constraints into diffusion models remains unexplored. We present the Graph Diffusion Transformer (Graph DiT) for multi-conditional molecular generation. Graph DiT has a condition encoder to learn the representation of numerical and categorical properties and utilizes a Transformer-based graph denoiser to achieve molecular graph denoising under conditions. Unlike previous graph diffusion models that add noise separately on the atoms and bonds in the forward diffusion process, we propose a graph-dependent noise model for training Graph DiT, designed to accurately estimate graph-related noise in molecules. We extensively validate the Graph DiT for multi-conditional polymer and small molecule generation. Results demonstrate our superiority across metrics from distribution learning to condition control for molecular properties. A polymer inverse design task for gas separation with feedback from domain experts further demonstrates its practical utility.</description>
