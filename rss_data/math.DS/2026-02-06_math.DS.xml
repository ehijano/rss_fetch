      <title>A surprising discrepancy in the regularity of conjugacies between generalized interval exchange transformations and their inverses at freezing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generalized interval exchange transformations (GIETs) are semi-conjugate to interval exchange transformations (IETs) when the Rauzy-Veech combinatorics is $\infty$-complete. When this semi-conjugacy is a homeomorphism, a fundamental problem is to understand the regularity of the conjugacy and its inverse. Contrary to the usual expectation that their H\"older regularities degenerate simultaneously, we exhibit a strongly asymmetric behavior. For self-similar IETs of hyperbolic periodic type and a natural one-parameter central family of affine IET deformations obtained via a freezing (zero-temperature) limit, the conjugacy becomes arbitrarily irregular while its inverse remains uniformly H\"older. Using thermodynamic formalism for renormalization and zero-temperature limits, we obtain sharp asymptotics for Hausdorff dimensions of invariant and conformal measures and for the supremal H\"older exponents of the conjugacy and its inverse.</description>

      <title>Optimal Harvesting in Stream Networks: Maximizing Biomass and Yield</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we develop a metapopulation model framework to identify optimal harvesting strategies for a population in a stream network. We consider two distinct optimization objectives: maximization of total biomass and maximization of total yield, under the constraint of a fixed total harvesting effort. We examine in detail the special case of a two-patch network and fully characterize the optimal strategies for each objective. We show that when the population growth rate exceeds a critical threshold, a single harvesting strategy can simultaneously maximize both objectives. For general $n$-patch networks with homogeneous growth rates across patches, we focus on the regime of large growth rates and demonstrate that the optimal harvesting strategy selects patches according to their intraspecific competition rates and an effective net flow metric determined by network connectivity parameters.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct non-stationary normal coordinates in a neighborhood of Pesin stable manifolds \cite{Pesin}. This construction is a natural extension, via jets in the normal directions, of the non-stationary normal coordinates on stable manifolds introduced by Guysinsky and Katok. We emphasize that this extension provides a useful framework for describing the fractal geometric structures of stable and unstable foliations in smooth dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>On the Density of Periodic Measures for Star Vector Fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.05402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove that every ergodic hyperbolic invariant measure of a $C^1$ star vector field can be approximated by periodic measures in weak$^*$ topology. This extends a classical result of Katok \cite{Ka} for $C^{1+\alpha}(\alpha&gt;0)$ diffeomorphisms to $C^1$ star vector field of any dimension.</description>

      <title>Rational Interpreters for Discrete Dynamics: Existence, Exactness, and Decomposition over $p$-adic Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address an inverse problem in non-Archimedean dynamics: given a finite discrete dynamical system (equivalently, a functional graph on $N$ states), construct a continuous $p$-adic dynamical system whose residue-level behavior reproduces the prescribed transitions. Using the cylinder partition of $\mathcal{O}_K$ (viewed as \emph{Witt cylinders} for unramified $K/\mathbb{Q}_p$), we encode states by pairwise disjoint closed balls and formalize an \textbf{interpreter} as a map sending each state ball into its target ball.
  Our main existence result constructs rational interpreters that are analytic (hence pole-free) on the prescribed state cylinders, combining rigid-analytic Runge approximation with finite interpolation constraints. Under a linear-dominance condition on each cylinder, ball images are explicit and locally affine, leading to a robust classification of discrete behavior into contractive, indifferent, and expansive regimes. Good reduction provides a selection principle for natural interpreters; effective degree and height bounds for general rational interpreters remain open.
  For composite alphabets we prove a \textbf{Dynamic Chinese Remainder Theorem} for congruence-preserving systems: the CRT isomorphism $\Theta:\mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z}\xrightarrow{\sim}\prod_i\mathbb{Z}/p_i^{k_i}\mathbb{Z}$ (for $m=\prod p_i^{k_i}$) yields a factorization of the \emph{dynamics} (equivalently, the functional graph) on $\mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z}$ into dynamics on the prime-power components, compatible with reduction. Finally, we discuss an inverse-limit (profinite) extension: compatible towers define a $1$-Lipschitz map on $\mathbb{Z}_p$, while selecting compatible analytic/rational interpreters across levels becomes a separate problem.</description>

      <title>Phase transitions on periodic orbits in $\beta$-transformation with a hole at zero</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given $\beta\in(1,2]$, let $T_\beta: [0,1)\to[0,1);~x\mapsto\beta x\pmod 1$. For $m\in\mathbb N$ let
  \[
  \tau_m(\beta):=\sup\left\{t\in[0,1): K_\beta(t)\textrm{ {contains a periodic orbit} of smallest period }m \right\},
  \]
  where $K_\beta(t)=\{x\in[0,1): T_\beta^n(x)\notin(0,t)~\forall n\ge 0\}$ is the survivor set of the open dynamical system $(T_\beta, [0,1), H)$ with a hole $H=(0,t)$. In this paper we give a complete characterization of $\tau_m$, and show that $\tau_m$ is piecewise continuous with precisely $\psi(m)$ discontinuity points, where $\psi(m)$ is the number of bulbs of period $m$ in the Mandelbrot set. To describe the critical value function $\tau_m$ we construct a finite butterfly tree $\mathcal T_m$, from which we are able to determine the discontinuity points and the analytic formula of $\tau_m$ based on Farey words and substitution operators. As a by product, we characterize the extremal Lyndon words and extremal Perron words. Since we are working in the symbolic space, our result can be applied to study phase transitions for periodic orbits in topologically expansive Lorenz maps, doubling map with an asymmetric hole, intermediate $\beta$-transformations, unique expansions in double bases, and so on.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.05593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given any function $\phi \colon [0,\infty)\to (0,1]$ satisfying $\lim_{\xi\to\infty}\phi(\xi) = 0$, we prove the existence of i) self-similar measures and ii) nonlinear $C^{\infty}$ self-conformal measures which are Rajchman and whose Fourier transform $\widehat{\mu}$ satisfies \[ \limsup_{\xi\to\infty}\frac{|\widehat{\mu}(\xi)|}{\phi(\xi)}&gt;0.\] Moreover, we derive new sufficient conditions for a self-conformal measure to be Rajchman, and construct an explicit self-similar measure $\mu$ such that $\mu$ almost every $x$ is normal in base $10$ but the sequence $(10^{n}x \mod 1)_{n=1}^{\infty}$ equidistributes extremely slowly.</description>

      <title>Heteroclinic connections between finite-amplitude periodic orbits emerging from a codimension two singularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heteroclinic connections between two distinct hyperbolic periodic orbits in conservative systems are important in a wide range of applications. On the other hand, it is theoretically challenging to find large amplitude connections from scratch and compute them numerically. In this paper, we use a codimension two singularity, in a family of periodic orbits, as an organizing center for the emergence of heteroclinic connections. A normal form is derived whose unfolding produces two distinct finite amplitude periodic orbits with an explicit heteroclinic connection. We also construct heteroclinic connections far from the singularity by numerical continuation, using two numerical strategies: shooting and the core-farfield decomposition. A key geometric tool in the numerics is cylindrical foliations for the stable and unstable manifolds and their intersection. We introduce a new property of heteroclinic connections - the action - and show it is an invariant along foliations, it has a jump at a surface of section, and it appears in a central way in the normal form theory. We find that the difference in asymptotic phase between minus and plus infinity is also a key property. The theory is applied to the Swift-Hohenberg equation, the nonlinear Schrodinger with fourth order dispersion, and coupled Boussinesq equations from water waves, all of which have an energy and action conservation law.</description>

      <title>Minimal Equicontinuous Actions on Stone Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we study minimal equicontinuous actions on Stone spaces, which we call \emph{subodometers}, and do neither assume that the space is metrizable, nor any assumptions on the acting group. We show that the set of eigenvalues is a complete invariant for subodometers. Furthermore, we characterize minimal rotations on Stone spaces, which we call \emph{odometers}, via the intersection stability of their sets of eigenvalues. We show that any non-empty family of odometers allows for a minimal common extension and a maximal common factor, that both are odometers and that they are unique up to conjugacy. We provide examples that a similar statement does not hold for subodometers.
  We show that subodometers are given as inverse limits of minimal finite actions, that odometers are given as inverse limits of minimal finite rotations, and present how the minimal common extension and the maximal common factor of a non-empty family of odometers can be represented as an inverse limit.
  We establish that a minimal action $X$ is a subodometer if and only if its Ellis semigroup $E(X)$ is an odometer, and present how an inverse limit representation of $E(X)$ can be derived from the representation of $X$. Furthermore, we establish the existence of a universal odometer that has all subodometers as factors; as well as the existence of a maximal subodometer factor, and a maximal odometer factor of a given minimal action.</description>

      <title>Decaying Sensitivity of the Zero Solution for a Class of Nonlinear Optimal Control Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05020v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study spatial decay properties of sensitivities in a nonlinear optimal control problem with a graph--structured interaction topology. For a problem with nonlinear decoupled dynamics and quadratic cost, we show that a localized perturbation of the zero reference leads to an optimal trajectory that decays exponentially with the graph distance. The analysis, based on a nonlinear controllability condition, provides a first step toward extending known spatial decay results from linear--quadratic to nonlinear systems. A numerical example illustrates the theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Learning Nonlinear Continuous-Time Systems for Formal Uncertainty Propagation and Probabilistic Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05103v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear ordinary differential equations (ODEs) are powerful tools for modeling real-world dynamical systems. However, propagating initial state uncertainty through nonlinear dynamics, especially when the ODE is unknown and learned from data, remains a major challenge. This paper introduces a novel continuum dynamics perspective for model learning that enables formal uncertainty propagation by constructing Taylor series approximations of probabilistic events. We establish sufficient conditions for the soundness of the approach and prove its asymptotic convergence. Empirical results demonstrate the framework's effectiveness, particularly when predicting rare events.</description>

      <title>On Path-based Marginal Cost of Heterogeneous Traffic Flow for General Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Path marginal cost (PMC) is a crucial component in solving path-based system-optimal dynamic traffic assignment (SO-DTA), dynamic origin-destination demand estimation (DODE), and network resilience analysis. However, accurately evaluating PMC in heterogeneous traffic conditions poses significant challenges. Previous studies often focus on homogeneous traffic flow of single vehicle class and do not well address the interactive effect of heterogeneous traffic flows and the resultant computational issues. This study proposes a novel but simple method for approximately evaluating PMC in complex heterogeneous traffic condition. The method decomposes PMC into intra-class and inter-class terms and uses conversion factor derived from heterogeneous link dynamics to explicitly model the intricate relationships between vehicle classes. Additionally, the method considers the non-differentiable issue that arises when mixed traffic flow approaches system optimum conditions. The proposed method is tested on a small corridor network with synthetic demand and a large-scale network with calibrated demand from real-world data. Results demonstrated that our method exhibits superior performance in solving bi-class SO-DTA problems, yielding lower total travel cost and capturing the multi-class flow competition at the system optimum state.</description>

      <title>Inverse Depth Scaling From Most Layers Being Similar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural scaling laws relate loss to model size in large language models (LLMs), yet depth and width may contribute to performance differently, requiring more detailed studies. Here, we quantify how depth affects loss via analysis of LLMs and toy residual networks. We find loss scales inversely proportional to depth in LLMs, probably due to functionally similar layers reducing error through ensemble averaging rather than compositional learning or discretizing smooth dynamics. This regime is inefficient yet robust and may arise from the architectural bias of residual networks and target functions incompatible with smooth dynamics. The findings suggest that improving LLM efficiency may require architectural innovations to encourage compositional use of depth.</description>

Abstract: This paper explores the domain of meromorphic extension for the dynamical zeta function associated to a class of one-dimensional differentiable parabolic maps featuring an indifferent fixed point. We establish the connection between this domain and the spectrum of the weighted transfer operators of the induced map. Furthermore, we discuss scenarios where meromorphic extensions occur beyond the confines of the natural disc of convergence of the dynamical zeta function.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09917v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider continuous maps of the interval which preserve the Lebesgue measure. Except for the identity map or $1 - \id$ all such maps have topological entropy at least $\log2/2$ and generically they have infinite topological entropy. In this article we show that the generic map has zero measure-theoretic entropy. This implies that there are dramatic differences in the topological versus measure-theoretic behavior both for injectivity as well as for the structure of the level sets of generic maps. As a consequence we get a surprising corollary for a family of planar attractors homeomorphic to the pseudo-arcs.</description>

Abstract: We show that given a lattice $\Gamma \subset \mathbb{R}^m \times \mathbb{R}^n$, and projections $p_1$ and $p_2$ onto $\mathbb{R}^m$ and $\mathbb{R}^n$ respectively, cut-and-project sets obtained using Jordan measurable windows $W$ and $W'$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$ of equal measure are bounded distance equivalent only if $W$ and $W'$ are equidecomposable by translations in $p_2(\Gamma)$. As a consequence, we obtain an explicit description of the bounded distance equivalence classes in the hulls of simple quasicrystals. A corrigendum is appended at the end of the paper.</description>

      <title>Analytical and numerical methods for spillover effects in prioritized PrEP for HIV prevention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08035v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an effective intervention for preventing HIV transmission, but high cost and uneven uptake raise challenges for resource allocation. While spillover effects, wherein PrEP use in one group reduces infections in others, are known to occur, they remain poorly quantified and rarely guide policy. We provide a comprehensive modeling study for PrEP spillover across risk groups, and develop analytic and numerical tools for its quantification. We first develop a compartmental model for HIV transmission that stratifies the population into interacting subgroups: heterosexual males (HETM), high- and low-risk heterosexual females (HETF-hi/HETF-lo) and men who have sex with men (MSM). The asymptotic stability of the disease-free equilibrium of the model is analyzed. Spillover is quantified by deriving an expression for the spillover-adjusted number needed to treat (NNT), a measure of the population-level impact of PrEP. Simulations show PrEP delivery to MSM yields substantial indirect benefits, particularly for HETF-lo, where spillover exceeds the direct effect by a factor of five. We show targeting HETF-hi outperforms direct PrEP delivery to HETM, emphasizing the importance of intra-group heterogeneity. To evaluate whether these results hold under more detailed assumptions, we embed our framework into the national HOPE model maintained by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and conduct global sensitivity analysis using Sobol indices with Polynomial Chaos Expansion. This approach extends our analytical insights and quantifies how uncertainty in PrEP allocation propagates through complex dynamics. Further, this framework provides a numerical procedure for quantifying spillover where direct analysis is impractical. Our results show that spillover is a central driver of PrEP dynamics and that failing to account for it risks mis-allocating resources.</description>

      <title>Threshold graphs are globally synchronizing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12646v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Kuramoto model can be formulated as a gradient flow on a nonconvex energy landscape of the form $E(\boldsymbol{\theta}) := \frac{1}{2} \sum_{1\le i,j\le n} A_{ij}\bigl(1-\cos(\theta_i-\theta_j)\bigr).$ A fundamental question is to identify graph structures for which this landscape is benign, in the sense that every second-order stationary point corresponds to a fully synchronized state. This property guarantees that all trajectories of the Kuramoto model converge to a fully synchronized state except for a measure-zero set of initial conditions, a phenomenon known as global synchronization. Existing guarantees typically require that each node be connected to a sufficiently large fraction of the other nodes, enforcing high graph density. In this work, we show that threshold graphs lie well outside this regime while still exhibiting global synchronization. In particular, threshold graphs realize arbitrary edge densities and have degree sequences that are extremal in the sense of majorization. Our analysis is based on a phasor--geometric characterization of stationary points that exploits the structural and geometric symmetries induced by threshold graphs.</description>

      <title>On the multiplier spectrum of polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13437v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove several results on the multiplier spectrum of polynomials. We provide a detailed proof of the theorem stating that the multiplier spectrum morphism is generically injective on the moduli space of polynomials. We obtain a description of the non-injective locus of the multiplier spectrum morphism for polynomials of degree $d\geq2$. Roughly speaking, we prove that, apart from isolated exceptions, polynomials with the same multiplier spectrum are intertwined. More precisely, we show that, up to iteration and isolated exceptions, the polynomials are either equivalent or related by Ritt moves. We also investigate the relationship between Ritt moves and multiplier spectra over arithmetic progressions.</description>

      <title>Limit Theorems and Quantitative Statistical Stability for the Equilibrium States of Piecewise Partially Hyperbolic Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04098v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper establishes limit theorems and quantitative statistical stability for a class of piecewise partially hyperbolic maps that are neither necessarily continuous nor locally invertible. By employing a flexible functional-analytic framework that bypasses the classical requirement of compact embeddings between Banach spaces, we obtain explicit rates of convergence for the variation of equilibrium states under perturbations. Furthermore, we prove the exponential decay of correlations and the Central Limit Theorem for H\"older observables. A key feature of our approach is its applicability to systems where traditional spectral gap techniques fail due to the presence of singularities and the lack of invertibility. We provide several examples illustrating the scope of our results, including partially hyperbolic attractors over horseshoes, non-invertible dynamics semi-conjugated to Manneville--Pomeau maps, and fat solenoidal attractors.</description>

      <title>Streaming Operator Inference for Model Reduction of Large-Scale Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12161v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Projection-based model reduction enables efficient simulation of complex dynamical systems by constructing low-dimensional surrogate models from high-dimensional data. The Operator Inference (OpInf) approach learns such reduced surrogate models through a two-step process: constructing a low-dimensional basis via Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to compress the data, then solving a linear least-squares (LS) problem to infer reduced operators that govern the dynamics in this compressed space, all without access to the underlying code or full model operators, i.e., non-intrusively. Traditional OpInf operates as a batch learning method, where both the SVD and LS steps process all data simultaneously. This poses a barrier to deployment of the approach on large-scale applications where dataset sizes prevent the loading of all data into memory at once. Additionally, the traditional batch approach does not naturally allow model updates using new data acquired during online computation. To address these limitations, we propose Streaming OpInf, which learns reduced models from sequentially arriving data streams. Our approach employs incremental SVD for adaptive basis construction and recursive LS for streaming operator updates, eliminating the need to store complete data sets while enabling online model adaptation. The approach can flexibly combine different choices of streaming algorithms for numerical linear algebra: we systematically explore the impact of these choices both analytically and numerically to identify effective combinations for accurate reduced model learning. Numerical experiments on benchmark problems and a large-scale turbulent channel flow demonstrate that Streaming OpInf achieves accuracy comparable to batch OpInf while reducing memory requirements by over 99% and enabling dimension reductions exceeding 31,000x, resulting in orders-of-magnitude faster predictions.</description>
