      <title>On the existence of Hamiltonian cycles in hypercubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For each pair of positive integers $(a,b)$ such that $a \geq 0$ and $b &gt; 1$, the present paper provides a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of Hamiltonian cycles visiting all the vertices of any $k$-dimensional grid $\{0,1\}^k \subset \mathbb{R}^k$ and whose associated Euclidean distance is equal to $\sqrt{a^2+b^2}$. Our solution extends previously stated results in fairy chess on the existence of closed Euclidean $(a,b)$-leapers tours for $2 \times 2 \times \cdots \times 2$ chessboards, where the (Euclidean) knight identifies the $(1,2)$-leaper.</description>

      <title>Coxeter groups and Billey-Postnikov decompositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this chapter, we give an overview of Billey-Postnikov (BP) decompositions which have become an important tool for understanding the geometry and combinatorics of Schubert varieties. BP decompositions are factorizations of Coxeter group elements with many nice properties in relation to Bruhat partial order. They have played an important role in the classification and enumeration of smooth Schubert varieties. They have also been used in the study of inversion hyperplane arrangements and permutation pattern avoidance. We survey many of these applications.</description>

      <title>Ruzsa's problem on Bi-Sidon sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A subset $S$ of real numbers is called bi-Sidon if it is a Sidon set with respect to both addition and multiplication, i.e., if all pairwise sums and all pairwise products of elements of $S$ are distinct. Imre Ruzsa asked the following question: What is the maximum number $f(N)$ such that every set $S$ of $N$ real numbers contains a bi-Sidon subset of size at least $f(N)$? He proved that $f(N)\geq cN^{1/3}$, for a constant $c&gt;0$. In this note, we improve this bound to $cN^{5/12}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a finite abelian group $G$ and a subset $S\subseteq G$, we let $N_{G,\ S}$ be the smallest integer $N$ such that for any subset $A\subseteq G$ with $N$ elements, we have $g+S\subseteq A$ for some $g\in G$. Using the probabilistic method, we prove that
  \begin{align*}
  \frac{|H_G(S)|-1}{|H_G(S)|}|G|+\Biggl\lceil\biggl(\frac{|G|}{|H_G(S)|}\biggr)^{1-|H_G(S)|/|S|}\Biggr\rceil\le N_{G,\ S}\le \biggl\lfloor\frac{|S|-1}{|S|}|G|\biggr\rfloor+1,
  \end{align*}
  where $H_G(S)$ is the stabilizer of $S$.</description>

      <title>Comparing the $p$-independence number of regular graphs to the $q$-independence number of their line graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a simple graph, and let $p$, $q$, and $r$ be non-negative integers. A \emph{$p$-independent} set in $G$ is a set of vertices $S \subseteq V(G)$ such that the subgraph induced by $S$ has maximum degree at most $p$. The \emph{$p$-independence number} of $G$, denoted by $\alpha_p(G)$, is the cardinality of a maximum $p$-independent set in $G$. Letting $L(G)$ denote the line graph of $G$. In this paper, motivated by the result $\alpha_0(G) \leq \alpha_0(L(G))$, for every $r$-regular graph with $r \geq 1$ (see~\cite{CaDaPe2020}), we investigate which values of $p$, $q$, and $r$ have the property that $\alpha_p(G) \leq \alpha_q(L(G))$ for all $r$-regular graphs $G$. Triples $(p, q, r)$ having this property are called \emph{valid $\alpha$-triples}. Among the results we prove are : \begin{itemize}
  \item $(p, q, r)$ is valid $\alpha$-triple for $p \geq 0$, $q \geq 3$ , and $r\geq 2$.
  \item $(p, q, r)$ is valid $\alpha$-triple for $p \leq q &lt; 3$ and $r\geq 2$.
  \item $(p, q, r)$ is valid $\alpha$-triple for $p \geq 0$, $q = 2$, and $r$ even.
  \item $(p, q, r)$ is valid $\alpha$-triple for $p \geq 0$, $q = 2$, and $r$ odd with $r = \max \Big \{ 3, \frac{17(p+1)}{6}\Big \}$. \end{itemize} We also show a close relation between undetermined possible valid $\alpha$-triples, the Linear Aboricity Conjecture, and the Path-Cover Conjecture.</description>

      <title>On the $\mathcal{ABS}$ spectrum and energy of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\eta_{1}\ge \eta_{2}\ge\cdots\ge \eta_{n}$ be the eigenavalues of $\mathcal{ABS}$ matrix. In this paper, we characterize connected graphs with $\mathcal{ABS}$ eigenvalue $\eta_{n}&gt;-1$. As a result, we determine all connected graphs with exactly two distinct $\mathcal{ABS}$ eigenvalues. We show that a connected bipartite graph has three distinct $\mathcal{ABS}$ eigenvalues if and only if it is a complete bipartite graph. Furthermore, we present some bounds for the $\mathcal{ABS}$ spectral radius (resp. $\mathcal{ABS}$ energy) and characterize extremal graphs. Also, we obtain a relation between $\mathcal{ABC}$ energy and $\mathcal{ABS}$ energy. Finally, the chemical importance of $\mathcal{ABS}$ energy is investigated and it shown that the $\mathcal{ABS}$ energy is useful in predicting certain properties of molecules.</description>

      <title>Connected Tur\'{a}n numbers for Berge paths in hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{F}$ be a family of $r$-uniform hypergraphs. Denote by $\ex^{\mathrm{conn}}_r(n,\mathcal{F})$ the maximum number of hyperedges in an $n$-vertex connected $r$-uniform hypergraph which contains no member of $\mathcal{F}$ as a subhypergraph. Denote by $\mathcal{B}C_k$ the Berge cycle of length $k$, and by $\mathcal{B}P_k$ the Berge path of length $k$. F\"{u}redi, Kostochka and Luo, and independently Gy\H{o}ri, Salia and Zamora determined $\ex^{\mathrm{conn}}_r(n,\mathcal{B}P_k)$ provided $k$ is large enough compared to $r$ and $n$ is sufficiently large. For the case $k\le r$, Kostochka and Luo obtained an upper bound for $\ex^{\mathrm{conn}}_r(n,\mathcal{B}P_k)$. In this paper, we continue investigating the case $k\le r$. We precisely determine $\ex^{\mathrm{conn}}_r(n,\mathcal{B}P_k)$ when $n$ is sufficiently large and $n$ is not a multiple of~$r$. For the case $k=r+1$, we determine $\ex^{\mathrm{conn}}_r(n,\mathcal{B}P_k)$ asymptotically.</description>

      <title>Partitioning 2-edge-coloured bipartite graphs into monochromatic cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given an $r$-colouring of the edges of a graph $G$, we say that it can be partitioned into $p$ monochromatic cycles when there exists a set of $p$ vertex-disjoint monochromatic cycles covering all the vertices of $G$. In the literature of this problem, an edge and a single vertex both count as a cycle.
  We show that for every $2$-colouring of the edges of a complete balanced bipartite graph, $K_{n,n}$, it can be partitioned into at most 4 monochromatic cycles. This type of question was first studied in 1970 for complete graphs and in 1983, by Gy\'arf\'as and Lehel, for $K_{n,n}$. In 2014, Pokrovskiy, has showed that any $2$-colouring of the edges of $K_{n,n}$ can be partitioned into at most $3$ paths. It turns out that finding monochromatic cycles instead of paths is a natural question that has also being asked for other graphs. In 2015, Schaudt and Stein have showed that at most 14 cycles are necessary.</description>

      <title>Tight minimum degree condition to guarantee $C_{2k+1}$-free graphs to be $r$-partite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Erd\H{o}s and Simonovits asked the following question: For an integer $c\geq 2$ and a family of graphs $\mathcal{F}$, what is the infimum of $\alpha$ such that any $\mathcal{F}$-free $n$-vertex graph with minimum degree at least $\alpha n$ has chromatic number at most $c$? Denote the infimum as $\delta_{\chi}(\mathcal{F}, c)$. A fundamental result of
  Erd\H{o}s, Stone and Simonovits \cite{ES46, ES66} implies that for any $c\le r-1$, $\delta_{\chi}(\mathcal{F}, c)=1-{1 \over r}$, where $r+1=\chi(\mathcal{F})=\min\{\chi (F): F\in \mathcal{F}\}$. So the remaining challenge is to determine $\delta_{\chi}(\mathcal{F}, c)$ for $c\ge \chi (\mathcal{F})-1$. Most previous known results are under the condition $c= \chi (\mathcal{F})-1$. When $c\ge \chi (\mathcal{F})$, the only known exact results are $\delta_{\chi}(K_3, 3)$ by H\"aggkvist and Jin, and $\delta_{\chi}(K_3, c)$ for every $c\ge4$ by Brandt and Thomass\'{e}, $\delta_{\chi}(K_r, r)$ and $\delta_{\chi}(K_r, r+1)$ by Nikiforov. In this paper, we focus on odd cycles. Combining results of Thomassen and Ma, we have $\Omega\bigg((c+1)^{-8(k+1)}\bigg)=\delta_{\chi}(C_{2k+1}, c)=O(\frac{k}{c})$ for $c\ge 3$. In this paper, we determine $\delta_{\chi}(C_{2k+1}, c)$ for all $c\ge 2$ and $k\ge 3c+4$ ($k\ge 5$ if $c=2$). We also obtain the following corollary. If $G$ is a non-$c$-partite graph on $n$ vertices with $c\ge 3$ and $\delta(G)&gt; {n \over 2c+2}$, then $C_{2k+1} \subset G$ for all $k\in [3c+4, {n \over 108(c+1)^c}]$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $p_1,\dots,p_d$ be integral polynomials vanishing at $0$. It was asked by Bergelson and Hindman whenever $A$ is large, whether the set $\{(m,n)\in \mathbb{N}^2:m+p_1(n),m+p_2(n),\dots,m+p_d(n)\in A\}$ be large in the same sense. In this paper, we give negative answers to this question when ``large'' being the notions of ``central*'', ``IP*'', ``IP$_n$*'', ``IP$_{&lt;\omega}$*'' and ``$\Delta$*''.</description>

      <title>On torsion in eulerian magnitude homology of Erdos-Renyi random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate the regimes where an Erdos-Renyi random graph has torsion free eulerian magnitude homology groups. To this end, we start be introducing the eulerian Asao-Izumihara complex - a quotient CW-complex whose homology groups are isomorphic to direct summands of the graph eulerian magnitude homology group. We then proceed by producing a vanishing threshold for a shelling of eulerian Asao-Izumihara complex. This will lead to a result establishing the regimes where eulerian magnitude homology of Erdos-Renyi random graphs is torsion free.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1995, Erd\H{o}s and Gy\'{a}rf\'{a}s proved that in every $2$-edge-coloured complete graph on $n$ vertices, there exists a collection of $2\sqrt{n}$ monochromatic paths, all of the same colour, which cover the entire vertex set. They conjectured that it is possible to replace $2\sqrt{n}$ by $\sqrt{n}$. We prove this to be true for all sufficiently large $n$.</description>

This result leads to a new characterization of when generalized Paley graphs are disconnected. We also provide necessary and sufficient divisibility conditions for the multiplicative group of the prime subfield of certain finite fields to be contained in the multiplicative subgroup of nonzero $k$-th powers. This latter result plays a crucial role in our development of a sorting algorithm on generalized Paley graphs that exploits the vector space structure of finite fields to partition certain subsets of vertices in a manner that decomposes the induced bipartite subgraph between them into complete balanced bipartite subgraphs. As a consequence, we establish a matching condition between these subsets of vertices that results in an explicit formula for the condensed Ricci curvature on certain Paley graphs and their generalizations.</description>

      <title>Higher-Categorical Associahedra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The second author introduced 2-associahedra as a tool for investigating functoriality properties of Fukaya categories, and he conjectured that they could be realized as face posets of convex polytopes. We introduce a family of posets called categorical $n$-associahedra, which naturally extend the second author's 2-associahedra and the classical associahedra. Categorical $n$-associahedra give a combinatorial model for the poset of strata of a compactified real moduli space of a tree arrangement of affine coordinate subspaces. We construct a family of complete polyhedral fans, called velocity fans, whose coordinates encode the relative velocities of pairs of colliding coordinate subspaces, and whose face posets are the categorical $n$-associahedra. In particular, this gives the first fan realization of 2-associahedra. In the case of the classical associahedron, the velocity fan specializes to the normal fan of Loday's realization of the associahedron.
  For proving that the velocity fan is a fan, we first construct a cone complex of metric $n$-bracketings and then exhibit a piecewise-linear isomorphism from this complex to the velocity fan. We demonstrate that the velocity fan, which is not simplicial, admits a canonical smooth flag triangulation on the same set of rays, and we describe a second, finer triangulation which provides a new extension of the braid arrangement. We describe piecewise-unimodular maps on the velocity fan such that the image of each cone is a union of cones in the braid arrangement, and we highlight a connection to the theory of building sets and nestohedra. We explore the local iterated fiber product structure of categorical $n$-associahedra and the extent to which this structure is realized by the velocity fan. For the class of concentrated $n$-associahedra we exhibit generalized permutahedra having velocity fans as their normal fans.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a formula for the Poincar\'e dual of the Chern-Schwartz-MacPherson (CSM) cycle of a matroid in the Chow ring of the matroid. We derive the formula from the case of matroids realizable over the complex numbers and prove that it satisfies a contraction-deletion formula. From this fact, we prove it holds for all matroids, confirming a conjecture of Fife and Rinc\'on.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce classical algorithms for random sampling of permutations, drawing inspiration from the Steinhaus-Johnson-Trotter algorithm. Our approach takes a comprehensive view of permutation sampling by expressing them as products of adjacent transpositions. Building on this, we develop a quantum analogue of these classical algorithms using a quantum circuit model for random sampling of permutations for $n$-qubit systems. As an application, we present a quantum algorithm for the two-sample randomization test to assess the difference of means in classical data, utilizing a quantum circuit model. Finally, we propose a nested corona product graph generative model for symmetric groups, which facilitates random sampling of permutations from specific sets of permutations through a quantum circuit model.</description>

      <title>Geometric Markov partitions for pseudo-Anosov homeomorphisms with prescribed combinatorics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we focus on constructing and refining geometric Markov partitions for pseudo-Anosov homeomorphisms that may contain spines. We introduce a systematic approach to constructing \emph{adapted Markov partitions} for these homeomorphisms. Our primary result is an algorithmic construction of \emph{adapted Markov partitions} for every generalized pseudo-Anosov map, starting from a single point. This algorithm is applied to the so-called \emph{first intersection points} of the homeomorphism, producing \emph{primitive Markov partitions} that behave well under iterations. We also prove that the set of \emph{primitive geometric types} of a given order is finite, providing a canonical tool for classifying pseudo-Anosov homeomorphisms. We then construct new geometric Markov partitions from existing ones, maintaining control over their combinatorial properties and preserving their geometric types. The first geometric Markov partition we construct has a binary incidence matrix, which allows for the introduction of the sub-shift of finite type associated with any Markov partition's incidence matrix -- this is known as the \emph{binary refinement}. We also describe a process that cuts any Markov partition along stable and unstable segments prescribed by a finite set of periodic codes, referred to as the $s$ and $U$-boundary refinements. Finally, we present an algorithmic construction of a Markov partition where all periodic boundary points are located at the corners of the rectangles in the partition, called the \emph{corner refinement}. Each of these Markov partitions and their intrinsic combinatorial properties plays a crucial role in our algorithmic classification of pseudo-Anosov homeomorphisms up to topological conjugacy.</description>

      <title>Rank fluctuations of matrix products and a moment method for growing groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the cokernel $G_n = \mathbf{Cok}(A_{k} \cdots A_2 A_1)$ of a product of independent $n \times n$ random integer matrices with iid entries from generic nondegenerate distributions, in the regime where both $n$ and $k$ are sent to $\infty$ simultaneously. In this regime we show that the cokernel statistics converge universally to the reflecting Poisson sea, an interacting particle system constructed in arXiv:2312.11702, at the level of $1$-point marginals. In particular, $\operatorname{corank}(A_{k} \cdots A_2 A_1 \pmod{p}) \sim \log_p k$, and its fluctuations are $O(1)$ and converge to a discrete random variable defined in arXiv:2310.12275.
  The main difference with previous works studying cokernels of random matrices is that $G_n$ does not converge to a random finite group; for instance, the $p$-rank of $G_n$ diverges. This means that the usual moment method for random groups does not apply. Instead, we proceed by proving a `rescaled moment method' theorem applicable to a general sequence of random groups of growing size. This result establishes that fluctuations of $p$-ranks and other statistics still converge to limit random variables, provided that certain rescaled moments $\mathbb{E}[\#\operatorname{Hom}(G_n,H)]/C(n,H)$ converge.</description>

      <title>On the complexity of the Eulerian path problem for infinite graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03113v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the problem of algorithmically deciding whether a given infinite connected graph has an Eulerian path, namely, a path that uses every edge exactly once. It has been recently observed that this problem is $D_3^0$-complete for graphs that have a computable description, whereas it is $\Pi_2^0$-complete for graphs that have a highly computable description, and that this same bound holds for the class of automatic graphs. A closely related problem consists of determining the number of ends of a graph, namely, the maximum number of distinct infinite connected components the graph can be separated into after removing a finite set of edges. The complexity of this problem for highly computable graphs is known to be $\Pi_2^0$-complete as well. The connection between these two problems lies in that only graphs with one or two ends can have Eulerian paths. In this paper we are interested in understanding the complexity of the infinite Eulerian path problem in the setting where the input graphs are known to have the right number of ends. We find that in this setting the problem becomes strictly easier, and that its exact difficulty varies according to whether the graphs have one or two ends, and to whether the Eulerian path we are looking for is one-way or bi-infinite. For example, we find that deciding existence of a bi-infinite Eulerian path for one-ended graphs is only $\Pi_1^0$-complete if the graphs are highly computable, and that the same problem becomes decidable for automatic graphs. Our results are based on a detailed computability analysis of what we call the Separation Problem, which we believe to be of independent interest. For instance, as a side application, we observe that K\"onig's infinity lemma, well known to be non-effective in general, becomes effective if we restrict to graphs with finitely many ends.</description>

We investigate when edge rings are pseudo-Gorenstein, which means that the leading coefficients of the $h$-polynomials of edge rings are equal to $1$. Moreover, we compute the $h$-polynomials of a special family of edge rings and show that some of them are almost Gorenstein.</description>

Abstract: Standard techniques for treating linear recurrences no longer apply for quadratic recurrences. It is not hard to determine asymptotics for a specific parametrized model over a wide domain of values (all $p \neq 1/2$ here). The gap between theory and experimentation seems insurmountable, however, at a single outlier ($p = 1/2$).</description>

Abstract: Given $s \in (0,1]$ and $t \in [0,2]$, suppose a set $X$ in the plane has the following property:~there is a collection of lines of packing dimension $t$ such that every line from the collection intersects $X$ in a set of packing dimension at least $s$. We show that such sets must have packing dimension at least $\max\{s,t/2\}$ and that this bound is sharp. In particular this solves a variant of the Furstenberg set problem for packing dimension. We also solve the upper and lower box dimension variants of the problem. In both of these cases the sharp threshold is $\max\{s,t-1\}$.</description>

      <title>Gathering Information about a Graph by Counting Walks from a Single Vertex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We say that a vertex $v$ in a connected graph $G$ is decisive if the numbers of walks from $v$ of each length determine the graph $G$ rooted at $v$ up to isomorphism among all connected rooted graphs with the same number of vertices. On the other hand, $v$ is called ambivalent if it has the same walk counts as a vertex in a non-isomorphic connected graph with the same number of vertices as $G$. Using the classical constructions of cospectral trees, we first observe that ambivalent vertices exist in almost all trees. If a graph $G$ is determined by spectrum and its characteristic polynomial is irreducible, then we prove that all vertices of $G$ are decisive. Note that both assumptions are conjectured to be true for almost all graphs. Without using any assumption, we are able to prove that the vertices of a random graph are with high probability distinguishable from each other by the numbers of closed walks of length at most 4. As a consequence, the closed walk counts for lengths 2, 3, and 4 provide a canonical labeling of a random graph. Answering a question posed in chemical graph theory, we finally show that all walk counts for a vertex in an $n$-vertex graph are determined by the counts for the $2n$ shortest lengths, and the bound $2n$ is here asymptotically tight.</description>

      <title>Convex decomposition spaces and Crapo complementation formula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03742v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a Crapo complementation formula for the M\"obius function $\mu^X$ in a general decomposition space $X$ in terms of a convex subspace $K$ and its complement: $\mu^X \simeq \mu^{X\setminus K} + \mu^X*\zeta^K*\mu^X$. We work at the objective level, meaning that the formula is an explicit homotopy equivalence of $\infty$-groupoids. Almost all arguments are formulated in terms of (homotopy) pullbacks. Under suitable finiteness conditions on $X$, one can take homotopy cardinality to obtain a formula in the incidence algebra at the level of $\mathbb{Q}$-algebras. When $X$ is the nerve of a locally finite poset, this recovers the Bj\"orner--Walker formula, which in turn specialises to the original Crapo complementation formula when the poset is a finite lattice. A substantial part of the work is to introduce and develop the notion of convexity for decomposition spaces, which in turn requires some general preparation in decomposition-space theory, notably some results on reduced covers and ikeo and semi-ikeo maps. These results may be of wider interest. Once this is set up, the objective proof of the Crapo formula is quite similar to that of Bj\"orner--Walker.</description>

      <title>Spectra of adjacency and Laplacian matrices of Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study adjacency and Laplacian matrices of Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi $r$-uniform hypergraphs on $n$ vertices with hyperedge inclusion probability $p$, in the setting where $r$ can vary with $n$ such that $r / n \to c \in [0, 1)$. Adjacency matrices of hypergraphs are contractions of adjacency tensors and their entries exhibit long range correlations. We show that under the Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi model, the expected empirical spectral distribution of an appropriately normalised hypergraph adjacency matrix converges weakly to the semi-circle law with variance $(1 - c)^2$ as long as $\frac{d_{\avg}}{r^7} \to \infty$, where $d_{\avg} = \binom{n-1}{r-1} p$. In contrast with the Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi random graph ($r = 2$), two eigenvalues stick out of the bulk of the spectrum. When $r$ is fixed and $d_{\avg} \gg n^{r - 2} \log^4 n$, we uncover an interesting Baik-Ben Arous-P\'{e}ch\'{e} (BBP) phase transition at the value $r = 3$. For $r \in \{2, 3\}$, an appropriately scaled largest (resp. smallest) eigenvalue converges in probability to $2$ (resp. $-2$), the right (resp. left) end point of the support of the standard semi-circle law, and when $r \ge 4$, it converges to $\sqrt{r - 2} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{r - 2}}$ (resp. $-\sqrt{r - 2} - \frac{1}{\sqrt{r - 2}}$). Further, in a Gaussian version of the model we show that an appropriately scaled largest (resp. smallest) eigenvalue converges in distribution to $\frac{c}{2} \zeta + \big[\frac{c^2}{4}\zeta^2 + c(1 - c)\big]^{1/2}$ (resp. $\frac{c}{2} \zeta - \big[\frac{c^2}{4}\zeta^2 + c(1 - c)\big]^{1/2}$), where $\zeta$ is a standard Gaussian. We also establish analogous results for the bulk and edge eigenvalues of the associated Laplacian matrices.</description>

Abstract: Hadwiger's transversal theorem gives necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a line transversal to a family of pairwise disjoint convex sets in the plane. These conditions were subsequently generalized to hyperplane transversals to general families of convex sets in $\mathbb{R}^d$ by Goodman, Pollack, and Wenger. Here we show a colorful genealization of their theorem which confirms a conjecture of Arocha, Bracho, and Montejano. The proof is topological and uses the Borsuk-Ulam theorem.</description>

      <title>The Poincar\'e-extended ab-index</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.05904v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by a conjecture concerning Igusa local zeta functions for intersection posets of hyperplane arrangements, we introduce and study the Poincar\'e-extended ab-index, which generalizes both the ab-index and the Poincar\'e polynomial. For posets admitting R-labelings, we give a combinatorial description of the coefficients of the extended ab-index, proving their nonnegativity. In the case of intersection posets of hyperplane arrangements, we prove the above conjecture of the second author and Voll as well as another conjecture of the second author and K\"uhne. We also define the pullback ab-index generalizing the cd-index of face posets for oriented matroids. Our results recover, generalize and unify results from Billera-Ehrenborg-Readdy, Bergeron-Mykytiuk-Sottile-van Willigenburg, Saliola-Thomas, and Ehrenborg. This connection allows us to translate our results into the language of quasisymmetric functions, and-in the special case of symmetric functions-make a conjecture about Schur positivity. A proof of this conjecture now appears an appendix by Ricky Ini Liu.</description>

      <title>Transitive path decompositions of Cartesian products of complete graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.07684v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An $H$-decomposition of a graph $\Gamma$ is a partition of its edge set into subgraphs isomorphic to $H$. A transitive decomposition is a special kind of $H$-decomposition that is highly symmetrical in the sense that the subgraphs (copies of $H$) are preserved and transitively permuted by a group of automorphisms of $\Gamma$. This paper concerns transitive $H$-decompositions of the graph $K_n \Box K_n$ where $H$ is a path. When $n$ is an odd prime, we present a construction for a transitive path decomposition where the paths in the decomposition are considerably large compared to the number of vertices. Our main result supports well-known Gallai's conjecture and an extended version of Ringel's conjecture.</description>

      <title>Complexity results on the decomposition of a digraph into directed linear forests and out-stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09202v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider two decomposition problems in directed graphs. We say that a digraph is $k$-bounded for some $k \in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 1}$ if each of its connected components contains at most $k$ arcs.
  For the first problem, a directed linear forest is a collection of vertex-disjoint directed paths and we consider the problem of decomposing a given digraph into a $k$-bounded and an $\ell$-bounded directed linear forest for some fixed $k,\ell \in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 1}\cup \{\infty\}$. We give a full dichotomy for this problem by showing that it can be solved in polynomial time if $k+\ell \leq 3$ and is NP-complete otherwise. This answers a question of Campbell, H\"orsch, and Moore.
  For the second problem, we say that an out-galaxy is a vertex-disjoint collection of out-stars. Again, we give a full dichotomy of when a given digraph can be edge-decomposed into a $k$-bounded and an $\ell$-bounded out-galaxy for fixed $k,\ell \in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 1}\cup \{\infty\}$. More precisely, we show that the problem can be solved in polynomial time if $\min\{k,\ell\}\in \{1,\infty\}$ and is NP-complete otherwise.</description>

      <title>Classifying abelian groups through acyclic matchings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08008v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The inquiry into identifying sets of monomials that can be eliminated from a generic homogeneous polynomial via a linear change of coordinates was initiated by E. K. Wakeford. This linear algebra problem prompted C. K. Fan and J. Losonczy to introduce the notion of acyclic matchings in the additive group $\mathbb{Z}^n$, subsequently extended to abelian groups by the latter author. Alon, Fan, Kleitman, and Losonczy established the acyclic matching property for $\mathbb{Z}^n$. This note aims to classify all abelian groups with respect to the acyclic matching property.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the max min of the algebraic degree and the nonlinearity of a Boolean function in $n$ variables when restricted to a $k$-dimensional affine subspace of $\mathbb{F}_2^n$. Previous authors have focused on the cases when the max min of the algebraic degree is 0 or 1. Upper bounds, lower bounds and a conjecture on the exact value in special cases are presented.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12459v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive the asymptotic expansion (asymptotics with an arbitrary number of error terms) of k-regular graphs by applying the Laplace method on a recent exact formula from Caizergues and de Panafieu (2023). We also deduce the asymptotic expansion of connected k-regular graphs using standard techniques for divergent series developed by Wright (1970) and Bender (1975), and quantify its closeness to the asymptotic expansion of k-regular graphs.</description>

      <title>On z-coloring and ${\rm b}^{\ast}$-coloring of graphs as improved variants of the b-coloring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12951v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a simple graph and $c$ a proper vertex coloring of $G$. A vertex $u$ is called b-vertex in $(G,c)$ if all colors except $c(u)$ appear in the neighborhood of $u$. By a ${\rm b}^{\ast}$-coloring of $G$ using colors $\{1, \ldots, k\}$ we define a proper vertex coloring $c$ such that there is a b-vertex $u$ (called nice vertex) such that for each $j\in \{1, \ldots, k\}$ with $j\not=c(u)$, $u$ is adjacent to a b-vertex of color $j$. The ${\rm b}^{\ast}$-chromatic number of $G$ (denoted by ${\rm b}^{\ast}(G)$) is the largest integer $k$ such that $G$ has a ${\rm b}^{\ast}$-coloring using $k$ colors. Every graph $G$ admits a ${\rm b}^{\ast}$-coloring which is an improvement over the famous b-coloring. A z-coloring of $G$ is a coloring $c$ using colors $\{1, 2, \ldots, k\}$ containing a nice vertex of color $k$ such that for each two colors $i&lt;j$, each vertex of color $j$ has a neighbor of color $i$ in the graph (i.e. $c$ is obtained from a greedy coloring of $G$). We prove that ${\rm b}^{\ast}(G)$ cannot be approximated within any constant factor unless $P=NP$. We obtain results for ${\rm b}^{\ast}$-coloring and z-coloring of block graphs, cacti, $P_4$-sparse graphs and graphs with girth greater than $4$. We prove that z-coloring and ${\rm b}^{\ast}$-coloring have a locality property. A linear 0-1 programming model is also presented for z-coloring of graphs. The positive results suggest that researches can be focused on ${\rm b}^{\ast}$-coloring (or z-coloring) instead of b-coloring of graphs.</description>

      <title>Improving the Crossing Lemma by Characterizing Dense 2-Planar and 3-Planar Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01733v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The classical Crossing Lemma by Ajtai et al.~and Leighton from 1982 gave an important lower bound of $c \frac{m^3}{n^2}$ for the number of crossings in any drawing of a given graph of $n$ vertices and $m$ edges. The original value was $c= 1/100$, which then has gradually been improved. Here, the bounds for the density of $k$-planar graphs played a central role. Our new insight is that for $k=2,3$ the $k$-planar graphs have substantially fewer edges if specific local configurations that occur in drawings of $k$-planar graphs of maximum density are forbidden. Therefore, we are able to derive better bounds for the crossing number $\text{cr}(G)$ of a given graph $G$. In particular, we achieve a bound of $\text{cr}(G) \ge \frac{37}{9}m-\frac{155}{9}(n-2)$ for the range of $5n &lt; m \le 6n$, while our second bound $\text{cr}(G) \ge 5m - \frac{203}{9}(n-2)$ is even stronger for larger $m&gt;6n$.
  For $m &gt; 6.77n$, we finally apply the standard probabilistic proof from the BOOK and obtain an improved constant of $c&gt;1/27.48$ in the Crossing Lemma. Note that the previous constant was $1/29$. Although this improvement is not too impressive, we consider our technique as an important new tool, which might be helpful in various other applications.</description>

      <title>On Oriented Diameter of Power Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02457v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the oriented diameter of power graphs of groups. We show that a $2$-edge connected power graph of a finite group has oriented diameter at most $4$. We prove that the power graph of a cyclic group of order $n$ has oriented diameter $2$ for all $n\neq 2,4,6$. Until our work, to the best of our knowledge, no infinite family of graphs with oriented diameter 2 had been identified except for subclasses of complete graphs. Finally, we give a complete characterization of the oriented diameter of the power graphs of nilpotent groups. This, in turn, gives an algorithm for computing the oriented diameter of the power graph of a given nilpotent group that runs in time polynomial in the size of the group.</description>

Abstract: The Ekeland-Hofer-Zehnder capacity (EHZ capacity) is a fundamental symplectic invariant of convex bodies. We show that computing the EHZ capacity of polytopes is NP-hard. For this we reduce the feedback arc set problem in bipartite tournaments to computing the EHZ capacity of simplices.</description>

      <title>The v-numbers and linear presentations of ideals of covers of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15206v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a graph and let $J=I_c(G)$ be its ideal of covers. The aims of this work are to study the {\rm v}-number ${\rm v}(J)$ of $J$ and to study when $J$ is linearly presented using combinatorics and commutative algebra. We classify when ${\rm v}(J)$ attains its minimum and maximum possible values in terms of the vertex covers of the graph that satisfy the exchange property. If the cover ideal of a graph has a linear presentation, we express its v-number in terms of the covering number of the graph. We show necessary and sufficient conditions for the graph $\mathcal{G}_J$ of $J$ to be connected. Then, for unmixed K\"onig graphs, we classify when $J$ is linearly presented using graph theory, and show some results on Cohen--Macaulay K\"onig graphs. If $G$ is unmixed, it is shown that the columns of the linear syzygy matrix of $J$ are linearly independent if and only if $\mathcal{G}_J$ has no strong $3$-cycles. One of our main theorems shows that if $G$ is unmixed and has no induced 4-cycles, then $J$ is linearly presented. For unmixed graphs without $3$- and $5$-cycles, we classify combinatorially when $J$ is linearly presented.</description>

Abstract: A multiplicatively idempotent rig (which we abbreviate to mirig) is a rig satisfying the equation $r^2 = r$. We show that a free mirig on finitely many generators is finite and compute its size. This work was originally motivated by a collaborative effort on the decentralized social network Mastodon to compute the size of the free mirig on two generators.</description>
