      <title>Ballistic Modes as a Source of Anomalous Charge Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Steady-state currents generically occur both in systems with continuous translation invariance and in nonequilibrium settings with particle drift. In either case, thermal fluctuations advected by the current act as a source of noise for slower hydrodynamic modes. This noise is unconventional, since it is highly correlated along spacetime rays. We argue that, in quasi-one-dimensional geometries, the correlated noise from ballistic modes generically gives rise to anomalous full counting statistics (FCS) for diffusively spreading charges. We present numerical evidence for anomalous FCS in two settings: (1) a two-component continuum fluid, and (2) the totally asymmetric exclusion process (TASEP) initialized in a nonequilibrium state.</description>

      <title>Random walk with horizontal and cyclic currents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a minimal two-chain random walk model and study the information that fluctuations of the flux and higher cumulants can reveal about the model: its structure, parameters, and whether it operates under nonequilibrium conditions. The two coupled chains allow for both horizontal and cyclic transport. We capture these processes by deriving the cumulant generating function of the system, which characterizes both horizontal and cyclic transport in the long time limit. First, we show that either the horizontal or the cyclic currents, along with their higher-order cumulants, can be used to unravel the intrinsic structure and parameters of the model. Second, we investigate the "zero current" situation, in which the {\it horizontal} current vanishes. We find that fluctuations of the horizontal current reveal the nonequilibrium condition at intermediate bias, while the cyclic current remains nonzero throughout. We also show that in nonequilibrium scenarios close to the zero {\it horizontal} current limit, the entropy production rate is more tightly lower-bounded by the relative noise of the {\it cyclic} current, and vice versa. Finally, simulations of transport before the steady state sets in allow for the extraction of the interchain hopping rate. Our study, illustrating the information concealed in fluctuations, could see applications in chemical networks, cellular processes, and charge and energy transport materials.</description>

      <title>Is active motion beneficial for target search with resetting in a thermal environment?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stochastic resetting has recently emerged as an efficient target-searching strategy in various physical and biological systems. The efficiency of this strategy depends on the type of environmental noise, whether it is thermal or telegraphic (active). While the impact of each noise type on a search process has been investigated separately, their combined effects have not been explored. In this work, we explore the effects of stochastic resetting on an active system, namely a self-propelled run-and-tumble particle immersed in a thermal bath. In particular, we assume that the position of the particle is reset at a fixed rate with or without reversing the direction of self-propelled velocity. Using standard renewal techniques, we compute the mean search time of this active particle to a fixed target and investigate the interplay between active and thermal fluctuations. We find that the active search can outperform the Brownian search when the magnitude and flipping rate of self-propelled velocity are large and the strength of environmental noise is small. Notably, we find that the presence of thermal noise in the environment helps reduce the mean first passage time of the run-and-tumble particle compared to the absence of thermal noise. Finally, we observe that reversing the direction of self-propelled velocity while resetting can also reduce the overall search time.</description>

      <title>Frustrations on Decorated Square Lattice in Ising Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we performed the comprehensive studies of frustration properties in the Ising model on a decorated square lattice in the framework of an exact analytical approach based on the Kramers--Wannier transfer matrix method. The assigned challenge consisted in finding rigorous formulas for residual entropies of all possible frustrations without exception and elucidating the influence of frustrations on the behavior of the thermodynamic functions of the system under discussion. The accomplished results turned out to be very rich and intricate, especially in comparison with the original undecorated square lattice, in which frustration properties are completely absent. Such an abundance of properties is due to the multiparametric problem of decorated lattice with four exchange interactions $J_{x}$, $J_{y}$, $J_{dx}$ and $J_{dy}$ taking on arbitrary continuous values and different signs: positive (ferromagnetic) and negative (antiferromagnetic), as well as with two discrete variables $d_{x}$ and $d_{y}$ (multiplicities of decorating spins in both lattice directions), corresponding to infinite natural series of numbers.</description>

      <title>Composition of q-entropies and hyperbolic orthogonality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We point out that the q-entropy composition for independent events has exactly the same form as the Pythagorean theorem in hyperbolic geometry. We justify the formal relation of hyperbolic geometry with the q-entropy through the use of the $\kappa$-entropy, which is directly related to the hyperboloid model of hyperbolic space. We comment on the relation between orthogonality in this form of the Pythagorean theorem and the independence of the probability distributions appearing in the q-entropy composition through the use of the Dvoretzky-Rogers lemma.</description>

      <title>Universal work statistics in long-range interacting quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We determine the conditions under which the presence of long-range interactions reduce the energy losses due to defect generation during non-adiabatic evolution, crucial for enhancing the power to efficiency ratio of quantum thermal devices. In order to do so, we investigate the response of long-range systems to diverse external drivings, emphasizing their robustness against dynamic excitation in comparison to generic local systems. This phenomenon is demonstrated through the study of the quantum work statistics, revealing insights into energy transfer efficiency and dynamical quantum criticality. Our results demonstrate the benefits of including a long-range interacting medium for quantum thermodynamics application, highlighting the potential to optimize finite-time quantum thermal cycles. Thanks to the effective dimension approach our findings can be drawn in full generality and, then, specified to different experimentally relevant scenarios.</description>

      <title>Kinetic theory of diffusion in a channel of varying cross section</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-diffusion along the longitudinal coordinate in a channel of varying cross section is considered. The starting point is the two-dimensional Enskog-Boltzmann-Lorentz kinetic equation with appropriated boundary conditions. It is integrated over the transversal coordinate to get an approximated one-dimensional kinetic equation, keeping the relevant properties of the original one. Then, a macroscopic equation for the time evolution of the longitudinal density is derived, by means of a modified Chapman-Enskog expansion method, that takes into account the inhomogeneity of the equilibrium longitudinal density. This transport equation has the form of the phenomenological Ficks-Jacobs equation, but with an effective diffusion coefficient that contains corrections associated to the variation of the slope of the equilibrium longitudinal density profile.</description>

      <title>Speed-accuracy trade-off for the diffusion models: Wisdom from nonequilibrium thermodynamics and optimal transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04495v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss a connection between a generative model, called the diffusion model, and nonequilibrium thermodynamics for the Fokker-Planck equation, called stochastic thermodynamics. Based on the techniques of stochastic thermodynamics, we derive the speed-accuracy trade-off for the diffusion models, which is a trade-off relationship between the speed and accuracy of data generation in diffusion models. Our result implies that the entropy production rate in the forward process affects the errors in data generation. From a stochastic thermodynamic perspective, our results provide quantitative insight into how best to generate data in diffusion models. The optimal learning protocol is introduced by the conservative force in stochastic thermodynamics and the geodesic of space by the 2-Wasserstein distance in optimal transport theory. We numerically illustrate the validity of the speed-accuracy trade-off for the diffusion models with different noise schedules such as the cosine schedule, the conditional optimal transport, and the optimal transport.</description>

      <title>SmoQyDEAC.jl: A differential evolution package for the analytic continuation of imaginary time correlation functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the SmoQyDEAC.jl package, a Julia implementation of the Differential Evolution Analytic Continuation (DEAC) algorithm [N. S. Nichols et al., Phys. Rev. E 106, 025312 (2022)] for analytically continuing noisy imaginary time correlation functions to the real frequency axis. Our implementation supports fermionic and bosonic correlation functions on either the imaginary time or Matsubara frequency axes, and treatment of the covariance error in the input data. This paper presents an overview of the DEAC algorithm and the features implemented in the SmoQyDEAC.jl. It also provides detailed benchmarks of the package's output against the popular maximum entropy and stochastic analytic continuation methods. The code for this package can be downloaded from our GitHub repository at https://github.com/SmoQySuite/SmoQyDEAC.jl or installed using the Julia package manager. The online documentation, including examples, can be accessed at https://smoqysuite.github.io/SmoQyDEAC.jl/stable/.</description>

      <title>General theory for extended-range percolation on simple and multiplex networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extended-range percolation is a robust percolation process that has relevance for quantum communication problems. In extended-range percolation nodes can be trusted or untrusted. Untrusted facilitator nodes are untrusted nodes that can still allow communication between trusted nodes if they lie on a path of distance at most R between two trusted nodes. In extended-range percolation the extended-range giant component (ERGC) includes trusted nodes connected by paths of trusted and untrusted facilitator nodes. Here, based on a message passing algorithm, we develop a general theory of extended-range percolation, valid for arbitrary values of R as long as the networks are locally tree-like. This general framework allows us to investigate the properties of extended-range percolation on interdependent multiplex networks. While the extended-range nature makes multiplex networks more robust, interdependency makes them more fragile. From the interplay between these two effects a rich phase diagram merges including discontinuous phase transitions and reentrant phases. The theoretical predictions are in excellent agreement with extensive Monte-Carlo simulations. The proposed exactly solvable model constitutes a fundamental reference for the study of models defined through properties of extended-range paths.</description>

      <title>A Didactic Journey from Statistical Physics to Thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper offers a pedestrian guide from the fundamental properties of entropy to the axioms of thermodynamics, which are a consequence of the axiom of statistical physics. It also dismantles flawed concepts, such as assigning physical meaning to Lagrange multipliers and numerous others. This work also provides a comprehensive understanding of the Legendre transform via geometrical, mathematical and physical insights, as well as its connection to the experimental setup. The central result of this paper is the comprehensive formalisation of key concepts, including ensembles, variable dependencies, potentials and natural variables. Furthermore, the framework of thermodynamics, the state function and the Euler inequality are rigorously proven from the axiom of statistical physics.</description>

      <title>Probing Krylov Complexity in Scalar Field Theory with General Temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Krylov complexity characterizes the operator growth in quantum many-body systems or in quantum field theories. The existing literatures have studied the Krylov complexity in the low temperature limit in quantum field theory. In this paper, we extend and systematically study the Krylov complexity and Krylov entropy in a scalar field theory with general temperatures. To this end, we propose a new method to calculate the Wightman power spectrum which allows us to compute the Lanczos coefficients and then to study the Krylov complexity (entropy) extensively. Compared to the previous studies in the low temperature limit, we find that the Lanczos coefficients and Krylov complexity (entropy) in the high temperature limit will behave somewhat differently. Finally, we also discuss the Krylov complexity (entropy) in the symmetry breaking phase with the Higgs scalar field at finite temperatures.</description>

      <title>Mutual distribution of two partial solutions in 1D localization: new information on the phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the mutual distribution of two linearly independent solutions y_1(x) and y_2(x) of the 1D Schroedinger equation with a random potential. Since individual distributions of $y_1$ and $y_2$ are log-normal, it is naturally to suggest that their mutual distribution is also log-normal. Such hypothesis is confirmed in the deep of the allowed and forbidden bands, but failed near the initial band edge. The mechanism of deviations from the log-normal form is elucidated, and the first correction to it is calculated. The latter allows to demonstrate broadening of the spectral lines in the universal conductance fluctuations. A lot of new information is obtained on the phase transition in the distribution P(\psi), where \psi is a combined phase entering the evolution equations. According to the previous publications, this transition is related with appearance of the imaginary part of \psi at a certain energy E_0, and is not accompanied by singularities in the system resistance. The real sense of this transition consists in the change of configuration of four Lyapunov exponents, which determine the general solution: there are two pairs of complex-conjugated exponents for E&gt;E_0, while for E&lt;E_0 all exponents become real. Realization of two different configurations is confirmed for energies in the deep of the allowed and forbidden bands; it proves the existence of the singular point E_0 at the formal level. The phase transition can be observed in optical systems, tracing the sign of the field in a wave, when the coordinate is changed.</description>

      <title>Meson Mass Sets Onset Time of Anomalous Dynamical Quantum Phase Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03394v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPTs) have been established as a rigorous framework for investigating far-from-equilibrium quantum many-body criticality. Although initially thought to be trivially connected to an order parameter flipping sign, a certain kind of \textit{anomalous} DQPTs have been discovered that exhibit no direct connection to the order parameter and have been shown to arise in the presence of confinement. Here, we show in two paradigmatic models how the onset time of anomalous DQPTs is directly connected, through a power law, to the meson mass in the confined regime of a global symmetry-broken phase. This relation becomes more prominent the closer the initial parameters are to the equilibrium quantum critical point, where a relativistic quantum field theory emerges. Our findings draw a direct connection between mesons and anomalous DQPTs, highlighting the power of the latter to classify exotic far-from-equilibrium criticality.</description>

      <title>Black box work extraction and composite hypothesis testing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Work extraction is one of the most central processes in quantum thermodynamics. However, the prior analysis of optimal extractable work has been restricted to a limited operational scenario where complete information about the initial state is given. Here, we introduce a general framework of black box work extraction, which addresses the inaccessibility of information on the initial state. We show that the optimal extractable work in the black box setting is completely characterized by the performance of a composite hypothesis testing task, a fundamental problem in information theory.We employ this general relation to reduce the asymptotic black box work extraction to the quantum Stein's lemma in composite hypothesis testing, allowing us to provide their exact characterization in terms of the Helmholtz free energy. We also show a new quantum Stein's lemma motivated in this physical setting, where a composite hypothesis contains a certain correlation. Our work exhibits the importance of information about the initial state and gives a new interpretation of the quantities in the composite quantum hypothesis testing, encouraging the interplay between the physical settings and the information theory.</description>

      <title>Geometry fluctuations in chiral superfluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The coupling of chiral superfluids and superconductors to the background geometry leads to surprising geometric induction phenomena. We show that this coupling bears important consequences even in a nearly flat background, through its signature in thermal fluctuations. Starting from the Ginzburg-Landau free energy of a chiral superfluid minimally coupled to the background geometry, we show that the interaction strength between vortices gets renormalized by geometry fluctuations. In our setup, these arise from the shape fluctuations of the underlying two-dimensional substrate, and are controlled by its bending rigidity and tension. In the tensionless limit, the fluctuations lower the vortex interaction strength at large distances, which leads to a lowering of the BKT transition temperature. We study this effect in terms of the renormalization group flow of a dual sine-Gordon theory of the superfluid transition coupled to the substrate shape. It shows that, in turn, the chiral superfluid order can suppress the amplitude of shape fluctuations, resulting in an extended phase diagram which links the superfluid transition to the crumpling transition of the substrate. These reveal thermodynamic signatures of chirality in the superfluid transition.</description>

      <title>Direct Estimation of the Density of States for Fermionic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03414v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulating time evolution is one of the most natural applications of quantum computers and is thus one of the most promising prospects for achieving practical quantum advantage. Here we develop quantum algorithms to extract thermodynamic properties by estimating the density of states (DOS), a central object in quantum statistical mechanics. We introduce key innovations that significantly improve the practicality and extend the generality of previous techniques. First, our approach allows one to estimate the DOS for a specific subspace of the full Hilbert space. This is crucial for fermionic systems, since fermion-to-qubit mappings partition the full Hilbert space into subspaces of fixed number, on which both canonical and grand canonical ensemble properties depend. Second, in our approach, by time evolving very simple, random initial states (e.g. random computational basis states), we can exactly recover the DOS on average. Third, due to circuit-depth limitations, we only reconstruct the DOS up to a convolution with a Gaussian window - thus all imperfections that shift the energy levels by less than the width of the convolution window will not significantly affect the estimated DOS. For these reasons we find the approach is a promising candidate for early quantum advantage as even short-time, noisy dynamics yield a semi-quantitative reconstruction of the DOS (convolution with a broad Gaussian window), while early fault tolerant devices will likely enable higher resolution DOS reconstruction through longer time evolution. We demonstrate the practicality of our approach in representative Fermi-Hubbard and spin models and find that our approach is highly robust to algorithmic errors in the time evolution and to gate noise. We show that our approach is compatible with NISQ-friendly variational methods, introducing a new technique for variational time evolution in noisy DOS computations.</description>

      <title>Continuum limit of the adaptive Kuramoto model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of the adaptive Kuramoto model in the continuum limit with slow adaptation. This model is distinguished by dense multistability, where multiple states coexist for the same system parameters. The underlying cause of this multistability is that some oscillators can lock at different phases or switch between locking and drifting depending on their initial conditions. We identify new states, such as two-cluster states. To simplify the analysis we introduce an approximate reduction of the model via row-averaging of the coupling matrix. We derive a self-consistency equation for the reduced model and present a stability diagram illustrating the effects of positive and negative adaptation. Our theoretical findings are validated through numerical simulations of a large finite system. Comparisons to previous work highlight the significant influence of adaptation on synchronization behavior.</description>

Abstract: In the absence of external forcing, all trajectories on the phase plane of the van der Pol oscillator tend to a closed, periodic, trajectory -- the limit cycle -- after infinite time. Here, we drive the van der Pol oscillator with an external time-dependent force to reach the limit cycle in a given finite time. Specifically, we are interested in minimising the non-conservative contribution to the work when driving the system from a given initial point on the phase plane to any final point belonging to the limit cycle. There appears a speed limit inequality, which expresses a trade-off between the connection time and cost -- in terms of the non-conservative work. We show how the above results can be { generalized to the broader family of non-linear oscillators given by} the Li\'enard equation. Finally, we also look into the problem of minimising the total work done by the external force.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03691v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In frustrated magnets, a variety of novel phenomena arise due to their peculiar magnetic states, whose excitations usually reside in the GHz to THz range. Intense THz lasers, therefore, lead to examining nonlinear optical effects in such magnets. Employing an unbiased numerical method, we calculate the laser-pulse driven harmonic spectra of the Shastry-Sutherland magnets, which is well known as the model of a quantum frustrated magnet $SrCu_2(BO_3)_2$. As a result, nonlinear responses of triplons and a two-triplon bound state are observed through the Zeeman or magnetoelectric couplings between the laser and the electron spin. Furthermore, we find that one can obtain information on magnetic anisotropy and symmetry from the spectra by manipulating external fields or two-color lasers. Our results indicate that laser-driven harmonic spectra are useful as a probe of less-detectable quantum many-body states in frustrated magnets.</description>

      <title>Magic spreading in random quantum circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magic state resources or non-stabilizerness quantify the beyond-Clifford operations necessary for universal quantum computing. How rapidly are magic resources generated by generic many-body dynamics under constraints of locality? We address this problem by exploring magic spreading in brick-wall random unitary circuits. Inspired by the algebraic structure of the Clifford group, we propose a scalable measure of non-stabilizerness, the Calderbank-Shor-Steane entropy, which generalizes the notion of stabilizer entropy and mirrors its qualitative behavior. This metric enables the investigation of non-stabilizerness dynamics for systems of up to N = 1024 qudits. Our main finding is that magic resources equilibrate on timescales logarithmic in system size N, akin to anticoncentration and Hilbert space delocalization measures, but differently from entanglement entropy. We conjecture that our findings describe the phenomenology of non-stabilizerness growth in a broad class of chaotic many-body systems.</description>

      <title>The integer quantum Hall transition: an $S$-matrix approach to random networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we propose a new $S$-matrix approach to numerical simulations of network models and apply it to random networks that we proposed in a previous work 10.1103/PhysRevB.95.125414. Random networks are modifications of the Chalker-Coddington (CC) model for the integer quantum Hall transition that more faithfully capture the physics of electrons moving in a strong magnetic field and a smooth disorder potential. The new method has considerable advantages compared to the transfer matrix approach, and gives the value $\nu \approx 2.4$ for the critical exponent of the localization length in a random network. This finding confirms our previous result and is surprisingly close to the experimental value $\nu_{\text{exp}} \approx 2.38$ observed at the integer quantum Hall transition but substantially different from the CC value $\nu_\text{CC} \approx 2.6$.</description>

      <title>Experiment on intrinsically nonequilibrium distribution of large ions in charged small nanopores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04599v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent theoretical research on locally nonchaotic gravitational energy barrier led to an interesting finding: beyond the boundaries of Boltzmann's H-theorem, there may be macroscopic systems with nontrivial energy properties. The fundamental mechanism is rooted in the intrinsically nonequilibrium steady state. In the current investigation, we experimentally verify this concept, with the weak gravitational force being changed to the strong Coulomb force. The tests are performed on capacitive cells with the same nanoporous electrodes and various electrolyte concentrations. The key characteristic is that the nanopore size is only slightly larger than the ion size, less than twice the ion size. The confinement effect of the nanopore walls plays the role of the spontaneously nonequilibrium dimension (SND). At first glance, the capacitive cells exhibit "normal" charge curves. However, their steady-state ion distribution significantly differs from thermodynamic equilibrium. The measured potential difference is nearly an order of magnitude larger than the prediction of equilibrium thermodynamics. Such phenomena are in line with the molecular dynamics simulations reported in the open literature.</description>

      <title>On temporal entropy and the complexity of computing the expectation value of local operators after a quench</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.11649v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the computational complexity of simulating the time-dependent expectation value of a local operator in a one-dimensional quantum system by using temporal matrix product states. We argue that such cost is intimately related to that of encoding temporal transition matrices and their partial traces. In particular, we show that we can upper-bound the rank of these reduced transition matrices by the one of the Heisenberg evolution of local operators, thus making connection between two apparently different quantities, the temporal entanglement and the local operator entanglement. As a result, whenever the local operator entanglement grows slower than linearly in time, we show that computing time-dependent expectation values of local operators using temporal matrix product states is likely advantageous with respect to computing the same quantities using standard matrix product states techniques.</description>

      <title>On the second law of thermodynamics: Spontaneous cold-to-hot heat transfer in a nonchaotic medium</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.09161v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has long been known that, fundamentally different from a large body of rarefied gas, when a Knudsen gas is immersed in a thermal bath, it may never reach thermal equilibrium. The root cause is nonchaoticity: as the particle-particle collisions are sparse, the particle trajectories tend to be independent of each other. Usually, this counterintuitive phenomenon is studied through kinetic theory and is not considered a thermodynamic problem. In current research, we show that if incorporated in a compound setup, such an intrinsically nonequilibrium behavior has nontrivial consequences and cannot circumvent thermodynamics: cold-to-hot heat transfer may happen spontaneously, either continuously (with an energy barrier) or cyclically (with time-dependent entropy barriers). It allows for production of useful work by absorbing heat from a single thermal reservoir without any other effect. As the system obeys the first law of thermodynamics, the refrigeration statement and the heat-engine statement of the second law of thermodynamics cannot be applied. The basic principle of maximum entropy is adhered to.</description>

      <title>Splitting probabilities as optimal controllers of rare reactive events</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.05414v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The committor constitutes the primary quantity of interest within chemical kinetics as it is understood to encode the ideal reaction coordinate for a rare reactive event. We show the generative utility of the committor, in that it can be used explicitly to produce a reactive trajectory ensemble that exhibits numerically exact statistics as that of the original transition path ensemble. This is done by relating a time-dependent analogue of the committor that solves a generalized bridge problem, to the splitting probability that solves a boundary value problem under a bistable assumption. By invoking stochastic optimal control and spectral theory, we derive a general form for the optimal controller of a bridge process that connects two metastable states expressed in terms of the splitting probability. This formalism offers an alternative perspective into the role of the committor and its gradients, in that they encode forcefields that guarantee reactivity, generating trajectories that are statistically identical to the way that a system would react autonomously.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15829v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thermodynamic properties of the ferromagnetic Ising model on the hierarchical pentagon lattice is studied by means of the tensor network methods. The lattice consists of pentagons, where 3 or 4 of them meet at each vertex. Correlation functions on the surface of the system up to n = 10 layers are evaluated by means of the time evolving block decimation (TEBD) method, and the power low decay is observed in the high temperature region. The recursive structure of the lattice enables complemental numerical study for larger systems, by means of a variant of the corner transfer matrix renormalization group (CTMRG) method. Calculated spin expectation value shows that there is a mean-field type order-disorder transition at T1 = 1.58 on the surface of the system. On the other hand, the bulk part exhibits the transition at T2 = 2.269. Consistency of these calculated results is examined.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.11276v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The preparation of an equilibrium thermal state of a quantum many-body system on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices is an important task in order to extend the range of applications of quantum computation. Faithful Gibbs state preparation would pave the way to investigate protocols such as thermalization and out-of-equilibrium thermodynamics, as well as providing useful resources for quantum algorithms, where sampling from Gibbs states constitutes a key subroutine. We propose a variational quantum algorithm (VQA) to prepare Gibbs states of a quantum many-body system. The novelty of our VQA consists in implementing a parameterized quantum circuit acting on two distinct, yet connected (via CNOT gates), quantum registers. The VQA evaluates the Helmholtz free energy, where the von Neumann entropy is obtained via post-processing of computational basis measurements on one register, while the Gibbs state is prepared on the other register, via a unitary rotation in the energy basis. Finally, we benchmark our VQA by preparing Gibbs states of the transverse field Ising and Heisenberg XXZ models and achieve remarkably high fidelities across a broad range of temperatures in statevector simulations. We also assess the performance of the VQA on IBM quantum computers, showcasing its feasibility on current NISQ devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.01126v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Critical behaviour in phase transitions is a resource for enhanced precision metrology. The reason is that the function, known as Fisher information, is superextensive at critical points, and, at the same time, quantifies performances of metrological protocols. Therefore, preparing metrological probes at phase transitions provides enhanced precision in measuring the transition control parameter. We focus on the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model that exhibits excited state quantum phase transitions at different magnetic fields. Resting on the model spectral properties, we show broad peaks of the Fisher information, and propose efficient schemes for precision magnetometry. The Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model was first introduced for superconductivity and for nuclear systems, and recently realised in several condensed matter platforms. The above metrological schemes can be also exploited to measure microscopic properties of systems able to simulate the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model.</description>

      <title>Emergence of power-law distributions in self-segregation reaction-diffusion processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.14083v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many natural or human-made systems encompassing local reactions and diffusion processes exhibit spatially distributed patterns of some relevant dynamical variable. These interactions, through self-organization and critical phenomena, give rise to power-law distributions, where emergent patterns and structures become visible across vastly different scales. Recent observations reveal power-law distributions in the spatial organization of, e.g., tree clusters and forest patch sizes. Crucially, these patterns do not follow a spatially periodic order but rather a statistical one. Unlike the spatially periodic patterns elucidated by the Turing mechanism, the statistical order of these particular vegetation patterns suggests an incomplete understanding of the underlying mechanisms. Here, we present a novel self-segregation mechanism, driving the emergence of power-law scalings in pattern-forming systems. The model incorporates an Allee-logistic reaction term, responsible for the local growth, and a nonlinear diffusion process accounting for positive interactions and limited resources. According to a self-organized criticality (SOC) principle, after an initial decrease, the system mass reaches an analytically predictable threshold, beyond which it self-segregates into distinct clusters, due to local positive interactions that promote cooperation. Numerical investigations show that the distribution of cluster sizes obeys a power-law with an exponential cutoff.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.12264v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has recently been argued that for near-extremal black holes, the entropy and the energy above extremality respectively receive a logT and a T-linear correction, where T is the temperature. We show that both these features can be derived in a low but not too low temperature regime, by assuming the existence of exponentially many low lying states cleanly separated from rest of the spectrum, without using any specific theory. Argument of the logarithm in the expression of entropy is seen to be the ratio of temperature and the bandwidth of the low lying states. We argue that such spectrum might arise in non-supersymmetric extremal brane systems. Our findings strengthen Page's suggestion that there is no true degeneracy for non-supersymmetric extremal black holes.</description>

      <title>Operadic structure of boundary conditions for two-dimensional Markov Gaussian random fields on the lattice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.07230v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The theory of Markov processes on the square lattice has been given recently by the second author a new algebraic description in terms of operads. In particular, this new approach allows for a nice description of invariant boundary conditions and infinite-volume Gibbs measures. This theory comes with new algebraic objects which have not been constructed on any non trivial model yet. In this article, the main objective is to exhibit and understand these structures in the particular case of Gaussian Markov fields on the two-dimensional square lattice. This article, in the Gaussian framework, is the first time where all the operadic constructions -- products and eigen-elements up to morphisms -- introduced by the second author are defined rigorously. We also relate these constructions to more classical approach such as the transfer matrix of statistical mechanics and the Fourier transform. The description of half-strips and corners is new and requires the introduction of new operations such as folding. From the probabilistic point of view, we also show that the operadic products on the boundaries are not easily defined and most operations are lifted to the level of parameter spaces, here quadratic forms through Schur complements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13231v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider an Ising model with quenched surface disorder, the disorder average of the free energy is the main object of interest. Explicit expressions for the free energy distribution are difficult to obtain if the quenched surface spins take values of $\pm 1$. Thus, we choose a different approach and model the surface disorder by Gaussian random matrices. The distribution of the free energy is calculated. We chose skew-circulant random matrices and analytically compute the characteristic function of the free energy distribution. From the characteristic function we numerically calculate the distribution and show that it becomes log-normal for sufficiently large dimensions of the disorder matrices, and in the limit of infinitely large matrices tends to a Gaussian. Furthermore, we establish a connection to the central limit theorem.</description>

Abstract: One of the key predictions of Parisi's broken replica symmetry theory of spin glasses is the existence of a phase transition in an applied field to a state with broken replica symmetry. This transition takes place at the de Almeida-Thouless (AT) line in the $h-T$ plane. We have studied this line in the power-law diluted Heisenberg spin glass in which the probability that two spins separated by a distance $r$ interact with each other falls as $1/r^{2\sigma}$. In the presence of a random vector-field of variance $h_r^2$ the phase transition is in the universality class of the Ising spin glass in a field. Tuning $\sigma$ is equivalent to changing the dimension $d$ of the short-range system, with the relation being $d =2/(2\sigma -1)$ for $\sigma &lt; 2/3$. We have found by numerical simulations that $h_{\text{AT}}^2 \sim (2/3 -\sigma)$ implying that the AT line does not exist below $6$ dimensions and that the Parisi scheme is not appropriate for spin glasses in three dimensions.</description>

      <title>A quantum annealing approach to the minimum distance problem of quantum codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17703v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum error-correcting codes (QECCs) is at the heart of fault-tolerant quantum computing. As the size of quantum platforms is expected to grow, one of the open questions is to design new optimal codes of ever-increasing size. A related challenge is to ``certify'' the quality of a given code by evaluating its minimum distance, a quantity characterizing code's capacity to preserve quantum information. This problem is known to be NP-hard. Here we propose to harness the power of contemporary quantum platforms to address this question, and in this way help design quantum platforms of the future. Namely, we introduce an approach to compute the minimum distance of quantum stabilizer codes by reformulating the problem as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem and leveraging established QUBO algorithms and heuristics as well as quantum annealing (QA) to address the latter. The reformulation as a QUBO introduces only a logarithmic multiplicative overhead in the required number of variables. We demonstrate practical viability of our method by comparing the performance of purely classical algorithms with the D-Wave Advantage 4.1 quantum annealer as well as hybrid quantum-classical algorithm Qbsolv. We found that the hybrid approach demonstrates competitive performance, on par with the best available classical algorithms to solve QUBO. In a practical sense, the QUBO-based approach is currently lagging behind the best deterministic minimal distance algorithms, however this advantage may disappear as the size of the platforms grows.</description>

      <title>Super-diffusive transport in two-dimensional Fermionic wires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15560v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a two-dimensional model of a Fermionic wire which shows a power-law conductance behavior despite the presence of uncorrelated disorder along the direction of the transport. The power-law behavior is attributed to the presence of energy eigenstates of diverging localization length below some energy cutoff, $E_c$. To study transport, we place the wire in contact with electron reservoirs biased around a Fermi level, $E$. We show that the conductance scales super-diffusively for $|E|&lt;E_c$ and decays exponentially for $|E|&gt;E_c$. At $|E|=E_c$, we show that the conductance scales diffusively or with different sub-diffusive power-laws depending on the sign of the expectation value of the disorder and the parameters of the wire.</description>

      <title>Electronic thermal resistivity and quasi-particle collision cross-section in semi-metals</title>

Abstract: Electron-electron collisions lead to a T-square component in the electrical resistivity of Fermi liquids. The case of liquid $^3$He illustrates that the \textit{thermal} resitivity of a Fermi liquid has a T-square term, expressed in m$\cdot$W$^{-1}$. Its natural units are $\hbar/k_FE_F^2$. Here, we present a high-resolution study of the thermal conductivity in bismuth, employing magnetic field to extract the tiny electronic component of the total thermal conductivity and resolving signals as small as $\approx 60 \mu$K. We find that the electronic thermal resistivity follows a T-square temperature dependence with a prefactor twice larger than the electric T-square prefactor. Adding this information to what has been known for other semi-metals, we find that the prefactor of the T-square thermal resistivity scales with the square of the inverse of the Fermi temperature, implying that the dimensionless fermion-fermion collision cross-section is roughly proportional to the Fermi wavelength, indicating that it is not simply set by the strength of the Coulomb interaction.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic behaviour of determinants through the expansion of the Moyal star product</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12781v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We work out a generalization of the Szeg\"o limit theorems on the determinant of large matrices. We focus on matrices with nonzero leading principal minors and elements that decay to zero exponentially fast with the distance from the main diagonal, but we relax the constraint of the Toeplitz structure. We obtain an expression for the asymptotic behaviour of the determinant written in terms of the factors of a left and right Wiener-Hopf type factorization of an appropriately defined symbol. For matrices with elements varying slowly along the diagonals (e.g., in locally Toeplitz sequences), we propose to apply the analogue of the semiclassical expansion of the Moyal star product in phase-space quantum mechanics. This is a systematic method that provides approximations up to any order in the typical scale of the inhomogeneity and allows us to obtain explicit asymptotic formulas.</description>

      <title>Perturbative versus Non-Perturbative Renormalization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15167v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Approximated functional renormalization group (FRG) equations lead to regulator-dependent $\beta$-functions, in analogy to the scheme-dependence of the perturbative renormalization group (pRG) approach. A scheme transformation redefines the couplings to relate the $\beta$-functions of the FRG method with an arbitrary regulator function to the pRG ones obtained in a given scheme. Here, we consider a periodic sine-Gordon scalar field theory in $d=2$ dimensions and show that the relation of the FRG and pRG approaches is intricate. Although, both the FRG and the pRG methods are known to be sufficient to obtain the critical frequency $\beta_c^2 =8\pi$ of the model independently of the choice of the regulator and the renormalization scheme, we show that one has to go beyond the standard pRG method (e.g., using an auxiliary mass term) or the Coulomb-gas representation in order to obtain the $\beta$-function of the wave function renormalization. This aspect makes the scheme transformation non-trivial. Comparing flow equations of the two-dimensional sine-Gordon theory without any scheme-transformation, i.e., redefinition of couplings, we find that the auxiliary mass pRG $\beta$-functions of the minimal subtraction scheme can be recovered within the FRG approach with the choice of the power-law regulator with $b=2$, therefore constitutes a preferred choice for the comparison of FRG and pRG flows.</description>
