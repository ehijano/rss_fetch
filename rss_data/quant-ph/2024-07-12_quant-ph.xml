      <title>Cryptography in the Common Haar State Model: Feasibility Results and Separations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Common random string model is a popular model in classical cryptography. We study a quantum analogue of this model called the common Haar state (CHS) model. In this model, every party participating in the cryptographic system receives many copies of one or more i.i.d Haar random states. We study feasibility and limitations of cryptographic primitives in this model and its variants:
  - We present a construction of pseudorandom function-like states with security against computationally unbounded adversaries, as long as the adversaries only receive (a priori) bounded number of copies. By suitably instantiating the CHS model, we obtain a new approach to construct pseudorandom function-like states in the plain model.
  - We present separations between pseudorandom function-like states (with super-logarithmic length) and quantum cryptographic primitives, such as interactive key agreement and bit commitment, with classical communication. To show these separations, we prove new results on the indistinguishability of identical versus independent Haar states against LOCC (local operations, classical communication) adversaries.</description>

      <title>Precision is not limited by the second law of thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physical devices operating out of equilibrium are inherently affected by thermal fluctuations, limiting their operational precision. This issue is pronounced at microscopic and especially quantum scales and can only be mitigated by incurring additional entropy dissipation. Understanding this constraint is crucial for both fundamental physics and technological design. For instance, clocks are inherently governed by the second law of thermodynamics and need a thermodynamic flux towards equilibrium to measure time, which results in a minimum entropy dissipation per clock tick. Classical and quantum models and experiments often show a linear relationship between precision and dissipation, but the ultimate bounds on this relationship are unknown. Our theoretical discovery presents an extensible quantum many-body system that achieves clock precision scaling exponentially with entropy dissipation. This finding demonstrates that coherent quantum dynamics can surpass the traditional thermodynamic precision limits, potentially guiding the development of future high-precision, low-dissipation quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Purity benchmarking study of error coherence in a single Xmon qubit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we employ purity benchmarking (PB) to explore the dynamics of gate noise in a superconducting qubit system. Over 1110 hours of observations on an Xmon qubit, we simultaneously measure the coherence noise budget across two different operational frequencies. We find that incoherent errors, which predominate in overall error rates, exhibit minimal frequency dependence, suggesting they are primarily due to wide-band, diffusive incoherent error sources. In contrast, coherent errors, although less prevalent, show significant sensitivity to operational frequency variations and telegraphic noise. We speculate that this sensitivity is due to interactions with a single strongly coupled environmental defect -- modeled as a two-level system -- which influences qubit control parameters and causes coherent calibration errors. Our results also demonstrate that PB offers improved sensitivity, capturing additional dynamics that conventional relaxation time measurements cannot detect, thus presenting a more comprehensive method for capturing dynamic interactions within quantum systems. The intricate nature of these coherence dynamics underscores the need for further research.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Beyond-Standard-Model Event Discovery at the LHC with a Novel Quantum Autoencoder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the potential of unsupervised anomaly detection for identifying physics beyond the Standard Model that may appear at proton collisions at the Large Hadron Collider. We introduce a novel quantum autoencoder circuit ansatz that is specifically designed for this task and demonstrates superior performance compared to previous approaches. To assess its robustness, we evaluate the quantum autoencoder on various types of new physics 'signal' events and varying problem sizes. Additionally, we develop classical autoencoders that outperform previously proposed quantum autoencoders but remain outpaced by the new quantum ansatz, despite its significantly reduced number of trainable parameters. Finally, we investigate the properties of quantum autoencoder circuits, focusing on entanglement and magic. We introduce a novel metric in the context of parameterised quantum circuits, stabilizer 2-R\'enyi entropy to quantify magic, along with the previously studied Meyer-Wallach measure for entanglement. Intriguingly, both metrics decreased throughout the training process along with the decrease in the loss function. This appears to suggest that models preferentially learn parameters that reduce these metrics. This study highlights the potential utility of quantum autoencoders in searching for physics beyond the Standard Model at the Large Hadron Collider and opens exciting avenues for further research into the role of entanglement and magic in quantum machine learning more generally.</description>

      <title>Towards Efficient Quantum Computation of Molecular Ground State Energies using Bayesian Optimization with Priors over Surface Topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Variational Quantum Eigensolvers (VQEs) represent a promising approach to computing molecular ground states and energies on modern quantum computers. These approaches use a classical computer to optimize the parameters of a trial wave function, while the quantum computer simulates the energy by preparing and measuring a set of bitstring observations, referred to as shots, over which an expected value is computed. Although more shots improve the accuracy of the expected ground state, it also increases the simulation cost. Hence, we propose modifications to the standard Bayesian optimization algorithm to leverage few-shot circuit observations to solve VQEs with fewer quantum resources. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach, Bayesian optimization with priors on surface topology (BOPT), by comparing optimizers for molecular systems and demonstrate how current quantum hardware can aid in finding ground state energies.</description>

      <title>Entanglement of photonic modes from a continuously driven two-level system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to generate entangled states of light is a key primitive for quantum communication and distributed quantum computation. Continuously driven sources, including those based on spontaneous parametric downconversion, are usually probabilistic, whereas deterministic sources require accurate timing of the control fields. Here, we experimentally generate entangled photonic modes by continuously exciting a quantum emitter, a superconducting qubit, with a coherent drive, taking advantage of mode matching in the time and frequency domain. Using joint quantum state tomography and logarithmic negativity, we show that entanglement is generated between modes extracted from the two sidebands of the resonance fluorescence spectrum. Because the entangled photonic modes are perfectly orthogonal, they can be transferred into distinct quantum memories. Our approach can be utilized to distribute entanglement at a high rate in various physical platforms, with applications in waveguide quantum electrodynamics, distributed quantum computing, and quantum networks.</description>

      <title>High-Dimensional Bell States: A Paradigm Shift for Quantum Illumination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper solves the open problem of characterizing the performance of quantum illumination (QI) with discrete variable states. By devising a novel quantum measurement approach along with meticulous analysis, our investigation demonstrates that, in the limit as $M \rightarrow \infty$, the maximally entangled $M$ mode Bell state achieves optimal performance, matching the two-mode squeezed vacuum in a high-noise regime and exceeding it in low-noise. This result challenges the dominance of continuous variable states in photonic sensing applications and extends the novelty of QI to regimes where no quantum advantage was believed to exist. A closer analysis reveals that this advantage stems from retained entanglement in the transmitted Bell state, a paradigm-shifting discovery since interaction with the environment in optical systems is believed to break entanglement. The complete mathematical analysis of this work provides granular insights into the interaction between photonic systems and environmental noise, motivating further research into discrete variable quantum sensing.</description>

      <title>An application of continuous-variable gate synthesis to quantum simulation of classical dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although quantum computing holds promise to accelerate a wide range of computational tasks, the quantum simulation of quantum dynamics as originally envisaged by Feynman remains the most promising candidate for achieving quantum advantage. A less explored possibility with comparably far-reaching technological applicability is the quantum simulation of classical nonlinear dynamics. Attempts to develop digital quantum algorithms based on the Koopman von Neumann formalism have met with challenges because of the necessary projection step from an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space to the finite-dimensional subspace described by a collection of qubits. This finitization produces numerical artifacts that limit solutions to very short time horizons. In this paper we review continuous-variable quantum computing (CVQC), which naturally avoids such obstacles, and a CVQC algorithm for KvN simulation of classical nonlinear dynamics is advocated. In particular, we present explicit gate synthesis for product-formula Hamiltonian simulation of anharmonic vibrational dynamics.</description>

      <title>Long-fiber Sagnac interferometers for twin field quantum key distribution networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Sagnac loop structure can help overcome the major difficulty in the practical implementation of a twin field quantum key distribution (TFQKD) network, namely, the need to stabilize the phase of a quantum state over many kilometers of fiber. Unfortunately, Rayleigh backscattering noise limits the signal-to-noise ratio for Sagnac systems containing long fibers and lossy photonic devices. Here, we solve this problem by sending optical pulses in long on-off bursts and using time post-selection on measurements taken with free-run single-photon avalanche detectors. We also investigate the impact of the residual phase noise uncompensated by the Sagnac structure and find that the variance of the phase noise scales as loop length to the third power, verifying an existing calculation in the literature. We measure the interference visibility in Sagnac loops of varying length without active phase or polarization stabilization and achieve &gt; 97% visibility in 200 km ultra-low-loss fiber, which is, to our knowledge, the longest fiber Sagnac interferometer demonstrated. Our results indicate the suitability of a Sagnac system for long-distance TFQKD networks, an important step towards the practical implementation of metropolitan quantum networks.</description>

      <title>Quantum information recast via multiresolution in $L_2(0,1]$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a multiresolution approach to the theory of quantum information. It arose from an effort to develop a systematic mathematical approach to the analysis of an infinite array of qubits, i.e., a structure that may be interpreted as a quantum metamaterial. Foundational to our approach are two mathematical constructions with classical roots: the Borel isomorphism and the Haar basis. Here, these constructions are intertwined to establish an identification between $L_2(0,1]$ and the Hilbert space of an infinite array of qubits and to enable analysis of operators that act on arrays of qubits (either finite or infinite). The fusion of these two concepts empowers us to represent quantum operations and observables through geometric operators. As an unexpected upshot, we observe that the fundamental concept of calculus is inherent in an infinite array of qubits; indeed, the antiderivative arises as a natural and indispensable operator in this context.</description>

Abstract: The transition from classical physics to quantum mechanics has been mysterious. Here, we derive the space-independent von Neumann equation for electron spin mathematically from the classical Bloch or Majorana--Bloch equation, which is also derived. Subsequently, the space-independent Schr\"odinger--Pauli equation is derived in both the quantum mechanical and recently developed co-quantum dynamic frameworks.</description>

      <title>Spin/Phonon Dynamics in Single Molecular Magnets: I. quantum embedding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single molecular magnets (SMMs) and Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs) attract significant interest due to their potential in quantum information processing, scalable quantum computing, and extended lifetimes and coherence times. The limiting factor in these systems is often the spin dephasing caused by interactions and couplings with the vibrational motions of the molecular framework. This work introduces a systematic projection/embedding scheme to analyze spin-phonon dynamics in molecular magnets. This scheme consolidates all spin/phonon couplings into a few collective degrees of freedom. quantum mechanically. Using parameters obtained from ab initio methods for spin/phonon coupling via Zeeman interaction, we apply this approach to compute the electronic spin relaxation times for a single-molecule qubit \ce{VOPc(OH)8}, which features a single unpaired electron localized on the central vanadium atom. However, our general embedding scheme can be applied to any single-molecule magnet or qubit MOF with any coupling/interaction Hamiltonian. This development offers a crucial tool for simulating spin relaxation in complex environments with significantly reduced computational complexity.</description>

      <title>Symmetries and singular behaviors with Bohmian trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum mechanics is able to produce challenging behaviors even in the simplest situations. This is possible because of the important dynamical role that phase plays in the evolution of quantum systems, very similar, nonetheless, to effects observable in analogous optical systems. The present work focuses on how Bohmian mechanics proves to be a rather convenient theoretical framework to analyze phase-based phenomena, since the phase constitutes the central element in this hydrodynamical formulation of quantum mechanics. More specifically, it allows us to understand how spatial phase variations give rise to velocity fields that eventually rule the dynamical behavior of quantum systems, and that, when integrated in time locally (i.e., taking into account specific positions), they provide us with a neat local (point by point) description of the system evolution in the configuration space. Indeed, it will also be seen that this idea transcends the quantum realm and can be profitably used to describe the behavior of optical analogs with rather singular behaviors. With this purpose, two interesting phenomena that take place in free space are considered, namely, the self-acceleration and shape-invariance of Airy beams, and spontaneous self-focusing.</description>

      <title>Asynchronous measurement-device-independent quantum digital signatures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum digital signatures (QDSs), which distribute and measure quantum states by key generation protocols and then sign messages via classical data processing, are a key area of interest in quantum cryptography. However, the practical implementation of a QDS network has many challenges, including complex interference technical requirements, linear channel loss of quantum state transmission, and potential side-channel attacks on detectors. Here, we propose an asynchronous measurement-device-independent (MDI) QDS protocol with asynchronous two-photon interference strategy and one-time universal hashing method. The two-photon interference approach protects our protocol against all detector side-channel attacks and relaxes the difficulty of experiment implementation, while the asynchronous strategy effectively reduces the equivalent channel loss to its square root. Compared to previous MDI-QDS schemes, our protocol shows several orders of magnitude performance improvements and doubling of transmission distance when processing multi-bit messages. Our findings present an efficient and practical MDI-QDS scheme, paving the way for large-scale data processing with non-repudiation in quantum networks.</description>

      <title>Harnessing quantum light for microscopic biomechanical imaging of cells and tissues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The biomechanical properties of cells and tissues play an important role in our fundamental understanding of the structures and functions of biological systems at both the cellular and subcellular levels. Recently, Brillouin microscopy, which offers a label-free spectroscopic means of assessing viscoelastic properties in vivo, has emerged as a powerful way to interrogate those properties on a microscopic level in living tissues. However, susceptibility to photo-damage and photo-bleaching, particularly when high-intensity laser beams are used to induce Brillouin scattering, poses a significant challenge. This article introduces a transformative approach designed to mitigate photo-damage in biological and biomedical studies, enabling non-destructive, label-free assessments of mechanical properties in live biological samples. By leveraging quantum-light-enhanced stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) imaging contrast, the signal-to-noise ratio is significantly elevated, thereby increasing sample viability and extending interrogation times without compromising the integrity of living samples. The tangible impact of this novel methodology is evidenced by a notable three-fold increase in sample viability observed after subjecting the samples to three hours of continuous squeezed-light illumination, surpassing the traditional coherent light-based approaches. The quantum-enhanced SBS imaging holds promise across diverse fields, such as cancer biology and neuroscience where preserving sample vitality is of paramount significance. By mitigating concerns regarding photo-damage and photo-bleaching associated with high-intensity lasers, this technological breakthrough expands our horizons for exploring the mechanical properties of live biological systems, paving the way for a new era of research and clinical applications.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show how to prepare magnonic squeezed states in an optomagnomechanical system, in which magnetostriction induced mechanical displacement couples to an optical cavity via radiation pressure. We discuss two scenarios depending on whether the magnomechanical coupling is linear or dispersive. We show that in both cases the strong mechanical squeezing obtained via two-tone driving of the optical cavity can be efficiently transferred to the magnon mode. In the linear coupling case, stationary magnon squeezing is achieved; while in the dispersive coupling case, a transient magnonic squeezed state is prepared in a two-step protocol. The proposed magnonic squeezed states find promising applications in quantum information processing and quantum sensing using magnons.</description>

Abstract: Nonclassicality in composite quantum systems depicts several puzzling manifestations, with Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen entanglement, Schr\"odinger steering, and Bell nonlocality being the most celebrated ones. In addition to those, an unentangled quantum state can also exhibit nonclassicality, as evidenced from notions such as quantum discord and work deficit. Here, we propose a general framework to investigate nonclassical correlations in multipartite quantum states. The distinct signatures left on observable quantities, depending on whether the sub-parts of a composite system are probed separately or jointly, provide an operational avenue to construct different quantifiers that faithfully capture signatures of nonclassicality in quantum states. Along the line we unveil an intriguing phenomenon referred to as `nonlocal locking of observable quantities', where the value of an observable quantity gets locked in the correlation of a nonclassical state. Our approach reduces the experimental demand for verification of nonclassicality in composite systems and can find applications for enhanced energy storage in quantum thermodynamical devices.</description>

      <title>The trade-off between diagonal and off-diagonal elements in the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In order to bypass the local measurement as an intermediate quantity in the proof of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH), we have proposed a measurement-independent distinguishability measure. In this paper, we establish the connection between this measure and several other ETH measures in a more unified way. We first prove a universal trade-off relation for the diagonal and off-diagonal elements of the measure. Then we extend it to the discussion of eigenstate typicality and the average observable. In the trade-off relationship, the exponential increase of off-diagonal elements will directly suppress the value of off-diagonal elements, and the diagonal elements will also be suppressed indirectly. This relationship gives another perspective to understand the physical mechanism behind ETH. Finally, by numerically calculating one-dimensional Ising spin chain, we examine several trade-off relationships and strong and weak ETH.</description>

      <title>Modeling and Suppressing Unwanted Parasitic Interactions in Superconducting Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconducting qubits are among the most promising candidates for building quantum computers. Despite significant improvements in qubit coherence, achieving a fault-tolerant quantum computer remains a major challenge, largely due to imperfect gate fidelity. A key source of this infidelity is the parasitic interaction between coupled qubits, which this thesis addresses in two- and three-qubit circuits. This parasitic interaction causes a bending between computational and non-computational levels, leading to a parasitic ZZ interaction. The thesis first investigates the possibility of zeroing the ZZ interaction in two qubit combinations: a pair of interacting transmons, and a hybrid pair of a transmon coupled to a capacitively shunted flux qubit (CSFQ). The theory developed is used to accurately simulate experimental results from our collaborators, who measured a CSFQ-transmon pair with and without a cross-resonance (CR) gate. The strong agreement between theory and experiment motivated further study of a CR gate that achieves 99.9% fidelity in the absence of static ZZ interaction. Since the CR pulse adds an additional ZZ component to the static part, a new strategy called dynamical ZZ freedom is proposed to zero the total ZZ interaction. This strategy can be applied in all-transmon circuits to enable perfect entanglement. Based on these findings, a new two-qubit gate, the parasitic-free (PF) gate, is proposed. Additionally, the thesis explores how to utilize the ZZ interaction to enhance the performance of a controlled-Z gate. Lastly, the impact of a third qubit on two-qubit gate performance is examined, with several examples illustrating the properties of two-body ZZ and three-body ZZZ interactions in circuits with more than two qubits.</description>

      <title>Delocalization of skin steady states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The skin effect, characterized by the tendency of particles to accumulate at the boundaries, has been extensively studied in non-Hermitian systems. In this work, we propose an intuitive Lindbladian composed of two chains with reversed skin localization. The skin steady state is gradually delocalized as the interchain coupling increases. In the single-body scenario, it corresponds to a shift in the scaling of the Liouvillian gap $\Delta$ from $\Delta \propto N^0$ to $\Delta \propto N^{-2}$. Notably, exact diagonalization results reveal a system-size sensitivity of the single-particle Liouvillian spectrum, inherited from the non-Hermitian effective Hamiltonian's system-size sensitivity. We predict that even an arbitrarily small coupling will induce dramatic changes in the Liouvillian spectrum and steady state in the thermodynamic limit, a phenomenon we term the critical Liouvillian skin effect. Additionally, in the many-body scenario, by employing the stochastic Schr\"odinger equation to unravel the Lindblad master equation, it is revealed that the scaling behavior of steady-state entanglement changes from the area law to the logarithmic law. This work demonstrates the delocalization of both single-body and many-body skin steady states, introducing a novel mechanism for inducing entanglement transitions beyond the quantum Zeno effect.</description>

      <title>Floquet Schrieffer-Wolff transform based on Sylvester equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a Floquet Schrieffer Wolff transform (FSWT) to obtain effective Floquet Hamiltonians and micro-motion operators of periodically driven many-body systems for any non-resonant driving frequency. The FSWT perturbatively eliminates the oscillatory components in the driven Hamiltonian by solving operator-valued Sylvester equations. We show how to solve these Sylvester equations without knowledge of the eigenstates of the undriven many-body system, using the driven Hubbard model as an example. In the limit of high driving frequencies, these solutions reduce to the well-known high-frequency limit of the Floquet-Magnus expansion. We anticipate this method will be useful for describing multi-orbital and long-range interacting systems driven in-gap.</description>

      <title>Finding Quantum Codes via Riemannian Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel optimization scheme designed to find optimally correctable subspace codes for a known quantum noise channel. To each candidate subspace code we first associate a universal recovery map, as if the code was perfectly correctable, and aim to maximize a performance functional that combines a modified channel fidelity with a tuneable regularization term that promotes simpler codes. With this choice optimization is performed only over the set of codes, and not over the set of recovery operators. The set of codes of fixed dimensions is parametrized as the complex-valued Stiefel manifold of the same dimension: the resulting non-convex optimization problem is then solved by gradient-based local algorithms. When perfectly correctable codes cannot be found, a second optimization routine is run on the recovery Kraus map, also parametrized in a suitable Stiefel manifold via Stinespring representation. To test the approach, correctable codes are sought in different scenarios and compared to existing ones: three qubits subjected to bit-flip errors (single and correlated), four qubits undergoing local amplitude damping and five qubits subjected to local depolarizing channels. Approximate codes are found and tested for the previous examples as well pure non-Markovian dephasing noise acting on a $7/2$ spin, induced by a $1/2$ spin bath, and the noise of the first three qubits of IBM's \texttt{ibm\_kyoto} quantum computer. The fidelity results are competitive with existing iterative optimization algorithms, with respect to which we maintain a strong computational advantage, while obtaining simpler codes.</description>

      <title>Faster Preparation of Multi-qubit Entanglement with Higher Success Rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A noteworthy discovery in recent research is that the process of two-qubit quantum entanglement preparation can be significantly accelerated near the exceptional point (EP) or spectral coalescence of non-Hermitian systems, as compared to conventional Hermitian setups. Nevertheless, a significant obstacle for quantum EP-based devices is their limited success rate in generating highly entangled states, stemming from an inherent trade-off relation between entanglement degree and success rate in all lossy EP systems. Our study demonstrates that this limitation can be effectively overcome by harnessing a truly parity-time ($\mathcal{PT}$)-symmetric system, which possesses balanced gain and loss, thereby enabling maximal entanglement with rapid speed, high success rates, and greater resilience to non-resonant errors. We believe this approach can efficiently prepare multi-qubit entanglement and use not only bipartite but also tripartite entanglement as examples to illustrate, even when the precise gain-loss balance is not strictly maintained. Our analytical findings are in excellent agreement with numerical simulations, confirming the potential of $\mathcal{PT}$-devices as a powerful tool for creating and engineering diverse quantum resources for applications in quantum information technology.</description>

      <title>The XYZ ruby code: Making a case for a three-colored graphical calculus for quantum error correction in spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analyzing and developing new quantum error-correcting schemes is one of the most prominent tasks in quantum computing research. In such efforts, introducing time dynamics explicitly in both analysis and design of error-correcting protocols constitutes an important cornerstone. In this work, we present a graphical formalism based on tensor networks to capture the logical action and error-correcting capabilities of any Clifford circuit with Pauli measurements. We showcase the formalism on new Floquet codes derived from topological subsystem codes, which we call XYZ ruby codes. Based on the projective symmetries of the building blocks of the tensor network we develop a framework of Pauli flows. Pauli flows allow for a graphical understanding of all quantities entering an error correction analysis of a circuit, including different types of QEC experiments, such as memory and stability experiments. We lay out how to derive a well-defined decoding problem from the tensor network representation of a protocol and its Pauli flows alone, independent of any stabilizer code or fixed circuit. Importantly, this framework applies to all Clifford protocols and encompasses both measurement- and circuit-based approaches to fault tolerance. We apply our method to our new family of dynamical codes which are in the same topological phase as the 2+1d color code, making them a promising candidate for low-overhead logical gates. In contrast to its static counterpart, the dynamical protocol applies a Z3 automorphism to the logical Pauli group every three timesteps. We highlight some of its topological properties and comment on the anyon physics behind a planar layout. Lastly, we benchmark the performance of the XYZ ruby code on a torus by performing both memory and stability experiments and find competitive circuit-level noise thresholds of 0.18%, comparable with other Floquet codes and 2+1d color codes.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Train Long Short-Term Memory: Application on Flood Prediction Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flood prediction is a critical challenge in the context of climate change, with significant implications for ecosystem preservation, human safety, and infrastructure protection. In this study, we tackle this problem by applying the Quantum-Train (QT) technique to a forecasting Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model trained by Quantum Machine Learning (QML) with significant parameter reduction. The QT technique, originally successful in the A Matter of Taste challenge at QHack 2024, leverages QML to reduce the number of trainable parameters to a polylogarithmic function of the number of parameters in a classical neural network (NN). This innovative framework maps classical NN weights to a Hilbert space, altering quantum state probability distributions to adjust NN parameters. Our approach directly processes classical data without the need for quantum embedding and operates independently of quantum computing resources post-training, making it highly practical and accessible for real-world flood prediction applications. This model aims to improve the efficiency of flood forecasts, ultimately contributing to better disaster preparedness and response.</description>

      <title>Lower $T$-count with faster algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Among the cost metrics characterizing a quantum circuit, the $T$-count stands out as one of the most crucial as its minimization is particularly important in various areas of quantum computation such as fault-tolerant quantum computing and quantum circuit simulation. In this work, we contribute to the $T$-count reduction problem by proposing efficient $T$-count optimizers with low execution times. In particular, we greatly improve the complexity of TODD, an algorithm currently providing the best $T$-count reduction on various quantum circuits. We also propose some modifications to the algorithm which are leading to a significantly lower number of $T$ gates. In addition, we propose another algorithm which has an even lower complexity and that achieves a better or equal $T$-count than the state of the art on most quantum circuits evaluated. We also prove that the number of $T$ gates in the circuit obtained after executing our algorithms on a Hadamard-free circuit composed of $n$ qubits is upper bounded by $n(n + 1)/2 + 1$, which is the best known upper bound achievable in polynomial time. From this we derive an upper bound of $(n + 1)(n + 2h)/2 + 1$ for the number of $T$ gates in a Clifford$+T$ circuit where $h$ is the number of internal Hadamard gates in the circuit, i.e.\ the number of Hadamard gates lying between the first and the last $T$ gate of the circuit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adaptive variational quantum algorithms arguably offer the best prospects for quantum advantage in the NISQ era. Since the inception of the first such algorithm, ADAPT-VQE, many improvements have appeared in the literature. We combine the key improvements along with a novel operator pool -- which we term Coupled Exchange Operator (CEO) pool -- to assess the cost of running state-of-the-art ADAPT-VQE on hardware in terms of measurement counts and circuit depth. We show a dramatic reduction of these quantum resources compared to the early versions of the algorithm. We also find that our state-of-the-art CEO-ADAPT-VQE outperforms UCCSD, the most widely regarded static VQE ansatz, in all relevant metrics.</description>

Abstract: We numerically investigate the robustness against various perturbations of measurement-induced phase transition in monitored quantum Ising models in the no-click limit, where the dynamics is described by a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. We study perturbations that break the integrability and/or the symmetry of the model, as well as modifications in the measurement protocol, characterizing the resulting chaos and lack of integrability through the Dissipative Spectral Form Factor (DSFF). We show that while the measurement-induced phase transition and its properties appear to be broadly insensitive to lack of integrability and breaking of the $\mathbb{Z_2}$ symmetry, a modification of the measurement basis from the transverse to the longitudinal direction makes the phase transition disappear altogether.</description>

Abstract: In three dimensions, there is a nontrivial quantum cellular automaton (QCA) which disentangles the three-fermion Walker--Wang model, a model whose action depends on Stiefel--Whitney classes of the spacetime manifold. Here we present a conjectured generalization to higher dimensions. For an arbitrary symmetry protected topological phase of time reversal whose action depends on Stiefel--Whitney classes, we construct a corresponding QCA that we conjecture disentangles that phase. Some of our QCA are Clifford, and we relate these to a classification theorem of Clifford QCA. We identify Clifford QCA in $4m+1$ dimensions, for which we find a low-depth circuit description using non-Clifford gates but not with Clifford gates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Entanglement asymmetry is a measure of symmetry breaking in quantum subsystems, inspired by quantum information theory, particularly suited to study out-of-equilibrium states. We study the entanglement asymmetry of a class of excited "coherent states" in conformal quantum field theories with a U(1) symmetry, employing Euclidean path-integral methods with topological symmetry defects and the replica formalism. We compute, at leading order in perturbation theory, the asymmetry for a variety of subsystems, including finite spherical subregions in flat space, in finite volume, and at positive temperature. We also study its Lorentzian time evolution, showcasing the dynamical restoration of the symmetry due to thermalization, as well as the presence of a quantum Mpemba effect. Our results are universal, and apply in any number of dimensions. We also show that the perturbative entanglement asymmetry is related to the Fisher information metric, which has a known holographic dual called Hollands-Wald canonical energy, and that it is captured by the AdS bulk charge contained in the entanglement wedge.</description>

      <title>A tractable model of monitored fermions with conserved $\mathrm{U}(1)$ charge</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08045v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study measurement-induced phases of free fermion systems with U(1) symmetry. Following a recent approach developed for Majorana chains, we derive a field theory description for the purity and bipartite entanglement at large space and time scales. We focus on a multi-flavor one-dimensional chain with random complex hoppings and continuous monitoring of the local fermion density. By means of the replica trick, and using the number of flavors as a large parameter controlling our approximations, we derive an effective field theory made up of a SU(N) non-linear sigma model (NL$\sigma$M) coupled to fluctuating hydrodynamics. Contrary to the case of non-interacting Majorana fermions, displaying no U(1) symmetry, we find that the bipartite entanglement entropy satisfies an area law for all monitoring rates, but with a nontrivial scaling of entanglement when the correlation length is large. We provide numerical evidence supporting our claims. We briefly show how imposing a reality condition on the hoppings can change the NL$\sigma$M and also discuss higher dimensional generalizations.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08048v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of counting and classifying symmetric informationally complete positive operator-valued measures (SICs or SIC-POVMs), that is, sets of $d^2$ equiangular lines in $\mathbb{C}^d$. For $4 \leq d \leq 90$, we show the number of known equivalence classes of Weyl--Heisenberg covariant SICs in dimension $d$ equals the cardinality of the ideal class monoid of (not necessarily invertible) ideal classes in the real quadratic order of discriminant $(d+1)(d-3)$. Equivalently, this is the number of $\mathbf{GL}_2(\mathbb{Z})$ conjugacy classes in $\mathbf{SL}_2(\mathbb{Z})$ of trace $d-1$. We conjecture the equality extends to all $d \geq 4$. We prove that this conjecture implies more that one equivalence class of Weyl--Heisenberg covariant SICs for every $d &gt; 22$.
  Additionally, we refine the "class field hypothesis" of Appleby, Flammia, McConnell, and Yard (arXiv:1604.06098) to predict the exact class field generated by the ratios of vector entries for the equiangular lines defining a Weyl--Heisenberg covariant SIC. The class fields conjecturally associated to SICs in dimension $d$ come with a natural partial order under inclusion; we show that the natural inclusions of these fields are strict, except in a small family of cases.</description>

      <title>Generalized flux trajectories: New insights into partially coherent Airy beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The propagation of Airy beams in free space is characterized by being non dispersive, which warrants the shape invariance of their intensity distribution, and self-accelerating along the transverse direction. These distinctive traits are still present in partially coherent Airy beams as long as the reach of their back tail (and hence their energy content) is not importantly reduced. To investigate the effects associated with the decrease of the beam coherence and its power content (by smoothly reducing the reach of their back tails), here we introduce a novel and insightful methodology based on a generalization of the concept of flux trajectory for paraxial partially coherent beams. This methodologies emphasizes the role of phase relations, thus helping to clarify why and how the beam smears out spatially along its propagation. This formalism, though, is general enough to tackle other types of structured light beams with whatever degree of partial coherence, from full coherence to total incoherence.</description>

      <title>Uncovering Emergent Spacetime Supersymmetry with Rydberg Atom Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the zoo of emergent symmetries in quantum many-body physics, the previously unrealized emergent spacetime supersymmetry (SUSY) is particularly intriguing. Although it was known that spacetime SUSY could emerge at the (1+1)d tricritical Ising transition, an experimental realization is still absent. In this letter, we propose to realize the tricritical Ising transition with Rydberg atom arrays, taking advantage of the reconfigurability of these systems. In such systems, the spacetime SUSY manifests itself in the respective correlation functions of a bosonic mode and its fermionic partner. However, the correlation function of the fermionic mode inevitably involves a string operator, making direct measurement challenging in the conventional setting. Here, we utilize the analog--digital hybrid nature of the Rydberg atom arrays, which can simulate a physical Hamiltonian and perform a digital quantum circuit on the same platform, to measure the correlation function of the fermionic mode. This hybridized protocol provides an experimentally feasible way to reveal the hidden structure of the spacetime SUSY that emerges at the tricritical Ising transition.</description>

      <title>Quantum Thermodynamic Integrability for Foundations of Statistical Physics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the Carath\'eodory principle of the Second Law to quantum thermodynamics with energy levels depending on macroscopic variables, such as volume and magnetic field. This extension introduces the concept of Quantum Thermodynamic Integrability (QTI), offering an alternative foundation for statistical mechanics. QTI is characterized by the path-independence of work and heat within the thermodynamic manifold, which is locally described by energy levels and specific thermodynamic parameters. Within this framework, temperature naturally emerges as an integrating factor, allowing for the derivation of both canonical and non-canonical distributions from the Entropy Integrable Equations (EIE) based on QTI. Notably, non-canonical states, which become particularly significant outside the thermodynamic limit, reveal the existence of informational correlations in finite-size thermodynamic systems.</description>

      <title>Dynamically assisted pair production enhancement by combined multiple potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08355v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new Sauter-like field model with combinatorial multiple potentials consisting of a deep slow-varying and some shallow fast-varying potentials. The dynamically assisted Sauter-Schwinger effect on the pair production is found by using the computational quantum field theory. The enhanced pair production is found to be significant at about one order increasing for multiple potentials rather than single potential. In case of dominated by Schwinger mechanism, the obvious time effect leads to electrons concentrating at the two edges of the potential, meanwhile, the momentum locates at the zero nearby. In contrary, however, for the multiphoton processes, the pair generation makes the electrons distributing outside the potential and the momentum appearing multiple peaks far away from zero and evenly evolving toward a step-like structure. An interesting finding is that the particles of pair produced in the alternating potential has a quasi-monoenergetic structure compared to the oscillating potential well or/and potential barrier, which is helpful to achieve the high quality positron source.</description>

      <title>Mirror-induced effects in cavity polaritonics: influence on edge states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical cavities are widely used to induce strong light-matter coupling and thereby enable the presence of polaritons. While polaritons are at the source of most of the observed physics, the mirrors forming the cavity may also themselves be responsible for a number of phenomena, independently of the strong light-matter coupling regime. Here, we use a toy model of a chain of dipolar emitters coupled to a cuboidal cavity. We unveil several effects originating solely from the boundary conditions imposed by the cavity mirrors, that are dominant when the distances of the emitters to the cavity walls are of the order of the interdipole separation. In particular, we show that mirrors in the direction transverse to the chain may act as effective defects, leading to the emergence of Tamm edge states. Considering a topological chain, we demonstrate that such transverse mirrors may also protect edge states against the effects of the strong light-matter coupling. Finally, we find that mirrors parallel to the chain, by the image charges they involve, induce topological phase transitions even in the case of highly off-resonant photons.</description>

      <title>Quantized area of the Schwarzschild black hole: A non-hermitian perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08358v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work our aim is to link Bekenstein's quantized form of the area of the event horizon to the Hamiltonian of the non-Hermitian Swanson oscillator which is known to be parity-time-symmetric. We achieve this by employing a similarity transformation that maps the non-Hermitian quantum system to a scaled harmonics oscillator. To this end, we consider the unconstrained reduced Hamiltonian which is directly expressed in terms of the Schwarzschild mass and implies a periodic character for the conjugate momentum (which represents the asymptotic time coordinate), the period being the inverse Hawking temperature. This leads to the quantization of the event-horizon area in terms of the harmonic oscillator levels. Next, in the framework of the Swanson oscillator model, we proceed to derive novel expressions for the corresponding Hawking temperature and black hole entropy.</description>

      <title>Non-maximal entanglement of photons from positron-electron annihilation demonstrated using a novel plastic PET scanner</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08574v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the state-of-the-art Positron Emission Tomography (PET), information about the polarization of annihilation photons is not available. Current PET systems track molecules labeled with positron-emitting radioisotopes by detecting the propagation direction of two photons from positron-electron annihilation. However, annihilation photons carry more information than just the site where they originated. Here we present a novel J-PET scanner built from plastic scintillators, in which annihilation photons interact predominantly via the Compton effect, providing information about photon polarization in addition to information on photon direction of propagation. Theoretically, photons from the decay of positronium in a vacuum are maximally entangled in polarization. However, in matter, when the positron from positronium annihilates with the electron bound to the atom, the question arises whether the photons from such annihilation are maximally entangled. In this work, we determine the distribution of the relative angle between polarization orientations of two photons from positron-electron annihilation in a porous polymer. Contrary to prior results for positron annihilation in aluminum and copper, where the strength of observed correlations is as expected for maximally entangled photons, our results show a significant deviation. We demonstrate that in porous polymer, photon polarization correlation is weaker than for maximally entangled photons but stronger than for separable photons. The data indicate that more than 40% of annihilations in Amberlite resin lead to a non-maximally entangled state. Our result indicates the degree of correlation depends on the annihilation mechanism and the molecular arrangement. We anticipate that the introduced Compton interaction-based PET system opens a promising perspective for exploring polarization correlations in PET as a novel diagnostic indicator.</description>

Abstract: A system of one electron in a Coulomb potential in an optical cavity is solved using a tensor-product light-matter basis. The problem was treated at the level of the Pauli-Fierz Hamiltonian describing both light and matter quantum mechanically. The effect of cavity size on the energy levels and high harmonics generation (HHG) spectrum is studied. We have shown that the energy levels, transition states, entanglement, and the HHG spectrum can be strongly influenced by changing the cavity size.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mixtures of ultracold gases with long-range interactions are expected to open new avenues in the study of quantum matter. Natural candidates for this research are spin mixtures of atomic species with large magnetic moments. However, the lifetime of such assemblies can be strongly affected by the dipolar relaxation that occurs in spin-flip collisions. Here we present experimental results for a mixture composed of the two lowest Zeeman states of $^{162}$Dy atoms, that act as dark states with respect to a light-induced quadratic Zeeman effect. We show that, due to an interference phenomenon, the rate for such inelastic processes is dramatically reduced with respect to the Wigner threshold law. Additionally, we determine the scattering lengths characterizing the s-wave interaction between these states, providing all necessary data to predict the miscibility range of the mixture, depending on its dimensionality.</description>

Abstract: Gate-set tomography (GST) characterizes the process matrix of quantum logic gates, along with measurement and state preparation errors in quantum processors. GST typically requires extensive data collection and significant computational resources for model estimation. We propose a more efficient GST approach for qudits, utilizing the qudit Hadamard and virtual Z gates to construct fiducials while assuming virtual Z gates are error-free. Our method reduces the computational costs of estimating characterization results, making GST more practical at scale. We experimentally demonstrate the applicability of this approach on a superconducting transmon qutrit.</description>

      <title>Bohmian analysis of dark solutions in interfering Bose-Einstein condensates: The dynamical role of underlying velocity fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.13175v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the last decades, the experimental research on Bose-Einstein interferometry has received much attention due to promising technological implications. This has thus motivated the development of numerical simulations aimed at solving the time-dependent Gross-Pitaevskii equation and its reduced one-dimensional version to better understand the development of interference-type features and the subsequent soliton dynamics. In this work, Bohmian mechanics is considered as an additional tool to further explore and analyze the formation and evolution in real time of the soliton arrays that follow the merging of two condensates. An alternative explanation is thus provided in terms of an underlying dynamical velocity field, directly linked to the local phase variations undergone by the condensate along its evolution. Although the reduced one-dimensional model is considered here, it still captures the essence of the phenomenon, rendering a neat picture of the full evolution without diminishing the generality of the description. To better appreciate the subtleties of free versus bound dynamics, two cases are discussed. First, the soliton dynamics exhibited by a coherent superposition of two freely released condensates is studied, discussing the peculiarities of the underlying velocity field and the corresponding flux trajectories in terms of both the peak-to-peak distance between the two initial clouds and the addition of a phase difference between them. In the latter case, an interesting correspondence with the well-known Aharonov-Bohm effect is found. Then, the recurrence dynamics displayed by the more general case of two condensates released from the two opposite turning points of a harmonic trap is considered in terms of the distance between such turning points.

      <title>Learning a quantum channel from its steady-state</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.06517v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a scalable method for learning local quantum channels using local expectation values measured on a single state -- their steady state. Our method is inspired by the algorithms for learning local Hamiltonians from their ground states. For it to succeed, the steady state must be non-trivial, and therefore the channel needs to be non-unital. Such non-unital channels are readily implementable on present day quantum computers using mid-circuit measurements or RESET gates. We demonstrate that the full structure of such channels is encoded in their steady states, and can be learned efficiently using only the expectation values of local observables on these states. We emphasize two immediate applications to illustrate our approach: (i) Using engineered dissipative dynamics, we offer a straightforward way to assess the accuracy of a given noise model in a regime where all qubits are actively utilized for a significant duration. (ii) Given a parameterized noise model for the entire system, our method can learn its underlying parameters. We demonstrate both applications using numerical simulations and experimental trials conducted on an IBMQ machine.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.14038v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An issue which has attracted increasing attention in contemporary researches are Kirkwood--Dirac quasiprobabilities. List of their use includes many questions of quantum physics. Applications of complex tight frames in quantum information science were recently demonstrated. It is shown in this paper that quasiprobabilities naturally appear in the context of unravelings of a quantum channel. Using vectors of the given tight frame to build principal Kraus operators generates quasiprobabilities with interesting properties. For an equiangular tight frame, we characterize the Hilbert--Schmidt and spectral norms of the matrix consisted of quasiprobabilities. Hence, novel uncertainty relations in terms of R\'{e}nyi and Tsallis entropies are obtained. New inequalities for characterizing the location of eigenvalues are derived. They give an alternative to estimating on the base of Ger\v{s}gorin's theorem. A utility of the presented inequalities is exemplified with symmetric informationally complete measurement in dimension two.</description>

Abstract: We present a general way of quantifying the entropic uncertainty of quantum field configurations in phase space in terms of entropic distinguishability with respect to the vacuum. Our approach is based on the functional Husimi $Q$-distribution and a suitably chosen relative entropy, which we show to be non-trivially bounded from above by the uncertainty principle. The resulting relative entropic uncertainty relation is as general as the concept of coherent states and thus holds for quantum fields of bosonic and fermionic type. Its simple form enables diverse applications, among which we present a complete characterization of the uncertainty surplus of arbitrary states in terms of the total particle number for a scalar field and the fermionic description of the Ising model. Moreover, we provide a quantitative interpretation of the role of the uncertainty principle for quantum phase transitions.</description>

      <title>QAOA Performance in Noisy Devices: The Effect of Classical Optimizers and Ansatz Depth</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.10149v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is a variational quantum algorithm for Near-term Intermediate-Scale Quantum computers (NISQ) providing approximate solutions for combinatorial optimiz\-ation problems. The QAOA utilizes a quantum-classical loop, consisting of a quantum ansatz and a classical optimizer, to minimize some cost function, computed on the quantum device. This paper presents an investigation into the impact of realistic noise on the classical optimizer and the determination of optimal circuit depth for the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) in the presence of noise. We find that, while there is no significant difference in the performance of classical optimizers in a state vector simulation, the Adam and AMSGrad optimizers perform best in the presence of shot noise. Under the conditions of real noise, the SPSA optimizer, along with ADAM and AMSGrad, emerge as the top performers. The study also reveals that the quality of solutions to some 5 qubit minimum vertex cover problems increases for up to around six layers in the QAOA circuit, after which it begins to decline. This analysis shows that increasing the number of layers in the QAOA in an attempt to increase accuracy may not work well in a noisy device.</description>

      <title>Maximal intrinsic randomness of a quantum state</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.15708v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the most counterintuitive aspects of quantum theory is its claim that there is 'intrinsic' randomness in the physical world. Quantum information science has greatly progressed in the study of intrinsic, or secret, quantum randomness in the past decade. With much emphasis on device-independent and semi-device-independent bounds, one of the most basic questions has escaped attention: how much intrinsic randomness can be extracted from a given state $\rho$, and what measurements achieve this bound? We answer this question for three different randomness quantifiers: the conditional min-entropy, the conditional von Neumann entropy and the conditional max-entropy. For the first, we solve the min-max problem of finding the projective measurement that minimises the maximal guessing probability of an eavesdropper. The result is that one can guarantee an amount of conditional min-entropy $H^*_{\textrm{min}}=-\log_2 P_{\textrm{guess}}^{*}(\rho)$ with $P_{\textrm{guess}}^{*}(\rho)=\frac{1}{d}(\textrm{tr} \sqrt{\rho})^2$ by performing suitable projective measurements. For the conditional von Neumann entropy, we find that the maximal value is $H^{*}= \log_{2}d-S(\rho)$, with $S(\rho)$ the von Neumann entropy of $\rho$, while for the conditional max-entropy, we find the maximal value $H^{*}_\textrm{max}=\log_{2}d + \log_{2}\lambda_{\textrm{max}}(\rho)$, where $\lambda_{\textrm{max}}(\rho)$ is the largest eigenvalue of $\rho$. Optimal values for $H^{*}_{\textrm{min}}$, $H^{*}$ and $H^{*}_\textrm{max}$ are achieved by measuring in any basis that is unbiased to the eigenbasis of $\rho$, as well as by other, less intuitive, measurements.</description>

      <title>Interpolating Parametrized Quantum Circuits using Blackbox Queries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.04396v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article focuses on developing classical surrogates for parametrized quantum circuits using interpolation via (trigonometric) polynomials. We develop two algorithms for the construction of such surrogates and prove performance guarantees. The constructions are based on circuit evaluations which are blackbox in the sense that no structural specifics of the circuits are exploited. While acknowledging the limitations of the blackbox approach compared to whitebox evaluations, which exploit specific circuit properties, we demonstrate scenarios in which the blackbox approach might prove beneficial. Sample applications include but are not restricted to the approximation of VQEs and the alleviaton of the barren plateau problem.</description>

      <title>Angular Momentum Flows without anything carrying it</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.07568v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transfer of conserved quantities between two remote regions is generally assumed to be a rather trivial process: a flux of particles carrying the conserved quantities propagates from one region to another. We however demonstrate a flow of angular momentum from one region to another across a region of space in which there is a vanishingly small probability of any particles (or fields) being present. This shows that the usual view of how conservation laws work needs to be revisited.</description>

Abstract: Quantum acoustics -- a recently developed framework parallel to quantum optics -- establishesa nonperturbative and coherent treatment of the electron-phonon interaction in real space. The quantum-acoustical representation reveals a displaced Drude peak hid ing in plain sight within the venerable Fr\"ohlich model: the optical conductivity exhibits a finite frequency maximum in the far-infrared range and the d.c. conductivity is suppressed. Our results elucidate the origin of the high-temperature absorption peaks in strange or bad metals, revealing that dynamical lattice disorder steers the system towards a non-Drude behavior</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.08495v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a faithful translation of a two-player quantum Morra game, which builds on previous work by including the classical game as a special case. We propose a natural deformation of the game in the quantum regime in which Alice has a winning advantage, breaking the balance of the classical game. A Nash equilibrium can be found in some cases by employing a pure strategy, which is impossible in the classical game where a mixed strategy is always required. We prepared our states using photonic qubits on a linear optics setup, with an average deviation less than 2% with respect to the measured outcome probabilities. Finally, we discuss potential applications of the quantum Morra game to the study of quantum information and communication.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.05732v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A full-fledged quantum network relies on the formation of entangled links between remote location with the help of quantum repeaters. The famous Duan-Lukin-Cirac-Zoller quantum repeater protocol is based on long distance single-photon interference, which not only requires high phase stability but also cannot generate maximally entangled state. Here, we propose a quantum repeater protocol using the idea of post-matching, which retains the same efficiency as the single-photon interference protocol, reduces the phase-stability requirement and can generate maximally entangled state in principle. We also outline an implementation of our scheme based on the Kerr nonlinear resonator. Numerical simulations show that our protocol has its superiority by comparing with existing protocols under a generic noise model and show the feasibility of building a large-scale quantum communication network with our scheme. We believe our work represents a crucial step towards the construction of a fully-connected quantum network.</description>

      <title>Quantum Generative Diffusion Model: A Fully Quantum-Mechanical Model for Generating Quantum State Ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07039v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Classical diffusion models have shown superior generative results. Exploring them in the quantum domain can advance the field of quantum generative learning. This work introduces Quantum Generative Diffusion Model (QGDM) as their simple and elegant quantum counterpart. Through a non-unitary forward process, any target quantum state can be transformed into a completely mixed state that has the highest entropy and maximum uncertainty about the system. A trainable backward process is used to recover the former from the latter. The design requirements for its backward process includes non-unitarity and small parameter count. We introduce partial trace operations to enforce non-unitary and reduce the number of trainable parameters by using a parameter-sharing strategy and incorporating temporal information as an input in the backward process. We present QGDM's resource-efficient version to reduce auxiliary qubits while preserving generative capabilities. QGDM exhibits faster convergence than Quantum Generative Adversarial Network (QGAN) because its adopted convex-based optimization can result in faster convergence. The results of comparing it with QGAN demonstrate its effectiveness in generating both pure and mixed quantum states. It can achieve 53.02% higher fidelity in mixed-state generation than QGAN. The results highlight its great potential to tackle challenging quantum generation tasks.</description>

      <title>Reductive Quantum Phase Estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04471v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Estimating a quantum phase is a necessary task in a wide range of fields of quantum science. To accomplish this task, two well-known methods have been developed in distinct contexts, namely, Ramsey interferometry (RI) in atomic and molecular physics and quantum phase estimation (QPE) in quantum computing. We demonstrate that these canonical examples are instances of a larger class of phase estimation protocols, which we call reductive quantum phase estimation (RQPE) circuits. Here we present an explicit algorithm that allows one to create an RQPE circuit. This circuit distinguishes an arbitrary set of phases with a fewer number of qubits and unitary applications, thereby solving a general class of quantum hypothesis testing to which RI and QPE belong. We further demonstrate a trade-off between measurement precision and phase distinguishability, which allows one to tune the circuit to be optimal for a specific application.</description>

      <title>A thermodynamically consistent approach to the energy costs of quantum measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16037v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Considering a general microscopic model for a quantum measuring apparatus comprising a quantum probe coupled to a thermal bath, we analyze the energetic resources necessary for the realization of a quantum measurement, which includes the creation of system-apparatus correlations, the irreversible transition to a statistical mixture of definite outcomes, and the apparatus resetting. Crucially, we do not resort to another quantum measurement to capture the emergence of objective measurement results, but rather exploit the properties of the thermal bath which redundantly records the measurement result in its degrees of freedom, naturally implementing the paradigm of quantum Darwinism. In practice, this model allows us to perform a quantitative thermodynamic analysis for the measurement process. From the expression of the second law, we show how the minimal required work depends on the energy variation of the system being measured plus information-theoretic quantities characterizing the performance of the measurement -- efficiency and completeness. Additionally, we show that it is possible to perform a thermodynamically reversible measurement, thus reaching the minimal work expenditure, and provide the corresponding protocol. Finally, for finite-time measurement protocols, we illustrate the increasing work cost induced by rising entropy production inherent of finite-time thermodynamic processes. This highlights an emerging trade-off between velocity of the measurement and work cost, on top of a trade-off between efficiency of the measurement and work cost.</description>

      <title>Achieving Quantum Limits of Exoplanet Detection and Localization</title>

Abstract: Discovering exoplanets in orbit around distant stars via direct imaging is fundamentally impeded by the high dynamic range between the star and the planet. Coronagraphs strive to increase the signal-to-noise ratio of exoplanet signatures by optically rejecting light from the host star while leaving light from the exoplanet mostly unaltered. However it is unclear whether coronagraphs constitute an optimal strategy for attaining fundamental limits relevant exoplanet discovery. In this work, we report the quantum information limits of exoplanet detection and localization specified by the Quantum Chernoff Exponent (QCE) and the Quantum Fisher Information Matrix (QFIM) respectively. In view of these quantum limits, we assess and compare several high-performance coronagraph designs that theoretically achieve total rejection of an on-axis point source. We find that systems which exclusively eliminate the fundamental mode of the telescope, without attenuating higher-order orthogonal modes, are quantum-optimal in the regime of high star-planet contrasts. Importantly, the QFIM is shown to persist well below the diffraction-limit of the telescope, suggesting that quantum-optimal coronagraphs may further expand the domain of accessible exoplanets.</description>

      <title>Arrival Times Versus Detection Times</title>

Abstract: How to compute the probability distribution of a detection time, i.e., of the time which a detector registers as the arrival time of a quantum particle, is a long-debated problem. In this regard, Bohmian mechanics provides in a straightforward way the distribution of the time at which the particle actually does arrive at a given surface in 3-space in the absence of detectors. However, as we discuss here, since the presence of detectors can change the evolution of the wave function and thus the particle trajectories, it cannot be taken for granted that the arrival time of the Bohmian trajectories in the absence of detectors agrees with the one in the presence of detectors, and even less with the detection time. In particular, we explain why certain distributions that Das and D\"urr [arXiv:1802.07141] presented as the distribution of the detection time in a case with spin, based on assuming that all three times mentioned coincide, is actually not what Bohmian mechanics predicts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15148v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fault-tolerant quantum computation requires low physical-qubit gate errors. Many approaches exist to reduce gate errors, including both hardware- and control-optimization strategies. Dynamically corrected gates are designed to cancel specific errors and offer the potential for high-fidelity gates, but they have yet to be implemented in singlet-triplet spin qubits in semiconductor quantum dots, due in part to the stringent control constraints in these systems. In this work, we experimentally implement dynamically corrected gates designed to mitigate hyperfine noise in a singlet-triplet qubit realized in a Si/SiGe double quantum dot. The corrected gates reduce infidelities by about a factor of three, resulting in gate fidelities above 0.99 for both identity and Hadamard gates. The gate performances depend sensitively on pulse distortions, and their specific performance reveals an unexpected distortion in our experimental setup.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15947v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Strong quantum-correlated sources are essential but delicate resources for quantum information science and engineering protocols. Decoherence and loss are the two main disruptive processes that lead to the loss of nonclassical behavior in quantum correlations. In quantum systems, scattering can contribute to both decoherence and loss. In this work, we present an experimental scheme capable of significantly mitigating the adverse impact of scattering in quantum systems. Our quantum system is composed of a two-mode squeezed light generated with the four-wave mixing process in hot rubidium vapor, and a scatterer is introduced to one of the two modes. An integrating sphere is then placed after the scatterer to recollect the scattered photons. We use mutual information between the two modes as the measure of quantum correlations, and demonstrate a 47.5% mutual information recovery from scattering, despite an enormous photon loss of greater than 85%. Our scheme is a pioneering step towards recovering quantum correlations from disruptive random processes, thus has the potential to bridge the gap between proof-of-principle demonstrations and practical real-world deployments of quantum protocols.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08882v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce SA-DQAS in this paper, a novel framework that enhances the gradient-based Differentiable Quantum Architecture Search (DQAS) with a self-attention mechanism, aimed at optimizing circuit design for Quantum Machine Learning (QML) challenges. Analogous to a sequence of words in a sentence, a quantum circuit can be viewed as a sequence of placeholders containing quantum gates. Unlike DQAS, each placeholder is independent, while the self-attention mechanism in SA-DQAS helps to capture relation and dependency information among each operation candidate placed on placeholders in a circuit. To evaluate and verify, we conduct experiments on job-shop scheduling problems (JSSP), Max-cut problems, and quantum fidelity. Incorporating self-attention improves the stability and performance of the resulting quantum circuits and refines their structural design with higher noise resilience and fidelity. Our research demonstrates the first successful integration of self-attention with DQAS.</description>

      <title>High-Entanglement Capabilities for Variational Quantum Algorithms: The Poisson Equation Case</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10156v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The discretized Poisson equation matrix (DPEM) is vital to the field of computational fluid dynamics (CFD), and an algorithm that solves it on a quantum computer could potentially grant exponential space and time complexity speedups. However, the DPEM in 1D has been shown to have trouble being represented as a decomposition in the Pauli basis. Additionally, traditional ansatz for Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) that are used to heuristically solve linear systems (such as the DPEM) have large numbers of parameters, making them harder to train. This research attempts to resolve these problems by utilizing the IonQ Aria quantum computer capabilities that boast all-to-all connectivity of qubits. We propose a decomposition of the DPEM that is based on 2- or 3-qubit entanglement gates and is shown to have $O(1)$ terms with respect to system size, with one term having an $O(n^2)$ circuit depth and the rest having only an $O(1)$ circuit depth (where $n$ is the number of qubits defining the system size). To test these new improvements, we ran numerical simulations to examine how well the VQAs performed with varying system sizes, showing that the new setup offers an $O(n)$ scaling of the number of iterations required for convergence, providing an exponential speedup over their classical computing counterparts. This project shows that the future of computational fluid dynamics may involve quantum computers to provide significant time and space complexity speedups.</description>

      <title>QC-Forest: a Classical-Quantum Algorithm to Provably Speedup Retraining of Random Forest</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12008v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Random Forest (RF) is a popular tree-ensemble method for supervised learning, prized for its ease of use and flexibility. Online RF models require to account for new training data to maintain model accuracy. This is particularly important in applications where data is periodically and sequentially generated over time in data streams, such as auto-driving systems, and credit card payments. In this setting, performing periodic model retraining with the old and new data accumulated is beneficial as it fully captures possible drifts in the data distribution over time. However, this is unpractical with state-of-the-art classical algorithms for RF as they scale linearly with the accumulated number of samples. We propose QC-Forest, a classical-quantum algorithm designed to time-efficiently retrain RF models in the streaming setting for multi-class classification and regression, achieving a runtime poly-logarithmic in the total number of accumulated samples. QC-Forest leverages Des-q, a quantum algorithm for single tree construction and retraining proposed by Kumar et al. by expanding to multi-class classification, as the original proposal was limited to binary classes, and introducing an exact classical method to replace an underlying quantum subroutine incurring a finite error, while maintaining the same poly-logarithmic dependence. Finally, we showcase that QC-Forest achieves competitive accuracy in comparison to state-of-the-art RF methods on widely used benchmark datasets with up to 80,000 samples, while significantly speeding up the model retrain.</description>

Abstract: Quantum machine learning (QML) requires significant quantum resources to achieve quantum advantage. Research should prioritize both the efficient design of quantum architectures and the development of learning strategies to optimize resource usage. We propose a framework called quantum curriculum learning (Q-CurL) for quantum data, where the curriculum introduces simpler tasks or data to the learning model before progressing to more challenging ones. We define the curriculum criteria based on the data density ratio between tasks to determine the curriculum order. We also implement a dynamic learning schedule to emphasize the significance of quantum data in optimizing the loss function. Empirical evidence shows that Q-CurL significantly enhances the training convergence and the generalization for unitary learning tasks and improves the robustness of quantum phase recognition tasks. Our framework provides a general learning strategy, bringing QML closer to realizing practical advantages.</description>

Abstract: Entangled photon sources (EPSs) are pivotal in advancing quantum communication, computing and sensing. The demand for deploying efficient, robust EPSs in the field, characterized by exceptional (phase) stability, has become increasingly apparent. This work introduces a polarization-entangled photon source, leveraging type-0 spontaneous parametric down-conversion, and constructed using commercial bulk optomechanical components. Our system is versatile, enabling the generation of N00N states for sensing applications or Bell states for quantum key distribution protocols. We attained a maximal Bell inequality violation, with the average entanglement visibility exceeding 99% . The potential for further performance enhancements is also explored.</description>

      <title>Majorana Tensor Decomposition: A unifying framework for decompositions of fermionic Hamiltonians to Linear Combination of Unitaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06571v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Linear combination of unitaries (LCU) decompositions have appeared as one of the main tools for encoding operators on quantum computers, allowing efficient implementations of arbitrary operators. In particular, LCU approaches present a way of encoding information from the electronic structure Hamiltonian into a quantum circuit. Over the past years, many different decomposition techniques have appeared for the electronic structure Hamiltonian. Here we present the Majorana Tensor Decomposition (MTD), a framework that unifies existing LCUs and offers novel decomposition methods by using popular low-rank tensor factorizations.</description>

      <title>Realization of Conditional Operations through Transition Pathway Engineering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06687v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the NISQ era, achieving large-scale quantum computing demands compact circuits to mitigate decoherence and gate error accumulation. Quantum operations with diverse degrees of freedom hold promise for circuit compression, but conventional approaches encounter challenges in simultaneously adjusting multiple parameters. Here, we propose a transition composite gate (TCG) scheme grounded on state-selective transition path engineering, enabling more expressive conditional operations. We experimentally validate a controlled unitary (CU) gate as an example, with independent and continuous parameters. By adjusting the parameters of $\rm X^{12}$ gate, we obtain the CU family with a fidelity range of 95.2% to 99.0% leveraging quantum process tomography (QPT). To demonstrate the capability of circuit compression, we use TCG scheme to prepare 3-qubit Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) and W states, with the fidelity of 96.77% and 95.72%. TCG can achieve the reduction in circuit depth of about 40% and 44% compared with the use of CZ gates only. Moreover, we show that short-path TCG (SPTCG) can further reduce the state-preparation circuit time cost. The TCG scheme exhibits advantages in certain quantum circuits and shows significant potential for large-scale quantum algorithms.</description>

      <title>Approximate Unitary $k$-Designs from Shallow, Low-Communication Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07876v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Random unitaries are useful in quantum information and related fields but hard to generate with limited resources. An approximate unitary $k$-design is an ensemble of unitaries and measure over which the average is close to a Haar (uniformly) random ensemble up to the first $k$ moments. A particularly strong notion of approximation bounds the distance from Haar randomness in relative error: the approximate design can be written as a convex combination involving an exact design and vice versa. We construct multiplicative-error approximate unitary $k$-design ensembles for which communication between subsystems is $O(1)$ in the system size. These constructions use the alternating projection method to analyze overlapping Haar twirls, giving a bound on the convergence speed to the full twirl with respect to the $2$-norm. Using von Neumann subalgebra indices to replace system dimension, the 2-norm distance converts to relative error without introducing any additional dimension dependence. Via recursion on these constructions, we construct a scheme yielding relative error designs in $O \big ( (k \log k + \log m + \log(1/\epsilon) ) k\, \text{polylog}(k) \big )$ depth, where $m$ is the number of qudits in the complete system and $\epsilon$ the approximation error. This sublinear depth construction answers one variant of [Harrow and Mehraban 2023, Open Problem 1]. Moreover, entanglement generated by the sublinear depth scheme follows area laws on spatial lattices up to corrections logarithmic in the full system size.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.05679v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that constraints imposed by strong Hilbert space fragmentation (HSF) along with the presence of certain global symmetries can ensure the reality of eigenspectra of non-Hermitian quantum systems; such a reality cannot be guaranteed by global symmetries alone. We demonstrate this insight for two interacting finite chains, namely the fermionic Nelson-Hatano and the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger models, none of which has a $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry. We show analytically that strong HSF and real spectrum are both consequences of the same dynamical constraints in the limit of large interaction, provided the systems have sufficient global symmetries. We also show that a local equal-time correlation function can detect the many-body exceptional point at a finite critical interaction strength above which the eigenspectrum is real.</description>

Abstract: Particle-particle correlations, characterized by Glauber's second-order correlation function,play an important role in the understanding of various phenomena in radio and optical astronomy, quantum and atom optics, particle physics, condensed matter physics, and quantum many-body theory. However, the relevance of such correlations to quantum thermodynamics has so far remained illusive. Here, we propose and investigate a class of quantum many-body thermal machines whose operation is directly enabled by second-order atom-atom correlations in an ultracold atomic gas. More specifically, we study quantum thermal machines that operate in a sudden interaction-quench Otto cycle and utilize a one-dimensional Lieb-Liniger gas of repulsively interacting bosons as the working fluid. The atom-atom correlations in such a gas are different to those of a classical ideal gas, and are a result of the interplay between interparticle interactions, quantum statistics, and thermal fluctuations. We show that operating these thermal machines in the intended regimes, such as a heat engine, refrigerator, thermal accelerator, or heater, would be impossible without such atom-atom correlations. Our results constitute a step forward in the design of conceptually new quantum thermodynamic devices which take advantage of uniquely quantum resources such as quantum coherence, correlations, and entanglement.</description>

      <title>Microscopic scale of quantum phase transitions: from doped semiconductors to spin chains, cold gases and moir\'e superlattices</title>

Abstract: In the vicinity of continuous quantum phase transitions (QPTs), quantum systems become scale-invariant and can be grouped into universality classes characterized by sets of critical exponents. We have found that despite scale-invariance and universality, the experimental data still contain information related to the microscopic processes and scales governing QPTs. We have found that for many systems, the scaled data near QPTs can be approximated by the generic exponential dependence introduced in the scaling theory of localization; this dependence includes as a parameter a microscopic seeding scale of the renormalization group, $L_0$. We have also conjectured that for interacting systems, the temperature cuts the renormalization group flow at the length travelled by a system-specific elementary excitation over the life-time set by the Planckian time, $\tau_P$=$\hbar/k_BT$. We have adapted this approach for QPTs in several systems and showed that $L_0$ extracted from experiment is comparable to physically-expected minimal length scales, namely (i) the mean free path for metal-insulator transition in doped semiconductor Si:B, (ii) the distance between spins in Heisenberg and Ising chains, (iii) the period of an optical lattice for cold atom boson gases, and (iv) the period of a moir\'e superlattice for the Mott QPT in dichalcogenide bilayers. The metal-insulator transition in Si:P has been explained using a non-interacting version of the model. In two companion papers, we show that in superconducting systems, $L_0$ is comparable to superconducting coherence length, and in quantum Hall systems, to the magnetic length. The developed new method of data analysis identifies microscopic processes leading to QPTs and quantitatively explains and unifies a large body of experimental data.</description>

      <title>Constraining Ultralight Dark Matter through an Accelerated Resonant Search</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.16600v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Experiments aimed at detecting ultralight dark matter typically rely on resonant effects, which are sensitive to the dark matter mass that matches the resonance frequency. In this study, we investigate the nucleon couplings of ultralight axion dark matter using a magnetometer operating in a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) mode. Our approach involves the use of a $^{21}$Ne spin-based sensor, which features the lowest nuclear magnetic moment among noble-gas spins. This configuration allows us to achieve an ultrahigh sensitivity of 0.73 fT/Hz$^{1/2}$ at around 5 Hz, corresponding to energy resolution of approximately 1.5$\times
  10^{-23}\,\rm{eV/Hz^{1/2}}$. Our analysis reveals that under certain conditions it is beneficial to scan the frequency with steps significantly larger than the resonance width. The analytical results are in agreement with experimental data and the scan strategy is potentially applicable to other resonant searches. Further, our study establishes stringent constraints on axion-like particles (ALP) in the 4.5--15.5 Hz Compton-frequency range coupling to neutrons and protons, improving on prior work by several-fold. Within a band around 4.6--6.6 Hz and around 7.5 Hz, our laboratory findings surpass astrophysical limits derived from neutron-star cooling. Hence, we demonstrate an accelerated resonance search for ultralight dark matter, achieving an approximately 30-fold increase in scanning step while maintaining competitive sensitivity.</description>

Abstract: Quantum tomography in high-energy physics processes has usually been restricted to the spin degrees of freedom. We address the case of top quark decays $t \to W b$, in which the orbital angular momentum ($L$) and the spins of $W$ and $b$ are intertwined into a 54-dimensional $LWb$ density operator. The entanglement between $L$ and the $W$ or $b$ spin is large and could be determined for decays of single top quarks produced at the Large Hadron Collider with Run 2 data. With the foreseen statistical and systematic uncertainties, the significance is well above $5\sigma$ from the separability hypothesis for $L$-$W$ entanglement, and $3.2\sigma$ for $L$-$b$. These would be the first entanglement measurements between orbital and spin angular momenta in high-energy physics. Likewise, the genuine tripartite entanglement between $L$ and the two spins could be established with more than $5\sigma$. The method presented paves the way for similar measurements in other processes.</description>

      <title>Theory of quasiparticle-induced errors in driven-dissipative Schr\"odinger cat qubits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15310v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the mechanisms of qubit decoherence is a crucial prerequisite for improving the qubit performance. In this work we discuss the effects of residual Bogolyubov quasiparticles in Schr\"odinger cat qubits, either of the dissipative or Kerr type. The major difference from previous studies of quasiparticles in superconducting qubits is that the Schr\"odinger cat qubits are operated under non-equilibrium conditions. Indeed, an external microwave drive is needed to stabilize "cat states", which are superpositions of coherent degenerate eigenstates of an effective stationary Lindbladian in the rotating frame. We present a microscopic derivation of the master equation for cat qubits and express the effect of the quasiparticles as dissipators acting on the density matrix of the cat qubit. This enables us to determine the conditions under which the quasiparticles give a substantial contribution to the qubit errors.</description>

      <title>Hilbert space fragmentation from lattice geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07825v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The eigenstate thermalization hypothesis describes how isolated many-body quantum systems reach thermal equilibrium. However, quantum many-body scars and Hilbert space fragmentation violate this hypothesis and cause nonthermal behavior. We demonstrate that Hilbert space fragmentation may arise from lattice geometry in a spin-1/2 model that conserves the number of domain walls. We generalize a known, one-dimensional, scarred model to larger dimensions and show that this model displays Hilbert space fragmentation on the Vicsek fractal lattice and the two-dimensional lattice. Using Monte Carlo methods, the model is characterized as strongly fragmented on the Vicsek fractal lattice when the number of domain walls is either small or close to the maximal value. On the two-dimensional lattice, the model is strongly fragmented when the density of domain walls is low and weakly fragmented when the density of domain walls is high. Furthermore, we show that the fragmentation persists at a finite density of domain walls in the thermodynamic limit for the Vicsek fractal lattice and the two-dimensional lattice. We also show that the model displays signatures similar to Hilbert space fragmentation on a section of the second-generation hexaflake fractal lattice and a modified two-dimensional lattice. We study the autocorrelation function of local observables and demonstrate that the model displays nonthermal dynamics.</description>

      <title>Probing spontaneously symmetry-broken phases with spin-charge separation through noise correlation measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08374v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spontaneously symmetry-broken (SSB) phases are locally ordered states of matter characterizing a large variety of physical systems. Because of their specific ordering, their presence is usually witnessed by means of local order parameters. Here, we propose an alternative approach based on statistical correlations of noise after the ballistic expansion of an atomic cloud. We indeed demonstrate that probing such noise correlators allows one to discriminate among different SSB phases characterized by spin-charge separation. As a particular example, we test our prediction on a 1D extended Fermi-Hubbard model, where the competition between local and nonlocal couplings gives rise to three different SSB phases: a charge density wave, a bond-ordering wave, and an antiferromagnet. Our numerical analysis shows that this approach can accurately capture the presence of these different SSB phases, thus representing an alternative and powerful strategy to characterize strongly interacting quantum matter.</description>

      <title>Quantum gravity signatures in gravitational wave detectors placed inside a harmonic trap potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18868v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we consider a general gravitational wave detector of gravitational wave interacting with an incoming gravitational wave carrying plus polarization only placed inside a harmonic trap. This model can be well acquainted with the description of a resonant detector of gravitational wave as well. The well known detector-gravitational wave interaction scenario uses the method of a semi classical approach where the detector is treated quantum mechanically but the gravitational wave is considered at a classical level. In our analysis, we use a discrete mode decomposition of the gravitational wave perturbation which results in a Hamiltonian involving the position and momentum operators corresponding to the gravitational wave and the harmonic oscillator. We have then calculated the transition probability for the harmonic oscillator-gravitational wave tensor product state for going from an initial state to some unknown final state. Using the energy flux relation of the gravitational waves, we observe that if we consider the total energy as a combination of the number of gravitons in the initial state of the detector then the transition probability for the resonant absorption case scenario takes the analytical form which is exactly similar to the semi-classical absorption case. In case of the emission scenario, we observe a spontaneous emission of a single graviton which was completely absent in the semi-classical analouge of this model. This therefore gives a direct signature of linearized quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Modulating Relaxation Time in Boundary-Dissipative Systems via Bond Dissipation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04183v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Relaxation time plays a crucial role in describing the relaxation processes of quantum systems. We study the effect of a type of bond dissipation on the relaxation time of boundary dissipative systems and find that it can change the scaling of the relaxation time $T_c\sim L^{z}$ from $z=3$ to a value significantly less than $3$. We further reveal that the reason such bond dissipation can significantly reduce the relaxation time is that it can selectively target specific states. For Anderson localized systems, the scaling behavior of the relaxation time changes from an exponential form to a power-law form as the system size varies. This is because the bond dissipation we consider can not only select specific states but also disrupt the localization properties. Our work reveals that in open systems, one type of dissipation can be used to regulate the effects produced by another type of dissipation.</description>

They cover the conceptual structure of quantum gravity, the relational interpretation of quantum mechanics, the structure of time, its orientation and the openness of the future, the physical underpinning of information and meaning, and some general considerations on the fact that concepts evolve, on perspectivalism and anti-foundationalism.</description>
