      <title>The Spider Stellar Engine: a Fully Steerable Extraterrestrial Design?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A long-lived civilization will inevitably have to migrate towards a nearby star as its home star runs out of nuclear fuel. One way to achieve such a migration is by transforming its star into a stellar engine, and to control its motion in the galaxy. We first provide a brief overview of stellar engines and conclude that looking for technosignatures of stellar engines has taken two roads: on the observational side, hypervelocity stars have been the target of such searches, but without good candidates. On the theoretical side, stellar engine concepts have been proposed but are poorly linked to observable technosignatures. Since about half the stars in our galaxy are in binary systems where life might develop too, we introduce a model of a binary stellar engine. We propose mechanisms for acceleration, deceleration, steering in the orbital plane and outside of the orbital plane. We apply the model to candidate systems, spider pulsars, which are binary stars composed of one millisecond pulsar and a very low-mass companion star that is heavily irradiated by the pulsar wind. We discuss potential signatures of acceleration, deceleration, steering, as well as maneuvers such as gravitational assists or captures.

      <title>Search for Axions from Magnetic White Dwarfs with Chandra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low mass axion-like particles could be produced in abundance within the cores of hot, compact magnetic white dwarf (MWD) stars from electron bremsstrahlung and converted to detectable X-rays in the strong magnetic fields surrounding these systems. In this work, we constrain the existence of such axions from two dedicated Chandra X-ray observations of $\sim$40 ks each in the energy range $\sim$1 - 10 keV towards the magnetic white dwarfs (MWDs) WD 1859+148 and PG 0945+246. We find no evidence for axions, which constrains the axion-electron times axion-photon coupling to $|g_{a\gamma \gamma} g_{aee}| \lesssim 1.54 \times 10^{-25}$ ($3.54 \times 10^{-25}$) GeV$^{-1}$ for PG 0945+246 (WD 1859+148) at 95% confidence for axion masses $m_a \lesssim 10^{-6}$ eV. We find an excess of low-energy X-rays between 1 - 3 keV for WD 1859+148 but determine that the spectral morphology is too soft to arise from axions; instead, the soft X-rays may arise from non-thermal emission in the MWD magnetosphere.</description>

      <title>An Effective Model for Magnetic Field Amplification by the Magnetorotational and Parasitic Instabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The magnetorotational instability (MRI) is considered a leading mechanism for driving angular momentum transport in differentially rotating astrophysical flows, including accretion discs and proto-neutron stars. This process is mediated by the exponential amplification of the magnetic field whose final amplitude is envisioned to be limited by secondary (parasitic) instabilities. In this paper, we investigate the saturation of the MRI via parasitic modes relaxing previous approximations. We carry out the first systematic analysis of the evolution of parasitic modes as they feed off the exponentially growing MRI while being advected by the background shear flow. We provide the most accurate calculation of the amplification factor to which the MRI can grow before the fastest parasitic modes reach a comparable amplitude. We found that this amplification factor is remarkably robust, depending only logarithmically on the initial amplitude of the parasitic modes, in reasonable agreement with numerical simulations. Based on these insights, and guided by numerical simulations, we provide a simple analytical expression for the amplification of magnetic fields responsible for MRI-driven angular momentum transport. Our effective model for magnetic field amplification may enable going beyond the standard prescription for viscous transport currently employed in numerical simulations when the MRI cannot be explicitly resolved.</description>

      <title>Panning for gold with the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory: an optimal strategy for finding the counterparts to gravitational wave events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The LIGO, Virgo and KAGRA gravitational wave observatories are currently undertaking their O4 observing run offering the opportunity to discover new electromagnetic counterparts to gravitational wave events. We examine the capability of the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory (Swift) to respond to these triggers, primarily binary neutron star mergers, with both the UV/Optical Telescope (UVOT) and the X-ray Telescope (XRT). We simulate Swift's response to a trigger under different strategies using model skymaps, convolving these with the 2MPZ catalogue to produce an ordered list of observing fields, deriving the time taken for Swift to reach the correct field and simulating the instrumental responses to modelled kilonovae and short gamma-ray burst afterglows. We find that UVOT using the $u$ filter with an exposure time of order 120 s is optimal for most follow-up observations and that we are likely to detect counterparts in $\sim6$% of all binary neutron star triggers. We find that the gravitational wave 90% error area and measured distance to the trigger allow us to select optimal triggers to follow-up. Focussing on sources less than 300 Mpc away or 500 Mpc if the error area is less than a few hundred square degrees, distances greater than previously assumed, offer the best opportunity for discovery by Swift with $\sim5 - 30$% of triggers having detection probabilities $\geq 0.5$. At even greater distances, we can further optimise our follow-up by adopting a longer 250 s or 500 s exposure time.</description>

      <title>Strong Scatterings Invalidate Proposed Models of Enhanced TDE Rates in Post-Starburst Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stars wandering too close to supermassive black holes (SMBHs) can be ripped apart by the tidal forces of the black hole. Recent optical surveys have revealed that E+A galaxies are overrepresented by a factor $\sim $ 30, while green galaxies are overrepresented in both optical and infrared surveys. Different stellar models have been proposed to explain this Tidal Disruption Event (TDE) preference: ultra-steep stellar densities in the nuclear cluster, radial velocity anisotropies, and top-heavy Initial Mass Function (IMF). Here we explore these hypotheses in the framework of our revised loss cone theory that accounts for both weak and strong scattering, i.e., a scattering strong enough to eject a star from the nuclear cluster. We find that, when accounting for weak and strong scatterings, both ultra-steep densities and radial velocity anisotropies fail to explain the post-starburst preference of TDEs except when considering a high anisotropy factor together with a high SMBH mass and a shallow density profile of stellar mass black holes $\gamma_{\rm bh} =7/4$. Our findings hold when combining either model with top-heavy IMFs. Hence, new models to explain the post-starburst preference of TDEs are needed.</description>

      <title>Leveraging neutrino flavor physics for supernova model differentiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutrino flavor evolution is critical for understanding the physics of dense astrophysical regimes, including core-collapse supernovae (CCSN). Powerful numerical integration codes exist for simulating these environments, yet a complete understanding of the inherent nonlinearity of collective neutrino flavor oscillations and how it fits within the overall framework of these simulations remains an open challenge. For this reason, we continue developing statistical data assimilation (SDA) to infer solutions to the flavor field in a CCSN envelope, given simulated measurements far from the source. SDA is an inference paradigm designed to optimize a model with sparse data. Our model consists of neutrino beams emanating from a CCSN and coherently interacting with each other and with a background of other matter particles in one dimension $r$. One model feature of high interest is the distribution of those matter particles as a function of radius $r$, or the "matter potential" $V(r)$ -- as it significantly dictates flavor evolution. In this paper, we expand the model beyond previous incarnations, by replacing the monotonically-decaying analytic form for $V(r)$ we previously used with a more complex -- and more physically plausible -- set of profiles derived from a one-dimensional (spherically symmetric) hydrodynamics simulation of a CCSN explosion. We ask whether the SDA procedure can use simulated flavor measurements at physically accessible locations (i.e. in vacuum) to determine the extent to which different matter density profiles through which the neutrinos propagate in the matter-dominated regime are compatible with these measurements. Within the scope of our small-scale model, we find that the neutrino flavor measurements in the vacuum regime are able to discriminate between different matter profiles, and we discuss implications regarding a future galactic CCSN detection.</description>

      <title>Exploring non-thermal emission from the star-forming region NGC 3603 through a realistic modelling of its environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Star-forming regions are gaining considerable interest in the high-energy astrophysics community as possible Galactic particle accelerators. In general, the role of electrons has not been fully considered in this kind of cosmic-ray source. However, the intense radiation fields inside these regions might make electrons significant gamma-ray contributors. Aims. We study the young and compact star-forming region NGC 3603, a well known gamma-ray emitter. Our intention is to test whether its gamma-ray emission can be produced by cosmic-ray electrons. Methods. We build a novel model by creating realistic 3D distributions of the gas and the radiation field in the region. We introduce these models into PICARD to perform cosmic-ray transport simulations and produce gamma-ray emission maps. The results are compared with a dedicated Fermi Large Area Telescope data analysis at high energies. We also explore the radio and neutrino emissions of the system. Results. We improve the existing upper limits of the NGC 3603 gamma-ray source extension. Although the gamma-ray spectrum is well reproduced with the injection of CR protons, it requires nearly 30\% acceleration efficiency. In addition, the resulting extension of the simulated hadronic source is in mild tension with the extension data upper limit. The radio data disfavours the lepton-only scenario. Finally, combining both populations, the results are consistent with all observables, although the exact contributions are ambiguous.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Intrabinary Shock Model for Millisecond Pulsar Binaries: Radiative Losses and Long-Term Variability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spectrally hard X-ray emission with double-peak light curves (LCs) and orbitally modulated gamma rays have been observed in some millisecond pulsar binaries, phenomena attributed to intrabinary shocks (IBSs). While the existing IBS model by Sim, An, and Wadiasingh (2024) successfully explains these high-energy features observed in three pulsar binaries, it neglects particle energy loss within the shock region. We refine this IBS model to incorporate radiative losses of X-ray emitting electrons and positrons, and verify that the losses have insignificant impact on the observed LCs and spectra of the three binaries. Applying our refined IBS model to the X-ray bright pulsar binary PSR J1723-2837, we predict that it can be detected by the Cherenkov Telescope Array. Additionally, we propose that the long-term X-ray variability observed in XSS J12270-4859 and PSR J1723-2837 is due to changes in the shape of their IBSs. Our modeling of the X-ray variability suggests that these IBS shape changes may alter the extinction of the companion's optical emission, potentially explaining the simultaneous optical and X-ray variability observed in XSS J12270-4859. We present the model results and discuss their implications.</description>

      <title>Probing the Galactic neutrino flux at neutrino energies above 200 TeV with the Baikal Gigaton Volume Detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent observations of the Galactic component of the high-energy neutrino flux, together with the detection of the diffuse Galactic gamma-ray emission up to sub-PeV energies, open new possibilities to study the acceleration and propagation of cosmic rays in the Milky Way. At the same time, both large non-astrophysical backgrounds at TeV energies and scarcity of neutrino events in the sub-PeV band currently limit these analyses. Here we use the sample of cascade events with estimated neutrino energies above 200 TeV, detected by the partially deployed Baikal Gigaton Volume Detector (GVD) in six years of operation, to test the continuation of the Galactic neutrino spectrum to sub-PeV energies. We find that the distribution of the arrival directions of Baikal-GVD cascades above 200 TeV in the sky suggests an excess of neutrinos from low Galactic latitudes. We find the excess above 200 TeV also in the most recent IceCube public data sets, both of cascades and tracks. The significant (3.6 sigma in the combined analysis) flux of Galactic neutrinos above 200 TeV challenges often-used templates for neutrino search based on cosmic-ray simulations.</description>

      <title>Ultra-high-energy cosmic rays from ultra-fast outflows of active galactic nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an investigation of ultra-fast outflows (UFOs) in active galactic nuclei (AGN) as potential sources of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs). We focus on cosmic-ray nuclei, an aspect not explored previously. These large-scale, mildly-relativistic outflows, characterised by velocities up to half the speed of light, are a common feature of AGN. We study the cosmic-ray spectrum and maximum energy attainable in these environments with 3D CRPropa simulations and apply our method to 87 observed UFOs. Iron nuclei can be accelerated up to $\sim10^{20}\,$eV at the wind-termination shock in some UFOs, but the escaping flux is strongly attenuated due to photonuclear interactions with intense AGN photon fields. The maximum energy of nuclei escaping most UFOs is interaction-limited to below $\sim 10^{17}\,$eV and scales with the mass number. In the most extreme $\sim10\%$ of UFOs in our sample, nitrogen and helium escape with energy exceeding $10^{17.6}\,$eV. Protons and neutrons, either primaries or by-products of photodisintegration, escape UFOs with little attenuation, with half of the observed UFOs reaching energies exceeding $10^{18}\,$eV. Thus, UFOs emerge as viable sources of the diffuse cosmic-ray flux between the end of the Galactic cosmic-rays and the highest-energy extragalactic flux. We demonstrate that UFOs can fill this part of the spectrum in terms of energetics, spectral shape and chemical composition and that the role of UFOs as UHECR sources is testable with neutrino telescopes due to a substantial accompanying neutrino flux with peak energy around a few PeV. For a small subset of UFOs in our sample, nuclei can escape without photodisintegration with energy up to $10^{19.8}\,$eV. This occurs during low-emission states of the AGN, which would make UFOs intermittent sources of UHECR nuclei up to the highest observed energies.</description>

      <title>Understanding Streaming Instabilities in the Limit of High Cosmic Ray Current Density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A critical component of particle acceleration in astrophysical shocks is the non-resonant (Bell) instability, where the streaming of cosmic rays (CRs) leads to the amplification of magnetic fields necessary to scatter particles. In this work we use kinetic particle-in-cells simulations to investigate the high-CR current regime, where the typical assumptions underlying the Bell instability break down. Despite being more strongly driven, significantly less magnetic field amplification is observed compared to low-current cases, an effect due to the anisotropic heating that occurs in this regime. We also find that electron-scale modes, despite being fastest growing, mostly lead to moderate electron heating and do not affect the late evolution or saturation of the instability.</description>

      <title>Effective Theory Approach for Axion Wormholes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.11260v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We employ the effective field theory approach to analyze the characteristics of Euclidean wormholes within axion theories. Using this approach, we obtain non-perturbative instantons in various complex scalar models with and without a non-minimal coupling to gravity, as well as models featuring the $R^2$ term for a range of coupling values. This yields a series of analytical expressions for the axion wormhole action, shedding light on the model parameters and field dependencies of contributions in both the ultraviolet and infrared domains. Consequently, model-dependent local operators that disrupt axion shift symmetries are generated at lower energy levels. This, in turn, provides crucial insights into the gravitational influences on the axion quality problem.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Waves from Primordial Black Hole Dark Matter Spikes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The origin of the binary black hole mergers observed by LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) remains an open question. We calculate the merger rate from primordial black holes (PBHs) within the density spike around supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at the center of galaxies. We show that the merger rate within the spike is comparable to that within the wider dark matter halo. We also calculate the extreme mass ratio inspiral (EMRI) signal from PBHs hosted within the density spike spiralling into their host SMBHs due to GW emission. We predict that LISA may detect $\sim10^4$ of these EMRIs with signal-to-noise ratio of 5 within a 4-year observation run, if all dark matter is made up of PBHs. Uncertainties in our rates come from the uncertain mass fraction of PBHs within the dark matter spike, relative to the host central SMBHs, which defines the parameter space LISA can constrain.</description>

      <title>Solving the mystery of extreme light variability in the massive eccentric system MACHO 80.7443.1718</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05469v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The evolution of massive stars is heavily influenced by their binarity, and the massive eccentric binary system MACHO 80.7443.1718 (ExtEV) serves as a prime example. This study explores whether the light variability of ExtEV, observed near the periastron during its 32.8-day orbit, can be explained by a wind-wind collision (WWC) model and reviews other potential explanations. Using broadband photometry, TESS data, ground-based $UBV$ time-series photometry, and high-resolution spectroscopy, we analysed the system's parameters. We ruled out the presence of a Keplerian disk and periodic Roche-lobe overflow. Our analysis suggests the primary component has a radius of about $30\,{\rm R}_\odot$, luminosity of $\sim6.6\times10^5\,{\rm L}_\odot$, and mass between $25$ and $45\,{\rm M}_\odot$, with a high wind mass-loss rate of $4.5\times10^{-5}\,{\rm M}_\odot\,{\rm yr}^{-1}$, likely enhanced by tidal interactions, rotation, and tidally excited oscillations. We successfully modelled ExtEV's light curve, identifying atmospheric eclipse and light scattering in the WWC cone as key contributors. The system's mass-loss rate exceeds theoretical predictions, indicating that ExtEV is in a rare evolutionary phase, offering insights into enhanced mass loss in massive binary systems.</description>

Abstract: The Pierre Auger Collaboration has embraced the concept of open access to their research data since its foundation, with the aim of giving access to the widest possible community. A gradual process of release began as early as 2007 when 1% of the cosmic-ray data was made public, along with 100% of the space-weather information. In February 2021, a portal was released containing 10% of cosmic-ray data collected from 2004 to 2018, during Phase I of the Observatory. The Portal included detailed documentation about the detection and reconstruction procedures, analysis codes that can be easily used and modified and, additionally, visualization tools. Since then the Portal has been updated and extended. In 2023, a catalog of the 100 highest-energy cosmic-ray events examined in depth has been included. A specific section dedicated to educational use has been developed with the expectation that these data will be explored by a wide and diverse community including professional and citizen-scientists, and used for educational and outreach initiatives. This paper describes the context, the spirit and the technical implementation of the release of data by the largest cosmic-ray detector ever built, and anticipates its future developments.</description>

      <title>Long-term spin-down and low luminosity regime in the Be/X-ray binary pulsar GX 304-1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.13303v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We carry out timing and spectral studies of the Be/X-ray binary pulsar GX 304-1 using NuStar and XMM-Newton observations. We construct the long-term spin period evolution of the pulsar which changes from a long-term spin-up ($\sim 1.3 \times 10^{-13} $Hz \~s$^{-1}$) to a long-term spin-down ($\sim -3.4 \times 10^{-14} $Hz \~s$^{-1}$) trend during a low luminosity state ($\sim 10^{34-35} $erg \~s$^{-1}$). A prolonged low luminosity regime ($L_X \sim 10^{34-35} $erg \~s$^{-1}$) was detected during 2005-2010 and spanning nearly five years since 2018 December. The XMM-Newton and NuStar spectra can be described with a power law plus blackbody model having an estimated luminosity of $\sim 2.5 \times 10^{33} $erg \~s$^{-1}$ and $\sim 3.6 \times 10^{33} $erg \~s$^{-1}$ respectively. The inferred radius of the blackbody emission is about 100-110 m which suggests a polar-cap origin of this component. From long-term ultraviolet observations of the companion star, an increase in the ultraviolet signatures is detected preceding the X-ray outbursts. The spectral energy distribution of the companion star is constructed which provides a clue of possible UV excess when X-ray outbursts were detected from the neutron star compared to the quiescent phase. We explore plausible mechanisms to explain the long-term spin-down and extended low luminosity manifestation in this pulsar. We find that sustained accretion from a cold disc may explain the prolonged low luminosity state of the pulsar since December 2018 but the pulsar was undergoing normal accretion during the low luminosity period spanning 2005-2010.</description>

      <title>Kicking time back in black-hole mergers: Ancestral masses, spins, birth recoils and hierarchical-formation viability of GW190521</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00720v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pair-instability supernova (PISN) prevents black-hole formation from stellar collapse within the approximate mass range $M\in [65,130]M_\odot$. However, such black holes may form hierarchically through merging ancestral black holes, whose properties determine those of the ``child'' one: mass, spin, and recoil velocity. Crucially, the child will leave its host environment if its ``birth recoil'' exceeds the corresponding escape velocity, preventing further mergers. We exploit relations between the final recoil and spin of quasi-circular black-hole mergers to obtain posterior probability distributions for the hypothetical ancestral masses, spins and birth recoils of the component black holes of GW190521. To this, we present a Bayesian framework applicable to existing estimates for the components of black-hole merger observations. We consider both the quasi-circular (generically spinning) analysis performed by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration and the eccentric (aligned-spin) one performed by Romero-Shaw et. al. We evaluate the probability $p_{2g}$ that the GW190521 components inferred by these analyses formed from the merger of stellar-origin black holes and were retained by their environment. For the primary component, which populates the PISN gap, such scenario is strongly suppressed if GW190521 happened in a Globular Cluster with $p_{2g} \sim 10^{-3}$ unless it was quasi-circular and its ancestors had aligned-spins, uncharacteristic of hierarchical formation channels, or small spins, which yields $p_{2g} \simeq 10^{-2}$. If GW190521 was eccentric, we obtain $p_{2g} \simeq 0.1$ for any host other than an AGN, and zero for a Globular Cluster. If GW190521 was quasi-circular, a Nuclear-Star Cluster origin is possible with $p_{2g} \in (\sim 0.4 \sim ,0.8)$</description>

      <title>Reconstructing the Genealogy of LIGO-Virgo Black Holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06390v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a Bayesian inference framework to predict the merger history of LIGO-Virgo binary black holes (BHs), whose binary components may have undergone hierarchical mergers in the past. The framework relies on numerical relativity predictions for the mass, spin, and kick velocity of the remnant BHs. This proposed framework computes the masses, spins, and kicks imparted to the remnant of the parent binaries, given the initial masses and spin magnitudes of the binary constituents. We validate our approach by performing an ``injection study'' based on a constructed sequence of hierarchically formed binaries. Noise is added to the final binary in the sequence, and the parameters of the `parent' and `grandparent' binaries in the merger chain are then reconstructed. This method is then applied to three GWTC-3 events: GW190521, GW200220_061928, and GW190426_190642. These events were selected because at least one of the binary companions lies in the putative pair-instability supernova mass gap, in which stellar processes alone cannot produce BHs. Hierarchical mergers offer a natural explanation for the formation of BHs in the pair-instability mass gap. We use the backward evolution framework to predict the parameters of the parents of the primary companion of these three binaries. For instance, the parent binary of GW190521 has masses $72_{-22}^{+32}M_{\odot}$ and $31_{-23}^{+24}M_{\odot}$ within the 90% credible interval. Astrophysical environments with escape speeds $\geq100{\rm \, km \, s^{-1}}$ are preferred sites to host these events. Our approach can be readily applied to future high-mass gravitational wave events to predict their formation history under the hierarchical merger assumption.</description>

      <title>Identifying jittering-jet-shaped ejecta in the Cygnus Loop supernova remnant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11014v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Analyzing images of the Cygnus Loop, a core-collapse supernova (CCSN) remnant, in different emission bands, we identify a point-symmetrical morphology composed of three symmetry axes that we attribute to shaping by three pairs of jets. The main jet axis has an elongated S shape, appearing as a faint narrow zone in visible and UV. We term it the S-shaped hose, and the structure of three symmetry lines, the point-symmetric wind rose. The two other lines connect a protrusion (an ear or a bulge) with a hole on the opposite side of the center (a nozzle or a cavity), structures that we identify in the X-ray, UV, visible, IR, and/or radio images. There is a well-known blowout at the southern end of the S-shaped hose, and we identify a possible opposite blowout at the northern end of the S-shaped hose. The point-symmetrical morphology of the Cygnus Loop is according to the expectation of the jittering jets explosion mechanism (JJEM) of CCSNe, where several to few tens of pairs of jets with stochastically varying directions explode the star. The three pairs of jets that shaped the wind-rose structure of the Cygnus Loop are the last energetic pairs of this series of jets. Our study further supports the JJEM as the main explosion mechanism of CCSNe.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning the Forecast of Galactic Cosmic-Rays Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21046v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a novel deep learning framework based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to predict galactic cosmic-ray spectra on a one-day-ahead basis by leveraging historical solar activity data, overcoming limitations inherent in traditional transport models. By flexibly incorporating multiple solar parameters such as the heliospheric magnetic field, solar wind speed, and sunspot numbers, our model achieves accurate short-term and long-term predictions of cosmic-ray flux. The addition of historical cosmic-ray flux data significantly enhances prediction accuracy, allowing the model to capture complex dependencies between past and future flux variations. Additionally, the model reliably predicts full cosmic-ray spectra for different particle species, enhancing its utility for comprehensive space weather forecasting. Our approach offers a scalable, data-driven alternative to traditional physics-based methods, ensuring robust daily and long-term forecasts. This work opens avenues for advanced models that can integrate broader observational data, with significant implications for space weather monitoring and mission planning.</description>

Abstract: Causality is an essential factor in determining the maximum mass of a neutron star. Previous works study causality for smooth equations of state. The density at the core of neutron stars can be a few times nuclear saturation density, where the occurrence of first-order phase transition has not been ruled out. The causality condition for first-order phase transition is characteristically different from that of smooth EOS, which becomes evident in the mass-radius relation. In this letter, we find that equations of state having first-order phase transition, the causality line deviates considerably from the smooth equation of state. Depending on the onset density of phase transition, there is a narrow band in the mass-radius plot, which is available only to the stars having a smooth equation of state. This can have significant consequences in the sense that if some pulsars are to lie in this band, one can rule out the equation of state having first-order phase transition occurring at that particular onset density.</description>

      <title>The XRISM/Resolve view of the Fe K region of Cyg X-3</title>

Abstract: The X-ray binary system Cygnus X-3 (4U 2030+40, V1521 Cyg) is luminous but enigmatic owing to the high intervening absorption. High-resolution X-ray spectroscopy uniquely probes the dynamics of the photoionized gas in the system. In this paper we report on an observation of Cyg X-3 with the XRISM/Resolve spectrometer which provides unprecedented spectral resolution and sensitivity in the 2-10 keV band. We detect multiple kinematic and ionization components in absorption and emission, whose superposition leads to complex line profiles, including strong P-Cygni profiles on resonance lines. The prominent Fe XXV He$\alpha$ and Fe XXVI Ly$\alpha$ emission complexes are clearly resolved into their characteristic fine structure transitions. Self-consistent photoionization modeling allows us to disentangle the absorption and emission components and measure the Doppler velocity of these components as a function of binary orbital phase. We find a significantly higher velocity amplitude for the emission lines than for the absorption lines. The absorption lines generally appear blueshifted by ${\sim}-500$-$600$km s$^{-1}$. We show that the wind decomposes naturally into a relatively smooth and large scale component, perhaps originating with the background wind itself, plus a turbulent more dense structure located close to the compact object in its orbit.</description>

      <title>Hunting Nonstandard Neutrino Interactions and Leptoquarks in Dark Matter Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.15736v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Next generation direct dark matter (DM) detection experiments will have unprecedented capabilities to explore coherent neutrino-nucleus scattering (CE$\nu$NS) complementary to dedicated neutrino experiments. We demonstrate that future DM experiments can effectively probe nonstandard neutrino interactions (NSI) mediated by scalar fields in the scattering of solar and atmospheric neutrinos. We set first limits on $S_1$ leptoquark models that result in sizable $\mu-d$ and $\tau-d$ sector neutrino NSI CE$\nu$NS contributions using LUX-ZEPLIN (LZ) data. As we show, near future DM experiments reaching $\sim \mathcal{O}(100)$ton-year exposure, such as argon-based ARGO and xenon-based DARWIN, can probe parameter space of leptoquarks beyond the reach of current and planned collider facilities. We also analyze for the first time prospects for testing NSI in lead-based detectors. We discuss the ability of leptoquarks in the parameter space of interest to also explain the neutrino masses and $(g-2)_\mu$ observations.</description>

      <title>Bounds on the charge of the graviton using gravitational wave observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05038v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: If the graviton possesses a non-zero charge $q_g$, gravitational waves (GW) originating from astrophysical sources would experience an additional time delay due to intergalactic magnetic fields. This would result in a modification of the phase evolution of the observed GW signal similar to the effect induced by a massive graviton. As a result, we can reinterpret the most recent upper limits on the graviton's mass as constraints on the joint mass-charge parameter space, finding $|q_g|/{e} &lt; 3\times 10^{-34}$ where $e$ represents the charge of an electron. Additionally, we illustrate that a charged graviton would introduce a constant phase difference in the gravitational waves detected by two spatially separated GW detectors due to the Aharonov-Bohm effect. Using the non-observation of such a phase difference for the GW event GW190814, we establish a mass-independent constraint $|q_g|/e &lt; 2\times 10^{-26}$. To the best of our knowledge, our results constitute the first-ever bounds on the charge of the graviton. We also discuss various caveats involved in our measurements and prospects for strengthening these bounds with future GW observations.</description>

      <title>On the single versus the repetitive Penrose process in a Kerr black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08229v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Extracting the rotational energy from a Kerr black hole (BH) is one of the crucial topics in relativistic astrophysics. Here, we give special attention to the Penrose ballistic process based on the fission of a massive particle $\mu_0$ into two particles $\mu_1$ and $\mu_2$, occurring in the ergosphere of a Kerr BH. Bardeen et al. indicated that for the process to occur, some additional "hydrodynamical forces or superstrong radiation reactions" were needed. Wald and Chandrasekhar further expanded this idea. This animosity convinced T. Piran and collaborators to move from a simple three-body system characterizing the original Penrose process to a many-body system. This many-body approach was further largely expanded by others, some questionable in their validity. Here, we return to the simplest original Penrose process and show that the solution of the equations of motion, imposing the turning point condition on their trajectories, leads to the rotational energy extraction from the BH expected by Penrose. The efficiency of energy extraction by a single process is quantified for three different single decay processes occurring respectively at $r=1.2 M$, $r=1.5 M$, and $r=1.9 M$. An interesting repetitive model has been proposed by Misner, Thorne \&amp; Wheeler (hereafter MTW73). Indeed, it would appear that a repetitive sequence of $246$ decays of the above injection process at $r=1.2 M$ and the corresponding ones at $r=1.5 M$ and $r=1.9 M$ could extract $100\%$ of the rotational energy of the BH, so violating energy conservation. The accompanying paper, accounting for the existence of the BH irreducible mass, introduces a non-linear approach that avoids violating energy conservation and leads to a new energy extraction process.</description>

      <title>Convergence of the hydrodynamic gradient expansion in relativistic kinetic theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14316v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We rigorously prove that, in any relativistic kinetic theory whose non-hydrodynamic sector has a finite gap, the Taylor series of all hydrodynamic dispersion relations has a finite radius of convergence. Furthermore, we prove that, for shear waves, such radius of convergence cannot be smaller than $1/2$ times the gap size. Finally, we prove that the non-hydrodynamic sector is gapped whenever the total scattering cross-section (expressed as a function of the energy) is bounded below by a positive non-zero constant. These results, combined with well-established covariant stability criteria, allow us to derive a rigorous upper bound on the shear viscosity of relativistic dilute gases.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter Interactions in White Dwarfs: A Multi-Energy Approach to Capture Mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13908v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: White dwarfs offer a compelling avenue for probing interactions of dark matter particles, particularly in the challenging sub-GeV mass regime. The constraints derived from these celestial objects strongly depend on the existence of high dark matter densities in the corresponding regions of the Universe, where white dwarfs are observed. This implies that excluding the parameter space using local white dwarfs would present a significant challenge, primarily due to the low dark matter density in the solar neighbourhood. This limitation prompts the exploration of alternative scenarios involving dark matter particles with a diverse spectrum of kinetic energies. In this work, we investigate how these dark matter particles traverse the star, interact with stellar matter, and ultimately get captured. To accomplish this, we approximate the dark matter flux as a delta function and inspired on the Three Portal Model, we assume that fermionic dark matter interacts with stellar matter either through a broken $U(1)$ gauge vector mediator or a scalar. In our computations, we consider how interactions might vary across different energy regimes, from high-energy deep inelastic scattering and inelastic scatterings via the production of $N-$ and $\Delta-$ resonances to lower-energy elastic interactions with nucleons and nuclei. Our study models these inelastic resonant interactions with dark matter and vector or scalar mediators for the very first time. We provide insights into the specific conditions required for successfully boosted dark matter capture in white dwarfs. We found that, in general, dark matter capture is most likely to occur at low energies, as expected. However, in the high-energy regime, there remains a small window for capture through resonant and deep inelastic scattering processes.</description>
