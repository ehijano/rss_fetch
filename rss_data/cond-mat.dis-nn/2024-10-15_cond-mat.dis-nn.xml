      <title>Statistics of systemwide correlations in the random-field XXZ chain: Importance of rare events in the many-body localized phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by recent debates around the many-body localization (MBL) problem, and in particular its stability against systemwide resonances, we investigate long-distance spin-spin correlations across the phase diagram of the random-field XXZ model, with a particular focus on the strong disorder regime. Building on state-of-the-art shift-invert diagonalization techniques, we study the high-energy behavior of transverse and longitudinal correlation functions, computed at the largest possible distance, for a broad range of disorder and interaction strengths. Our results show that while transverse correlations display a fairly stable exponential decay over the entire XXZ phase diagram, longitudinal correlations exhibit markedly different behavior, revealing distinct physical regimes. More precisely, we identify an intermediate disorder region where standard observables show well-converged MBL behavior [J. Colbois et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 133, 116502 (2024)] while the distributions of longitudinal correlations reveal unexpected fat-tails towards large values. These rare events strongly influence the average decay of longitudinal correlations, which we find to be algebraic in a broad region inside the supposed MBL phase, whereas the typical decay remains mostly exponential. At stronger disorder and weaker interactions, this intermediate regime is replaced by a more conventional exponential decay with short correlation lengths for both typical and average correlators, as expected for standard localization. Our findings shed light on the systemwide instabilities and raise important questions about the impact of such rare but large long-range correlations on the stability of the MBL phase. Finally, we discuss the possible fate of the intermediate region in the context of recent perspectives in the field.</description>

      <title>How to realize compact and Anderson-like localized states in disorder-free hypercube bosonic networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a method to engineer various zero-energy localized states on disorder-free hypercube graphs. Previous works have already indicated that disorder is not essential for observing localization phenomena in noninteracting systems, with some prominent examples including the 1D Aubry-Andr\'e model, characterized solely by incommensurate potentials, or 2D incommensurate Moir\'e lattices, which exhibit localization due to the flat band spectrum. Moreover, flat band systems with translational invariance can also possess so-called compact localized states, characterized by exactly zero amplitude outside a finite region of the lattice. Here we show that both compact and non-compact (i.e., Anderson-like) localized states can be observed on disorder-free hypercubes that can be constructed in a standard iterative manner via Cartan products. This construction also makes these localized states robust against perturbations. We illustrate and visualize our results on the example of an $8$D hypercube projected on its Petrie polygon. Our findings can be readily tested on existing photonic experimental setups, where hypercube graphs studied can be emulated by bosonic networks of coupled optical cavities and/or waveguides, thus offering potential advancements in the development of various information and wave manipulation protocols.</description>

      <title>Diffraction and pseudospectra in non-Hermitian quasiperiodic lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09185v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wave dynamics in disordered open media is an intriguing topic, and has lately attracted a lot of attention in non-Hermitian physics, especially in photonics. In fact, spatial distributions of gain and loss elements are physically possible in the context of integrated photonic waveguide arrays. In particular, in these type of lattices, counter-intuitive quantized jumps along the propagation direction appear in the strong disorder limit (where all eigenstates are localized) and they have also been recently experimentally observed. We systematically study the non-Hermitian quasiperiodic Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper model with on-site gain and loss distribution (NHAAH), with an emphasis on the spectral sensitivity based on pseudospectra analysis. Moreover, diffraction dynamics and the quantized jumps, as well as, the effect of saturable nonlinearity, are investigated in detail. Our study reveals the intricate relation between the nonlinearity and non-Hermiticity.</description>

      <title>Localization of Hybridized Surface Plasmon Modes on Random Gold Nanoparticle Assemblies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Assemblies of plasmonic nanoparticles (NPs) support hybridized modes of localized surface plasmons (LSPs), which delocalize in geometrically well-ordered arrangements. Here, the hybridization behavior of LSPs in geometrically completely disordered arrangements of Au NPs fabricated by an e-beam synthesis method is studied. Employing electron energy loss spectroscopy in a scanning transmission electron microscope in combination with numerical simulations, the disorder-driven spatial and spectral localization of the coupled LSP modes that depend on the NP thickness is revealed. Below 0.4 nm sample thickness (flat NPs), localization increases towards higher hybridized LSP mode energies. In comparison, above 10 nm thickness, a decrease of localization (an increase of delocalization) with higher mode energies is observed. In the intermediate thickness regime, a transition of the energy dependence of the localization between the two limiting cases, exhibiting a transition mode energy with minimal localization, is observed. This behavior is mainly driven by the energy and thickness dependence of the polarizability of the individual NPs.</description>

      <title>Fully Programmable Spatial Photonic Ising Machine by Focal Plane Division</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10689v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ising machines are an emerging class of hardware that promises ultrafast and energy-efficient solutions to NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems. Spatial photonic Ising machines (SPIMs) exploit optical computing in free space to accelerate the computation, showcasing parallelism, scalability, and low power consumption. However, current SPIMs can implement only a restricted class of problems. This partial programmability is a critical limitation that hampers their benchmark. Achieving full programmability of the device while preserving its scalability is an open challenge. Here, we report a fully programmable SPIM achieved through a novel operation method based on the division of the focal plane. In our scheme, a general Ising problem is decomposed into a set of Mattis Hamiltonians, whose energies are simultaneously computed optically by measuring the intensity on different regions of the camera sensor. Exploiting this concept, we experimentally demonstrate the computation with high success probability of ground-state solutions of up to 32-spin Ising models on unweighted maximum cut graphs with and without ferromagnetic bias. Simulations of the hardware prove a favorable scaling of the accuracy with the number of spins. Our fully programmable SPIM enables the implementation of many quadratic unconstrained binary optimization problems, further establishing SPIMs as a leading paradigm in non von Neumann hardware.</description>

      <title>Benefiting from Quantum? A Comparative Study of Q-Seg, Quantum-Inspired Techniques, and U-Net for Crack Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10713v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exploring the potential of quantum hardware for enhancing classical and real-world applications is an ongoing challenge. This study evaluates the performance of quantum and quantum-inspired methods compared to classical models for crack segmentation. Using annotated gray-scale image patches of concrete samples, we benchmark a classical mean Gaussian mixture technique, a quantum-inspired fermion-based method, Q-Seg a quantum annealing-based method, and a U-Net deep learning architecture. Our results indicate that quantum-inspired and quantum methods offer a promising alternative for image segmentation, particularly for complex crack patterns, and could be applied in near-future applications.</description>

      <title>Neural Projected Quantum Dynamics: a systematic study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the challenge of simulating unitary quantum dynamics in large systems using Neural Quantum States, focusing on overcoming the computational instabilities and high cost of existing methods. This work offers a comprehensive formalization of the projected time-dependent Variational Monte Carlo (p-tVMC) method by thoroughly analyzing its two essential components: stochastic infidelity minimization and discretization of the unitary evolution. We investigate neural infidelity minimization using natural gradient descent strategies, identifying the most stable stochastic estimators and introducing adaptive regularization strategies that eliminate the need for manual adjustment of the hyperparameter along the dynamics. We formalize the specific requirements that p-tVMC imposes on discretization schemes for them to be efficient, and introduce four high-order integration schemes combining Taylor expansions, Pad\'e approximants, and Trotter splitting to enhance accuracy and scalability. We benchmark our adaptive methods against a 2D Ising quench, matching state of the art techniques without manual tuning of hyperparameters. This work establishes p-tVMC as a highly promising framework for addressing complex quantum dynamics, offering a compelling alternative for researchers looking to push the boundaries of quantum simulations.</description>

      <title>Matrix denoising: Bayes-optimal estimators via low-degree polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16719v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the additive version of the matrix denoising problem, where a random symmetric matrix $S$ of size $n$ has to be inferred from the observation of $Y=S+Z$, with $Z$ an independent random matrix modeling a noise. For prior distributions of $S$ and $Z$ that are invariant under conjugation by orthogonal matrices we determine, using results from first and second order free probability theory, the Bayes-optimal (in terms of the mean square error) polynomial estimators of degree at most $D$, asymptotically in $n$, and show that as $D$ increases they converge towards the estimator introduced by Bun, Allez, Bouchaud and Potters in [IEEE Transactions on Information Theory 62, 7475 (2016)]. We conjecture that this optimality holds beyond strictly orthogonally invariant priors, and provide partial evidences of this universality phenomenon when $S$ is an arbitrary Wishart matrix and $Z$ is drawn from the Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble, a case motivated by the related extensive rank matrix factorization problem.</description>

      <title>Robustness and classical proxy of entanglement in variants of quantum walk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05597v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum walk (QW) utilizes its internal quantum states to decide the displacement, thereby introducing single-particle entanglement between the internal and positional degrees of freedom. By simulating three variants of QW with the conventional, symmetric, and split-step translation operators with or without classical randomness in the coin operator, we show the entanglement is robust against both time- and spatially- dependent randomness, which can cause localization transitions of QW. We propose a classical quantity call overlap, which literally measures the overlap between the probability distributions of the internal states, as a proxy of entanglement. The overlap is associated with the off-diagonal terms of the reduced density matrix in the internal space, which then reflects its purity. Therefore, the overlap captures the inverse behavior of the entanglement entropy in most cases. We test the limitation of the classical proxy by constructing a special case with high population imbalance between the internal states to blind the overlap. Possible implications and experimental measurements are also discussed.</description>
