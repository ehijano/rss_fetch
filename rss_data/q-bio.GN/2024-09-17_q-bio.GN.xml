      <title>Gene and RNA Editing: Methods, Enabling Technologies, Applications, and Future Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gene and RNA editing methods, technologies, and applications are emerging as innovative forms of therapy and medicine, offering more efficient implementation compared to traditional pharmaceutical treatments. Current trends emphasize the urgent need for advanced methods and technologies to detect public health threats, including diseases and viral agents. Gene and RNA editing techniques enhance the ability to identify, modify, and ameliorate the effects of genetic diseases, disorders, and disabilities. Viral detection and identification methods present numerous opportunities for enabling technologies, such as CRISPR, applicable to both RNA and gene editing through the use of specific Cas proteins. This article explores the distinctions and benefits of RNA and gene editing processes, emphasizing their contributions to the future of medical treatment. CRISPR technology, particularly its adaptation via the Cas13 protein for RNA editing, is a significant advancement in gene editing. The article will delve into RNA and gene editing methodologies, focusing on techniques that alter and modify genetic coding. A-to-I and C-to-U editing are currently the most predominant methods of RNA modification. CRISPR stands out as the most cost-effective and customizable technology for both RNA and gene editing. Unlike permanent changes induced by cutting an individual's DNA genetic code, RNA editing offers temporary modifications by altering nucleoside bases in RNA strands, which can then attach to DNA strands as temporary modifiers.</description>

      <title>The Future of Decoding Non-Standard Nucleotides: Leveraging Nanopore Sequencing for Expanded Genetic Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Expanding genetic codes from natural standard nucleotides to artificial non-standard nucleotides marks a significant advancement in synthetic biology, with profound implications for biotechnology and medicine. Decoding the biological information encoded in these non-standard nucleotides presents new challenges, as traditional sequencing technologies are unable to recognize or interpret novel base pairings. In this perspective, we explore the potential of nanopore sequencing, which is uniquely suited to decipher both standard and non-standard nucleotides by directly measuring the biophysical properties of nucleic acids. Nanopore technology offers real-time, long-read sequencing without the need for amplification or synthesis, making it particularly advantageous for expanded genetic systems like Artificially Expanded Genetic Information Systems (AEGIS). We discuss how the adaptability of nanopore sequencing and advancements in data processing can unlock the potential of these synthetic genomes and open new frontiers in understanding and utilizing expanded genetic codes.</description>
