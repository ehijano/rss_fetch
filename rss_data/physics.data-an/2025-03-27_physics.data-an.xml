      <title>How Ground Deformation Influences Earthquake Occurrence During the Ongoing Unrest at Campi Flegrei (2005-Present)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the relationship between the cumulative number of earthquakes and ground uplift at the Campi Flegrei caldera (South Italy) during the ongoing unrest (2005-present). While previous studies have explored this correlation, we propose a nonlinear epidemic model that captures new features of the caldera system. Our model describes earthquakes' occurrence as a cascading process driven by ground deformation. The nonlinearity reflects the reduced efficiency of the triggering mechanism, which contributes to the short duration of seismic swarms. This mechanism may represent a general framework for understanding the occurrence of volcanic earthquakes worldwide.</description>

      <title>Stabilizing Neural Likelihood Ratio Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20753v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Likelihood ratios are used for a variety of applications in particle physics data analysis, including parameter estimation, unfolding, and anomaly detection. When the data are high-dimensional, neural networks provide an effective tools for approximating these ratios. However, neural network training has an inherent stochasticity that limits their precision. A widely-used approach to reduce these fluctuations is to train many times and average the output (ensembling). We explore different approaches to ensembling and pretraining neural networks for stabilizing likelihood ratio estimation. For numerical studies focus on unbinned unfolding with OmniFold, as it requires many likelihood ratio estimations. We find that ensembling approaches that aggregate the models at step 1, before pushing the weights to step 2 improve both bias and variance of final results. Variance can be further improved by pre-training, however at the cost increasing bias.</description>

      <title>Flow Matching Beyond Kinematics: Generating Jets with Particle-ID and Trajectory Displacement Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.00123v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the first generative model trained on the JetClass dataset. Our model generates jets at the constituent level, and it is a permutation-equivariant continuous normalizing flow (CNF) trained with the flow matching technique. It is conditioned on the jet type, so that a single model can be used to generate the ten different jet types of JetClass. For the first time, we also introduce a generative model that goes beyond the kinematic features of jet constituents. The JetClass dataset includes more features, such as particle-ID and track impact parameter, and we demonstrate that our CNF can accurately model all of these additional features as well. Our generative model for JetClass expands on the versatility of existing jet generation techniques, enhancing their potential utility in high-energy physics research, and offering a more comprehensive understanding of the generated jets.</description>

      <title>Application of Haldane's statistical correlation theory in classical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14327v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This letter investigates the application of Haldane's statistical correlation theory in classical systems. A modified statistical correlation theory has been proposed by including non-linearity in the form of an exponent into the original theory of Haldane. The dependence of the statistical correlation on indistinguishability is highlighted. Using this modified theory, a quasi-classical derivation of intermediate statistics is shown where indistinguishability can be introduced into distinguishable systems in the form of a statistical correlation. The final result is equivalent to the classical fractional exclusion statistics (CFES), which was derived earlier using a purely classical route. An extended non-linear correlation model based on power series expansion is also proposed, which can produce various intermediate statistical models.</description>
