      <title>Data-Driven Nonlinear Model Reduction to Spectral Submanifolds via Oblique Projection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamics in a primary Spectral Submanifold (SSM) constructed over the slowest modes of a dynamical system provide an ideal reduced-order model for nearby trajectories. Modeling the dynamics of trajectories further away from the primary SSM, however, is difficult if the linear part of the system exhibits strong non-normal behavior. Such non-normality implies that simply projecting trajectories onto SSMs along directions normal to the slow linear modes will not pair those trajectories correctly with their reduced counterparts on the SSMs. In principle, a well-defined nonlinear projection along a stable invariant foliation exists and would exactly match the full dynamics to the SSM-reduced dynamics. This foliation, however, cannot realistically be constructed from practically feasible amounts and distributions of experimental data. Here we develop an oblique projection technique that is able to approximate this foliation efficiently, even from a single experimental trajectory of a significantly non-normal and nonlinear beam.</description>

      <title>Projection theorems with countably many exceptions and applications to the exact overlaps conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish several optimal estimates for exceptional parameters in the projection of fractal measures: (1) For a parametric family of self-similar measures satisfying a transversality condition, the set of parameters leading to a dimension drop is at most countable. (2) For any ergodic CP-distribution $Q$ on $\mathbb{R}^2$, the Hausdorff dimension of its orthogonal projection is $\min\{1, \dim Q\}$ in all but at most countably many directions. Applications of our projection results include: (i) For any planar Borel probability measure with uniform entropy dimension $\alpha$, the packing dimension of its orthogonal projection is at least $\min\{1, \alpha\}$ in all but at most countably many directions. (ii) For any planar set $F$, the Assouad dimension of its orthogonal projection is at least $ \min\{1, \dim_{\rm A} F\} $ in all but at most countably many directions.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work focuses on two notions of non-Hamiltonian integrable systems: B-integrability and Euler-Jacobi integrability. We first show that the first notion is stronger. We then investigate which possible "non-evident" properties one can add to the Euler-Jacobi Theorem to make the dynamics B-integrable.</description>

      <title>Trimmed ergodic sums for non-integrable functions with power singularities over irrational rotations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studying Birkhoff sums of non-integrable functions involves the challenge of large observations depending on the sampled orbit, which prevents pointwise limit theorems. To address this issue, the largest observations are removed, this process is commonly known as trimming. While this method is well studied for independent identically distributed sequences and systems with strong mixing behaviour, this paper focuses on irrational rotations of $\mathbb{T}$. In this setting we establish trimmed weak and strong laws for the functions $\frac{1}{x}$ and $\frac{1}{x^{\beta}}$ with $\beta&gt;1$, providing explicit conditions on the rotation angle.</description>

      <title>Persistent homology of Morse decomposition in Markov chains based on combinatorial multivector fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel persistence framework for Morse decompositions in Markov chains using combinatorial multivector fields. Our approach provides a structured method to analyze recurrence and stability in finite-state stochastic processes. In our setting filtrations are governed by transition probabilities rather than spatial distances. We construct multivector fields directly from Markov transition matrices, treating states and transitions as elements of a directed graph. By applying Morse decomposition to the induced multivector field, we obtain a hierarchical structure of invariant sets that evolve under changes in transition probabilities. This structure naturally defines a persistence diagram, where each Morse set is indexed by its topological and dynamical complexity via homology and Conley index dimensions.</description>

      <title>Phase-preserving nonreciprocal dynamics in coupled nonlinear oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21901v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonreciprocity is most commonly associated with a large difference in the transmitted energy when the locations of the source and receiver are interchanged. This energy bias is accompanied by a difference in the transmitted phase. We highlight the role of this phase bias in breaking reciprocity in the steady-state vibration transmission characteristics of coupled nonlinear systems to external harmonic excitation. We show that breaking of reciprocity is most commonly accompanied by a simultaneous bias in the transmitted energy and phase. Energy bias alone, without any contribution from phase, can still lead to nonreciprocity, but only at very finely tuned system parameters. We provide a methodology for realizing response regimes of phase-preserving nonreciprocity using two independent symmetry-breaking parameters in the system. Our findings highlight the key contribution of phase in nonlinear nonreciprocity.</description>

      <title>Local Normalization Distortion and the Thermodynamic Formalism of Decoding Strategies for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advances in hardware and language model architecture have spurred a revolution in natural language generation. However, autoregressive models compute probability distributions over next-token choices, and sampling from these distributions, known as decoding, has received significantly less attention than other design choices. Existing decoding strategies are largely based on heuristics, resulting in methods that are hard to apply or improve in a principled manner. We develop the theory of decoding strategies for language models by expressing popular decoding algorithms as equilibrium states in the language of ergodic theory and stating the functions they optimize. Using this, we analyze the effect of the local normalization step of top-k, nucleus, and temperature sampling, used to make probabilities sum to one. We argue that local normalization distortion is a fundamental defect of decoding strategies and quantify the size of this distortion and its effect on mathematical proxies for the quality and diversity of generated text. Contrary to the prevailing explanation, we argue that the major cause of the under-performance of top-k sampling relative to nucleus sampling is local normalization distortion. This yields conclusions for the future design of decoding algorithms and the detection of machine-generated text.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define bounded cohomology of $t$-discrete measured groupoids with coefficients into measurable bundles of Banach spaces. Our approach via homological algebra extends the classic theory developed by Ivanov and by Monod. As a consequence, we show that the bounded cohomology of a $t$-discrete groupoid $\mathcal{G}$ can be computed using any amenable $\mathcal{G}$-space. In particular, we can compute bounded cohomology using strong boundaries.</description>

      <title>Koopman Reduced Order Modeling with Confidence Bounds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.13127v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a reduced order modeling technique based on Koopman operator theory that gives confidence bounds on the model's predictions. It is based on a data-driven spectral decomposition of the Koopman operator. The reduced order model is constructed using a finite number of Koopman eigenvalues and modes, while the rest of spectrum is treated as a noise process. This noise process is used to extract the confidence bounds. Additionally, we propose a heuristic algorithm to choose the number of deterministic modes to keep in the model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11734v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We settle two questions on sequence A120243 in the OEIS that were raised by Clark Kimberling and partly solve a conjecture of Van de Lune and Arias de Reyna. We extend Kimberling's questions to the framework of deterministic random walks, automatic sequences, and linear recurrences. Our results indicate that there may be a deeper connection between these structures. In particular, we conjecture that the records of deterministic random walks are $\xi$-Ostrowski automatic for a quadratic rotation number $\xi$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15175v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by partition regularity problems of homogeneous quadratic equations, we prove multiple recurrence and convergence results for multiplicative measure preserving actions with iterates given by rational sequences involving polynomials that factor into products of linear forms in two variables. We focus mainly on actions that are finitely generated, and the key tool in our analysis is a decomposition result for any bounded measurable function into a sum of two components, one that mimics concentration properties of pretentious multiplicative functions and another that mimics vanishing properties of aperiodic multiplicative functions. Crucial to part of our arguments are some new seminorms that are defined by a mixture of addition and multiplication of the iterates of the action, and we prove an inverse theorem that explicitly characterizes the factor of the system on which these seminorms vanish.</description>

Abstract: This paper describes extension of the Master Stability Function for arrays of non-smooth oscillators. This extension is based on the previously introduced Jacobi matrix estimation method, which can be applied to networks of non-smooth coupled oscillators. Proposed method and its limitations were described. Then the new algorithm was applied to calculate MSF for an impact oscillator. The results were presented and validated using an alternative MSF estimation method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13971v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With a mere usage of well-established properties of para-differential operators, the conjugacy equations in several model KAM problems are converted to para-homological equations solvable by standard fixed point argument. Such discovery greatly simplifies KAM proofs, renders the traditional KAM iteration steps unnecessary, and may suggest a systematic scheme of finding quasi-periodic solutions of realistic magnitude.</description>

      <title>Counting the number of $\mathcal{O}_{K}$-fixed points of a discrete dynamical system with applications from arithmetic statistics, II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11393v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this follow-up paper, we again study a surprising connection between the set of fixed points of a polynomial map $\varphi_{d, c}$ defined by $\varphi_{d, c}(z) = z^d + c$ for all $c, z \in \mathcal{O}_{K}$ and the coefficient $c$, where $K$ is any number field of degree $n&gt;1$ and $d&gt;2$ an integer. As in \cite{BK1}, we wish to study counting problems which are inspired by exciting advances in arithmetic statistics, and also partly by a point-counting result of Narkiewicz on real $K$-periodic points of any $\varphi_{p^{\ell}, c}$ in arithmetic dynamics. In doing so, we prove that for any given prime integer $p\geq 3$ and any integer $\ell \geq 1$, the average number of distinct integral fixed points of any $\varphi_{p^{\ell}, c}$ modulo a prime ideal $p\mathcal{O}_{K}$ where $K$ is a real algebraic number field of any degree $n\geq 2$ is $3$ or $0$, as $p$ tends to infinity. Motivated further by a $K$-rational periodic point-counting result of Benedetto on any $\varphi_{(p-1)^{\ell}, c}$ for any given prime integer $p\geq 5$ and $\ell \in \mathbb{Z}^{+}$ in arithmetic dynamics, we then also prove unconditionally that the average number of distinct integral fixed points of any $\varphi_{(p-1)^{\ell}, c}$ modulo a prime ideal $p\mathcal{O}_{K}$ where $K$ is any number field (not necessarily real) of degree $n\geq 2$ is $1$ or $2$ or $0$, as $p$ tends to infinity. Finally, we then apply counting and statistical results from arithmetic statistics to then deduce here several counting and statistical results; and among them includes applying here a more recent number field-counting result of Oliver Lemke-Thorne to bound above the number of number fields $K_{f}$ of degree $m:= np^{\ell}$ over $\mathbb{Q}$ with bounded discriminant; and similarly also bound above the number of number fields $L_{g}$ of degree $r:= n(p-1)^{\ell}$ over $\mathbb{Q}$ with bounded discriminant.</description>
