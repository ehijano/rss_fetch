      <title>Turning Up the Heat: Assessing 2-m Temperature Forecast Errors in AI Weather Prediction Models During Heat Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extreme heat is the deadliest weather-related hazard in the United States. Furthermore, it is increasing in intensity, frequency, and duration, making skillful forecasts vital to protecting life and property. Traditional numerical weather prediction (NWP) models struggle with extreme heat for medium-range and subseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S) timescales. Meanwhile, artificial intelligence-based weather prediction (AIWP) models are progressing rapidly. However, it is largely unknown how well AIWP models forecast extremes, especially for medium-range and S2S timescales. This study investigates 2-m temperature forecasts for 60 heat waves across the four boreal seasons and over four CONUS regions at lead times up to 20 days, using two AIWP models (Google GraphCast and Pangu-Weather) and one traditional NWP model (NOAA United Forecast System Global Ensemble Forecast System (UFS GEFS)). First, case study analyses show that both AIWP models and the UFS GEFS exhibit consistent cold biases on regional scales in the 5-10 days of lead time before heat wave onset. GraphCast is the more skillful AIWP model, outperforming UFS GEFS and Pangu-Weather in most locations. Next, the two AIWP models are isolated and analyzed across all heat waves and seasons, with events split among the model's testing (2018-2023) and training (1979-2017) periods. There are cold biases before and during the heat waves in both models and all seasons, except Pangu-Weather in winter, which exhibits a mean warm bias before heat wave onset. Overall, results offer encouragement that AIWP models may be useful for medium-range and S2S predictability of extreme heat.</description>

      <title>Induced Diffusion of Internal Gravity Waves: Directionality and Role in Ocean Mixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Induced diffusion (ID), an important mechanism of spectral energy transfer in the internal gravity wave (IGW) field, plays a significant role in driving turbulent dissipation in the ocean interior. In this study, we revisit the ID mechanism to elucidate its directionality and role in ocean mixing under varying IGW spectral forms, with particular attention to deviations from the standard Garrett-Munk (GM) spectrum. The original interpretation of ID as an action diffusion process, as proposed by McComas et al., suggests that ID is inherently bidirectional, with its direction governed by the vertical-wavenumber spectral slope $\sigma$ of the IGW action spectrum, $n \propto m^\sigma$. In contrast, by evaluating the wave kinetic equation, we reveal a more complete depiction of ID, comprising both diffusive and scale-separated transfers that are rooted in energy conservation within wave triads. Although the action diffusion may reverse direction depending on the sign of $\sigma$ (i.e., between red and blue spectral cases), the combined ID transfer consistently leads to a forward energy cascade at the dissipation scale, thereby contributing positively to turbulent dissipation. This supports the viewpoint of ID as a dissipative mechanism in physical oceanography. This study presents a physically grounded overview of ID and offers insights into the specific types of wave-wave interactions responsible for turbulent dissipation.</description>

      <title>Zero-Shot Super-Resolution from Unstructured Data Using a Transformer-Based Neural Operator for Urban Micrometeorology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study demonstrates that a transformer-based neural operator (TNO) can perform zero-shot super-resolution of two-dimensional temperature fields near the ground in urban areas. During training, super-resolution is performed from a horizontal resolution of 100 m to 20 m, while during testing, it is performed from 100 m to a finer resolution of 5 m. This setting is referred to as zero-shot, since no data with the target 5 m resolution are included in the training dataset. The 20 m and 5 m resolution data were independently obtained by dynamically downscaling the 100 m data using a physics-based micrometeorology model that resolves buildings. Compared to a convolutional neural network, the TNO more accurately reproduces temperature distributions at 5 m resolution and reduces test errors by approximately 33%. Furthermore, the TNO successfully performs zero-shot super-resolution even when trained with unstructured data, in which grid points are randomly arranged. These results suggest that the TNO recognizes building shapes independently of grid point locations and adaptively infers the temperature fields induced by buildings.</description>

      <title>Square Root Operators and the Well-Posedness of Pseudodifferential Parabolic Models of Wave Phenomena</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pseudodifferential parabolic equations with an operator square root arise in wave propagation problems as a one-way counterpart of the Helmholtz equation. The expression under the square root usually involves a differential operator and a known function. We discuss a rigorous definition of such operator square roots and show well-posedness of the pseudodifferential parabolic equation by using the theory of strongly continuous semigroups. This provides a justification for a family of widely-used numerical methods for wavefield simulations in various areas of physics.</description>

      <title>The U2H map explains the effect of (sub)mesoscale turbulence on significant wave height statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Currents modulate the energy of surface gravity waves, leading to spatial inhomogeneities in significant wave height (SWH). Previous work indicates that the overall scale of the inhomogeneities is set by the scale of the currents, that the inhomogeneities are strongly anisotropic even for isotropic currents, and that the rotational and divergent components of the currents have sharply distinct effects. We explain these and other features of current-induced SWH inhomogeneities using the U2H map, a linear relation between SWH and currents deduced from wave-action conservation by making simplifying assumptions. We obtain a linear law relating the spectrum of SWH to the spectra of rotational and divergent kinetic energy of the current. This makes it possible to relate SWH statistics (such as variance and anisotropy) to the current statistics and wave properties including directional spreading.</description>

      <title>A Case Study of the Tornadic Supercell in the Province of Pampanga, Philippines (27 May 2024)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20559v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study provides an integrated damage, visual, environmental, and remote sensing analysis of the tornado event that struck the suburb of Candating in Arayat, Pampanga on 27 May 2024. Satellite imagery and photographs of the damage indicate that the tornado caused EF2 damage on the Enhanced Fujita (EF) scale across a $\sim$2 km path. Videos of the tornado and its parent storm reveal a well-defined wall cloud and low-level mesocyclone, but without a sign of precipitation curtain, indicative of its low-precipitation mode. Subsequent radar analysis supports these and other tornadic supercell features. Mid- and upper-tropospheric synoptic-scale ascent was subtle, influenced by the approach of TC Ewiniar. However, a modest meridional flow aloft over the area provided sufficient deep-layer shear to support supercell development. The southwest monsoon acted as a low-level jet, promoting warm, moist advection into western Luzon. The supercell developed around mid-noon and was characterized by large-undiluted instability, attributed to steep low-level lapse rates. Although low-level shear and its associated near-surface horizontal vorticity were weak, the latter is highly streamwise allowing for efficient ingestion, tilting, and stretching into vertical vorticity, which aided in tornadogenesis. Both satellite and radar data suggest that storm interactions (i.e., nudging process) and terrain interactions with nearby Mt. Arayat may have contributed to the initiation and intensification of the supercell through lee-side convergence and enhancing vorticity. The complex tropical environment of the Candating, Arayat tornado mirrors several characteristics of well-documented North American tornadic environments. This highlights the need for more research into the atmospheric conditions conducive to tornadic activity in the Philippines.</description>

      <title>Examining Entropic Unbalanced Optimal Transport and Sinkhorn Divergences for Spatial Forecast Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16063v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An optimal transport (OT) problem seeks to find the cheapest mapping between two distributions with equal total density, given the cost of transporting density from one place to another. Unbalanced OT allows for different total density in each distribution. This is the typical setting for precipitation forecast and observation data, when considering the densities as accumulated rainfall, or intensity. In this work, entropic unbalanced OT and its associated Sinkhorn divergence are examined as a spatial forecast verification method for precipitation data. It offers many attractive features, such as morphing one field into another, defining a distance between fields and providing feature based optimal assignment. It is found that the Sinkhorn divergence is robust against the common double penalty problem (a form of phase error), on average aligns with expert assessments of model performance, and allows for a variety of novel pictorial illustrations of error. It provides informative summary scores, and has few limitations to its application. Combined, these findings place unbalanced entropy regularised optimal transport and the Sinkhorn divergence as an informative method which follows geometric intuition.</description>
