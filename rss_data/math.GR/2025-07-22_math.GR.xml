      <title>Multi-virtual braid groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: L. Kauffman (2024) introduced multi-virtual and symmetric multi-virtual braid groups, which are generalizations of the virtual braid group. We introduce multi-virtual pure and multi-virtual semi-pure braid groups, which are normal subgroups of index $n!$. We give a set of generators and defining relations for these groups, show that multi-virtual (symmetric multi-virtual) braid group is a semi-direct products of multi-virtual pure (symmetric multi-virtual pure) braid group and symmetric group. Also, we introduce multi-welded and multi-unrestricted braid groups and examines structure of three-strand 2-virtual braid group and some its subgroups and quotients. The paper concludes by outlining open problems and suggesting avenues for future research in this area.</description>

      <title>Relatively hyperbolic groups, Grothendieck pairs, and uncountable profinite ambiguity among fibre products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: These notes expand upon our lectures on {\em profinite rigidity} at the international colloquium on randomness, geometry and dynamics, organised by TIFR Mumbai at IISER Pune in January 2024. We are interested in the extent to which groups that arise in hyperbolic geometry and 3-manifold topology are determined by their finite quotients. The main theme of these notes is the radical extent to which rigidity is lost when one passes from consideration of groups with hyperbolic features to consideration of their direct products. We describe a general method for producing infinite sequences of {\em{Grothendieck pairs,}} i.e.~embeddings $P_i\hookrightarrow G\times G$ inducing isomorphisms of profinite completions, with $G$ fixed and $P_i$ finitely generated. In order to apply this method, one needs $G$ to map onto a subgroup of finite index in the commutator subgroup of a group $\Gamma$ with $H_2(\Gamma,\mathbb{Z})=0$, and $\Gamma$ should be relatively hyperbolic. By exploiting the flexibility of the construction, we explain how, under the same hypotheses on $G$, one can construct {\em uncountable families} of pairwise non-isomorphic subgroups $P_\lambda$ such that $P_\lambda\hookrightarrow G\times G$ induces an isomorphism of profinite completions. Examples of groups $G$ satisfying these conditions include the fundamental group of the Weeks manifold and the fundamental group of the 4-fold branch cover of the figure-8 knot complement. Both of these examples are profinitely rigid in the absolute sense and in each case Grothendieck pairs account entirely for the loss of profinite rigidity for $G\times G$: if $H$ is a finitely generated group whose profinite completion is isomorphic to that of $G\times G$, then there is an embedding $H\hookrightarrow G\times G$ that is a Grothendieck pair.</description>

      <title>On oriented $m$-semiregular representations of finite groups about valency three</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a group and $m$ a positive integer. We say an $m$-Cayley digraph $\Gamma$ over $G$ is a digraph that admits a group of automorphisms isomorphic to $G$ acting semiregularly on the vertex set with $m$ orbits. The digraph $\Sigma$ is $k$-regular if there exists a non-negative integer $k$ such that every vertex has out-valency and in-valency equal to $k$. All digraphs considered in this paper are regular. We say that $G$ admits an oriented $m$-semiregular representation (abbreviated as OmSR) if there exists a regular $m$-Cayley digraph $\Gamma$ over $G$ such that $\Gamma$ is oriented and its automorphism group is isomorphic to $G$. In particular, an O1SR is called an ORR. Xia et al. \cite{x2} provided a classification of finite simple groups admitting an ORR of valency 2. Furthermore, in 2022, Du et al. \cite{du2} proved that most finite simple groups admit an OmSR of valency 2 for $m \geq 2$, except for a few exceptional cases. In this paper, we classify the finite groups generated by at most two elements that admit an OmSR of valency 3 for $m \geq 2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a probability measure on a finitely generated group, the local limit problem consists in finding asymptotics of $p_n(e,e)$, the probability that the random walk at time $n$ is at the origin. We give the classification of all possible local limit theorems, up to bounded error, for finitely supported, symmetric, admissible probability measures on a relatively hyperbolic group with respect to virtually nilpotent subgroups.</description>

      <title>Normal 2-coverings in affine groups of small dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A finite group $G$ admits a normal $2$-covering if there exist two proper subgroups $H$ and $K$ with $G=\bigcup_{g\in G}H^g\cup\bigcup_{g\in G}K^g$. For determining inductively the finite groups admitting a normal $2$-covering, it is important to determine all finite groups $G$ possessing a normal $2$-covering, where no proper quotient of $G$ admits such a covering.
  Using terminology arising from the O'Nan-Scott theorem, Garonzi and Lucchini have shown that these groups fall into four natural classes: product action, almost simple, affine and diagonal.
  In this paper, we start a preliminary investigation of the affine case.</description>

      <title>A Recursive Lie-Group Formulation for the Second-Order Time Derivatives of the Inverse Dynamics of parallel Kinematic Manipulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14274v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Series elastic actuators (SEA) were introduced for serial robotic arms. Their model-based trajectory tracking control requires the second time derivatives of the inverse dynamics solution, for which algorithms were proposed. Trajectory control of parallel kinematics manipulators (PKM) equipped with SEAs has not yet been pursued. Key element for this is the computationally efficient evaluation of the second time derivative of the inverse dynamics solution. This has not been presented in the literature, and is addressed in the present paper for the first time. The special topology of PKM is exploited reusing the recursive algorithms for evaluating the inverse dynamics of serial robots. A Lie group formulation is used and all relations are derived within this framework. Numerical results are presented for a 6-DOF Gough-Stewart platform (as part of an exoskeleton), and for a planar PKM when a flatness-based control scheme is applied.</description>

      <title>On the subdirect product of graph bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The subdirect product of two finite groups $A$ and $B$ is defined as a subgroup of the direct product $A \times B$, which is a well-known notion in finite group theory. While it is clear that, under appropriate choices of sets of generators $S$, $S_A$ and $S_B$, the Cayley graph $Cay(A \times B, S)$ corresponds to the Cartesian product $Cay(A, S_A) \square Cay(B, S_B)$ of two graphs, there is no analogue at the level of graph product that reflects the notion of subdirect product of groups. This is precisely the problem which we discuss here. By using the concept of graph bundles and the corresponding pullbacks, we introduce an operation on graph bundles such that the Cayley graph of the subdirect product of two groups can be described as the total space of the product of the Cayley graphs. This allows us to define the so-called ``network $K$-theory group of a graph'', inspired by the notion of topological $K$-theory, and we are able to investigate an interesting functor from the category of graphs to the category of abelian groups.</description>

      <title>Representation theory of monoids consisting of order-preserving functions and order-reversing functions on an n-set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\operatorname{OD}_{n}$ be the monoid of all order-preserving functions and order-reversing functions on the set $\{1,\ldots,n\}$. We describe a quiver presentation for the monoid algebra $\Bbbk\operatorname{OD}_{n}$ where $\Bbbk$ is a field whose characteristic is not 2. We show that the quiver consists of two straightline paths, one with $n-1$ vertices and one with $n$ vertices, and that all compositions of consecutive arrows are equal to $0$. As part of the proof we obtain a complete description of all homomorphisms between induced left Sch\"utzenberger modules of $\Bbbk\operatorname{OD}_{n}$. We also define $\operatorname{COD}_{n}$ to be a covering of $\operatorname{OD}_{n}$ with an artificial distinction between order-preserving and order-reversing constant functions. We show that $\operatorname{COD}_{n}\simeq\operatorname{O}_{n}\rtimes\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ where $\operatorname{O}_{n}$ is the monoid of all order-preserving functions on the set $\{1,\ldots,n\}$. Moreover, if $\Bbbk$ is a field whose characteristic is not $2$ we prove that $\Bbbk\operatorname{COD}_{n}\simeq\Bbbk\operatorname{O}_{n}\times\Bbbk\operatorname{O}_{n}$. As a corollary, we deduce that the quiver of $\Bbbk\operatorname{COD}_{n}$ consists of two straightline paths with n vertices, and that all compositions of consecutive arrows are equal to $0$.</description>

      <title>Twin groups representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct two representations of the twin group $T_n, n\geq 2$, namely $\eta_1: T_n \rightarrow \text{Aut}(\mathbb{F}_n)$ and $\eta_2: T_n \rightarrow \text{GL}_n(\mathbb{Z}[t^{\pm 1}])$, where $\mathbb{F}_n$ is a free group with $n$ generators and $t$ is indeterminate. We then analyze some characteristics of these two representations, such as irreducibility and faithfulness. Moreover, we prove that both representations can be extended to the virtual twin group $VT_n$ in the $2$-local extension way, for $n\geq 2$, and we find their $2$-local extensions. On the other hand, we obtain a different result for the welded twin group $WT_n$. More deeply, we show that $\eta_1$ cannot be extended to $WT_n$ in the $2$-local extension way, for $n\geq 3$, while $\eta_2$ can be extended to $WT_n$ in the $2$-local extension way, for $n\geq 2$, and we find its $2$-local extensions.</description>

Abstract: The Cremona dimension of a group $G$ is the minimal $n$ such that $G$ is isomorphic to a subgroup of the Cremona group of birational transformations of an $n$-dimensional rational variety. In this survey article, we give many examples that gives evidence to the conjecture that the Cremona dimension of a finite group over the field of complex numbers is less than or equal to the essential dimension of the group.</description>

Abstract: We prove that the Higman-Thompson groups $T_n$ and $V_n$ are non-inner amenable for all $n\ge 2$. This extends Haagerup and Olesen's result that Thompson's groups $T=T_2$ and $V=V_2$ are non-inner amenable. Their proof relied on machinery only available in the $n=2$ case, namely Thurston's piecewise-projective model for Thompson's group $T$, so our approach necessarily utilizes different tools. This also provides an alternate proof of Haagerup-Olesen's result when $n=2$.</description>

      <title>Uniform finite presentation for groups of polynomial growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.12428v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a quantitative refinement of the statement that groups of polynomial growth are finitely presented. Let $G$ be a group with finite generating set $S$ and let $\operatorname{Gr}(r)$ be the volume of the ball of radius $r$ in the associated Cayley graph. For each $k \geq 0$, let $R_k$ be the set of words of length at most $2^k$ in the free group $F_S$ that are equal to the identity in $G$, and let $\langle \langle R_k \rangle\rangle$ be the normal subgroup of $F_S$ generated by $R_k$, so that the quotient map $F_S/\langle\langle R_k\rangle\rangle \to G$ induces a covering map of the associated Cayley graphs that has injectivity radius at least $2^{k-1}-1$. Given a non-negative integer $k$, we say that $(G,S)$ has a new relation on scale k if $\langle\langle R_{k+1} \rangle\rangle \neq \langle\langle R_{k} \rangle\rangle$. We prove that for each $K&lt;\infty$ there exist constants $n_0$ and $C$ depending only on $K$ and $|S|$ such that if $\operatorname{Gr}(3n)\leq K \operatorname{Gr}(n)$ for some $n\geq n_0$, then there exist at most $C$ scales $k\geq \log_2 (n)$ on which $G$ has a new relation. We apply this result in a forthcoming paper as part of our proof of Schramm's locality conjecture in percolation theory.</description>

      <title>Regular bi-interpretability and finite axiomatizability of Chevalley groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.01954v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we consider Chevalley groups over commutative rings with~$1$, constructed by irreducible root systems of rank $&gt;1$. We always suppose that for the systems $A_2, B_\ell, C_\ell, F_4, G_2$ our rings contain $1/2$ and for the system $G_2$ also $1/3$. Under these assumptions we prove that the central quotients of Chevalley groups are regularly bi-interpretable with the corresponding rings, the class of all central quotients of Chevalley groups of a given type is elementarily definable and even finitely axiomatizable (see Definition~2.2). The same holds for adjoint Chevalley groups and for bondedly generated Chevalley groups. We also give an example of Chevalley group with infinite center, which is not bi-interpretable with the corresponding ring and is elementarily equivalent to a group that is not a Chevalley group itself.</description>

      <title>Rigidity of proper almost-homogeneous domains in positive flag manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18747v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that, inside the Shilov boundary of any given Hermitian symmetric space of tube type, there is, up to isomorphism, only one proper domain such that every point on its boundary belongs to the closure of an orbit under its automorphism group. This gives a classification of all closed proper manifolds locally modelled on such Shilov boundaries, and provides a positive answer, in the case of flag manifolds admitting a $\Theta$-positive structure, to a rigidity question of Limbeek and Zimmer.</description>

      <title>Short hierarchically hyperbolic groups I: uncountably many coarse median structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09232v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that the mapping class group of a sphere with five punctures admits uncountably many non-equivalent, coarsely equivariant coarse median structures, falsifying a folklore belief. The same is shown for right-angled Artin groups whose defining graphs are connected, triangle- and square-free, and have at least three vertices. Remarkably, in the latter case the coarse medians we produce are not induced by cocompact cubulations. In the process, we develop the theory of short hierarchically hyperbolic groups (HHGs), which also include Artin groups of large and hyperbolic type, graph manifolds groups, and extensions of Veech groups. We develop tools to modify their hierarchical structure, including using quasimorphisms to construct quasilines that serve as coordinate spaces, and this is where the abundance of coarse median structures comes from. These techniques are of independent interest, and we use them in a forthcoming paper to study quotients of short HHGs.</description>

      <title>Cartesian subgroups in graph products of groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19764v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The kernel of the natural projection of a graph product of groups onto their direct product is called the Cartesian subgroup of the graph product. This construction generalises commutator subgroups of right-angled Coxeter and Artin groups. Using theory of polyhedral products, we give a lower and an upper bound on the number of relations in presentations of Cartesian groups and on their deficiency. The bounds are related to the fundamental groups of full subcomplexes in the clique complex, and the lower bound coincide with the upper bound if these fundamental groups are free or free abelian.
  Following Li Cai's approach, we also describe an algorithm that computes "small" presentations of Cartesian subgroups.</description>

      <title>Good involutions of conjugation subquandles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08090v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Posed by Taniguchi, the classification of quandles with good involutions is a difficult question with applications to surface-knot theory. We address this question for subquandles of conjugation quandles, including all core quandles. We also study good involutions of faithful racks. In particular, we obtain sharp bounds on the number of good involutions of racks in these families.
  As an application of our results, we implement group-theoretic algorithms that compute all good involutions of conjugation quandles and core quandles; we provide data for those up to order 23. As another application, we construct infinite families of connected, noninvolutive symmetric quandles.
  We also classify symmetric and Legendrian racks, quandles, and kei up to order 8 using a computer search. Finally, we exhibit an equivalence of categories between racks and Legendrian racks that induces an equivalence between involutory racks, Legendrian kei, and symmetric kei.</description>

      <title>On Structural Properties and Adjacency Spectrum of Coprime Graph of Integers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10583v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $TCG_n$ denote the coprime graph having vertex set $\{1,2,\ldots,n\}$ with any two vertices $i,j$ being adjacent if and only if $\gcd(i,j)=1$. In this article, we first study some structural properties of $TCG_n$. We study the vertex connectivity and crossing number of the coprime graph of integers. We discover a lower constraint on the multiplicity of $-1$, which appears as an eigenvalue in the adjacency matrix of $TCG_n$. We demonstrate our findings with a variety of cases. We also show that the adjacency matrix of $TCG_n$ is singular, i.e. has determinant $0$. Furthermore, we give a lower bound on the multiplicity of $0$, which appears as an eigenvalue in the adjacency matrix of $TCG_n$. Finally, we establish that the greatest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix of $TCG_n$ is always above $2.$</description>

      <title>Abelianization of $\text{SL}_2$ over Dedekind domains of arithmetic type</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.12638v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We determine the exact group structure of the abelianization of $\text{SL}_2(A)$, where $A$ is a Dedekind domain of arithmetic type with infinitely many units. In particular, our results show that $\text{SL}_2(A)^\text{ab}$ is finite, with exponent dividing $12$ when $\text{char}(A)=0$, and dividing $6$ when $\text{char}(A)&gt;0$. As illustrative cases, we compute $\text{SL}_2(A)^\text{ab}$ explicitly for instances where $A$ is the ring of integers of a real quadratic field or a cyclotomic extension.</description>

      <title>Linear Geometry and Algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14060v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Linear Geometry studies geometric properties which can be expressed via the notion of a line. All information about lines is encoded in a ternary relation called a line relation. A set endowed with a line relation is called a liner. So, Linear Geometry studies liners. Imposing some additional axioms on a liner, we obtain some special classes of liners: regular, projective, affine, proaffine, etc. Linear Geometry includes Affine and Projective Geometries and is a part of Incidence Geometry. The aim of this book is to present a self-contained logical development of Linear Geometry, starting with some intuitive acceptable geometric axioms and ending with algebraic structures that necessarily arise from studying the structure of geometric objects that satisfy those simple and intuitive geometric axioms. We shall meet many quite exotic algebraic structures that arise this way: magmas, loops, ternars, quasi-fields, alternative rings, procorps, profields, etc. We strongly prefer (synthetic) geometric proofs and use tools of analytic geometry only when no purely geometric proof is available. Liner Geometry has been developed by many great mathematicians since times of Antiquity (Thales, Euclides, Proclus, Pappus), through Renaissance (Descartes, Desargues), Early Modernity (Playfair, Gauss, Lobachevski, Bolyai, Poncelet, Steiner, M\"obius), Late Modernity Times (Steinitz, Klein, Hilbert, Moufang, Hessenberg, Jordan, Beltrami, Fano, Gallucci, Veblen, Wedderburn, Lenz, Barlotti) till our contempories (Hartshorne, Hall, Buekenhout, Gleason, Kantor, Doyen, Hubault, Dembowski, Klingenberg, Grundh\"ofer).</description>

      <title>Note on the linearisation of finite abelian groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13047v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: If $K$ is a field with enough roots of unity and $V$ an abelian group, the $K$-algebra $K[V]$ of the group $V$ is split semisimple, so that the canonical morphism $K[V]\to K^{V^\sharp}$, where $V^\sharp$ denotes the dual group of $V$ (which may be seen as Hom$(V,K^\times)$), is an isomorphism of $K$-algebras. If one removes the assumption that $K$ has enough roots of unity, one can easily deduce from it (by using a base change and Krull-Schmidt) that it remains a $K$-linear isomorphism $K[V]\xrightarrow{\simeq} K^{V^\sharp}$ natural in the group $V$ if one restricts to finite groups $V$ canceled by a fixed nonzero integer. The question of whether such an isomorphism, natural in the abelian group $V$, still exists without any other restriction than $V$ is finite and its order is invertible in $K$, is less obvious; we solve it positively, in a somewhat more general setting ($K$ being any commutative ring), by using Gauss sums. We also explore some related functorial questions.</description>
