      <title>Rayleigh-Taylor, Kelvin-Helmholtz and immiscible to miscible quenching instabilities in binary Bose-Einstein condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate three kinds of instabilities in binary immiscible homogeneous Bose-Einstein condensate, considering rubidium isotopes $^{85}$Rb and $^{87}$Rb confined in two-dimensional circular box. Rayleigh-Taylor (RT) and Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) instability types are studied under strong perturbations. Without external perturbation, instabilities are also probed by immiscible to miscible quenching transition (IMQT), under two different initial configurations. Our numerical simulations show that all such instability dynamics are dominated by large vortex productions and sound-wave (phonon) propagations. For long-term propagation, vortex dynamics become dominant over sound waves in the KH instability, while sound wave excitations predominate in the other cases. For all the dynamical simulations, the emergence of possible scaling laws are investigated for the compressible and incompressible parts of the kinetic energy spectra, in terms of the wave number $k$. The corresponding results are compared with the classical Kolmogorov scalings, $k^{-5/3}$ and $k^{-3}$, for turbulence, which are observed in the kinetic energy spectra at some specific time intervals. Deviating from the classical scaling, a kind of ``Bottleneck effect" is noticed in the IMQT spectra.</description>

      <title>Complexity of Bose-Einstein condensates at finite temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the geometric quantum complexity of Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) at finite temperature. Specifically, we use the Bures and Sj\"oqvist metrics -- generalizations of the Fubini-Study metric for mixed quantum states, as well as the Nielsen geometric complexity approach based on purification of mixed states. Starting from the Bogoliubov Hamiltonian of BEC, which exhibits an $SU(1,1)$ symmetry, we explicitly derive and compare the complexities arising from these three distinct measures. For the Bures and Sj\"oqvist metrics, analytical and numerical evaluations of the corresponding geodesics are provided, revealing characteristic scaling behaviors with respect to temperature. In the Nielsen complexity approach, we rigorously handle the gauge freedoms associated with mixed state purification and non-uniqueness unitary operations, demonstrating that the resulting complexity aligns precisely with the Bures metric. Our work provides a compara</description>

      <title>Non-Bloch edge dynamics of non-Hermitian lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The non-Hermitian skin effect, i.e., the localization of nominally bulk modes, not only drastically reshapes the spectral properties of non-Hermitian systems, but also dramatically modifies the real-time dynamics therein. Here we investigate the time evolution of waves (or quantum-mechanical particles) initialized around the edge of non-Hermitian lattices. The non-Hermitian skin effect tends to localize the wave to the edge, meaning that the real-time dynamics differs from the Bloch-theory picture. We focus on the long-time decay or growth rate of wave function, which is quantified by the Lyapunov exponents. These exponents can be obtained from the saddle points in the complex momentum space. We propose an efficient yet unambiguous criterion for identifying the dominant saddle point that determines the Lyapunov exponents. Our criterion can be precisely formulated in terms of a mathematical concept known as the Lefschetz thimble. Counterintuitively, the seemingly natural criterion based on the imaginary part of the energy fails. Our work provides a coherent theory for characterizing the real-time edge dynamics of non-Hermitian lattices. Our predictions are testable in various non-Hermitian physical platforms.</description>

      <title>Engineering anisotropic Dicke model with dipole-dipole interaction for Rydberg atom arrays in cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The anisotropic Dicke model reveals the important role that counter-rotating wave terms play in the coupling between light and two level atoms. It is intriguing to generate the model to the strongly correlated many body case, where the competition between atomic interaction and light-atom coupling will induce exotic phenomenon. In this paper, we provide a periodically driving method for engineering an anisotropic Dicke model with strong dipole-dipole interaction between atoms based on Rydberg atom arrays in cavity. By modulating the pumping laser, the ratio of counter-rotating wave terms to rotating ones could be tuned from zero to infinity. As an illustrative example, the superiority of this tunability in the adiabatic state preparation is revealed. Our engineered model provides an extensive foundation for subsequet research of quantum simulation, many-body physics and even information processing.</description>

      <title>Magnetotransport of tomographic electrons in a channel</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14431v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hydrodynamics is a new paradigm of electron transport in high-mobility devices, where frequent electron collisions give rise to a collective electron flow profile. However, conventional descriptions of these flows, which are based on the fluid equations for a classical gas extended to include impurity scattering, do not account for the distinct collisional relaxation in quantum-mechanical systems. In particular, by dint of Pauli blocking even modes of the distribution function relax over significantly shorter length scales than odd modes (dubbed the ``tomographic'' effect). We establish an analytical description of tomographic electron flow in a channel, and find four new distinguishing features: (i) Non-equilibrium effects from the boundaries penetrate significantly deeper into the flow domain; (ii) an additional velocity slip condition leads to a significant increase in the channel conductance; (iii) bulk rarefaction corrections decrease the curvature of the velocity profile in the channel center; and (iv) all these anomalous transport effects are rapidly suppressed with magnetic fields. The latter effect leads to a non-monotonic magneto-conductance, which can be used to measure both the even- and odd-mode mean free paths. Our asymptotic results unveil the underlying physics of tomographic flows and provide an alternative to numerical solutions of the Fermi-liquid equations.</description>

      <title>Tomographic electron flow in confined geometries: Beyond the dual-relaxation time approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hydrodynamic-like electron flows are typically modeled using the Stokes-Ohm equation or a kinetic description that is based on a dual-relaxation time approximation. Such models assume a short intrinsic mean free path $\ell_e$ due to momentum-conserving electronic scattering and a large extrinsic mean free path $\ell_\text{MR}$ due to momentum-relaxing impurity scattering. This assumption, however, is overly simplistic and falls short at low temperatures, where it is known from exact diagonalization studies of the electronic collision integral that another large electronic mean free path $\ell_o$ emerges, which describes long-lived odd electron modes -- this is sometimes known as the tomographic effect. Here, using a matched asymptotic expansion of the Fermi liquid kinetic equation that includes different electron relaxation times, we derive a general asymptotic theory for tomographic flows in arbitrary smooth boundary geometries. Our key results are a set of governing equations for the electron density and electron current, their slip boundary conditions and boundary layer corrections near diffuse edges. We find that the tomographic effect strongly modifies previous hydrodynamic theories for electron flows: In particular, we find that (i) an equilibrium is established in the bulk, where the flow is governed by Stokes-Ohm like equations with significant finite-wavelength corrections, (ii) the velocity slip conditions for these equations are strongly modified from the widely-used hydrodynamic slip-length condition (iii) a large kinetic boundary layer arises near diffuse boundaries of width $\sim\sqrt{\ell_e \ell_o}$, and (iv) all these effects are strongly suppressed by an external magnetic field. We illustrate our findings for electron flow in a channel. The equations derived here represent the fundamental governing equations for tomographic electron flow in arbitrary smooth geometries.</description>

      <title>Mean-Field Dynamics of the Bose-Hubbard Model in High Dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05304v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Bose-Hubbard model effectively describes bosons on a lattice with on-site interactions and nearest-neighbour hopping, serving as a foundational framework for understanding strong particle interactions and the superfluid to Mott insulator transition. This paper aims to rigorously establish the validity of a mean-field approximation for the dynamics of quantum systems in high dimension, using the Bose-Hubbard model on a square lattice as a case study. We prove a trace norm estimate between the one-lattice-site reduced density of the Schr\"odinger dynamics and the mean-field dynamics in the limit of large dimension. Here, the mean-field approximation is in the hopping amplitude and not in the interaction, leading to a very rich and non-trivial mean-field equation. This mean-field equation does not only describe the condensate, as is the case when the mean-field description comes from a large particle number limit averaging out the interaction, but it allows for a phase transition to a Mott insulator since it contains the full non-trivial interaction. Our work is a rigorous justification of a simple case of the highly successful dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) for bosons, which somewhat surprisingly yields many qualitatively correct results in three dimensions.</description>

      <title>Superdiffusion, normal diffusion and chaos in semiclassical Bose-Hubbard chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19584v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the evolution of two-point correlation functions of one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model in the semiclassical regime in the framework of Truncated Wigner Approximation (TWA) with quantum jumps as first-order corrections. At early times, the correlation functions show strong superdiffusion with universal integer exponents determined solely by the initial conditions and completely insensitive to system parameters and chaos. Only after a long time this regime crosses over to normal diffusion regime which is most robust when nonintegrability is strong. For strong nonintegrability, the system ends up in a homogeneous state while for weak nonintegrability the oscillations and inhomogeneities persist, despite the fact that chaos is nearly always strong and only weakly depends on nonintegrability parameter. We conclude that the superidiffusive regime is neither prethermalized nor a precursor to thermalization but a novel early-time phenomenon related to a special scaling symmetry of the Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian.</description>
