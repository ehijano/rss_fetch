      <title>Status of the Proton EDM Experiment (pEDM)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Proton EDM Experiment (pEDM) is the first direct search for the proton electric dipole moment (EDM) with the aim of being the first experiment to probe the Standard Model (SM) prediction of any particle EDM. Phase-I of pEDM will achieve $10^{-29} e\cdot$cm, improving current indirect limits by four orders of magnitude. This will establish a new standard of precision in nucleon EDM searches and offer a unique sensitivity to better understand the Strong CP problem. The experiment is ideally positioned to explore physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM), with sensitivity to axionic dark matter via the signal of an oscillating proton EDM and across a wide mass range of BSM models from $\mathcal{O}(1\text{GeV})$ to $\mathcal{O}(10^3\text{TeV})$. Utilizing the frozen-spin technique in a highly symmetric storage ring that leverages existing infrastructure at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL), pEDM builds upon the technological foundation and experimental expertise of the highly successful Muon $g$$-$$2$ Experiments. With significant R\&amp;D and prototyping already underway, pEDM is preparing a conceptual design report (CDR) to offer a cost-effective, high-impact path to discovering new sources of CP violation and advancing our understanding of fundamental physics. It will play a vital role in complementing the physics goals of the next-generation collider while simultaneously contributing to sustaining particle physics research and training early career researchers during gaps between major collider operations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this contribution, we evaluate the sensitivity for particles with charges much smaller than the electron charge with a dedicated scintillator-based detector in the far forward region at the CERN LHC, FORMOSA. This contribution will outline the scientific case for this detector, its design and potential locations, and the sensitivity that can be achieved.

      <title>Combination and interpretation of differential Higgs boson production cross sections in proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precision measurements of Higgs boson differential production cross sections are a key tool to probe the properties of the Higgs boson and test the standard model. New physics can affect both Higgs boson production and decay, leading to deviations from the distributions that are expected in the standard model. In this paper, combined measurements of differential spectra in a fiducial region matching the experimental selections are performed, based on analyses of four Higgs boson decay channels ($\gamma\gamma$, ZZ$^{(*)}$, WW$^{(*)}$, and $\tau\tau$) using proton-proton collision data recorded with the CMS detector at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 138 fb$^{-1}$. The differential measurements are extrapolated to the full phase space and combined to provide the differential spectra. A measurement of the total Higgs boson production cross section is also performed using the $\gamma\gamma$ and ZZ decay channels, with a result of 53.4$^{+2.9}_{-2.9}$ (stat)$^{+1.9}_{-1.8}$ (syst) pb, consistent with the standard model prediction of 55.6 $\pm$ 2.5 pb. The fiducial measurements are used to compute limits on Higgs boson couplings using the $\kappa$-framework and the SM effective field theory.</description>

      <title>Absorption of Fermionic Dark Matter in the PICO-60 C$_{3}$F$_{8}$ Bubble Chamber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fermionic dark matter absorption on nuclear targets via neutral current interactions is explored using a non-relativistic effective field theory framework. An analysis of data from the PICO-60 C$_{3}$F$_{8}$ bubble chamber sets leading constraints on spin-independent absorption for dark matter masses below 23 MeV/$\textit{c}^2$ and establishes the first limits on spin-dependent absorptive interactions. These results demonstrate the sensitivity of bubble chambers to low-mass dark matter and underscore the importance of absorption searches in expanding the parameter space of direct detection experiments.</description>

      <title>Transfer learning empowers material Z classification with muon tomography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12305v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmic-ray muon sources exhibit distinct scattering angle distributions when interacting with materials of different atomic numbers (Z values), facilitating the identification of various Z-class materials, particularly those radioactive high-Z nuclear elements. Most of the traditional identification methods are based on complex muon event reconstruction and trajectory fitting processes. Supervised machine learning methods offer some improvement but rely heavily on prior knowledge of target materials, significantly limiting their practical applicability in detecting concealed materials. For the first time, transfer learning is introduced into the field of muon tomography in this work. We propose two lightweight neural network models for fine-tuning and adversarial transfer learning, utilizing muon tomography data of bare materials to predict the Z-class of coated materials. By employing the inverse cumulative distribution function method, more accurate scattering angle distributions could be obtained from limited data, leading to an improvement by nearly 4\% in prediction accuracy compared with the traditional random sampling based training. When applied to coated materials with limited labeled or even unlabeled muon tomography data, the proposed method achieves an overall prediction accuracy exceeding 96\%, with high-Z materials reaching nearly 99\%. Simulation results indicate that transfer learning improves prediction accuracy by approximately 10\% compared to direct prediction without transfer. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of transfer learning in overcoming the physical challenges associated with limited labeled/unlabeled data, highlights the promising potential of transfer learning in the field of muon tomography.</description>

      <title>Transforming Simulation to Data Without Pairing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12343v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore a generative machine learning-based approach for estimating multi-dimensional probability density functions (PDFs) in a target sample using a statistically independent but related control sample - a common challenge in particle physics data analysis. The generative model must accurately reproduce individual observable distributions while preserving the correlations between them, based on the input multidimensional distribution from the control sample. Here we present a conditional normalizing flow model (CNF) based on a chain of bijectors which learns to transform unpaired simulation events to data events. We assess the performance of the CNF model in the context of LHC Higgs to diphoton analysis, where we use the CNF model to convert a Monte Carlo diphoton sample to one that models data. We show that the CNF model can accurately model complex data distributions and correlations. We also leverage the recently popularized Modified Differential Multiplier Method (MDMM) to improve the convergence of our model and assign physical meaning to usually arbitrary loss-function parameters.</description>

      <title>Factorization for Collider Dataspace Correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A metric on the space of collider physics data enables analysis of its geometrical properties, like dimensionality or curvature, as well as quantifying the density with which a finite, discrete ensemble of data samples the space. We provide the first systematically-improvable precision calculations on this dataspace, presenting predictions resummed to next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy, using the Spectral Energy Mover's Distance (SEMD) as its metric. This is accomplished by demonstration of factorization of soft and collinear contributions to the metric at leading power and renormalization group evolution of the single-scale functions that are present in the factorization theorem. As applications of this general framework, we calculate the two-point correlator between pairs of jets on the dataspace, and the measure of the non-Gaussian fluctuations in a finite dataset. For the non-Gaussianities, our calculations validate the existence of a universal structure that had been previously observed in simulated data. As byproducts of this analysis, we also calculate the two-loop anomalous dimension of the SEMD metric and show that the original Energy Mover's Distance metric is identical to the SEMD through next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy.</description>

      <title>Tests of quantum contextuality in particle physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum contextuality refers to the impossibility of assigning a predefined, intrinsic value to a physical property of a system independently of the context in which the property is measured. It is, perhaps, the most fundamental feature of quantum mechanics. The many states with different spin that particle physics provides are the ideal setting for testing contextuality. We verify that the polarization states of single spin-1 massive particles produced at colliders are contextual. We test $W^{+}$ gauge bosons produced in top-quark decays, $J/\psi$ and $K^{*}(892)^0$ mesons in $B$-meson decays and $\phi$ mesons in $\chi^0_c$ and $\chi^1_c$ charmonium decays by reinterpreting the data and the analyses of the ATLAS, LHCb, Belle II and BESIII experimental collaborations, respectively. The polarization states of these four particles show contextuality with a significance larger than $5\sigma$. We also discuss the presence of quantum contextuality in spin states of bipartite systems formed by spin-1/2 particles. We test $\Lambda$ and $\Sigma$ baryons reinterpreting two BESIII data analyses, and pairs of top quarks utilizing a recent analysis of the CMS collaboration. Quantum contextuality is present with a significance exceeding $5\sigma$ also in these cases. In addition, we study the feasibility of testing quantum contextuality by means of $Z$ boson production in association with the Higgs boson, $Z$ and $W$ bosons pairs created in Higgs boson decays and with pairs of $\tau$ leptons. For the latter, we use Monte Carlo simulations that mimic the settings of SuperKEKB and of future lepton colliders. Experiments at high energies, though not designed for the purpose, perform surprisingly well in testing for quantum contextuality.</description>

      <title>Natural complex plane for kaon CKM data: framework, status and future</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kaon physics can be used to independently determine three out of the four parameters of the CKM matrix, without any B physics input. Treating one parameter, $|V_{us}|$, or alternatively Wolfenstein $\lambda$, as well known, we show that the natural plane for the presentation of kaon CKM information is spanned by the combinations $\left(A^2(1-\hat\rho),\, A^2 \hat\eta\right)$. In this way, the use of B physics inputs is avoided, as well as the artificial inflation of errors due to parametric uncertainties, mainly due to $|V_{cb}|$. We show that the current status of kaon CKM constraints, impacted by recent advances in measurement and theory, is characterized by four allowed regions, and find that incoming data will inevitably disfavor a number of them, either confirming the CKM paradigm as dominant, or discovering a departure from the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>$D \bar D_1(2420)$ and $D^* \bar D^*(2400)$ molecular states: Probing their electromagnetic fingerprints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12694v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As in previous decades, a comprehensive understanding of the intricate internal configuration of hadrons continues to be a central objective within both experimental and theoretical hadron physics. This pursuit plays a pivotal role in advancing our knowledge of QCD and critically evaluating the robustness and accuracy of the theoretical models developed to date. Furthermore, deciphering the underlying mechanisms of exotic states, both those currently observed and those anticipated in future experiments, remains a pressing and unresolved challenge. Motivated by this, in the present study, we investigate the electromagnetic properties of the $D \bar D_1(2420)$ and $D^* \bar D^*(2400)$ molecular tetraquark states with quantum numbers $J^{PC} = 1^{--}$, using the QCD light-cone sum rule method. These states are analyzed within a hadronic molecular framework, where their magnetic and quadrupole moments are computed to probe internal structure and geometric deformation. Our results reveal distinct electromagnetic signatures, with the magnetic moments primarily dominated by light-quark contributions, and the quadrupole moments suggesting an oblate charge distribution. The findings are compared with prior studies assuming compact tetraquark configurations, emphasizing the sensitivity of electromagnetic observables to the underlying hadronic structure. This analysis provides critical insights into the nature of exotic hadrons and contributes to the broader understanding of QCD dynamics in the non-perturbative regime.</description>

      <title>New Frontiers in Muon-Spin Spectroscopy Using Si-Pixel Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12993v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of novel quantum materials relies on muon-spin rotation, relaxation, or resonance (\mSR) measurements. Yet, a fundamental limitation persists: many of these materials can only be synthesized in extremely small quantities, often at sub-millimeter scales. While \mSR ~offers unique insights into electronic and magnetic properties, existing spectrometers lack a sub-millimeter spatial resolution and the possibility of triggerless pump-probe data acquisition, which would enable more advanced measurements. The General Purpose Surface-muon instrument (GPS) at the Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI) is currently limited to a muon stopping rate of \SI{40}{\kilo\hertz} to \SI{120}{\kilo\hertz}, a constraint that will become more pressing with the upcoming High-Intensity Muon Beam (HIMB) project. To overcome these challenges, we demonstrate the feasibility of employing ultra-thin monolithic Si-pixel detectors to reconstruct the stopping position of muons within the sample, thereby significantly enhancing the capability of measuring at higher muon rate. Additionally, we explore the first steps toward a triggerless pump-probe \mSR ~measurement scheme. Unlike conventional pump-probe techniques that require external triggers, a triggerless readout system can continuously integrate stimuli pulses into the data stream, allowing real-time tracking of ultra-fast dynamics in quantum materials. This approach will enable the study of transient states, spin dynamics, and quantum coherence under external stimuli.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction and Performance Evaluation of FASER's Emulsion Detector at the LHC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13008v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the reconstruction and performance evaluation of the FASER$\nu$ emulsion detector, which aims to measure interactions from neutrinos produced in the forward direction of proton-proton collisions at the CERN Large Hadron Collider. The detector, composed of tungsten plates interleaved with emulsion films, records charged particles with sub-micron precision. A key challenge arises from the extremely high track density environment, reaching $\mathcal{O}(10^5)$ tracks per cm$^2$. To address this, dedicated alignment techniques and track reconstruction algorithms have been developed, building on techniques from previous experiments and introducing further optimizations. The performance of the detector is studied by evaluating the single-film efficiency, position and angular resolution, and the impact parameter distribution of reconstructed vertices. The results demonstrate that an alignment precision of 0.3 micrometers and robust track and vertex reconstruction are achieved, enabling accurate neutrino measurements in the TeV energy range.</description>

      <title>High-Density Ultracold Neutron Source for Low-Energy Particle Physics Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: SuperSUN, a new superthermal source of ultracold neutrons (UCN) at the Institut Laue-Langevin, exploits inelastic scattering of neutrons in isotopically pure superfluid $^4$He at temperatures below $0.6\,$K. For the first time, continuous operation with an intense broad-spectrum cold neutron beam is demonstrated over 60 days. We observe continuous UCN extraction rates of $21000\,$s$^{-1}$, and storage in the source with saturated $\textit{in-situ}$ density $273\,$cm$^{-3}$. The high stored density, low-energy UCN spectrum, and long storage times open new possibilities in fundamental and applied physics.</description>

      <title>Irradiation Studies of the Resistive AC-coupled Silicon Detector (RSD/AC-LGAD)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Resistive AC-coupled Silicon Detectors (RSDs) are silicon sensors which provide high temporal and spatial resolution. The RSD is a candidate sensor to be used in future tracking detectors with the objective of obtaining '4D' tracking, where timing information can be used along with spatial hits during track finding. 4D tracking will be an essential part of any future lepton or hadron collider and may even be feasible at the HL-LHC. For applications at hadron colliders, RSD sensors must be able to operate in high fluence environments in order to provide 4D tracking. However, the effects of radiation on RSDs have not been extensively studied. In this study, RSDs were irradiated to $1.0$, $2.0$, and $3.5 \times 10^{15}$~cm$^{-2}$ (1~MeV neutron equivalents) with both protons and neutrons. The sensors were then characterized electrically to study the acceptor removal and, for the first time in this doping concentration range, the donor removal. Then, the Transient Current Technique was used to begin investigating the signal charge sharing after irradiation. The results suggest an interesting trend between acceptor and donor removal, which is worthy of further study and could assist in improving radiation hardness of Low Gain Avalanche Diodes (LGADs).</description>

      <title>APEX: Optimized vertical drift PDS for DUNE FD3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06032v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment currently under construction in the US will be a long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiment dedicated to determining the neutrino mass ordering and to measure the CP violation phase in the lepton sector. DUNE will also perform studies of non-beam physics such as atmospheric neutrinos, bursts from supernovae and nucleon decays in which photon detection systems will play a major role in triggering and also provide calorimetric measurements. For the second phase of DUNE, two additional detector modules will be added in the far detector complex in the Sanford Underground Research Facility. We present the Aluminum Profiles with Embedded X-ARAPUCA (APEX) concept as an advanced proposal for the photon detector system of the third DUNE far detector module. This system aims to have an optical coverage of approximately 60% made viable by the technology advancement achieved by the DUNE collaboration on the use of non-conductive optical fibers for power and signal readout of the photon detector units. Such large coverage will provide enhanced light collection capabilities at MeV-scale energy deposit level per interaction and optimal energy reconstruction resolution up to the GeV scale. The attained electrical isolation of the detector units with low noise levels allows for a complete instrumentation of the field cage walls with satisfactory segmentation as the readout scheme envisages a much larger than typical number of channels to be adopted. We discuss the main features of the system, first estimates on its expected performances, potential for physics measurements and prototyping plans for R\&amp;D.</description>

      <title>The FCC integrated programme: a physics manifesto</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02634v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The FCC integrated programme comprises an $\rm e^+e^-$ high-luminosity circular collider that will produce very large samples of data in an energy range $88 \le \sqrt{s} \le 365$ GeV, followed by a high-energy $\rm pp$ machine that, with the current baseline plan, will operate at a collision energy of around 85 TeV and deliver datasets an order of magnitude larger than those of the HL-LHC. This visionary project will allow for transformative measurements across a very broad range of topics, which in almost all cases will exceed in sensitivity the projections of any other proposed facility, and simultaneously provide the best possible opportunity for discovering physics beyond the Standard Model. The highlights of the physics programme are presented, together with discussion on the key attributes of the integrated project that enable the physics reach. It is noted that the baseline programme of FCC-ee, in particular, is both flexible and extendable, and also that the synergy and complementarity of the electron and proton machines, and the sharing of a common infrastructure, provides a remarkably efficient, timely and cost-effective approach to addressing the most pressing open questions in elementary particle physics.</description>

      <title>Electroweak Phase Transition in a Right-Handed Neutrino Superfield Extended NMSSM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.05061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.05061v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Supersymmetric models with singlet extensions can accommodate single- or multi-step first-order phase transitions (FOPT) along the various constituent field directions. Such a framework can also produce Gravitational Waves, detectable at the upcoming space-based interferometers, e.g., U-DECIGO. We explore the dynamics of electroweak phase transition and the production of Gravitational Waves in an extended set-up of the Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (NMSSM) with a Standard Model singlet right-handed neutrino superfield. We examine the role of the new parameters compared to NMSSM on the phase transition dynamics and observe that the occurrence of a FOPT, an essential requirement for Electroweak Baryogenesis, typically favours a right-handed sneutrino state below 125 GeV. Our investigation shows how the analysis can offer complementary probes for physics beyond the Standard Model besides the collider searches.</description>

      <title>Contrasting Features of Parton Energy Loss in Heavy-ion Collisions at RHIC and the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.00024v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Energetic quarks and gluons lose energy as they traverse the hot and dense medium created in high-energy heavy-ion collisions at the BNL Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The nuclear modification factor ($R_{AA}$) of leading particles quantifies parton energy loss in such collisions, with the particle spectrum in $p+p$ collisions as a reference. Previous $R_{AA}$ measurements at RHIC energies have revealed an approximately constant trend at high transverse momenta ($p_{T}$), implying a scenario where parton energy loss, $\Delta p_{T}$, scales proportionally with $p_{T}$, a feature naively expected from energy loss dynamics in elastic collisions. In this study, we investigate the LHC $R_{AA}$ measurements which exhibit a pronounced $p_{T}$ dependence of $R_{AA}$ for various particle species, and our analysis attributes this behavior to $\Delta p_T$ being approximately proportional to $\sqrt{p_{T}}$. These distinct features are consistent with model calculations of dominant radiative energy loss dynamics at the LHC, in contrast to the dominance of collisional energy loss at RHIC. Additionally, the linear increase of fractional energy loss with medium density at different $p_{T}$ magnitudes affirms the previous empirical observation that the magnitude of the energy loss depends mostly on the initial entropy density, with no significant path-length dependence. Implications on the dynamical scenarios of parton energy loss and future experimental investigations will also be discussed.</description>

      <title>Weak interaction axial form factors of the octet baryons in nuclear medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07958v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the axial-vector and the induced pseudoscalar form factors associated with the weak transitions between the octet baryon members in nuclear medium, using a covariant constituent quark model. We extend previous calculations of the axial transition form factors from the vacuum (free space) to the nuclear medium (symmetric nuclear matter). The extension of the model to the nuclear medium takes into account the modifications of the properties of hadrons in the medium (masses and coupling constants), as determined by the quark-meson coupling model. The axial-vector ($G_A$) and the induced pseudoscalar ($G_P$) form factors are evaluated for different values of the nuclear density $\rho$ in terms of the square transfer momentum $q^2= -Q^2$. We conclude that, in general, the $G_A$ and $G_P$ form factors are reduced in the nuclear medium. The reduction is stronger for light baryons and high densities. The medium modifications are milder for the heavier octet baryons, particularly at large $Q^2$. The calculations presented here can be used to estimate the cross sections of neutrino and antineutrino scattering with nucleus, and neutrino and antineutrino scattering with hyperons bound to a nucleus, as well as those in the cores of compact stars.</description>

      <title>Search for Dark Matter in association with a Higgs boson at the LHC: A model independent study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17803v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Astrophysical and cosmological observations strongly suggest the existence of Dark Matter\,(DM). Experiments at the Large Hadron Collider\,(LHC) have the potential to probe the particle nature of the DM. In the present work, we investigate the potential of the mono-Higgs plus Missing Transverse Energy signature at the LHC to search for a relatively light fermionic dark matter candidate using the framework of Effective Field Theory. In our study, the DM interacts with the Standard Model\,(SM) via dimension-6 and dimension-7 effective operators involving the Higgs and the gauge bosons. Although, our analysis is independent of any Ultra Violet complete dynamics of DM, such interactions can be realized in an extension of the SM where the gauge group is extended minimally by adding an extra $U(1)$. Both cut-based and Boosted Decision Tree\,(BDT) discriminators are used to estimate and optimize the signal sensitivity over the SM backgrounds, assuming an integrated luminosity of $3000~fb^{-1}$ at $\sqrt{s}=14$ TeV at the High Luminosity phase of the LHC\,(HL-LHC). It can be seen that in the best scenario, atleast $4\sigma$ significance can be achieved for relic masses upto 200 GeV, showcasing the prospects of this search at the HL-LHC. This study provides a foundation for future explorations in this direction.</description>

      <title>Directional Direct Detection of MeV Scale Boosted Dark Matter in Two Component Dark Matter Scenario via Dark Photon Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10149v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study explores a two-component dark matter model in which one component, heavier dark matter, annihilates into a lighter dark matter. The lighter dark matter is expected to generate detectable signals in detectors due to its enhanced momentum, enabling direct detection even for MeV-scale dark matter. We investigate the effectiveness of directional direct detections, especially the nuclear emulsion detector NEWSdm, in verifying these boosted dark matter particles through nuclear recoil. In particular, we focus on light nuclei, such as protons and carbon, as suitable targets for this detection method due to their high sensitivity to MeV-scale dark matter. By modeling the interactions mediated by a dark photon in a hidden U(1)$_D$ gauge symmetry framework, we calculate the expected dark matter flux and scattering rates for various detector configurations. Our results show that nuclear emulsions have the potential to yield distinct, direction-sensitive dark matter signals from the Galactic center, providing a new way to probe low-mass dark matter parameter spaces that evade conventional detection methods.</description>

      <title>Quality control of PEN wavelength shifters for DarkSide-20k veto</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05978v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Efficient Wavelength Shifters (WLS) are crucial for Liquid Argon (LAr) dark matter detectors. As they grow larger in volume, the scalability of WLS becomes an important concern. Tetraphenyl butadiene (TPB), the most common WLS in use, requires to be deposited with vacuum evaporation, impractical for detectors with very large surface area due to its high cost and energy requirements. The neutron veto of the DarkSide-20k detector will utilize nearly 200 m^2 of polyethylene naphthalate (PEN) wavelength shifter, available in the form of large format polymeric foils. In order to assess the quality of PEN sheets in the DarkSide-20k production batch, multiple samples will be tested at cryogenic temperatures. For this purpose, a new Argon Gas Setup (ArGSet) has been recently commissioned. In this setup, we exploit the Argon scintillation light (128 nm) as excitation for measuring the wavelength shifting efficiency of the samples. In this work, we will present the results of the first measurements performed at cryogenic temperature with this setup.</description>
