      <title>Three Magnetization Peaks in HgBa$_2$Ca$_2$Cu$_3$O$_8$ Single Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By measuring magnetization hysteresis loops of the superconducting HgBa$_2$Ca$_2$Cu$_3$O$_8$ single crystals ($T_{\rm c}$ = 133 K), we observed three magnetization peaks in a wide temperature region. This is in contrast to the previous observation that there are only two magnetization peaks in many superconductors. Detailed analysis finds that the second peak here evolves from a kinky structure at low temperatures and gets enhanced at high temperatures; the third peak evolves from a general broad peak at low temperatures and evolves into a sharp peak and even a step-like one at high temperatures. We propose a general phase diagram to interpret these peaks, the second peak is corresponding to the order-disorder transition, while the third peak is associated with the elastic-plastic crossover. Our work unifies the understanding of different "second peak" structures in different systems and thus sheds new light in understanding the vortex dynamics in type-II superconductors.</description>

      <title>Interfacial spin-orbit coupling in superconducting hybrid systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of interfacial spin-orbit coupling (ISOC) on superconductors, focusing on its impact on electronic transport and spin-charge conversion. Using a symmetry-based nonlinear sigma model, we derive effective boundary conditions for the Usadel and Maxwell equations that account for spin-galvanic effect, spin relaxation, and spin precession. This approach allows for the analysis of various interfaces without relying on specific microscopic models. We apply these boundary conditions to derive ISOC-induced terms in the Ginzburg-Landau functional, which is then used to compute the critical temperature of superconducting films with ISOC subjected to an external magnetic field. Our findings show that, contrary to a recent prediction, the critical temperature of a film cannot be enhanced by an external magnetic field. Additionally, we demonstrate that the combination of ISOC and an external magnetic field leads to a superconducting diode effect. Its efficiency strongly depends on the interplay between the spin-galvanic and the spin relaxation terms. Our results provide a framework for understanding ISOC in superconducting systems and highlight the potential for optimizing diode efficiency through careful interface engineering</description>

      <title>Orbital Signatures of Density Wave Transition in La3Ni2O7-delta and La2PrNi2O7-delta RP-Nickelates Probed via in-situ X-ray Absorption Near-edge Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The report of superconductivity (SC) with Tc~80 K in bilayer Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) nickelate La3Ni2O7-delta have sparked considerable investigations on its normal state properties and SC mechanism under pressure and at low temperature. It is believed that the density wave (DW) at ~150 K plays an important role in SC emergence, but its nature remains largely underexplored. Here, we utilized temperature-dependent in-situ Ni K-edge X-ray Absorption Near-edge Spectroscopy (XANES) to probe the Ni-3d/4p electronic states of La3Ni2O7-delta and La2PrNi2O7-delta samples down to 4.8 K, enabling us to witness the evolution of both in-plane d_(x^2-y^2)/p_x (p_y) and out-of-plane d_(3z^2-r^2)/p_z orbitals of NiO6 octahedron across the DW transition. Main edge energy associated with Ni 4p orbital shows an anomalous decline near DW transition, signifying the occurrence of lattice distortions as a hallmark of charge density wave. Below DW transition, the enlarged crystal field splitting (CFS) indicates an enhanced NiO6 octahedral distortion. Intriguingly, magnetic Pr substituents could activate the mutual interplay of d_(x^2-y^2) and d_(3z^2-r^2) orbitals. We discussed its relevance to the favored bulk SC in the pressurized polycrystalline La2PrNi2O7-delta than pristine.</description>

      <title>Organometallic-Inorganic Hybrid MXenes with Tunable Superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ti-based two-dimensional transition-metal carbides (MXenes) have attracted attention due to their superior properties and are being explored across various applications1,2. Despite their versatile properties, superconductivity has never been demonstrated, not even predicted, for this important group of 2D materials. In this work, we have introduced an electrochemical intercalation protocol to construct versatile organometallic-inorganic hybrid MXenes and achieved tunable superconductivity in the metallocene-modified layered crystals. Through structural editing of MXene matrix at atomic scale and meticulously modulated intercalation route, Ti3C2Tx intercalated with metallocene species exhibits a superconductive transition temperature (Tc) of 10.2 K. Guest intercalation induced electron filling and strain engineering are responsible for the emerging superconductivity in this intrinsically non-superconducting material. Theoretically, simulated electron-phonon interaction effects further elucidate the nature of the changes in Tc. Furthermore, the Tc of crafted artificial superlattices beyond Ti-based MXenes have been predicted, offering a general strategy for engineering superconductivity and magnetism in layered hybrid materials.</description>

      <title>Weak coupling approach to magnetic and orbital susceptibilities for superconducting states in multiorbital electron-phonon coupled model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Alkali-doped fullerides are molecular-based superconductors with multiple active orbitals. In this paper, using the Eliashberg theory with the retardation effect of Jahn-Teller phonons, we study the response of the spin-singlet superconducting state relevant to fulleride materials. The spin Zeeman field is not active for the singlet pairing state, and the magnetic orbital field, which physically generates a circular electron motion inside the fullerene molecule, is also shown to be inactive. On the other hand, the electric orbital (or quadrupolar) field, which corresponds to a uniaxial distortion, remains active across the superconducting phase transition. This is understood by the orbital-symmetric structure of the Cooper pair, which is susceptible to the electric orbital field, while it is not the case for the magnetic orbital field which tends to create an antisymmetric part.</description>

      <title>Observation of the Dirac Dispersions in Co-doped CaFe2As2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We performed an angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) study of the electronic structure of the CaFe2As2 122-iron pnictide, a parent compound, and two iron-based superconductors CaFe(2-x)CoxAs2 (x = 0.07 and 0.15). We studied the band structure of this system across the phase diagram with the transition from the orthorhombic spin density wave (SDW) phase to the tetragonal paramagnetic phase. We observed characteristic features of the electronic structures corresponding to the antiferromagnetic phase in the parent compound and the samples with low cobalt concentration (x = 0.07).
  For highly doped systems (x = 0.15), the measurements revealed the concentric branches of the Fermi surface, which are associated with paramagnetic and superconducting 122-iron pnictides. We found the existence of Dirac cones located at 30 meV below Fermi energy for nonsuperconducting CaFe2As2 and superconducting CaFe(1.93)Co(0.07)As2 orthorhombic SDW systems.</description>

      <title>Superconducting and spin-density wave phases probed by scanning tunneling spectroscopy in the organic conductor $\mathrm{(TMTSF)_{2}ClO_{4}}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) we have probed the local quasi-particle density of states (DOS) of the Bechgaard salt organic superconductor $\mathrm{(TMTSF)_{2}ClO_{4}}$ in slowly cooled single crystals cleaved under ultrahigh vacuum conditions. In well STM imaged crystallographic surface planes, the local DOS has been probed for different surface areas at temperatures above and below the critical temperature of superconducting or insulating spin-density wave states. While a rather homogeneous superconducting state is expected in the bulk from previous studies, depending on the degree of disorder introduced by cleavage in the anion lattice, an inhomogeneous granular state is predominantly observed at the surface. A pronounced linear V-shape profile of the local DOS is observed from intermediate to the lowest energy scale in the less disordered superconducting surface areas. This supports the existence of an unconventional d-wave like order parameter with nodes at low energy, which is preceded by more energetic fluctuations attributed to quantum criticality of the material. At higher energy disorder combined to correlations deplete further the DOS. By contrast a non-linear U-shape characterizes the local low energy DOS profile for the more disordered and insulating surface areas of the spin-density wave state. The experimental results are compared quantitatively with those predicted by the renormalization group theory of the quasi-one dimensional electron gas model and its description of the superconducting and spin-density wave states that are interlinked by quantum criticality in the Bechgaard salts.</description>

      <title>Superconducting Diode Effects: Mechanisms, Materials and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconducting diode effects (SDEs) generally emerge in superconducting systems where both time-reversal and inversion symmetries are broken, showing nonreciprocal current characteristics: nondissipative in one direction and ohmic in the opposite. Since the discovery of the SDEs by Ando et al. in the noncentrosymmetric superconductor [Nb/V/Ta]n in 2020, notable progress has been achieved on both the theoretical and experimental fronts. It has been proposed that intrinsic SDEs are closely linked to various exotic superconducting states, such as the Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) state, topological superconductivity, and chiral superconductivity. Recently, SDEs have emerged as important experimental tools for detecting symmetry breaking in exotic superconducting states. This advancement not only enhances our understanding of the fundamental nature of SDEs but also opens new possibilities for their applications in superconducting physics and related fields. This review focuses on the recent experimental progress in the observation of the SDEs and discusses their primary mechanisms from the perspective of material properties and symmetry breaking. Finally, we summarize the observed rectification efficiency of SDE devices and discuss future research directions in this rapidly developing field.</description>

      <title>The uncollapsed LaFe2As2 phase: compensated, highly doped, electron-phonon coupled, iron-based superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recently discovered LaFe2As2 superconducting compound, member of the 122 family of iron pnictide superconductors, becomes superconducting below Tc=13K, yet its nominal doping apparently places it in the extreme overdoped limit, where superconductivity should be suppressed. In this work, we investigate the normal state of magneto- and thermo-electric transport and specific heat of this compound. The experimental data are consistent with the presence of highly compensated electron and hole bands, with around 0.42 electrons per unit cell just above Tc, and high effective masses around 3m0. The temperature dependence of transport properties strongly resembles that of conventional superconductors, pointing to a key role of electron-phonon coupling. From these evidences, LaFe2As2 can be regarded as the connecting compound between unconventional and conventional superconductors.</description>

      <title>Charge Orders in Fully Intercalated Bilayer TaSe$_2$: Dependence on Interlayer Stacking and Intercalation Sites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements have established self-intercalation as a powerful technique for manipulating quantum material properties, with precisely controllable intercalation concentrations. Given the inherently rich phase diagrams of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs), studying the self-intercalated TMDCs can offer promising candidates for investigating the interplay between various orderings. This work focuses on fully intercalated bilayer TaSe$_2$ (Ta$_3$Se$_4$), which has recently been fabricated experimentally. By performing first-principles calculations, we demonstrate the suppression of an intrinsic $3\times3$ charge density wave (CDW) in parent TaSe$_2$ layers, and the emergence of $2\times 2$, $\sqrt{3} \times \sqrt{3}$, or the absence of a CDW in the intercalated layers, depending on the interlayer stacking orders and intercalation sites being occupied. Particularly, the $2\times 2$ CDW shows an increase in electronic states at the Fermi level compared to its non-CDW phase. This unusual behavior contrasts with that of typical CDW materials in TMDCs. Furthermore, superconductivity is preserved in these Ta$_3$Se$_4$ structures, with superconducting transition temperatures comparable to or substantially smaller than those of TaSe$_2$. Spin-orbit coupling is found to enhance the density of states at Fermi levels while simultaneously reducing the electron-phonon coupling matrix elements. These two competing effects result in varying impacts on superconductivity across different Ta$_3$Se$_4$ structures. Moreover, our calculations indicate that magnetic order is absent. Our study deepens the understanding of underlying physics in Ta$_3$Se$_4$, and provides experimentally feasible candidates for studying CDW, superconductivity, and their interplay.</description>

      <title>Application of Many-body Non-perturbative Theories to the Three-Dimensional Attractive Hubbard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11527v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The attractive Fermi-Hubbard model stands out as a simple model for studying the pairing and superconductivity of fermions on a lattice. In this article, we apply several many-body theories in the three-dimensional attractive Hubbard model. Specifically, we compare the results of various GW methods with DQMC simulations and observe that they provide reliable results in the weak to intermediate coupling regime. The critical exponents also agree well with the accurate results obtained from the 3D XY model. In the superconducting phase, the post-GW method significantly improves the description of Green's functions and density of states. Additionally, we propose a method to determine the temperature at which the pseudogap appears.</description>

      <title>High-Temperature Superconductivity from Finite-Range Attractive Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11624v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this letter we consider $D$-dimensional interacting Fermi liquids, and demonstrate that an attractive interaction with a finite range $R_s$ that is much greater than the Fermi wavelength $\lambda_F$ breaks the conventional BCS theory of superconductivity. In contrast to the BCS prediction of a finite superconducting gap for all attractive contact interactions, we show that a finite-range interaction does not induce a superconducting gap. Instead, the pair susceptibility develops a power-law singularity at zero momentum and zero frequency signaling quantum critical behavior without long-range ordering. Starting from this, we show that superconductivity can be stabilized by adding a short-range attractive interaction, which is always present in real electronic systems. As an example, we consider a layered quasi-two-dimensional material with attractive electron-electron interactions mediated by optical phonons. We demonstrate a dome shape of the critical temperature $T_c$ versus doping, strongly suppressed isotope effect, and a weak dependence of the optimal doping and maximal $T_c^* \sim 0.1 E_F$ on the interaction range at $R_s \gg \lambda_F$, $E_F$ is the Fermi energy. We believe that these results could be relevant to high-temperature superconductors.</description>

      <title>Superconducting phase diagram of finite-layer nickelates Nd$_{n+1}$Ni$_n$O$_{2n+2}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Following the successful prediction of the superconducting phase diagram for infinite-layer nickelates, here we calculate the superconducting $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ vs. the number of layers $n$ for finite-layer nickelates using the dynamical vertex approximation. To this end, we start with density functional theory, and include local correlations non-perturbatively by dynamical mean-field theory for $n=2$ to 7. For all $n$, the Ni $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital crosses the Fermi level, but for $n&gt;4$ there are additional $(\pi, \pi)$ pockets or tubes that slightly enhance the layer-averaged hole doping of the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals beyond the leading $1/n$ contribution stemming from the valence electron count. We finally calculate $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ for the single-orbital $d_{x^2-y^2}$ Hubbard model by dynamical vertex approximation.</description>

Abstract: We discuss a two-band model for two-dimensional superconductors with electron and hole bands separated by an energy gap and singlet $d$-wave pairing in each band. This type of model exhibits a V-shaped to U-shaped transition in the density of the states of the superconductor, and was phenomenologically used as a possible interpretation of recent tunneling experiments in magic-angle twisted trilayer graphene (MATTG)~[Kim {\it et al.}, Nature {\bf 606}, 494-500 (2022)]. Performing a microscopic investigation, we find that such a qualitative difference in behavior occurs when the electron and hole chemical potentials change, leading to topological quantum phase transitions (TQPTs) between gapless and gapped $d$-wave superconducting states, due to the annihilation of chiral Dirac fermions at the phase boundaries. This transition requires the vanishing of the coherence peaks in the density of states at zero energy when the phase boundary is crossed, but this is not seen in the experimental data of Kim {\it et al.} (2022). We also show that direct thermodynamic signatures of these topological quantum phase transitions arise in the theoretical compressibility, which exhibits logarithmic singularities at the transition points. Measurements of the compressibility may illuminate the interpretation of the experimental data of Kim {\it et al.} (2022) and provide additional information about topological quantum phase transitions in the superconducting state of MATTG. Based on our analysis, we are led to conclude that the V-shaped to U-shaped transition observed is not related to annihilation of Dirac fermion quasiparticles and its associated TQPTs, but is possibly connected to a change in symmetry of the order parameter from a nodal to a non-nodal superconducting phase.</description>

      <title>Modelling the mechanics of 32 T REBCO superconductor magnet using numerical simulation</title>

Abstract: High temperature REBCO superconducting tapes are very promising for high-field magnets. Under high magnetic fields there are high electro-mechanical forces, and thus concern for mechanical damage. Due to large screening currents and composite structure of the tape, the mechanical design of these magnets are not straightforward. In addition, many present designs use insulated winding. In this work we develop a novel two-dimensional axisymmetric finite element tool programmed in MATLAB that assumes the displacement field within linear elastic range. The stack of pancakes and a large number of REBCO tape turns are approximated as an anisotropic bulk hollow cylinder. Our results agree with uni-axial stress experiments in literature, validating the bulk approximation. Here, we study the following configuration. The current is first ramp up to below the critical current and we calculate the screening currents and the forces that they cause using the MEMEP model. As a case study 32 T REBCO superconductor magnet is simulated numerically. We have done complete mechanical analysis of the magnet by including the axial and shear mechanical quantities for each pancake unlike previous work where only radial and circumferential quantities are focused. Effect on mechanical quantities without screening current is also calculated and compared. It is shown that including screening current induced field strongly affect the mechanical quantities, specially the shear stress. The latter might be the critical quantity for certain magnet configurations. Additionally, in order to overcome high stresses, a stiff over banding of different material is considered and numerically modelled which significantly reduces the mechanical stresses. The FE based model developed is efficient to calculate the mechanical behaviour of any general superconductor magnet and its devices.</description>

      <title>A novel and fast electromagnetic and electrothermal software for quench analysis of high field magnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04034v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-field superconducting REBCO magnets contain several coils with many turns. For these magnets, electro-thermal quench is an issue that magnet designers need to take into account. Thus, there is a need for a fast and accurate software to numerically model the overall performance of full-scale magnets. High temperature superconductors can be modeled using different techniques for electro-magnetic and thermal (finite element method) analysis. However, it takes a lot of time to model the electro-magnetic and electro-thermal behavior of superconductors simultaneously, especially for non-insulated or metal-insulated coils. In addition, most of the available methods ignore screening currents, which are an important feature of REBCO magnets. We have developed a novel software programmed in C++, which performs coupled electro-magnetic and electro-thermal analysis using variational methods based on Minimum Electro-Magnetic Entropy Production (MEMEP) and Finite Difference, respectively. The developed software, which takes screening currents into account, is applied to axi-symmetric fullscale magnets of more than 32 T field strength under the SuperEMFL project for thermal quench reliability during standard operation. We show that the magnets incorporating non-insulated coils are more reliable against quench than the metal insulated coils. Also, realistic cooling conditions at boundaries is essential for such simulations. The model developed can be used for a quick and complete electro-magnetic and electro-thermal analysis of superconducting high field magnets.</description>

      <title>Pressure-enhanced splitting of density wave transitions in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$</title>

Abstract: The observation of superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$ under pressure, following the suppression of a high-temperature density wave state, has attracted considerable attention. The nature of this density wave order was not clearly identified. Here, we probe the magnetic response of the zero-pressure phase of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$ as hydrostatic pressure is applied and find that the apparent single density wave transition at zero applied pressure splits into two. The comparison of our muon-spin rotation and relaxation experiments with dipole-field numerical analysis reveals the magnetic structure's compatibility with a stripe-type arrangement of Ni moments, characterized by alternating lines of magnetic moments and nonmagnetic stripes at ambient pressure. When pressure is applied, the magnetic ordering temperature increases, while the unidentified density wave transition temperature falls. Our findings reveal that the ground state of the La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$ system is characterized by the coexistence of two distinct orders -- a magnetically ordered spin density wave and a lower-temperature ordering that is most likely a charge density wave -- with a notable pressure-enhanced separation between them.</description>

      <title>Revealing Symmetry-Broken Superconducting Configurations by Density Functional Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00719v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A coherent theory for the superconductivity of both conventional and unconventional superconductors is currently lacking. Here we show that superconductivity arises from the formation of a symmetry-broken superconducting configuration (SCC) due to atomic perturbation of the normal conducting configuration (NCC). This perturbation creates straight one-dimensional tunnels (SODTs) for charge density of electrons and/or holes as revealed by the calculations based on density functional theory (DFT). The SODTs act as resistance-free superhighways and are correlated to the Cooper pairs in the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory. The formation of SODTs implies that the electron-phonon interaction in the BCS theory can be represented by the difference in charge densities between SCC and NCC predicted by DFT. The present work highlights that in conventional superconductors, SODTs are embedded within the bulk materials and are easily destroyed by phonon vibrations, resulting in a low critical superconducting temperature (T_C). Conversely, in unconventional superconductors such as YBa2Cu3O7 (YBCO7), SODTs are protected by a layered pontoon structure with very weak bonding to the bulk materials, maintaining SODTs' stability at higher temperatures and leading to a much higher T_C. The present approach is validated for 13 conventional superconductors of 18 pure elements examined in this work, including the presently predicted superconductivity in Cu, Ag, Au, Sb, and Bi at 0 K and 0 GPa, and one unconventional superconductor of YBCO7. Our discovery indicates that DFT can be a practical tool for predicting superconductors, enabling a systematic search for new superconducting materials in the future.</description>

Abstract: We define an infinite class of ``frustration-free'' interacting lattice quantum Hamiltonians for bosons, constructed such that their exact ground states have a density distribution specified by the Boltzmann weight of a corresponding classical lattice gas problem. By appropriately choosing the classical weights, we obtain boson representations of various known solvable models, including quantum dimer and vertex models, toric code, and certain Levin-Wen string-net models. We also systematically construct solvable models with other interesting ground states, including ``quantum spin liquids,'' supersolids, ``Bose-Einstein insulators,'' Bose liquids with ``Bose surfaces'', and Bose-Einstein condensates that permit adiabatic evolution from a non-interacting limit to a Gutzwiller-projected limit.</description>

      <title>Transmission of radio-frequency waves and nuclear magnetic resonance in lanthanum superhydrides</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11727v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The discovery of near-room temperature superconductivity in the lanthanum hydride LaH$_{10}$ has revolutionized this field of research. However, the need to use diamond anvils for the synthesis of such superconductors severely limits the number of experimental techniques to study these materials. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is one of the key methods for probing spin systems of superconductors. In this work, we show how $^1$H NMR measurements can be realized in diamond anvil cells to study high-temperature superconductivity in lanthanum polyhydrides at pressures up to 165 GPa. In the newly discovered superhydride LaH$_{12}$, we observed a pronounced suppression of the $^1$H NMR signal intensity below $\textit{T$_{c}$(onset)}$ = 260 K in a magnetic field of 7 T, corresponding to the screening of the radio-frequency pulses. Below the critical temperature of superconductivity, all $^1$H NMR characteristics, including the spin-lattice relaxation rate $\textit{1/T$_{1}$T}$, demonstrate pronounced features, evidencing the bulk nature of the superconducting transition. In zero field, the radio-frequency signal transmission through the LaH$_{12}$ sample shows a pronounced drop below $\textit{T$_{c}$(onset)}$ = 267 K, confirming the superconducting nature of the transition. A description of the $\textit{1/T$_{1}$T}$ data with an exponential form allows the estimation of the superconducting gap $\textit{${\Delta}$(0)}$ lying between 427 and 671 K (corresponding to 36.8 to 57.8 meV), and the ratio $\textit{R$_{\Delta}$ = 2${\Delta}$(0)/k$_B$T$_c$}$ between 3.76 and 5.16 in the synthesized hydride sample.</description>

Abstract: Josephson junctions containing ferromagnetic materials are under consideration for applications in digital superconducting logic and memory. Some memory applications rely on the ability to reverse the magnetization direction of a "soft" magnetic layer within the junction using a small local magnetic field generated on the chip. It is crucial, therefore, to find a suitable soft magnetic material with a low switching field and low switching energy. A popular magnetic material for such applications is Ni$_{80}$Fe$_{20}$, also known as Permalloy, however Permalloy has a rather large magnetization, leading to large magnetic switching energies. In this work we explore Cr-doped Permalloy, specifically Ni$_{73}$Fe$_{18}$Cr$_{9}$, which has a saturation magnetization just under two-thirds that of Permalloy. Josephson junctions containing this NiFeCr alloy undergo a 0-$\pi$ transition at a NiFeCr thickness of 2.3 nm, and the critical supercurrent decays in the alloy over a short characteristic length of 0.36 nm. Switching fields of a few millitesla are promising, but the short decay length and overall small values of the critical current in the Josephson junctions may preclude the use of NiFeCr in current cryogenic memory technologies.</description>

      <title>Fast and accurate electromagnetic modeling of non-insulated and metal-insulated REBCO magnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.02249v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: REBCO high-temperature superconductors are promising for fully superconducting high-field magnets, including ultra-high field magnets. Non-insulated (NI) and metal-insulated (MI) windings are a good solution for protection against electro-thermal quench. Design and optimization requires numerical modelling of REBCO inserts for high-field magnets. Here, we detail a fast and accurate two-dimensional (2D) cross-sectional model for the electromagnetic response of NI and MI coils, which is based on the Minimum Electro Magnetic Entropy Production (MEMEP). Benchmarking with an $A-V$ formulation method on a double pancake coil shows good agreement. We also analyse a fully superconducting 32 T magnet with a REBCO insert and a low-temperature superconducing (LTS) outsert. In particular, we analyze the current density, the screening curren induced field (SCIF), and the AC loss. We have shown that metal-insulated coils enable transfer of angular current in the radial direction, and hence magnet protection, while keeping the same screening currents and AC loss of isolated coils, even at relatively high ramp rates of 1 A/s. Surprisingly, soldered coils with low resistance between turns present relatively low AC loss for over-current configuration, which might enable higher generated magnetic fields. The numerical method presented here can be applied to optimize high-field magnets regarding SCIF in MI or NI magnets. It also serves as the basis for future electro-thermal modelling and multi-physics modeling that also includes mechanical properties.</description>

Abstract: Recent experiments strongly indicate deep connections between transports of strange metal and high $T_c$ superconductors. For instance, it is known that the dependence of the zero-temperature phase stiffness on the critical superconducting temperature becomes linear in underdoped materials. In this paper, we investigate relation meticulously between the phase stiffness and the critical superconducting temperature for the Gubser-Rocha holographic superconductor model in the probe limit. The superfluid density (or phase stiffness) can be extracted from the low-frequency dependence of the AC conductivity. More importantly, we find linear dependence of zero-temperature superfluid density on the critical superconducting temperature, which has a similarity to a recent experiment in a film cuprate. In addition, we also provide some approximate formulas for the critical temperatures and the AC conductivity.</description>

      <title>Generic reduction theory for Fermi sea topology in metallic systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19125v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Fermi sea of a metal can host exotic quantum topology, which governs its conductance quantization and is characterized by the Euler characteristic ($\chi_F$). In contrast to the well-known band topology, which is determined by the global features of wave functions, the topology of such metallic systems is intrinsically linked to the geometry of the Fermi sea. As a result, probing and identifying $\chi_F$ in high-dimensional systems presents a challenge. Here, we propose a generic dimensional reduction theory for the Fermi sea topology in $d$-dimensional metallic systems, showing that $\chi_F$ can be determined by the features of so-called reduced critical points on Fermi surfaces. Moreover, we reveal that $\chi_F$ can be interpreted as a topological invariant of band topology by mapping a metallic system to a gapped system. Building on this nontrivial result, we identify a broad class of topological superconductors (SCs) whose topological numbers are precisely determined by the $\chi_F$ of their normally filled bands. This provides an indirect method to capture $\chi_F$ by measuring the (pseudo)spin polarizations of these topological SCs. Our findings are expected to significantly advance research into Fermi sea topology.</description>

      <title>Topological zero modes and bounded modes at smooth domain walls: Exact solutions and dualities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16466v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topology describes global quantities invariant under continuous deformations, such as the number of elementary excitations at a phase boundary, without detailing specifics. Conversely, differential laws are needed to understand the physical properties of these excitations, such as their localization and spatial behavior. For instance, topology mandates the existence of solitonic zero-energy modes at the domain walls between topologically inequivalent phases in topological insulators and superconductors. However, the spatial dependence of these modes is only known in the idealized (and unrealistic) case of a sharp domain wall. Here, we find the analytical solutions of these zero-modes by assuming a smooth and exponentially-confined domain wall. This allows us to characterize the zero-modes using a few length scales: the domain wall width, the exponential decay length, and oscillation wavelength. These quantities define distinct regimes: featureless modes with "no hair" at sharp domain walls, and nonfeatureless modes at smooth domain walls, respectively, with "short hair", i.e., featureless at long distances, and "long hair", i.e., nonfeatureless at all length scales. We thus establish a universal relation between the bulk excitation gap, decay rate, and oscillation momentum of the zero modes, which quantifies the bulk-boundary correspondence in terms of experimentally measurable physical quantities. Additionally, we reveal an unexpected duality between topological zero modes and Shockley modes, unifying the understanding of topologically-protected and nontopological boundary modes. These findings shed some new light on the localization properties of edge modes in topological insulators and Majorana zero modes in topological superconductors and on the differences and similarities between topological and nontopological zero modes in these systems.</description>

Abstract: In recent years, materials with topological flat bands have attracted significant attention due to their association with extraordinary transport properties and strongly correlated electrons. This includes phenomena such as high-temperature superconductivity, magnetism, Wigner crystallization, and Mott-insulating behavior. Among these systems, two-dimensional (2D) materials are particularly compelling as they can host electronic states with unique band structures, such as dispersionless states alongside linearly dispersive Dirac cones. In this work, we use tight-binding models to comprehensively investigate a class of 2D lattices that generically support flat bands, and focus on the effects of strain on their electronic and topological properties. The studied lattices are constructed within a unifying graph-theoretic framework, whereupon split-graph and line-graph operations on bipartite square and hexagonal lattices are employed to generate new structures. In the absence of strain, the introduction of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) induces a bulk excitation gap, which transforms flat bands into quasi-flat bands with topologically nontrivial characteristics. By tuning system parameters and external strain, we observe the emergence of directional flat bands, and tilted and semi-Dirac cones. Remarkably, all lattices studied show phase transitions among trivial insulating, semimetallic, and topological phases. Our results highlight the potential of strain engineering as a versatile tool for manipulating electronic and topological phases in a wide variety of 2D materials.</description>
