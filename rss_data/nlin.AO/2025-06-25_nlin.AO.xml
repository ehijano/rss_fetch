      <title>Synchronization of Dirac-Bianconi driven oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20163</link>

Abstract: In dynamical systems on networks, one assigns the dynamics to nodes, which are then coupled via links. This approach does not account for group interactions and dynamics on links and other higher dimensional structures. Higher-order network theory addresses this by considering variables defined on nodes, links, triangles, and higher-order simplices, called topological signals (or cochains). Moreover, topological signals of different dimensions can interact through the Dirac-Bianconi operator, which allows coupling between topological signals defined, for example, on nodes and links. Such interactions can induce various dynamical behaviors, for example, periodic oscillations. The oscillating system consists of topological signals on nodes and links whose dynamics are driven by the Dirac-Bianconi coupling, hence, which we call it Dirac-Bianconi driven oscillator. Using the phase reduction method, we obtain a phase description of this system and apply it to the study of synchronization between two such oscillators. This approach offers a way to analyze oscillatory behaviors in higher-order networks beyond the node-based paradigm, while providing a ductile modeling tool for node- and edge-signals.</description>

      <title>A biophysical approach to the design of networks of communication systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the growth dynamics of the protist \textit{Physarum polycephalum}, we use a formalism that describes adaptive incompressible Hagen-Poiseuille flows on channel networks to identify graphs connecting different nodes within Euclidean space. These graphs are either suboptimal or optimal in terms of their length. Occasionally, we obtain graph tree configurations that are topologically equivalent to Steiner trees. This approach is employed to design communication systems, such as railway networks, motorways, or fibre webs. As a proof of concept, we explicitly apply this framework to the Portuguese railway network.</description>

      <title>Theory of phase reduction from hypergraphs to simplicial complexes: a general route to higher-order Kuramoto models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21587</link>

Abstract: Phase reduction is a powerful technique in the study of nonlinear oscillatory systems. Under certain assumptions, it allows us to describe each multidimensional oscillator by a single phase variable, giving rise to simple phase models such as the Kuramoto model. Classically, the method has been applied in the case where the interactions are only pairwise (two-body). However, increasing evidence shows that interactions in real-world systems are not pairwise but higher-order, i.e., many-body. Although synchronization in higher-order systems has received much attention, analytical results are scarce because of the highly nonlinear nature of the framework. In this paper, we fill the gap by presenting a general theory of phase reduction for the case of higher-order interactions. We show that the higher-order topology is preserved in the phase reduced model at the first order and that only odd couplings have an effect on the dynamics when certain symmetries are present. Additionally, we show the power and ductility of the phase reduction approach by applying it to a population of Stuart-Landau oscillators with an all-to-all configuration and with a ring-like hypergraph topology; in both cases, only the analysis of the phase model can provide insights and analytical results.</description>
