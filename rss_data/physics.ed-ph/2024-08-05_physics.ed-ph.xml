      <title>Hands-on STEM Learning Experiences using Digital Technologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The facilitation of STEM education can be enhanced by the provision of opportunities for learners to gain a better understanding of science through the utilization of tangible and visual examples. The objective of this work is to present an account of our experiences and activities carried out in Italian schools with this novel approach. The selection of projects and experiences discussed --in which students develop a range of core competencies such as collaboration, creativity, critical thinking, experimentation, prototyping, communication and problem-solving; include tangible complex 3D printed structures, large micro-controller board replicas and the visualization of wind dynamics and tiny invisible elementary particles among others. These hands-on experiences demonstrate the benefits on the use of digital fabrication technologies implemented within a FabLab for STEM learning.</description>

      <title>Investigating introductory and advanced students' difficulties with entropy and the second law of thermodynamics using a validated instrument</title>

Abstract: We use the Survey of Thermodynamic Processes and First and Second Laws-Long (STPFaSL-Long), a research-based survey instrument with 78 items at the level of introductory physics, to investigate introductory and advanced students' difficulties with entropy and the second law of thermodynamics. We present analysis of data from 12 different introductory and advanced physics classes at four different higher education public institutions in the US in which the survey was administered in-person to more than 1000 students. We find that a widespread unproductive tendency for introductory students to associate the properties of entropy with those of energy leads to many errors based on an idea of "conservation of entropy," in which entropy increases are always balanced by equal entropy decreases. For many of the more advanced students (calculus-based and upper level), we detect a tendency to expect entropy increases even in processes in which the entropy does not change. We observed a widespread failure to correctly apply the relationship {\Delta}S = {\delta}Qreversible/T, either by using it for irreversible processes to which it does not apply, or by applying it incorrectly or completely neglecting it in reversible processes to which it does apply. We also noted that many introductory students are simply not aware that total entropy must increase in any "spontaneous" heat transfer process. Students at all levels were very frequently found to be confused that while net entropy (system + reservoir) in reversible isothermal processes does not change, the entropy of the working substance itself does indeed increase or decrease depending on whether the process is an expansion or compression. Our findings are broadly consistent with prior research findings in this area, expanding upon them and revealing previously unreported aspects of students' thinking.</description>

      <title>Development and validation of a conceptual multiple-choice survey instrument to assess student understanding of introductory thermodynamics</title>

Abstract: We discuss the development and validation of the long version of a conceptual multiple-choice survey instrument called the Survey of Thermodynamic Processes and First and Second Laws-Long (STPFaSL-Long) suitable for introductory physics courses. This version of the survey instrument is a longer version of the original shorter version developed and validated earlier. The 19 contexts including the exact wording of all of the problem situations posed in the two versions of the survey instrument are identical and the difference between the long and short versions of the instrument is only in the multiple-choice options. In particular, in the longer version of the survey instrument, there are no alternative conceptions explicitly embedded in the four multiple-choice options students choose from and the questions asked in a given context in one item of the shorter survey instrument were split into several items focusing, e.g., on different thermodynamic variables. After the development and validation of the longer version of the survey instrument, the final version was administered in 12 different in-person classes (four different institutions) in which students answered the questions in-class on paper scantron forms with the instructor as the proctor and 12 different in-person classes (five different institutions) in which students answered the questions online on Qualtrics within a two-hour period. This longer version of the survey instrument was administered to introductory physics students in various traditionally taught calculus-based and algebra-based classes before and after traditional lecture-based instruction in relevant concepts. It was also administered to upper-level undergraduates majoring in physics and Ph.D. students taught traditionally for bench marking purposes.</description>

      <title>Investigating introductory and advanced students' difficulties with change in internal energy, work and heat transfer using a validated instrument</title>

Abstract: We use the Survey of Thermodynamic Processes and First and Second Laws-Long (STPFaSL-Long), a research-based survey instrument with 78 items at the level of introductory physics, to investigate introductory and advanced students' difficulties with internal energy, work, and heat transfer. We present analysis of data from 12 different introductory and advanced physics classes at four different higher education public institutions in the US in which the survey was administered in person to more than 1000 students. We find that not only introductory but also advanced physics students have many common difficulties with these introductory thermodynamic concepts after traditional lecture-based instruction in relevant concepts. We utilize a wide variety of problem types and contexts and our sample includes large numbers of introductory algebra-based, calculus-based, and advanced students. Some of our findings are consistent with prior research in this area, but others expand upon them and reveal previously unreported aspects of students' thinking. Findings related to common difficulties of students before and after traditional lecture-based instruction in college physics courses can help instructors of these courses plan instruction and curricula to improve student understanding. These findings can also be valuable for developing effective research-based curricula and pedagogies to address student difficulties and help students develop a functional understanding of these fundamental thermodynamic concepts.</description>
