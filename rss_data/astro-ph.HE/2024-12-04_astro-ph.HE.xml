      <title>Late-time Evolution and Instabilities of Tidal Disruption Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observations of tidal disruption events (TDEs) on a timescale of years after the main flare show evidence of continued activity in the form of optical/UV emission, quasi-periodic eruptions, and delayed radio flares. Motivated by this, we explore the time evolution of these disks using semi-analytic models to follow the changing disk properties and feeding rate to the central black hole (BH). We find that thermal instabilities typically begin $\sim150-250\,{\rm days}$ after the TDE, causing the disk to cycle between high and low accretion states for up to $\sim10-20\,{\rm yrs}$. The high state is super-Eddington, which may be associated with outflows that eject $\sim10^{-3}-10^{-1}\,M_\odot$ with a range of velocities of $\sim0.03-0.3c$ over a span of a couple of days and produce radio flares. In the low state, the accretion rate slowly grows over many months to years as continued fallback accretion builds the mass of the disk. In this phase, the disk may reach luminosities of $\sim10^{41}-10^{42}\,{\rm erg\,s^{-1}}$ in the UV as seen in some late-time observations. We highlight the importance of the iron-opacity "bump" at $\approx2\times10^5\,{\rm K}$ in generating sufficiently high luminosities. This work suggests that joint optical/UV observations with radio monitoring could be key for following the disk state as the radio flares are produced.</description>

      <title>Gravitational wave mergers of accreting binary black holes in AGN discs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Binary black hole (BBH) evolution in the discs of active galactic nuclei (AGN) is a promising channel for gravitational wave (GW)-driven mergers. It is however unclear whether binaries interacting with the surrounding disc undergo orbital contraction or expansion. We develop a simple analytic model of accreting BBHs in AGN discs to follow the orbital evolution from the disc-dominated regime at large separations into the GW-driven regime at small separations (the coupled `disc+GW'-driven evolution). We obtain that accreting binaries expand in thick discs with aspect ratio greater than a critical value ($&gt; h_\mathrm{crit}$); whereas accreting binaries contract and eventually merge in thin discs ($&lt; h_\mathrm{crit}$). Interestingly, accreting BBHs can experience faster mergers compared to non-accreting counterparts, with a non-monotonic dependence on the disc aspect ratio. The orbital contraction is usually coupled with eccentricity growth in the disc-dominated regime, which lead to accelerated inspirals in the GW-driven regime. We quantify the resulting BBH merger timescales in AGN discs ($\tau_\mathrm{merger} \sim 10^5 - 10^7$ yr) and estimate the associated GW merger rates ($\mathcal{R} \sim (0.2 - 5) \, \text{Gpc}^{-3} \text{yr}^{-1}$). Overall, accreting binaries may efficiently contract and merge in thin discs, hence this particular BBH-in-AGN channel may provide a non-negligible contribution to the observed GW merger event rate.</description>

      <title>Simulation-Based Prediction of Black Hole X-ray Spectra and Spectral Variability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data derived from general relativistic MHD simulations of accretion onto black holes can be used as input to a post-processing scheme that predicts the radiated spectrum. Combining a relativistic Compton-scattering radiation transfer solution in the corona with detailed local atmosphere solutions incorporating local ionization and thermal balance within the disk photosphere, it is possible to study both spectral formation and intrinsic spectral variability in the radiation from relativistic accretion disks. With this method, we find that radiatively-efficient systems with black holes of $10M_\odot$ accreting at $\approx 0.01$ in Eddington units produce spectra very similar to those observed in the hard states of X-ray binaries. The spectral shape above 10keV is well-described by a power-law with an exponential cutoff. Intrinsic turbulent variations lead to order-unity fluctuations in bolometric luminosity, logarithmic spectral slope fluctuations over a range $\approx 0.15$, and factor of 2 changes in the cut-off energy on timescales $\sim 50\, (M_{\rm BH}/10 M_\odot)$ms. Within the corona, the range of gas temperature spans more than an order of magnitude. The wide distribution of temperatures is central to defining the spectrum: the logarithmic spectral slope is harder by $\sim 0.3$ and the cut-off energy larger by a factor $\sim 10 - 30$ than if the coronal temperature everywhere were its mass-weighted mean.</description>

      <title>The Statistic Analysis of GeV Spectral Breaks in Bright Gamma-Ray FSRQs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the statistic results of GeV spectral breaks of bright gamma-ray flat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs) in the energy range of 0.1-10 GeV based on New Pass 8 date of the Large Area Telescope abroad on Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope. We have fitted the 15-year average gamma-ray spectra of 755 FSRQs by using both a broken power-law (BPL) and the Logarithmic Parabolas (LP) models, and obtained 87 bright gamma-ray FSRQs with their integrated photon fluxes greater than $2.16\times 10^{-8}$ cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$. From our results, the FSRQ population shows similar preferences for both the BPL and LP models in gamma-ray spectral fitting and clustering analysis suggests that BPL-preferred and LP-preferred FSRQs belong to the same category. Our results indicate that GeV spectral breaks in bright gamma-ray FSRQs are located at $\rm 2.90\pm1.92$ GeV in the rest frame, and the observed change in photon index is $\rm \Delta \gamma =0.45 \pm 0.19$, which is consistent with the expected value for a cooling break of electrons scattering seed photons.</description>

      <title>First Pulsar Polarization Array Limits on Ultralight Axion-like Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conduct the first-ever Pulsar Polarization Array (PPA) analysis to detect the ultralight Axion-Like Dark Matter (ALDM) using the polarization data of 22 millisecond pulsars from the third data release of Parkes Pulsar Timing Array. As one of the major dark matter candidates, the ultralight ALDM exhibits a pronounced wave nature on astronomical scales and offers a promising solution to small-scale structure issues within local galaxies. While the linearly polarized pulsar light travels through the ALDM galactic halo, its position angle (PA) can be subject to an oscillation induced by the ALDM Chern-Simons coupling with electromagnetic field. The PPA is thus especially suited for detecting the ultralight ALDM by correlating polarization data across the arrayed pulsars. To accomplish this task, we develop an advanced Bayesian analysis framework that allows us to construct pulsar PA residual time series, model noise contributions properly and search for pulsar cross-correlations. We find that for an ALDM density of $\rho_0=0.4\,\textrm{GeV}/\textrm{cm}^3$, the Parkes PPA offers the best global limits on the ALDM Chern-Simons coupling, namely $\lesssim 10^{-13.5}-10^{-12.2}~{\rm GeV}^{-1}$, for the mass range of $10^{-22} - 10^{-21}~{\rm eV}$. The crucial role of pulsar cross-correlation in recognizing the nature of the derived limits is also highlighted.</description>

      <title>Synthetic pulsar lightcurves from global kinetic simulations and comparison with the Fermi-LAT catalog</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rotation-powered pulsars represent the main class of identified gamma-ray sources in the Galaxy. The wealth of observational data collected by the AGILE and Fermi gamma-ray space telescopes in the GeV range, and by ground-based Cherenkov telescopes in the TeV band provide invaluable insights into how relativistic plasmas dissipate and accelerate particles. Decoding the information contained in the gamma-ray pulses profile is an important step to understand how pulsars work. In this study, we aim at putting an ab initio plasma model of pulsar magnetospheres to the test, in light of the most recent gamma-ray observations in the GeV and TeV bands. To this end, we present of a new series of global particle-in-cell simulations of an inclined pulsar magnetosphere. High-quality synthetic pulse profiles in the synchrotron and inverse Compton channels are reconstructed to study in greater details their morphology and their energy dependence. We also perform a fit of observed lightcurves with the model, using the third Fermi-LAT gamma-ray pulsar catalog. Reconnection in the wind current sheet powers synchrotron and inverse Compton emission. The modeled pulse profiles reproduce some of the salient features of observed gamma-ray pulsars, including the mysterious Vela-like lightcurves, such as: the generic double-peaked structure, the presence of a bridge or third peak in between the main pulses, the pulse narrowing with increasing energy. The bolometric synchrotron radiative efficiency is strictly limited by the reconnection rate. Our global kinetic simulations are able to match observed pulse profiles. Such direct comparisons will help drive and focus future simulation developments.</description>

      <title>Probing jet dynamics and collimation in radio galaxies. Application to NGC 1052</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Radio galaxies with visible two-sided jet structures, such as NGC 1052, are sources of particular interest to study the collimation and shock structure of active galactic nuclei jets. High-resolution very-long-baseline interferometry observations of such sources can resolve and study the jet collimation profile and probe different physical mechanisms. Aims. In this paper, we study the physics of double-sided radio sources at parsec scales, and in particular investigate whether propagating shocks can give rise to the observed asymmetry between jet and counterjet. Methods. We carry out special relativistic hydrodynamic simulations and perform radiative transfer calculations of an over-pressured perturbed jet. During the radiative transfer calculations we incorporate both thermal and nonthermal emission while taking the finite speed of light into account. To further compare our results to observations, we create more realistic synthetic data including the properties of the observing array as well as the image reconstruction via multifrequency regularized maximum likelihood methods. We finally introduce a semi-automatized method for tracking jet components and extracting jet kinematics. Results. We show that propagating shocks in an inherently symmetric double-sided jet can lead to partially asymmetric jet collimation profiles due to time delay effects and relativistic beaming. These asymmetries may appear on specific epochs, with one jet evolving near conically and the other one parabolically (width profile evolving with a slope of 1 and 0.5, respectively). However, these spurious asymmetries are not significant when observing the source evolve for an extended amount of time. Conclusions. Purely observational effects are not enough to explain a persisting asymmetry in the jet collimation profile of double-sided jet sources and hint at evidence for asymmetrically launched jets.</description>

      <title>Detection of a new GeV source in the outer region of the Coma cluster: a signature of external accretion shock ?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The supersonic flow motions associated with infall of baryonic gas toward sheets and filaments, as well as cluster mergers, produces large-scale shock waves. The shocks associated with galaxy clusters can be classified mainly into two categories: internal shocks appear in the hot intracluster medium within the viral radius, and external accretion shocks form in the outer cold region well outside of the virial radius. Cosmic-ray (CR) electrons and/or protons accelerated by these shocks are expected to produce gamma-rays through inverse-Compton scatterings (ICS) or inelastic $pp$ collisions respectively. Recent studies have found a spatially extended GeV source within the virial radius, consistent with the internal shock origin. Here we report the detection of a new GeV source at a distance of about 2.8$^\circ$ from the center of the Coma cluster through the analysis of 16.2 years of Fermi-LAT data. The hard spectrum of the source, in agreement with the ICS origin, and its location in a large-scale filament of galaxies points to the external accretion shock origin. The gamma-ray ($0.1-10^3$ GeV) luminosity of the source, $1.4\times 10^{42}~ {\rm erg~s^{-1}}$, suggests that a fraction $\sim 10^{-3}$ of the kinetic energy flux through the shock-surface is transferred to relativistic CR electrons.</description>

      <title>Late-time HST and JWST Observations of GRB 221009A: Evidence for a Break in the Light Curve at 50 Days</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: GRB 221009A is one of the brightest transients ever observed with the highest peak gamma-ray flux for a gamma-ray burst (GRB). A type Ic-BL supernova (SN), SN 2022xiw, was definitively detected in late-time JWST spectroscopy (t = 195 days, observer-frame). However, photometric studies have found SN 2022xiw to be less luminous (10-70%) than the canonical GRB-SN, SN 1998bw. We present late-time Hubble Space Telescope (HST)/WFC3 and JWST/NIRCam imaging of the afterglow and host galaxy of GRB 221009A at t ~ 185, 277, and 345 days post-trigger. Our joint archival ground, HST, and JWST light curve fits show strong support for a break in the light curve decay slope at t = 50 +/- 10 days (observer-frame) and a supernova at $1.4^{+0.37}_{-0.40} \times$ the optical/NIR flux of SN 1998bw. This break is consistent with an interpretation as a jet break when requiring slow-cooling electrons in a wind medium with the electron energy spectral index, p &gt; 2, and $\nu_m &lt; \nu_c$. Our light curve and joint HST/JWST spectral energy distribution (SED) also show evidence for the late-time emergence of a bluer component in addition to the fading afterglow and supernova. We find consistency with the interpretations that this source is either a young, massive, low-metallicity star cluster or a scattered light echo of the afterglow with a SED shape of $f_{\nu} \propto \nu^{2.0\pm1.0}$.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic radiation from scalar and axion fields: distinguishability and detectability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17186v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we analyze the characteristics of electromagnetic (EM) radiation associated with scalar and axion field oscillations in different background field setups. Because the scalar field and axion field have different parity and couple with the EM field in different forms, the EM signals generated by the scalar and axion can be used to distinguish them. More interestingly, resonance effects amplify the difference between the two fields and consequent EM signal strength, which helps us distinguish and detect them in future observations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superradiance, the process by which waves are amplified through energy and angular momentum transfer, can also occur in horizonless objects like boson stars, due to both the real space and internal field space rotations. In this work, we study superradiance in the frequency and time domains for static and spinning boson stars, constructed within general relativity and with a self-interacting complex scalar field as a matter source. Using linear perturbation theory and three dimensional nonlinear simulations, we calculate amplification factors and analyze energy and angular momentum transfer in scattering processes, with results showing consistency between approaches. Wave scattering inside a cavity containing a boson star is also examined, demonstrating the effects of confinement on amplification.</description>

      <title>From eccentric binaries to nonstationary gravitational wave backgrounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01899v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A large population of binary systems in the Universe emitting gravitational waves (GW) would produce a stochastic noise, known as the gravitational wave background (GWB). The properties of the GWB directly depend on the attributes of its constituents. If the binary systems are in eccentric orbits, it is well established that the GW power they radiate strongly depends on their instantaneous orbital phase. Consequently, their power spectrum varies over time, and the resulting GWB can appear nonstationary. In this work, we estimate the amplitude of time-dependent fluctuations in the GWB power spectrum as a function of the eccentricity of the binaries. Specifically, we focus on the GWB produced by a population of supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHB) that should be observable by pulsar timing arrays (PTA). We show that a large population of homogeneously distributed equal SMBHBs produces nonstationary features that are undetectable by current PTA datasets. However, using more realistic and astrophysically motivated populations of SMBHBs, we show that the nonstationarity might become very large and detectable, especially in the case of more massive and eccentric populations. In particular, when one binary is slightly brighter than the GWB, we demonstrate that time fluctuations can become significant. This is also true for individual binary systems with a low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) relative to the GWB (SNR $\approx$ 1), which standard data analysis methods would struggle to detect. The detection of nonstationary features in the GWB could indicate the presence of some relatively bright GW sources in eccentric orbits, offering new insights into the origins of the signal.</description>

Abstract: Horizon-scale imaging with the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) has provided transformative insights into supermassive black holes but its resolution and scope are limited by ground-based constraints such as the size of the Earth, its relatively slow rotation, and atmospheric delays. Space-based very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) offers the capability for studying a larger and more diverse sample of black holes. We identify a number of nearby supermassive black holes as prime candidates for horizon-scale imaging at millimeter wavelengths, and use source characteristics such as angular size, sky distribution, and variability timescales to shape the design of a space-based array. We identify specific metrics that serve as key predictors of image fidelity and scientific potential, providing a quantitative basis for optimizing mission design parameters. Our analysis demonstrates that the optimal configuration requires two space-based elements in high Earth orbits (HEO) that are not coplanar and are apparently counter-rotating. Our results delineate the key requirements for a space-based VLBI mission, enabling detailed studies of black hole shadows, plasma dynamics, and jet formation, advancing black hole astrophysics beyond the current capabilities of the EHT.</description>

      <title>Signatures of Rapidly Rotating Stars with Chemically Homogeneous Evolution in the First Galaxies</title>

Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has revealed an unexpectedly high abundance of UV luminous galaxies at redshifts $z\gtrsim 10$, challenging `standard' galaxy formation models. This study investigates the role of rapidly rotating (massive) stars undergoing chemically homogeneous evolution (CHE) in reconciling this potential tension. These stars are more compact, hotter, and exhibit enhanced UV emission. We find that the rest-frame UV luminosity of star-forming galaxies can be significantly enhanced by a factor of $\sim 3-6$ when CHE stars above a minimum initial mass of $m_{\star,\min}^{\rm CHE}\sim 2-10\ \rm M_\odot$ account for more than half of the total stellar mass following a Salpeter initial mass function. As a result, the UV luminosity functions observed at $z\sim 12-16$ can be reproduced with less extreme values of star formation efficiency and UV luminosity stochastic variability. Our results highlight the potential of CHE in explaining the UV-bright galaxy populations detected by JWST and call for future work to explore the broader astrophysical implications of CHE and its associated phenomena in the early universe, such as gamma-ray bursts, compact object binaries, and metal enrichment.</description>

      <title>An upper limit on the frequency of short-period black hole companions to Sun-like stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stellar-mass black holes descend from high-mass stars, most of which had stellar binary companions. However, the number of those binary systems that survive the binary evolution and black hole formation is uncertain by multiple orders of magnitude. The survival rate is particularly uncertain for massive stars with low-mass companions, which are thought to be the progenitors of most black hole X-ray binaries. We present a search for close black hole companions (separations less than 20 solar radii) to AFGK-type stars in TESS, i.e. the non-accreting counterparts to and progenitors of low-mass X-ray binaries. Such black holes can be detected by the tidally induced ellipsoidal deformation of the visible star, and the ensuing photometric light-curve variations. From an initial sample of 4.7 million TESS stars, we have selected 457 candidates for such variations. However, spectroscopic followup of 251 of them shows that none are consistent with a close black hole companion. On the basis of this non-detection, we determine (2 $\sigma$ confidence) that fewer than one in $10^5$ Solar-type stars in the Solar neighbourhood host a short-period black hole companion. This upper limit is in tension with a number of ``optimistic'' population models in the literature that predict short-period black hole companions around one in $10^{4-5}$ stars. Our limits are still consistent with other models that predict only a few in $10^{7-8}$.</description>

      <title>New insight of time-transformed symplectic integrator I: hybrid methods for hierarchical triples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate $N$-body simulations of multiple systems such as binaries and triples are essential for understanding the formation and evolution of interacting binaries and binary mergers, including gravitational wave sources, blue stragglers and X-ray binaries. The logarithmic time-transformed explicit symplectic integrator (LogH), also known as algorithmic regularization, is a state-of-the-art method for this purpose.However, we show that this method is accurate for isolated Kepler orbits because of its ability to trace Keplerian trajectories, but much less accurate for hierarichal triple systems. The method can lead to an unphysical secular evolution of inner eccentricity in Kozal-Lidov triples, despite a small energy error. We demonstrate that hybrid methods, which apply LogH to the inner binary and alternative methods to the outer bodies, are significantly more effective, though not symplectic. Additionally, we introduce a more efficient hybrid method, BlogH, which eliminates the need for time synchronization and is time symmetric. The method is implemented in the few-body code SDAR. We explore suitable criteria for switching between the LogH and BlogH methods for general triple systems. These hybrid methods have the potential to enhance the integration performance of hierarchial triples.</description>

      <title>Searches for signatures of ultra-light axion dark matter in polarimetry data of the European Pulsar Timing Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02232v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultra-light axion-like particles (ALPs) can be a viable solution to the dark matter problem. The scalar field associated with ALPs, coupled to the electromagnetic field, acts as an active birefringent medium, altering the polarisation properties of light through which it propagates. In particular, oscillations of the axionic field induce monochromatic variations of the plane of linearly polarised radiation of astrophysical signals. The radio emission of millisecond pulsars provides an excellent tool to search for such manifestations, given their high fractional linear polarisation and negligible fluctuations of their polarisation properties. We have searched for the evidence of ALPs in the polarimetry measurements of pulsars collected and preprocessed for the European Pulsar Timing Array (EPTA) campaign. Focusing on the twelve brightest sources in linear polarisation, we searched for an astrophysical signal from axions using both frequentist and Bayesian statistical frameworks. For the frequentist analysis, which uses Lomb-Scargle periodograms at its core, no statistically significant signal has been found. The model used for the Bayesian analysis has been adjusted to accommodate multiple deterministic systematics that may be present in the data. A statistically significant signal has been found in the dataset of multiple pulsars with common frequency between $10^{-8}$ Hz and $2\times10^{-8}$ Hz, which can most likely be explained by the residual Faraday rotation in the terrestrial ionosphere. Strong bounds on the coupling constant $g_{a\gamma}$, in the same ballpark as other searches, have been obtained in the mass range between $6\times10^{-24}$ eV and $5\times10^{-21}$ eV. We conclude by discussing problems that can limit the sensitivity of our search for ultra-light axions in the polarimetry data of pulsars, and possible ways to resolve them.</description>

      <title>ComPair-2: A Next Generation Medium Energy Gamma-ray Telescope Prototype</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02562v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many questions posed in the Astro2020 Decadal survey in both the New Messengers and New Physics and the Cosmic Ecosystems science themes require a gamma-ray mission with capabilities exceeding those of existing (e.g. Fermi, Swift) and planned (e.g. COSI) observatories. ComPair, the Compton Pair telescope, is a prototype of such a next-generation gamma-ray mission. It had its inaugural balloon flight from Ft. Sumner, New Mexico in August 2023. To continue the goals of the ComPair project to develop technologies that will enable a future gamma-ray mission, the next generation of ComPair (ComPair-2) will be upgraded to increase the sensitivity and low-energy transient capabilities of the instrument. These advancements are enabled by AstroPix, a silicon monolithic active pixel sensor, in the tracker and custom dual-gain silicon photomultipliers and front-end electronics in the calorimeter. This effort builds on design work for the All-sky Medium Energy Gamma-ray Observatory eXplorer (AMEGO-X) concept that was submitted the 2021 MIDEX Announcement of Opportunity. Here we describe the ComPair-2 prototype design and integration and testing plans to advance the readiness level of these novel technologies.</description>

      <title>An unbiased statistical study of the metallicity of core-collapse supernovae based on VLT/MUSE integral-field-unit spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metallicity plays a crucial role in the evolution of massive stars and their final core-collapse supernova (CCSN) explosions. Integral-field-unit (IFU) spectroscopy can provide a spatially resolved view of SN host galaxies and serve as a powerful tool to study SN metallicities. Early transient surveys targeted bright galaxies with high star formation and SN rates; as a result, the discovered SNe are significantly biased toward high metallicities. More recently, the untargeted, wide-field transient surveys, such as ASAS-SN and ZTF, have discovered a large number of SNe without such a bias. In this work, we construct a large and unbiased sample of SNe discovered by (quasi-) untargted searches, consisting of 209 SNe of Types II (with unknown subtypes), IIP, IIn, IIb, Ib and Ic at z $\leq$ 0.02 with VLT/MUSE observations. This is currently the largest CCSN sample with IFU observations. With the strong-line method, we reveal the spatially-resolved metallicity maps of the SN host galaxies and acquire accurate metallicity measurements for the SN sites. Our results show that the SN metallicities range from 12 + log(O/H) = 8.1 to 8.7 dex, and the metallicity distributions for different SN types are very close to each other, with mean and median values of 8.4 - 8.5 dex. We carefully analysed the stochastic sampling effect, showing that our large sample size narrows the 1$\sigma$ uncertainty down to only 0.05 dex. The apparent metallicity differences among SN types are all within 3$\sigma$ uncertainties and the metallicity distributions for different SN types are all consistent with being randomly drawn from the same reference distribution. This suggests that metallicity plays a minor role in the origin of different CCSN types and some other metallicity-insensitive processes, such as binary interaction, dominate the distinction of CCSN types.</description>

Abstract: The standard perception is that the detection of high energy (TeV energies and above) neutrinos from an astrophysical object is a conclusive evidence for the presence of hadronic cosmic rays at the source. In the present work we demonstrate that TeV neutrinos can also be originated from energetic electrons via electromagnetic interactions in different potential cosmic ray sources with flux levels comparable to that of the hadronic originated neutrinos at high energies. Our findings thus imply that at least a part of the neutrinos observed by Icecube observatory may be originated from energetic electrons. The present analysis further suggests that only a combine study of TeV gamma rays and neutrinos over a wide energy range from an astrophysical object can unambiguously identify the nature of their parents, hadrons or leptons.</description>

      <title>High-resolution imaging of the evolving bipolar outflows in symbiotic novae: The case of the RSOphiuchi 2021 nova outburst</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05794v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recurrent and symbiotic nova RS Ophiuchi (RSOph) underwent a new outburst phase during August 2021, about 15 years after the last event that occurred in 2006. This outburst represents the first nova event ever detected at very high energies (VHE, E&gt;100\,GeV), and a whole set of coordinated multiwavelength observations were triggered by this event. The main goals of this work are to characterize the evolving morphology of the expanding bipolar ejecta with high accuracy and to determine the physical conditions of the surrounding medium in which they propagate. By means of high-resolution very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) radio observations, we monitored RSOph with the European VLBI Network (EVN) and e-MERLIN at 1.6 and 5\,GHz during multiple epochs from 14 to 65 days after the explosion. We reveal an evolving source structure consisting of a central and compact core and two elongated bipolar outflows expanding on opposite sides of the core in the east-west direction. The ejecta angular separation with time is consistent with a linear expansion with an average projected speed of $\sim7000$ km s$^{-1}$. We find clear evidence of a radial dependence of the density along the density enhancement on the orbital plane (DEOP), going from 1$\times$10$^7$ ~cm$^{-3}$ close to the central binary to 9$\times$10$^5$~cm$^{-3}$ at $\sim400$~AU. Thanks to the accurate source astrometric position provided by \textit{Gaia} DR3, in this work we draw a detailed scenario of the geometry and physics of the RSOph evolving source structure after the most recent nova event. We conclude that most of the mass lost by the red giant companion goes into the DEOP, for which we estimate a total mass of $6.4 \times 10^{-6} ~~\mathrm{M_\odot}$, and into the circumstellar region, while only a small fraction (about one-tenth) is accreted by the white dwarf.</description>

      <title>Finding the Fuse: Prospects for the Detection and Characterization of Hydrogen-Rich Core-Collapse Supernova Precursor Emission with the LSST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13314v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Enhanced emission in the months to years preceding explosion has been detected for several core-collapse supernovae (SNe). Though the physical mechanisms driving the emission remain hotly debated, the light curves of detected events show long-lived ($\geq$50 days), plateau-like behavior, suggesting hydrogen recombination may significantly contribute to the total energy budget. The Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) will provide a decade-long photometric baseline to search for this emission, both in binned pre-explosion observations after an SN is detected and in single-visit observations prior to the SN explosion. In anticipation of these searches, we simulate a range of eruptive precursor models to core-collapse SNe and forecast the discovery rates of these phenomena in LSST data. We find a detection rate of ~40-130 yr$^{-1}$ for SN IIP/IIL precursors and ~110 yr$^{-1}$ for SN IIn precursors in single-epoch photometry. Considering the first three years of observations with the effects of rolling and observing triplets included, this number grows to a total of 150-400 in binned photometry, with the highest number recovered when binning in 100-day bins for 2020tlf-like precursors and in 20-day bins for other recombination-driven models from the literature. We quantify the impact of using templates contaminated by residual light (from either long-lived or separate precursor emission) on these detection rates, and explore strategies for estimating baseline flux to mitigate these issues. Spectroscopic follow-up of the eruptions preceding core-collapse SNe and detected with LSST will offer important clues to the underlying drivers of terminal-stage mass loss in massive stars.</description>

      <title>Shock breakouts from compact CSM surrounding core-collapse SN progenitors may contribute significantly to the observed $\gtrsim10$ TeV neutrino background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14233v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Growing observational evidence suggests that enhanced mass loss from the progenitors of core-collapse supernovae (SNe) is common during $\sim1$ yr preceding the explosion, creating an optically thick circum-stellar medium (CSM) shell at $\sim10^{14.5}$ cm radii. We show that if such mass loss is indeed common, then the breakout of the SN shock through the dense CSM shell produces a neutrino flux that may account for a significant fraction of the observed $\gtrsim10$ TeV neutrino background. The neutrinos are created within a few days from the explosion, during and shortly after the shock breakout, which produces also large UV (and later X-ray) luminosity. The compact size and large UV luminosity imply a pair production optical depth of $\sim10^4$ for $&gt;100$ GeV photons, naturally accounting for the lack of a high-energy gamma-ray background accompanying the neutrino background. SNe producing $&gt;1$ neutrino event in a 1 km$^2$ detector are expected at a rate of $\lesssim0.1$/yr. A quantitative theory describing the evolution of the electromagnetic spectrum during a breakout, as the radiation-mediated shock is transformed into a collisionless one, is required to enable (i) using data from upcoming surveys that will systematically detect large numbers of young, $&lt;1$ d old SNe, to determine the pre-explosion mass loss history of the SN progenitor population, and (ii) a quantitative determination of the neutrino luminosity and spectrum.</description>

      <title>LHAASO detection of very-high-energy gamma-ray emission surrounding PSR J0248+6021</title>

Abstract: We report the detection of an extended very-high-energy (VHE) gamma-ray source coincident with the location of middle-aged (62.4~\rm kyr) pulsar PSR J0248+6021, by using the LHAASO-WCDA data of live 796 days and LHAASO-KM2A data of live 1216 days. A significant excess of \gray induced showers is observed both by WCDA in energy bands of 1-25~\rm TeV and KM2A in energy bands of $&gt;$ 25~\rm TeV with 7.3 $\sigma$ and 13.5 $\sigma$, respectively. The best-fit position derived through WCDA data is R.A. = 42.06$^\circ \pm$ 0.12$^\circ$ and Dec. = 60.24$^\circ \pm $ 0.13$^\circ$ with an extension of 0.69$^\circ\pm$0.15$^\circ$ and that of the KM2A data is R.A.= 42.29$^\circ \pm $ 0.13$^\circ$ and Dec. = 60.38$^\circ \pm$ 0.07$^\circ$ with an extension of 0.37$^\circ\pm$0.07$^\circ$. No clear extended multiwavelength counterpart of this LHAASO source has been found from the radio band to the GeV band. The most plausible explanation of the VHE \gray emission is the inverse Compton process of highly relativistic electrons and positrons injected by the pulsar. These electrons/positrons are hypothesized to be either confined within the pulsar wind nebula or to have already escaped into the interstellar medium, forming a pulsar halo.</description>

      <title>Impact of propagation effects on the spectro-temporal properties of Fast Radio Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00232v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a mathematical analysis of the spectro-temporal properties of Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs), focusing on the distortions introduced by propagation effects such as scattering and inaccurate de-dispersion. By examining the impact of different scattering timescales and residual dispersion measures (DMs), both independently and in combination, we identify systematic trends in the sub-burst slope law as defined within the framework of the Triggered Relativistic Dynamical Model (TRDM). These effects primarily alter the measurements of the sub-burst slope and duration, thereby also modifying their correlations with other properties, such as central frequency and bandwidth. Our results show that scatter-induced temporal broadening affects duration more than slope, with weak to moderate scattering subtly modifying the sub-burst slope law and strong scattering causing significant deviations. Residual dispersion preferentially modifies the slope, further changing the trends predicted by the sub-burst slope law. Ultra-short bursts (or ultra-FRBs) emerge as particularly susceptible to these effects even at relatively high frequencies, underscoring the need for precise treatment of scattering and accurate dedispersion before performing analyses. Our findings emphasize the necessity for higher frequency observations (especially for ultra-FRBs) to improve the DM estimates as well as the measurements of spectro-temporal properties.</description>

      <title>Can we discern millilensed gravitational-wave signals from signals produced by precessing binary black holes with ground-based detectors?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.07253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.07253v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Millilensed gravitational waves (GWs) can potentially be identified by the interference signatures caused by $\sim\!O(10\textrm{--}100)~\textrm{ms}$ time delays between multiple overlapping lensed signals. However, distinguishing millilensed GWs from GWs generated by precessing binary black-hole mergers can be challenging due to their apparent similar waveform shapes. This morphological similarity may be an obstacle to template-based searches to correctly identifying the origin of observed GWs and poses a fundamental question, can we discern millilensed GW signals from signals produced by precessing binary black holes? In this study, we investigate the feasibility of distinguishing between these GWs by performing a proof-of-principle injection study of simulated millilensed precessing GW signals, within the context of ground-based LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA detector network detections. Our findings indicate that it is possible to differentiate between the two effects by comparing signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) computed using templates based on different hypotheses for the target signal. We further show from the parameter estimation study that while lensing magnification is sensitive to precession, it is possible to identify millilensing in precessing GW signals with an SNR of 18. The recovery of precession in the presence of lensing is more challenging but improves significantly for signals with an SNR of 40. Nonetheless, neglecting millilensing effects results in biases in the recovered spins, revealing the importance of accounting for these effects in accurate GW signal analysis.</description>

      <title>Whispers from the quantum core: the ringdown of semiclassical stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08807v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This investigation delves into the ringdown signals produced by semiclassical stars, which are ultra-compact, regular solutions of the Einstein equations incorporating stress-energy contributions from quantum vacuum polarization. These stars exhibit an approximately Schwarzschild exterior and an interior composed of a constant-density classical fluid and a cloud of vacuum polarization. By adjusting their compactness and density, we can alter the internal structure of these stars without modifying the exterior. This adaptability enables us to examine the sensitivity of the ringdown signal to the innermost regions of the emitting object and to compare it with similar geometries that differ substantially only at the core. Our results indicate that echo signals are intrinsically linked to the presence of stable light rings and can be very sensitive to the internal structure of the emitting object. This point was previously overlooked, either due to the imposition of reflective boundary conditions at the stellar surface or due to the assumption of low curvature interior geometries. Specifically, for stellar-sized semiclassical stars, we find that the interior travel time is sufficiently prolonged to render the echoes effectively unobservable. These findings underscore the potential efficacy of ultra-compact objects as black hole mimickers and emphasize that any phenomenological constraints on such objects necessitate a detailed understanding of their specific properties and core structure.</description>

      <title>Flexible mapping of ringdown amplitudes for nonprecessing binary black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05276v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The remnant black hole from a binary coalescence emits ringdown gravitational waves characterized by quasinormal modes, which depend solely on the remnant's mass and spin. In contrast, the ringdown amplitudes and phases are determined by the properties of the merging progenitors. Accurately modeling these amplitudes and phases reduces systematic biases in parameter estimation and enables the development and performance of rigorous tests of general relativity. We present a state-of-the-art, data-driven surrogate model for ringdown amplitudes and phases, leveraging Gaussian process regression trained against SXS numerical-relativity simulations. Focusing on nonprecessing, quasicircular binary black holes, our model offers the most comprehensive fit that includes 16 emission modes, incorporating overtones and quadratic contributions. Our surrogate model achieves reconstruction errors that are approximately 2 orders of magnitude smaller than the typical measurement errors of current gravitational-wave interferometers. An additional benefit of our approach is its flexibility, which allows for future extensions to include features such as eccentricity and precession, broadening the scope of its applicability to more generic astrophysical scenarios. Finally, we are releasing our model in a ready-to-use package called postmerger.</description>

      <title>ZTF SN Ia DR2: Overview</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04346v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first homogeneous release of several thousand Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), all having spectroscopic classification, and spectroscopic redshifts for half the sample. This release, named the "DR2", contains 3628 nearby (z &lt; 0.3) SNe Ia discovered, followed and classified by the Zwicky Transient Facility survey between March 2018 and December 2020. Of these, 3000 have good-to-excellent sampling and 2667 pass standard cosmology light-curve quality cuts. This release is thus the largest SN Ia release to date, increasing by an order of magnitude the number of well characterized low-redshift objects. With the "DR2", we also provide a volume-limited (z &lt; 0.06) sample of nearly a thousand SNe Ia. With such a large, homogeneous and well controlled dataset, we are studying key current questions on SN cosmology, such as the linearity SNe Ia standardization, the SN and host dependencies, the diversity of the SN Ia population, and the accuracy of the current light-curve modeling. These, and more, are studied in detail in a series of articles associated with this release. Alongside the SN Ia parameters, we publish our force-photometry gri-band light curves, 5138 spectra, local and global host properties, observing logs, and a python tool to ease use and access of these data. The photometric accuracy of the "DR2" is not yet suited for cosmological parameter inference, which will follow as "DR2.5" release. We nonetheless demonstrate that the multi-thousand SN Ia Hubble Diagram has a typical 0.15 mag scatter.</description>

      <title>Polarization of active galactic nuclei with significant VLBI-Gaia displacements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12226v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Numerous studies have reported significant displacements in the coordinates of active galactic nuclei between measurements using radio interferometry techniques and those obtained by the Gaia space observatory. There is a consensus that these discrepancies do indeed manifest astrometrically resolved sub-components of AGN rather than random measurement noise. Among other evidence, it has been reported that AGN with VLBI-to-Gaia displacements (VGD) pointing downstream their parsec-scale radio jets exhibit higher optical polarization compared to sources with the opposite VGD orientation. We aim to verify this previously reported connection between optical polarization and VGD-jet angle using a larger dataset of polarimetric measurements and updated Gaia DR3 positions. We also seek additional evidence supporting the disc-jet dichotomy as an explanation of such a connection by using mm-wave polarization and multi-band optical polarization measurements. We performed optical polarimetric observations of 152 AGN using three telescopes. We cross-match public astrometric data from VLBI and Gaia experiments, obtain corresponding positional displacements, and join this catalog with the polarimetric and jet directions data. AGN with downstream VGD are confirmed to have significantly higher optical fractional polarization than the upstream sample. At the same time, the mm-wavelength polarization of the two samples demonstrates very similar distributions. Our results support the hypothesis that the VLBI-to-Gaia displacements pointing down the radio jet are likely caused by a component in the jet emitting highly polarized synchrotron radiation and dominating in the overall optical emission. The upstream-oriented VGD are likely to be produced by the low-polarized emission of the central engine sub-components dominating in the optical.</description>

Abstract: The opening of the gravitational wave window has significantly enhanced our capacity to explore the universe's most extreme and dynamic sector. In the mHz frequency range, a diverse range of compact objects, from the most massive black holes at the farthest reaches of the Universe to the lightest white dwarfs in our cosmic backyard, generate a complex and dynamic symphony of gravitational wave signals. Once recorded by gravitational wave detectors, these unique fingerprints have the potential to decipher the birth and growth of cosmic structures over a wide range of scales, from stellar binaries and stellar clusters to galaxies and large-scale structures. The TianQin space-borne gravitational wave mission is scheduled for launch in the 2030s, with an operational lifespan of five years. It will facilitate pivotal insights into the history of our universe. This document presents a concise overview of the detectable sources of TianQin, outlining their characteristics, the challenges they present, and the expected impact of the TianQin observatory on our understanding of them.</description>
