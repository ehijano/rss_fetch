      <title>Availability of Perfect Decomposition in Statistical Linkage Learning for Unitation-based Function Concatenations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Statistical Linkage Learning (SLL) is a part of many state-of-the-art optimizers. The purpose of SLL is to discover variable interdependencies. It has been shown that the effectiveness of SLL-using optimizers is highly dependent on the quality of SLL-based problem decomposition. Thus, understanding what kind of problems are hard or easy to decompose by SLL is important for practice. In this work, we analytically estimate the size of a population sufficient for obtaining a perfect decomposition in case of concatenations of certain unitation-based functions. The experimental study confirms the accuracy of the proposed estimate. Finally, using the proposed estimate, we identify those problem types that may be considered hard for SLL-using optimizers.</description>

      <title>Lifelong Evolution of Swarms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adapting to task changes without forgetting previous knowledge is a key skill for intelligent systems, and a crucial aspect of lifelong learning. Swarm controllers, however, are typically designed for specific tasks, lacking the ability to retain knowledge across changing tasks. Lifelong learning, on the other hand, focuses on individual agents with limited insights into the emergent abilities of a collective like a swarm. To address this gap, we introduce a lifelong evolutionary framework for swarms, where a population of swarm controllers is evolved in a dynamic environment that incrementally presents novel tasks. This requires evolution to find controllers that quickly adapt to new tasks while retaining knowledge of previous ones, as they may reappear in the future. We discover that the population inherently preserves information about previous tasks, and it can reuse it to foster adaptation and mitigate forgetting. In contrast, the top-performing individual for a given task catastrophically forgets previous tasks. To mitigate this phenomenon, we design a regularization process for the evolutionary algorithm, reducing forgetting in top-performing individuals. Evolving swarms in a lifelong fashion raises fundamental questions on the current state of deep lifelong learning and on the robustness of swarm controllers in dynamic environments.</description>

      <title>Neuromorphic Principles for Efficient Large Language Models on Intel Loihi 2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18002v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) deliver impressive performance but require large amounts of energy. In this work, we present a MatMul-free LLM architecture adapted for Intel's neuromorphic processor, Loihi 2. Our approach leverages Loihi 2's support for low-precision, event-driven computation and stateful processing. Our hardware-aware quantized model on GPU demonstrates that a 370M parameter MatMul-free model can be quantized with no accuracy loss. Based on preliminary results, we report up to 3x higher throughput with 2x less energy, compared to transformer-based LLMs on an edge GPU, with significantly better scaling. Further hardware optimizations will increase throughput and decrease energy consumption. These results show the potential of neuromorphic hardware for efficient inference and pave the way for efficient reasoning models capable of generating complex, long-form text rapidly and cost-effectively.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning-based Self-adaptive Differential Evolution through Automated Landscape Feature Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, Meta-Black-Box-Optimization (MetaBBO) methods significantly enhance the performance of traditional black-box optimizers through meta-learning flexible and generalizable meta-level policies that excel in dynamic algorithm configuration (DAC) tasks within the low-level optimization, reducing the expertise required to adapt optimizers for novel optimization tasks. Though promising, existing MetaBBO methods heavily rely on human-crafted feature extraction approach to secure learning effectiveness. To address this issue, this paper introduces a novel MetaBBO method that supports automated feature learning during the meta-learning process, termed as RLDE-AFL, which integrates a learnable feature extraction module into a reinforcement learning-based DE method to learn both the feature encoding and meta-level policy. Specifically, we design an attention-based neural network with mantissa-exponent based embedding to transform the solution populations and corresponding objective values during the low-level optimization into expressive landscape features. We further incorporate a comprehensive algorithm configuration space including diverse DE operators into a reinforcement learning-aided DAC paradigm to unleash the behavior diversity and performance of the proposed RLDE-AFL. Extensive benchmark results show that co-training the proposed feature learning module and DAC policy contributes to the superior optimization performance of RLDE-AFL to several advanced DE methods and recent MetaBBO baselines over both synthetic and realistic BBO scenarios. The source codes of RLDE-AFL are available at https://github.com/GMC-DRL/RLDE-AFL.</description>

      <title>Accurate Peak Detection in Multimodal Optimization via Approximated Landscape Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detecting potential optimal peak areas and locating the accurate peaks in these areas are two major challenges in Multimodal Optimization problems (MMOPs). To address them, much efforts have been spent on developing novel searching operators, niching strategies and multi-objective problem transformation pipelines. Though promising, existing approaches more or less overlook the potential usage of landscape knowledge. In this paper, we propose a novel optimization framework tailored for MMOPs, termed as APDMMO, which facilitates peak detection via fully leveraging the landscape knowledge and hence capable of providing strong optimization performance on MMOPs. Specifically, we first design a novel surrogate landscape model which ensembles a group of non-linear activation units to improve the regression accuracy on diverse MMOPs. Then we propose a free-of-trial peak detection method which efficiently locates potential peak areas through back-propagation on the learned surrogate landscape model. Based on the detected peak areas, we employ SEP-CMAES for local search within these areas in parallel to further improve the accuracy of the found optima. Extensive benchmarking results demonstrate that APDMMO outperforms several up-to-date baselines. Further ablation studies verify the effectiveness of the proposed novel designs.

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the application of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) for solving the inverse advection-diffusion problem to localize pollution sources. The study focuses on optimizing neural network architectures to accurately model pollutant dispersion dynamics under diverse conditions, including scenarios with weak and strong winds and multiple pollution sources. Various PINN configurations are evaluated, showing the strong dependence of solution accuracy on hyperparameter selection. Recommendations for efficient PINN configurations are provided based on these comparisons. The approach is tested across multiple scenarios and validated using real-world data that accounts for atmospheric variability. The results demonstrate that the proposed methodology achieves high accuracy in source localization, showcasing the stability and potential of PINNs for addressing environmental monitoring and pollution management challenges under complex weather conditions.</description>

      <title>Temporal Flexibility in Spiking Neural Networks: Towards Generalization Across Time Steps and Deployment Friendliness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17394v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), models inspired by neural mechanisms in the brain, allow for energy-efficient implementation on neuromorphic hardware. However, SNNs trained with current direct training approaches are constrained to a specific time step. This "temporal inflexibility" 1) hinders SNNs' deployment on time-step-free fully event-driven chips and 2) prevents energy-performance balance based on dynamic inference time steps. In this study, we first explore the feasibility of training SNNs that generalize across different time steps. We then introduce Mixed Time-step Training (MTT), a novel method that improves the temporal flexibility of SNNs, making SNNs adaptive to diverse temporal structures. During each iteration of MTT, random time steps are assigned to different SNN stages, with spikes transmitted between stages via communication modules. After training, the weights are deployed and evaluated on both time-stepped and fully event-driven platforms. Experimental results show that models trained by MTT gain remarkable temporal flexibility, friendliness for both event-driven and clock-driven deployment (nearly lossless on N-MNIST and 10.1% higher than standard methods on CIFAR10-DVS), enhanced network generalization, and near SOTA performance. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to report the results of large-scale SNN deployment on fully event-driven scenarios.</description>

      <title>Bandwidth Reservation for Time-Critical Vehicular Applications: A Multi-Operator Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Onsite bandwidth reservation requests often face challenges such as price fluctuations and fairness issues due to unpredictable bandwidth availability and stringent latency requirements. Requesting bandwidth in advance can mitigate the impact of these fluctuations and ensure timely access to critical resources. In a multi-Mobile Network Operator (MNO) environment, vehicles need to select cost-effective and reliable resources for their safety-critical applications. This research aims to minimize resource costs by finding the best price among multiple MNOs. It formulates multi-operator scenarios as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), utilizing a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithm, specifically Dueling Deep Q-Learning. For efficient and stable learning, we propose a novel area-wise approach and an adaptive MDP synthetic close to the real environment. The Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) is used to handle time-dependent data and model training. Furthermore, the research leverages Amazon spot price data and adopts a multi-phase training approach, involving initial training on synthetic data, followed by real-world data. These phases enable the DRL agent to make informed decisions using insights from historical data and real-time observations. The results show that our model leads to significant cost reductions, up to 40%, compared to scenarios without a policy model in such a complex environment.</description>

      <title>Personalized Language Models via Privacy-Preserving Evolutionary Model Merging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18008v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Personalization in large language models (LLMs) seeks to tailor models to individual user or user group preferences. Prompt-based methods augment queries with user preference information, whereas training-based methods directly encode preferences into model parameters for more effective personalization. Despite achieving some success in personalizing LLMs, prior methods often fail to directly optimize task-specific metrics and lack explicit privacy-preservation mechanisms. To address these limitations, we propose Privacy-Preserving Model Merging via Evolutionary Algorithms (PriME), a novel approach to personalization that employs gradient-free methods to directly optimize task-specific metrics while preserving user privacy. By incorporating privacy preservation into optimization, PriME produces a personalized module that effectively captures the target user's preferences while minimizing the privacy risks for the users sharing their private information. Experiments on the LaMP benchmark show that PriME outperforms both prompt-based and training-based methods, achieving up to a 45% performance improvement over the prior art. Further analysis shows that PriME achieves a significantly better privacy-utility trade-off, highlighting the potential of evolutionary approaches for privacy-preserving LLM personalization.</description>

      <title>Surrogate Learning in Meta-Black-Box Optimization: A Preliminary Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent Meta-Black-Box Optimization (MetaBBO) approaches have shown possibility of enhancing the optimization performance through learning meta-level policies to dynamically configure low-level optimizers. However, existing MetaBBO approaches potentially consume massive function evaluations to train their meta-level policies. Inspired by the recent trend of using surrogate models for cost-friendly evaluation of expensive optimization problems, in this paper, we propose a novel MetaBBO framework which combines surrogate learning process and reinforcement learning-aided Differential Evolution algorithm, namely Surr-RLDE, to address the intensive function evaluation in MetaBBO. Surr-RLDE comprises two learning stages: surrogate learning and policy learning. In surrogate learning, we train a Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) with a novel relative-order-aware loss to accurately approximate the objective functions of the problem instances used for subsequent policy learning. In policy learning, we employ reinforcement learning (RL) to dynamically configure the mutation operator in DE. The learned surrogate model is integrated into the training of the RL-based policy to substitute for the original objective function, which effectively reduces consumed evaluations during policy learning. Extensive benchmark results demonstrate that Surr-RLDE not only shows competitive performance to recent baselines, but also shows compelling generalization for higher-dimensional problems. Further ablation studies underscore the effectiveness of each technical components in Surr-RLDE. We open-source Surr-RLDE at https://github.com/GMC-DRL/Surr-RLDE.</description>

      <title>Informer in Algorithmic Investment Strategies on High Frequency Bitcoin Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The article investigates the usage of Informer architecture for building automated trading strategies for high frequency Bitcoin data. Three strategies using Informer model with different loss functions: Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Generalized Mean Absolute Directional Loss (GMADL) and Quantile loss, are proposed and evaluated against the Buy and Hold benchmark and two benchmark strategies based on technical indicators. The evaluation is conducted using data of various frequencies: 5 minute, 15 minute, and 30 minute intervals, over the 6 different periods. Although the Informer-based model with Quantile loss did not outperform the benchmark, two other models achieved better results. The performance of the model using RMSE loss worsens when used with higher frequency data while the model that uses novel GMADL loss function is benefiting from higher frequency data and when trained on 5 minute interval it beat all the other strategies on most of the testing periods. The primary contribution of this study is the application and assessment of the RMSE, GMADL, and Quantile loss functions with the Informer model to forecast future returns, subsequently using these forecasts to develop automated trading strategies. The research provides evidence that employing an Informer model trained with the GMADL loss function can result in superior trading outcomes compared to the buy-and-hold approach.</description>

      <title>Feature Learning beyond the Lazy-Rich Dichotomy: Insights from Representational Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ability to integrate task-relevant information into neural representations is a fundamental aspect of both biological and artificial intelligence. To enable theoretical analysis, recent work has examined whether a network learns task-relevant features (rich learning) or resembles a random feature model (or a kernel machine, i.e., lazy learning). However, this simple lazy-versus-rich dichotomy overlooks the possibility of various subtypes of feature learning that emerge from different architectures, learning rules, and data properties. Furthermore, most existing approaches emphasize weight matrices or neural tangent kernels, limiting their applicability to neuroscience because they do not explicitly characterize representations.
  In this work, we introduce an analysis framework based on representational geometry to study feature learning. Instead of analyzing what are the learned features, we focus on characterizing how task-relevant representational manifolds evolve during the learning process. In both theory and experiment, we find that when a network learns features useful for solving a task, the task-relevant manifolds become increasingly untangled. Moreover, by tracking changes in the underlying manifold geometry, we uncover distinct learning stages throughout training, as well as different learning strategies associated with training hyperparameters, uncovering subtypes of feature learning beyond the lazy-versus-rich dichotomy. Applying our method to neuroscience and machine learning, we gain geometric insights into the structural inductive biases of neural circuits solving cognitive tasks and the mechanisms underlying out-of-distribution generalization in image classification. Our framework provides a novel geometric perspective for understanding and quantifying feature learning in both artificial and biological neural networks.</description>

      <title>Parental Guidance: Efficient Lifelong Learning through Evolutionary Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Developing robotic agents that can perform well in diverse environments while showing a variety of behaviors is a key challenge in AI and robotics. Traditional reinforcement learning (RL) methods often create agents that specialize in narrow tasks, limiting their adaptability and diversity. To overcome this, we propose a preliminary, evolution-inspired framework that includes a reproduction module, similar to natural species reproduction, balancing diversity and specialization. By integrating RL, imitation learning (IL), and a coevolutionary agent-terrain curriculum, our system evolves agents continuously through complex tasks. This approach promotes adaptability, inheritance of useful traits, and continual learning. Agents not only refine inherited skills but also surpass their predecessors. Our initial experiments show that this method improves exploration efficiency and supports open-ended learning, offering a scalable solution where sparse reward coupled with diverse terrain environments induces a multi-task setting.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Insect Paraintelligence: How a Mindless Colony of Ants Meaningfully Moves a Beetle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18858v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, a new concept called Vector Dissipation of Randomness (VDR) is developed and formalized. It describes the mechanism by which complex multicomponent systems transition from chaos to order through the filtering of random directions, accumulation of information in the environment, and self-organization of agents. VDR explains how individual random strategies can evolve into collective goaldirected behavior, leading to the emergence of an ordered structure without centralized control. To test the proposed model, a numerical simulation of the "ant and beetle" system was conducted, in which agents (ants) randomly choose movement directions, but through feedback mechanisms and filtering of weak strategies, they form a single coordinated vector of the beetles movement. VDR is a universal mechanism applicable to a wide range of self-organizing systems, including biological populations, decentralized technological networks, sociological processes, and artificial intelligence algorithms. For the first time, an equation of the normalized emergence function in the processing of vector dissipation of randomness in the Ant and Beetle system has been formulated. The concept of paraintelligence was introduced for the first time. Insect paraintelligence is interpreted as a rational functionality that is close to or equivalent to intelligent activity in the absence of reflexive consciousness and selfawareness.</description>

      <title>Multi-Neuron Representations of Hierarchical Concepts in Spiking Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04628v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe how hierarchical concepts can be represented in three types of layered neural networks. The aim is to support recognition of the concepts when partial information about the concepts is presented, and also when some of the neurons in the network might fail. Our failure model involves initial random failures. The three types of networks are: feed-forward networks with high connectivity, feed-forward networks with low connectivity, and layered networks with low connectivity and with both forward edges and "lateral" edges within layers. In order to achieve fault-tolerance, the representations all use multiple representative neurons for each concept. We show how recognition can work in all three of these settings, and quantify how the probability of correct recognition depends on several parameters, including the number of representatives and the neuron failure probability. We also discuss how these representations might be learned, in all three types of networks. For the feed-forward networks, the learning algorithms are similar to ones used in [4], whereas for networks with lateral edges, the algorithms are generally inspired by work on the assembly calculus [3, 6, 7].</description>

      <title>Expressivity of Neural Networks with Random Weights and Learned Biases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00957v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Landmark universal function approximation results for neural networks with trained weights and biases provided the impetus for the ubiquitous use of neural networks as learning models in neuroscience and Artificial Intelligence (AI). Recent work has extended these results to networks in which a smaller subset of weights (e.g., output weights) are tuned, leaving other parameters random. However, it remains an open question whether universal approximation holds when only biases are learned, despite evidence from neuroscience and AI that biases significantly shape neural responses. The current paper answers this question. We provide theoretical and numerical evidence demonstrating that feedforward neural networks with fixed random weights can approximate any continuous function on compact sets. We further show an analogous result for the approximation of dynamical systems with recurrent neural networks. Our findings are relevant to neuroscience, where they demonstrate the potential for behaviourally relevant changes in dynamics without modifying synaptic weights, as well as for AI, where they shed light on recent fine-tuning methods for large language models, like bias and prefix-based approaches.</description>

      <title>MERGE$^3$: Efficient Evolutionary Merging on Consumer-grade GPUs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10436v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Evolutionary model merging enables the creation of high-performing multi-task models but remains computationally prohibitive for consumer hardware. We introduce MERGE$^3$, an efficient framework that makes evolutionary merging feasible on a single GPU by reducing fitness computation costs 50$\times$ while preserving performance. MERGE$^3$ achieves this by Extracting a reduced dataset for evaluation, Estimating model abilities using Item Response Theory (IRT), and Evolving optimal merges via IRT-based performance estimators. Our method enables state-of-the-art multilingual and cross-lingual merging, transferring knowledge across languages with significantly lower computational overhead. We provide theoretical guarantees and an open-source library, democratizing high-quality model merging.</description>

      <title>Active Learning for Neural PDE Solvers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01536v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Solving partial differential equations (PDEs) is a fundamental problem in science and engineering. While neural PDE solvers can be more efficient than established numerical solvers, they often require large amounts of training data that is costly to obtain. Active learning (AL) could help surrogate models reach the same accuracy with smaller training sets by querying classical solvers with more informative initial conditions and PDE parameters. While AL is more common in other domains, it has yet to be studied extensively for neural PDE solvers. To bridge this gap, we introduce AL4PDE, a modular and extensible active learning benchmark. It provides multiple parametric PDEs and state-of-the-art surrogate models for the solver-in-the-loop setting, enabling the evaluation of existing and the development of new AL methods for neural PDE solving. We use the benchmark to evaluate batch active learning algorithms such as uncertainty- and feature-based methods. We show that AL reduces the average error by up to 71% compared to random sampling and significantly reduces worst-case errors. Moreover, AL generates similar datasets across repeated runs, with consistent distributions over the PDE parameters and initial conditions. The acquired datasets are reusable, providing benefits for surrogate models not involved in the data generation.</description>

      <title>Spiking Neural Network as Adaptive Event Stream Slicer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02249v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Event-based cameras are attracting significant interest as they provide rich edge information, high dynamic range, and high temporal resolution. Many state-of-the-art event-based algorithms rely on splitting the events into fixed groups, resulting in the omission of crucial temporal information, particularly when dealing with diverse motion scenarios (\eg, high/low speed).In this work, we propose SpikeSlicer, a novel-designed plug-and-play event processing method capable of splitting events stream adaptively.SpikeSlicer utilizes a low-energy spiking neural network (SNN) to trigger event slicing. To guide the SNN to fire spikes at optimal time steps, we propose the Spiking Position-aware Loss (SPA-Loss) to modulate the neuron's state. Additionally, we develop a Feedback-Update training strategy that refines the slicing decisions using feedback from the downstream artificial neural network (ANN). Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method yields significant performance improvements in event-based object tracking and recognition. Notably, SpikeSlicer provides a brand-new SNN-ANN cooperation paradigm, where the SNN acts as an efficient, low-energy data processor to assist the ANN in improving downstream performance, injecting new perspectives and potential avenues of exploration. Our code is available at https://github.com/AndyCao1125/SpikeSlicer.</description>

      <title>Evolution 6.0: Evolving Robotic Capabilities Through Generative Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17034v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new concept, Evolution 6.0, which represents the evolution of robotics driven by Generative AI. When a robot lacks the necessary tools to accomplish a task requested by a human, it autonomously designs the required instruments and learns how to use them to achieve the goal. Evolution 6.0 is an autonomous robotic system powered by Vision-Language Models (VLMs), Vision-Language Action (VLA) models, and Text-to-3D generative models for tool design and task execution. The system comprises two key modules: the Tool Generation Module, which fabricates task-specific tools from visual and textual data, and the Action Generation Module, which converts natural language instructions into robotic actions. It integrates QwenVLM for environmental understanding, OpenVLA for task execution, and Llama-Mesh for 3D tool generation. Evaluation results demonstrate a 90% success rate for tool generation with a 10-second inference time, and action generation achieving 83.5% in physical and visual generalization, 70% in motion generalization, and 37% in semantic generalization. Future improvements will focus on bimanual manipulation, expanded task capabilities, and enhanced environmental interpretation to improve real-world adaptability.</description>
