      <title>New Wolf-Rayet wind yields and nucleosynthesis of Helium stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strong metallicity-dependent winds dominate the evolution of core He-burning, classical Wolf-Rayet (cWR) stars, which eject both H and He-fusion products such as 14N, 12C, 16O, 19F, 22Ne and 23Na during their evolution. The chemical enrichment from cWRs can be significant. cWR stars are also key sources for neutron production relevant for the weak s-process. We calculate stellar models of cWRs at solar metallicity for a range of initial Helium star masses (12-50M), adopting the recent hydrodynamical wind rates from Sander &amp; Vink (2020). Stellar wind yields are provided for the entire post-main sequence evolution until core O-exhaustion. While literature has previously considered cWRs as a viable source of the radioisotope 26Al, we confirm that negligible 26Al is ejected by cWRs since it has decayed to 26Mg or proton-captured to 27Al. However, in Paper I, Higgins et al. (2023) we showed that very massive stars eject substantial quantities of 26Al, among other elements including N, Ne, and Na, already from the zero-age-main-sequence. Here, we examine the production of 19F and find that even with lower mass-loss rates than previous studies, our cWR models still eject substantial amounts of 19F. We provide central neutron densities (Nn) of a 30M cWR compared with a 32M post-VMS WR and confirm that during core He-burning, cWRs produce a significant number of neutrons for the weak s-process via the 22Ne(alpha,n)25Mg reaction. Finally, we compare our cWR models with observed [Ne/He], [C/He] and [O/He] ratios of Galactic WC and WO stars.</description>

      <title>Improving the Automated Coronal Jet Identification with U-NET</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coronal jets are one of the most common eruptive activities in the solar atmosphere. They are related to rich physics processes, including but not limited to magnetic reconnection, flaring, instabilities, and plasma heating. Automated identification of off-limb coronal jets has been difficult due to their abundant nature, complex appearance, and relatively small size compared to other features in the corona. In this paper, we present an automated coronal jet identification algorithm (AJIA) that utilizes true and fake jets previously detected by a laborious semi-automated jet detection algorithm (SAJIA, Liu et al. 2023) as the input of an image segmentation neural network U-NET. It is found that AJIA could achieve a much higher (0.81) detecting precision than SAJIA (0.34), meanwhile giving the possibility of whether each pixel in an input image belongs to a jet. We demonstrate that with the aid of artificial neural networks, AJIA could enable fast, accurate, and real-time coronal jet identification from SDO/AIA 304 \AA observations, which are essential in studying the collective and long-term behavior of coronal jets and their relation with the solar activity cycles.</description>

      <title>The white-light superflares from cool stars in GWAC triggers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: M-type stars are the ones that flare most frequently, but how big their maximum flare energy can reach is still unknown. We present 163 flares from 162 individual M2 through L1-type stars that triggered the GWAC, with flare energies ranging from $10^{32.2}$ to $10^{36.4}$ erg . The flare amplitudes range from $\triangle G = 0.84$ to $\sim 10$ mag. Flare energy increases with stellar surface temperature ($T_{\rm eff}$) but both $\triangle G$ and equivalent duration $\log_{10}(ED)$ seem to be independent of $T_{\rm eff}$. Combining periods detected from light curves of TESS and K2, spectra from LAMOST, SDSS and the 2.16 m Telescope, and the Gaia DR3 data, we found that these GWAC flare stars are young. For the stars that have spectra, we found that these stars are in or very near to the saturation region, and $\log_{10}(L_{\rm H\alpha}/L_{\rm bol})$ is lower for M7-L1 stars than for M2-M6 stars. We also studied the relation between GWAC flare bolometric energy $E_{\rm bol}$ and stellar hemispherical area $S$, and found that $\log_{10}E_{\rm bol}$ (in erg) increases with increasing $S$ (in cm$^2$), and the maximum flare energy $\log_{10}E_{\rm bol, max} \geqslant \log_{10}S + 14.25$. For M7-L1 stars, there seem to be other factors limiting their maximum flare energies in addition to stellar hemispherical area.</description>

      <title>TESS observations of non-Be fast rotators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The variability of fast-rotating Oe/Be stars has been reported in detail in recent years. However, much less known about the behaviour of fast-rotating OB stars without known decretion disks, and hence it is difficult to identify the commonalities and differences in the photometric variability of these two populations, especially with regards to their pulsational properties and their link with the presence of circumstellar material. Via an in-depth literature search, we identified a set of fast-rotating (v sin(i)&gt;200 km/s) early B-type stars not known to have disks. TESS and Kepler light curves were built for 58 stars that appear isolated (no bright neighbour within 1 arcmin and no known companion) to avoid contamination of the light curves. Frequency spectra were calculated and then analysed to determine the noise level and the presence of significant signals above the noise. Red noise is detected in all targets, without obvious correlations between noise and stellar parameters. Long-term changes are much less frequent than in Be stars, with only 12% of our targets having the variability below 0.5/d dominating their frequency spectrum. In contrast, strong frequency groups are detected in about a third of targets, as in Be stars. These groups generally occur in pairs with harmonic frequencies, as is usually seen in Be stars, but with the first group more often displaying larger amplitudes. Finally, the most frequent variability is due to isolated frequencies in the 0.5-6./d range (which is found in two-thirds of cases and dominates the spectra in 42% of the sample). Higher-frequency signals (up to 40/d) are sometimes also detected but rarely (only 12% of stars) appear as the strongest ones of the frequency spectra. Overall, fast-rotating B-type stars, with or without disks, display similar photometric properties, except as regards their longer-term behaviour.</description>

      <title>Photometric and Spectroscopic study of Ten Low Mass Ratio Contact Binary Systems: Orbital Stability, O'Connell Effect and Infra-red Calcium Line Filling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low mass ratio contact binary systems are more likely to have unstable orbits and potentially merge. In addition, such systems exhibit characteristics such as starspots and high energy emissions (UV) suggestive of chromospheric and magnetic activity. Light curve modelling of ten contact binary systems is reported. All were found to be of extreme low mass ratio ranging from 0.122 to 0.24 and three were found to be potentially unstable and possible merger candidates. Filling of the infrared Calcium absorption lines is a marker of increased chromospheric activity. We use the available LAMOST spectra along with matched standard spectra (broadened for rotation) to measure the excess filling of the central core depression flux of the two main infrared Calcium absorption lines at 8542 and 8662 angstroms. We find that all reported contact binaries have excess filling of the core flux in the infrared Calcium lines. Three of the systems reported were also observed by the GALEX mission and we find that all three have features of excess ultraviolet emissions further adding evidence for increased chromospheric activity in low mass ratio contact binaries. Analysis of both orbital stability and absorption line filling is dependent on the determination of geometric and absolute parameters from light curve modelling. Not an insignificant number of contact binary light curves exhibit the O'Connell effect, usually attributed to starspots. We discuss the inclusion of starspots in light curve solutions and how they influence the geometric and absolute parameters</description>

      <title>Magnetograms underestimate even unipolar magnetic flux nearly everywhere on the solar disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We aim to test the reliability of determining the line-of-sight magnetic field from a 3D MHD simulation of a unipolar region. In contrast to earlier similar studies, we consider the full solar disk, i.e. considering the full centre-to-limb variation, as well as regions with different averaged field strengths. We synthesised Stokes profiles from MURaM MHD simulations of unipolar regions with varying mean vertical magnetic flux densities, ranging from quiet Sun to active region plage. We did this for a comprehensive range of heliocentric angles: from $\mu=1$ to $\mu=0.15$, and for two commonly used photospheric spectral lines: Fe I $6173.3$ and Fe I $5250.2${\AA}. The line-of-sight magnetic field was derived with a Milne-Eddington Inversion as well as with other commonly used methods. The inferred spatially averaged $\langle B_{LOS}\rangle$ is always lower than that present in the MHD simulations, with the exception of $\mu\approx 1$ and sufficiently high spatial resolution. It is also generally inconsistent with a linear dependence on $\mu$. Above $\mu=0.5$ the spatial resolution greatly impacts the retrieved line-of-sight magnetic field. For $\mu\leq0.5$ the retrieved $B_{LOS}$ is nearly independent of resolution, but is always lower than expected from the simulation. These trends persist regardless of the mean vertical magnetic field in the MHD simulations and are independent of the $B_{LOS}$ retrieval method. For $\mu\leq0.5$, a larger $\langle B_{LOS}\rangle$ is inferred for the $5250.2${\AA} spectral line than $6173.3${\AA}, but the converse is true at higher $\mu$. The results found here raise some doubts of the reliability of determining the radial field by dividing the line-of-sight field by $\mu$ and are of considerable importance for deducing the total magnetic flux of the Sun. They may also contribute to the resolution of the open flux problem.</description>

      <title>Precise Bolometric Luminosities and Effective Temperatures of 23 late-T and Y dwarfs Obtained with JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present infrared spectral energy distributions of 23 late-type T and Y dwarfs obtained with the James Webb Space Telescope. The spectral energy distributions consist of NIRSpec PRISM and MIRI LRS spectra covering the $\sim$1--12 $\mu$m wavelength range at $\lambda/ \Delta \lambda \approx 100$ and broadband photometry at 15, 18, and 21 $\mu$m. The spectra exhibit absorption features common to these objects including H$_2$O, CH$_4$, CO, CO$_2$, and NH$_3$. Interestingly, while the spectral morphology changes relatively smoothly with spectral type at $\lambda &lt; 3$ $\mu$m and $\lambda &gt; 8$ $\mu$m, it shows no clear trend in the 5 $\mu$m region where a large fraction of the flux emerges. The broad wavelength coverage of the data enables us to compute the first accurate measurements of the bolometric fluxes of cool brown dwarfs. Combining these bolometric fluxes with parallaxes from Spitzer and HST, we also obtain the first accurate bolometric luminosities of these cool dwarfs. We then used the Sonora Bobcat solar metallicity evolutionary models to estimate the radii of the dwarfs which results in effective temperature estimates ranging from $\sim$1000 to 350 K with a median uncertainty of $\pm$20 K which is nearly an order of magnitude improvement over previous work. We also discuss how various portions of the spectra either do or do not exhibit a clear sequence when ordered by their effective temperatures.</description>

      <title>Discovery of a Hypervelocity L Subdwarf at the Star/Brown Dwarf Mass Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the discovery of a high velocity, very low-mass star or brown dwarf whose kinematics suggest it is unbound to the Milky Way. CWISE J124909.08+362116.0 was identified by citizen scientists in the Backyard Worlds: Planet 9 program as a high proper motion ($\mu$ $=$ 0''9/yr) faint red source. Moderate resolution spectroscopy with Keck/NIRES reveals it to be a metal-poor early L subdwarf with a large radial velocity ($-$103$\pm$10 km/s), and its estimated distance of 125$\pm$8 pc yields a speed of 456$\pm$27 km/s in the Galactic rest frame, near the local escape velocity for the Milky Way. We explore several potential scenarios for the origin of this source, including ejection from the Galactic center $\gtrsim$3 Gyr in the past, survival as the mass donor companion to an exploded white dwarf. acceleration through a three-body interaction with a black hole binary in a globular cluster, and accretion from a Milky Way satellite system. CWISE J1249+3621 is the first hypervelocity very low mass star or brown dwarf to be found, and the nearest of all such systems. It may represent a broader population of very high velocity, low-mass objects that have undergone extreme accelerations.</description>

      <title>An infrared census of R Coronae Borealis Stars II -- Spectroscopic classifications and implications for the rate of low-mass white dwarf mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present results from a systematic infrared (IR) census of R Coronae Borealis (RCB) stars in the Milky Way, using data from the Palomar Gattini IR (PGIR) survey. R Coronae Borealis stars are dusty, erratic variable stars presumably formed from the merger of a He-core and a CO-core white dwarf (WD). PGIR is a 30 cm $J$-band telescope with a 25 deg$^{2}$ camera that surveys 18000 deg$^{2}$ of the northern sky ($\delta&gt;-28^{o}$) at a cadence of 2 days. Using PGIR J-band lightcurves for $\sim$60 million stars together with mid-IR colors from WISE, we selected a sample of 530 candidate RCB stars. We obtained near-IR spectra for these candidates and identified 53 RCB stars in our sample. Accounting for our selection criteria, we find that there are a total of $\approx350^{+150}_{-100}$ RCB stars in the Milky Way. Assuming typical RCB lifetimes, this corresponds to an RCB formation rate of 0.8 - 5 $\times$ 10$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$, consistent with observational and theoretical estimates of the He-CO WD merger rate. We searched for quasi-periodic pulsations in the PGIR lightcurves of RCB stars and present pulsation periods for 16 RCB stars. We also examined high-cadenced TESS lightcurves for RCB and the chemically similar, but dustless hydrogen-deficient carbon (dLHdC) stars. We find that dLHdC stars show variations on timescales shorter than RCB stars, suggesting that they may have lower masses than RCB stars. Finally, we identified 3 new spectroscopically confirmed and 12 candidate Galactic DY Per type stars - believed to be colder cousins of RCB stars - doubling the sample of Galactic DY Per type stars.</description>

      <title>The Lowell Observatory Solar Telescope: A fiber feed into the EXtreme PREcision Spectrometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07967v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The signal induced by a temperate, terrestrial planet orbiting a Sun-like star is an order of magnitude smaller than the host stars' intrinsic variability. Understanding stellar activity is, therefore, a fundamental obstacle in confirming the smallest exoplanets. We present the Lowell Observatory Solar Telescope (LOST), a solar feed for the EXtreme PREcision Spectrometer (EXPRES) at the 4.3-m Lowell Discovery Telescope (LDT). EXPRES is one of the newest high-resolution spectrographs that accurately measure extreme radial velocity. With LOST/EXPRES, we observe disk-integrated sunlight autonomously throughout the day. In clear conditions, we achieve a ~137,500 optical spectrum of the Sun with a signal-to-noise of 500 in ~150s. Data is reduced using the standard EXPRES pipeline with minimal modification to ensure the data are comparable to the observations of other stars with the LDT. During the first three years of operation, we find a daily RMS of 71 cm/s. Additionally, having two EPRV spectrometers located in Arizona gives us an unprecedented opportunity to benchmark the performance of these planet-finders. We find a RMS of just 55 cm/s when comparing data taken simultaneously with EXPRES and NEID.</description>

      <title>The minimum neutron star mass in neutrino-driven supernova explosions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Supernova theory has struggled to explain the lightest known neutron star candidate with an accurate mass determination, the $1.174\mathrm{M}_\odot$ companion in the eccentric compact binary system J0453+1559. To improve the theoretical lower limit for neutron star birth masses, we perform 3D supernova simulations for five stellar models close to the minimum mass for iron core collapse. We obtain a record-low neutron star mass of $1.192\mathrm{M}_\odot$ and a substantial kick of $\mathord{\sim} 100\,\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. Given residual uncertainties in stellar evolution, a neutron star origin for the $1.174\mathrm{M}_\odot$ object remains plausible.</description>

      <title>Neutron star calculations with the phenomenological three-nucleon force</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we have studied the effect of three-nucleon interaction on the neutron stars structure. In our calculations, we have considered the neutron star matter as a beta-stable nuclear matter. We have put the results concerning the TBF effect in perspective against two-body results and other calculations of three-nucleon interactions, using the Urbana v14 potential and the parabolic approximation of the nuclear-matter energy for approximating the problem of asymmetric nuclear matter. As such, solving the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation, we have estimated bulk properties of neutron stars and investigated how the present calculations would agree with the expected dynamical-stability condition.</description>

Abstract: We implemented symbolic regression techniques to identify suitable analytical functions that map various properties of neutron stars (NSs), obtained by solving the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations, to a few key parameters of the equation of state (EoS). These symbolic regression models (SRMs) are then employed to perform Bayesian inference with a comprehensive dataset from nuclear physics experiments and astrophysical observations. The posterior distributions of EoS parameters obtained from Bayesian inference using SRMs closely match those obtained directly from the solutions of TOV equations. Our SRM-based approach is approximately 100 times faster, enabling efficient Bayesian analyses across different combinations of data to explore their sensitivity to various EoS parameters within a reasonably short time.</description>

      <title>Do not forget the electrons: Extending moderately-sized nuclear networks for multidimensional hydrodynamic codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03743v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present here an extended nuclear network, with 90 species, designed for being coupled with hydrodynamic simulations, which includes neutrons, protons, electrons, positrons, and the corresponding neutrino and anti-neutrino emission. This network is also coupled with temperature, making it extremely robust and, together with its size, unique of its kind. The inclusion of electron captures on free protons makes the network very appropriate for multidimensional studies of Type Ia supernova explosions, especially when the exploding object is a massive white dwarf.
  The results obtained with the proposed medium-sized network compare fairly well, to a few percent, with those computed with the extended network WinNet (&gt; 2000 isotopes) in scenarios reproducing the gross physical conditions of current Type Ia supernova explosion models. In those cases where the carbon and oxygen fuel ignites at high density, the high-temperature plateau typical of the nuclear statistical equilibrium regime is well defined and stable, allowing large integration time steps. We show that the inclusion of electron captures on free protons substantially improves the estimation of the electron fraction of the mixture. Therefore, the pressure is better determined than in networks where electron captures are excluded, which will ultimately lead to more reliable hydrodynamic models. Explosive combustion of helium at low density, occurring near the surface layer of a white dwarf, is also better described with the proposed network, which gives nuclear energy generation rates much closer to WinNet than typical reduced alpha networks.</description>

      <title>Modeling Time-Variable Elemental Abundances in Coronal Loop Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04473v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Numerous recent X-ray observations of coronal loops in both active regions (ARs) and solar flares have shown clearly that elemental abundances vary with time. Over the course of a flare, they have been found to move from coronal values towards photospheric values near the flare peak, before slowly returning to coronal values during the gradual phase. Coronal loop models typically assume that the elemental abundances are fixed, however. In this work, we introduce a time-variable abundance factor into the 0D ebtel++ code that models the changes due to chromospheric evaporation in order to understand how this affects coronal loop cooling. We find that for strong heating events ($\gtrsim$ 1 erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-3}$), the abundances quickly tend towards photospheric values. For smaller heating rates, the abundances fall somewhere between coronal and photospheric values, causing the loop to cool more quickly than the time-fixed photospheric cases (typical flare simulations) and more slowly than time-fixed coronal cases (typical AR simulations). This suggests heating rates in quiescent AR loops no larger than $\approx 0.1$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-3}$ to be consistent with recent measurements of abundance factors $f \gtrsim 2$.</description>

      <title>X-raying the zeta Tau binary system</title>

Abstract: The Be star zeta Tau was recently reported to be a gamma Cas analog; that is, it displays an atypical (bright and hard) X-ray emission. The origin of these X-rays remains debated.The first X-ray observations indicated a very large absorption of the hot plasma component (N_H~ 10^{23}/cm^2). This is most probably related to the edge-on configuration of the zeta Tau disk. If the X-ray emission arises close to the companion, an orbital modulation of the absorption could be detected as the disk comes in and out of the line of sight. New XMM-Newton data were obtained to characterize the high-energy properties of zeta Tau in more detail. They are complemented by previous Chandra and SRG/eROSITA observations as well as by optical spectroscopy and TESS photometry. The high-quality XMM-Newton data reveal the presence of a faint soft X-ray emission, which appears in line with that recorded for non-gamma Cas Be stars. In addition, zeta Tau exhibits significant short-term variability at all energies, with larger amplitudes at lower frequencies (``red noise''), as is found in X-ray data of other gamma Cas stars. Transient variability (softness dip, low-frequency signal) may also be detected at some epochs. In addition, between X-ray exposures, large variations in the spectra are detected in the 1.5-4.keV energy band. They are due to large changes in absorption toward the hottest (9keV) plasma. These changes are not correlated with either the orbital phase or the depth of the shell absorption of the Halpha line. These observed properties are examined in the light of proposed gamma Cas models.</description>

      <title>Grids of stellar models with rotation VIII: Models from 1.7 to 500 $M_\odot$ at metallicity $Z = 10^{-5}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06739v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Grids of stellar evolution models with rotation using the Geneva stellar evolution code (Genec) have been published for a wide range of metallicities. We introduce the last remaining grid of Genec models, with a metallicity of $Z=10^{-5}$. We study the impact of this extremely metal-poor initial composition on various aspects of stellar evolution, and compare it to the results from previous grids at other metallicities. We provide electronic tables that can be used to interpolate between stellar evolution tracks and for population synthesis. Using the same physics as in the previous papers of this series, we computed a grid of stellar evolution models with Genec spanning masses between 1.7 and 500 $M_\odot$, with and without rotation, at a metallicity of $Z=10^{-5}$. Due to the extremely low metallicity of the models, mass-loss processes are negligible for all except the most massive stars. For most properties (such as evolutionary tracks in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, lifetimes, and final fates), the present models fit neatly between those previously computed at surrounding metallicities. However, specific to this metallicity is the very large production of primary nitrogen in moderately rotating stars, which is linked to the interplay between the hydrogen- and helium-burning regions. The stars in the present grid are interesting candidates as sources of nitrogen-enrichment in the early Universe. Indeed, they may have formed very early on from material previously enriched by the massive short-lived Population III stars, and as such constitute a very important piece in the puzzle that is the history of the Universe.</description>

      <title>Prospects on the Detection of Solar Dark Photons by the International Axion Observatory</title>

Abstract: Dark (hidden) photons are widely recognised as well motivated candidates for physics beyond the standard model, and have been invoked for the solution of several outstanding problems, including to account for the dark matter in the universe. In this paper, we consider a simple model for dark photons, which is coupled to ordinary matter only through kinetic mixing with ordinary photons. Within this framework, we calculate the flux of solar dark photons on Earth and revise the potential to detect it with the next generation of axion helioscopes, particularly with the International AXion Observatory (IAXO). This paper extends on previous theoretical analyses in two main ways. Firstly, it includes a more complete analysis of the possible sources of dark photons from the sun, including the contribution of the solar magnetic field and of nuclear processes, and secondly it includes predictions on the parameter space accessible in the gas-filled phase of IAXO.</description>

Abstract: Most stars form in multiple systems whose properties can significantly impact circumstellar disk evolution. We investigate the physical and chemical properties of the equal-mass, small separation (~66 mas, ~9 au) DF Tau binary system. Previous observations indicated that only DF Tau A has a circumstellar disk. We present JWST-MIRI MRS observations of DF Tau. The MIRI spectrum shows a forest of H2O lines and emission from CO, C2H2, HCN, CO2, and OH. LTE slab models are used to determine the properties of the gas, and we analyze high angular spatial and spectral resolution data from ALMA, VLTI-GRAVITY, and IRTF-iSHELL to aid in the interpretation of the JWST data. The 1.3 mm ALMA continuum data show two equal-brightness sources of compact (R&lt;3 au) emission, with separations and movement consistent with astrometry from VLTI-GRAVITY and the known orbit. This is interpreted as a robust detection of a disk around DF Tau B, which we suggest may host a small (~1 au) cavity to reconcile all observations. The disk around DF Tau A is expected to be a full disk, and spatially and spectrally resolved dust and gas emission points to hot, close-in (&lt;0.2 au) material. Hot (~500-1000 K) H2O, HCN, and C2H2 emission in the MIRI data likely originate in the DF Tau A disk, while a cold (&lt;200 K) H2O component with an extended emitting area is consistent with an origin from both disks. Despite the very compact outer disks, the inner disk composition and conditions are similar to isolated systems, suggesting that the close binary nature is not a driving factor in setting the inner disk chemistry. However, constraining the geometry of the disks, for instance, via higher resolution ALMA observations, would provide additional insight into the mid-infrared gas emission. JWST observations of spatially resolved binaries will be important for understanding the impact of binarity on inner disk chemistry more generally.</description>

      <title>TransformerPayne: enhancing spectral emulation accuracy and data efficiency by capturing long-range correlations</title>

Abstract: Stellar spectra emulators often rely on large grids and tend to reach a plateau in emulation accuracy, leading to significant systematic errors when inferring stellar properties. Our study explores the use of Transformer models to capture long-range information in spectra, comparing their performance to The Payne emulator (a fully connected multilayer perceptron), an expanded version of The Payne, and a convolutional-based emulator. We tested these models on synthetic spectra grids, evaluating their performance by analyzing emulation residuals and assessing the quality of spectral parameter inference. The newly introduced TransformerPayne emulator outperformed all other tested models, achieving a mean absolute error (MAE) of approximately 0.15% when trained on the full grid. The most significant improvements were observed in grids containing between 1000 and 10,000 spectra, with TransformerPayne showing 2 to 5 times better performance than the scaled-up version of The Payne. Additionally, TransformerPayne demonstrated superior fine-tuning capabilities, allowing for pretraining on one spectral model grid before transferring to another. This fine-tuning approach enabled up to a tenfold reduction in training grid size compared to models trained from scratch. Analysis of TransformerPayne's attention maps revealed that they encode interpretable features common across many spectral lines of chosen elements. While scaling up The Payne to a larger network reduced its MAE from 1.2% to 0.3% when trained on the full dataset, TransformerPayne consistently achieved the lowest MAE across all tests. The inductive biases of the TransformerPayne emulator enhance accuracy, data efficiency, and interpretability for spectral emulation compared to existing methods.</description>

      <title>SHARP -- A near-IR multi-mode spectrograph conceived for MORFEO@ELT</title>

Abstract: The Extremely Large Telescopes (ELTs), thanks to their large apertures and cutting-edge Multi-Conjugate Adaptive Optics (MCAO) systems, promise to deliver sharper and deeper data even than the JWST. SHARP is a concept study for a near-IR (0.95-2.45 $\mu$m) spectrograph conceived to fully exploit the collecting area and the angular resolution of the upcoming generation of ELTs. In particular, SHARP is designed for the 2nd port of MORFEO@ELT. Composed of a Multi-Object Spectrograph, NEXUS, and a multi-Integral Field Unit, VESPER, MORFEO-SHARP will deliver high angular ($\sim$30 mas) and spectral (R$\simeq$300, 2000, 6000, 17000) resolution, outperforming NIRSpec@JWST (100 mas). SHARP will enable studies of the nearby Universe and the early Universe in unprecedented detail. NEXUS is fed by a configurable slit system deploying up to 30 slits with $\sim$2.4 arcsec length and adjustable width, over a field of about 1.2"$\times$1.2" (35 mas/pix). Each slit is fed by an inversion prism able to rotate by an arbitrary angle the field that can be seen by the slit. VESPER is composed of 12 probes of 1.7"$\times$1.5" each (spaxel 31 mas) probing a field 24"$\times$70". SHARP is conceived to exploit the ELTs apertures reaching the faintest flux and the sharpest angular resolution by joining the sensitivity of NEXUS and the high spatial sampling of VESPER to MORFEO capabilities. This article provides an overview of the scientific design drivers, their solutions, and the resulting optical design of the instrument achieving the required optical performance.</description>
