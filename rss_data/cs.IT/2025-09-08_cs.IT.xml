      <title>Fundamental bounds on efficiency-confidence trade-off for transductive conformal prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transductive conformal prediction addresses the simultaneous prediction for multiple data points. Given a desired confidence level, the objective is to construct a prediction set that includes the true outcomes with the prescribed confidence. We demonstrate a fundamental trade-off between confidence and efficiency in transductive methods, where efficiency is measured by the size of the prediction sets. Specifically, we derive a strict finite-sample bound showing that any non-trivial confidence level leads to exponential growth in prediction set size for data with inherent uncertainty. The exponent scales linearly with the number of samples and is proportional to the conditional entropy of the data. Additionally, the bound includes a second-order term, dispersion, defined as the variance of the log conditional probability distribution. We show that this bound is achievable in an idealized setting. Finally, we examine a special case of transductive prediction where all test data points share the same label. We show that this scenario reduces to the hypothesis testing problem with empirically observed statistics and provide an asymptotically optimal confidence predictor, along with an analysis of the error exponent.</description>

      <title>Histogram Driven Amplitude Embedding for Qubit Efficient Quantum Image Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work introduces a compact and hardware efficient method for compressing color images using near term quantum devices. The approach segments the image into fixed size blocks called bixels, and computes the total intensity within each block. A global histogram with B bins is then constructed from these block intensities, and the normalized square roots of the bin counts are encoded as amplitudes into an n qubit quantum state. Amplitude embedding is performed using PennyLane and executed on real IBM Quantum hardware. The resulting state is measured to reconstruct the histogram, enabling approximate recovery of block intensities and full image reassembly. The method maintains a constant qubit requirement based solely on the number of histogram bins, independent of the resolution of the image. By adjusting B, users can control the trade off between fidelity and resource usage. Empirical results demonstrate high quality reconstructions using as few as 5 to 7 qubits, significantly outperforming conventional pixel level encodings in terms of qubit efficiency and validating the practical application of the method for current NISQ era quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Rotatable Antenna Aided Mixed Near-Field and Far-Field Communications in the Upper Mid-Band: Interference Analysis and Joint Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04865v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose to leverage rotatable antennas (RAs) for improving the communication performance in mixed near-field and far-field communication systems by exploiting a new spatial degree-of-freedom (DoF) offered by antenna rotation to mitigate complex near-field interference and mixed-field interference. Specifically, we investigate a modular RA-enabled mixed-field downlink communication system, where a base station (BS) consisting of multiple RA subarrays communicates with multiple near-field users in the presence of several legacy far-field users. We formulate an optimization problem to maximize the sum-rate of the near-field users by jointly optimizing the power allocation and rotation angles of all subarrays at the BS. To gain useful insights into the effect of RAs on mixed-field communications, we first analyze a special case where all subarrays share the same rotation angle and obtain closed-form expressions for the rotation-aware normalized near-field interference and the rotation-aware normalized mixed-field interference using the Fresnel integrals. We then analytically reveal that array rotation effectively suppresses both interference types, thereby significantly enhancing mixed-field communication performance. For the general case involving subarray-wise rotation, we propose an efficient double-layer algorithm to obtain a high-quality solution, where the inner layer optimizes power allocation using the successive convex approximation (SCA) technique, while the outer layer determines the rotation angles of all subarrays via particle swarm optimization (PSO). Finally, numerical results highlight the significant performance gains achieved by RAs over conventional fixed-antenna systems and demonstrate the effectiveness of our developed joint design compared to benchmark schemes.</description>

      <title>An information metric for comparing and assessing informative interim decisions in sequential clinical trials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Group sequential designs enable interim analyses and potential early stopping for efficacy or futility. While these adaptations improve trial efficiency and ethical considerations, they also introduce bias into the adapted analyses. We demonstrate how failing to account for informative interim decisions in the analysis can substantially affect posterior estimates of the treatment effect, often resulting in overly optimistic credible intervals aligned with the stopping decision. Drawing on information theory, we use the Kullback-Leibler divergence to quantify this distortion and highlight its use for post-hoc evaluation of informative interim decisions, with a focus on end-of-study inference. Unlike pointwise comparisons, this measure provides an integrated summary of this distortion on the whole parameter space. By comparing alternative decision boundaries and prior specifications, we illustrate how this measure can improve the understanding of trial results and inform the planning of future adaptive studies. We also introduce an expected version of this metric to support clinicians in choosing decision boundaries. This guidance complements traditional strategies based on type-I error rate control by offering insights into the distortion introduced to the treatment effect at each interim phase. The use of this pre-experimental measure is finally illustrated in a group sequential trial for evaluating a treatment for central nervous system disorders.</description>

      <title>Subgroup perfect codes of $S_n$ in Cayley sum graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05069v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A perfect code in a graph $\Gamma = (V, E)$ is a subset $C$ of $V$ such that no two vertices in $C$ are adjacent, and every vertex in $V \setminus C$ is adjacent to exactly one vertex in $C$. Let $ G $ be a finite group, and let $ S $ be a square-free normal subset of $ G $. The Cayley sum graph of $ G $ with respect to $ S $ is a simple graph with vertex set $ G $ and two vertices $ x $ and $ y $ are adjacent if $ xy\in S .$ A subset $ C $ of $ G $ is called perfect code of $ G $ if there exists a Cayley sum graph of $ G $ that admits $ C $ as a perfect code. In particular, if a subgroup of $ G $ is a perfect code of $ G $, then the subgroup is called a subgroup perfect code of $ G $. In this work, we prove that there does not exist any proper perfect subgroup code of symmetric group $ S_n $. Using this result, we provide a complete characterization of the perfect subgroup code of the alternating group $A_n$.</description>

      <title>List Decoding Expander-Based Codes via Fast Approximation of Expanding CSPs: I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05203v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present near-linear time list decoding algorithms (in the block-length $n$) for expander-based code constructions. More precisely, we show that
  (i) For every $\delta \in (0,1)$ and $\epsilon &gt; 0$, there is an explicit family of good Tanner LDPC codes of (design) distance $\delta$ that is $(\delta - \epsilon, O_\varepsilon(1))$ list decodable in time $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}_{\varepsilon}(n)$ with alphabet size $O_\delta(1)$,
  (ii) For every $R \in (0,1)$ and $\epsilon &gt; 0$, there is an explicit family of AEL codes of rate $R$, distance $1-R -\varepsilon$ that is $(1-R-\epsilon, O_\varepsilon(1))$ list decodable in time $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}_{\varepsilon}(n)$ with alphabet size $\text{exp}(\text{poly}(1/\epsilon))$, and
  (iii) For every $R \in (0,1)$ and $\epsilon &gt; 0$, there is an explicit family of AEL codes of rate $R$, distance $1-R-\varepsilon$ that is $(1-R-\epsilon, O(1/\epsilon))$ list decodable in time $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}_{\varepsilon}(n)$ with alphabet size $\text{exp}(\text{exp}(\text{poly}(1/\epsilon)))$ using recent near-optimal list size bounds from [JMST25].
  Our results are obtained by phrasing the decoding task as an agreement CSP [RWZ20,DHKNT19] on expander graphs and using the fast approximation algorithm for $q$-ary expanding CSPs from [Jer23], which is based on weak regularity decomposition [JST21,FK96]. Similarly to list decoding $q$-ary Ta-Shma's codes in [Jer23], we show that it suffices to enumerate over assignments that are constant in each part (of the constantly many) of the decomposition in order to recover all codewords in the list.</description>

      <title>Repetition and recurrence times: Dual statements and summable mixing rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.14703v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By an analogy to the duality between the recurrence time and the longest match length, we introduce a quantity dual to the maximal repetition length, which we call the repetition time. Extending prior results, we sandwich the repetition time in terms of unconditional and conditional min-entropies. The upper bound holds if the mixing rate $\phi(n)$ is summable, whereas the lower bound only assumes stationarity. Our reasoning makes a repeated use of dualities between so-called times and so-called counts that generalize the duality of the recurrence time and the longest match length. We also discuss the analogy of these results with the Wyner-Ziv/Ornstein-Weiss theorem, which sandwiches the recurrence time in terms of Shannon entropies.</description>

      <title>A New Metric Function for SC-based Polar Decoders: Polarization, Pruning, and Fast Decoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03840v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a method to obtain the optimal metric function at each depth of the polarization tree through a process we call polarization of the metric function. This polarization process generates an optimal metric at intermediate levels of the polarization tree, which can be applied in fast successive-cancellation-based (FSC) and SC list-based (FSCL) decoders -- decoders that partially explore the binary tree representation. We prove that at each step of the polarization tree, the expected value of the metric function random variable is the mutual information of the corresponding channel, while its variance equals the varentropy of the channel -- two parameters that are particularly relevant in finite block-length regimes. Additionally, we show that after polarization, the variances of the bit metrics approach zero for binary-input discrete memoryless channels (BI-DMCs). Moreover, we provide an estimate for calculating the variance of the binary-input additive white Gaussian noise (BI-AWGN) channel. We introduce a list-pruning strategy for FSCL decoding that retains only the paths whose metric values are close to the average. As a result, our method significantly reduces the number of required sorting operations in FSCL-based decoding algorithms. We also derive an upper bound, as a function of the polarized channel varentropy, on the probability that the distance between a bit-metric random variable and the bit-channel mutual information exceeds a given threshold. Leveraging this result, we further propose a varentropy-based list-pruning strategy for the SCL (VPSCL) decoding algorithm that adapts to the varentropy of the corresponding bit-channel. Our proposed pruning strategy also benefits stack decoding (VPStack) by discarding partial paths and avoiding unnecessary extensions.</description>

      <title>The Distributed Multi-User Point Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10251v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of information-theoretic distributed multi-user point function, involving a trusted master node, $N \in \mathbb{N}$ server nodes, and $K\in \mathbb{N}$ users, where each user has access to the contents of a subset of the storages of server nodes. Each user is associated with an independent point function $f_{X_k,Z_k}: \{1,2,\hdots,T\} \rightarrow{GF(q^{m R_k})},T,mR_k \in \mathbb{N}$. Using these point functions, the trusted master node encodes and places functional shares $G_1,G_2,\hdots,G_N \in GF(q^{M}), M \in \mathbb{N}$ in the storage nodes such that each user can correctly recover its point function result from the response transmitted to itself and gains no information about the point functions of any other user, even with knowledge of all responses transmitted from its connected servers. For the first time, we propose a multi-user scheme that satisfies the correctness and information-theoretic privacy constraints, ensuring recovery for all point functions. We also characterize the inner and outer bounds on the capacity -- the maximum achievable rate defined as the size of the range of each point function $mR_k$ relative to the storage size of the servers $M$ -- of the distributed multi-user point function scheme by presenting a novel converse argument.</description>

      <title>Expansion of higher-dimensional cubical complexes with application to quantum locally testable codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07476v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a high-dimensional cubical complex, for any dimension t&gt;0, and apply it to the design of quantum locally testable codes. Our complex is a natural generalization of the constructions by Panteleev and Kalachev and by Dinur et. al of a square complex (case t=2), which have been applied to the design of classical locally testable codes (LTC) and quantum low-density parity check codes (qLDPC) respectively.
  We turn the geometric (cubical) complex into a chain complex by relying on constant-sized local codes $h_1,\ldots,h_t$ as gadgets. A recent result of Panteleev and Kalachev on existence of tuples of codes that are product expanding enables us to prove lower bounds on the cycle and co-cycle expansion of our chain complex.
  For t=4 our construction gives a new family of "almost-good" quantum LTCs -- with constant relative rate, inverse-polylogarithmic relative distance and soundness, and constant-size parity checks. Both the distance of the quantum code and its local testability are proven directly from the cycle and co-cycle expansion of our chain complex.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18655v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum low-density parity-check codes are a promising candidate for fault-tolerant quantum computing with considerably reduced overhead compared to the surface code. However, the lack of a practical decoding algorithm remains a barrier to their implementation. In this work, we introduce localized statistics decoding, a reliability-guided inversion decoder that is highly parallelizable and applicable to arbitrary quantum low-density parity-check codes. Our approach employs a parallel matrix factorization strategy, which we call on-the-fly elimination, to identify, validate, and solve local decoding regions on the decoding graph. Through numerical simulations, we show that localized statistics decoding matches the performance of state-of-the-art decoders while reducing the runtime complexity for operation in the sub-threshold regime. Importantly, our decoder is more amenable to implementation on specialized hardware, positioning it as a promising candidate for decoding real-time syndromes from experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02670v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The last decade has seen a number of advances in computationally efficient algorithms for statistical methods subject to robustness constraints. An estimator may be robust in a number of different ways: to contamination of the dataset, to heavy-tailed data, or in the sense that it preserves privacy of the dataset. We survey recent results in these areas with a focus on the problem of mean estimation, drawing technical and conceptual connections between the various forms of robustness, showing that the same underlying algorithmic ideas lead to computationally efficient estimators in all these settings.</description>

      <title>Behavior Synthesis via Contact-Aware Fisher Information Maximization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.12214v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Contact dynamics hold immense amounts of information that can improve a robot's ability to characterize and learn about objects in their environment through interactions. However, collecting information-rich contact data is challenging due to its inherent sparsity and non-smooth nature, requiring an active approach to maximize the utility of contacts for learning. In this work, we investigate an optimal experimental design approach to synthesize robot behaviors that produce contact-rich data for learning. Our approach derives a contact-aware Fisher information measure that characterizes information-rich contact behaviors that improve parameter learning. We observe emergent robot behaviors that are able to excite contact interactions that efficiently learns object parameters across a range of parameter learning examples. Last, we demonstrate the utility of contact-awareness for learning parameters through contact-seeking behaviors on several robotic experiments.</description>
