      <title>BERT and LLMs-Based avGFP Brightness Prediction and Mutation Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study aims to utilize Transformer models and large language models (such as GPT and Claude) to predict the brightness of Aequorea victoria green fluorescent protein (avGFP) and design mutants with higher brightness. Considering the time and cost associated with traditional experimental screening methods, this study employs machine learning techniques to enhance research efficiency. We first read and preprocess a proprietary dataset containing approximately 140,000 protein sequences, including about 30,000 avGFP sequences. Subsequently, we constructed and trained a Transformer-based prediction model to screen and design new avGFP mutants that are expected to exhibit higher brightness.
  Our methodology consists of two primary stages: first, the construction of a scoring model using BERT, and second, the screening and generation of mutants using mutation site statistics and large language models. Through the analysis of predictive results, we designed and screened 10 new high-brightness avGFP sequences. This study not only demonstrates the potential of deep learning in protein design but also provides new perspectives and methodologies for future research by integrating prior knowledge from large language models.</description>

      <title>Statistical thermodynamics of self-organization of the binding energy super-landscape in the adaptive immune system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.04665v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The humoral adaptive immune system, from the physical perspective, can be regarded as a self-organized antibody binding energy landscape. In biological terms it means the system organizes its repertoire of antigen binding molecules so as to maintain its integrity. In this article I reason that the super-landscape created by the fusion of binding energy landscapes can be described by the distribution of interaction energies and a deformation parameter of thermodynamic potentials in the system. This deformation parameter characterizes the adaptive network of interactions in the system and the asymmetry of generalized logistic distributions in immunoassays. Overall, statistical thermodynamics approaches could provide a deeper theoretical insight into the dynamical self-organization of the adaptive immune system and into the interpretation of experimental results.</description>

      <title>Modelling vitamin D food fortification among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples in Australia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20116v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Background: Low vitamin D intake and high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency (serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration &lt; 50 nmol/L) among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples highlight a need for public health strategies to improve vitamin D status. As few foods contain naturally occurring vitamin D, fortification strategies may be needed to improve vitamin D intake and status among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. Objective: We aimed to model vitamin D food fortification scenarios among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. Methods: We used nationally representative food consumption data (n=4,109) and vitamin D food composition data to model four food fortification scenarios. The modelling for Scenario 1 included foods and maximum vitamin D concentrations permitted for fortification in Australia: i) dairy products and alternatives, ii) butter/margarine/oil spreads, iii) formulated beverages, and iv) selected ready-to-eat breakfast cereals. The modelling for Scenarios 2a-c included some vitamin D concentrations higher than permitted in Australia; Scenario 2c included bread, which is not permitted for vitamin D fortification in Australia. Scenario 2a: i) dairy products and alternatives, ii) butter/margarine/oil spreads, iii) formulated beverages. Scenario 2b: as per Scenario 2a plus selected ready-to-eat breakfast cereals. Scenario 2c: as per Scenario 2b plus bread. Results: Vitamin D fortification of a range of staple foods could potentially increase vitamin D intake among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples by ~ 3-6 {\mu}g/day. Scenario 2c showed the highest potential median vitamin D intake increase to ~ 8 {\mu}g/day. Across all modelled scenarios, none of the participants had vitamin D intake above the Australian upper level of intake of 80 {\mu}g/day.</description>
