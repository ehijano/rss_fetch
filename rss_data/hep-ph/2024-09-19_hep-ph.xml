      <title>The $e^+ e^- \rightarrow Z H$ Process in the SMEFT Beyond Leading Order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We systematically study potential effects of Beyond the Standard Model physics in the $e^+ e^- \rightarrow Z H$ process. To this end, we include all relevant dimension-6 Standard Model Effective Field Theory operators and work to next-to-leading order (NLO) accuracy in the electroweak coupling. We consider both polarized and unpolarized electron and positron beams and present results for $\sqrt{s}=240, ~365$ and $500~{\rm GeV}$, emphasizing contributions where the NLO predictions differ significantly from the leading order results. At NLO, a sensitivity arises to operators that do not contribute at tree level, such as the Higgs trilinear coupling, CP-violating operators, and dimension-6 operators involving the top quark, among many others. We compare the prospects of future $e^+e^-$ colliders to explore these new physics effects with existing measurements from the LHC, electron EDMs (for CP violating operators), and Z pole measurements.</description>

      <title>Pion Boer-Mulders function using a contact interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A symmetry preserving treatment of a vector $\otimes$ vector contact interaction (SCI) is used as the basis for calculations of the two pion transverse momentum dependent parton distribution functions (TMDs); namely, that for unpolarised valence degrees-of-freedom and the analogous Boer-Mulders (BM) function. Amongst other things, the analysis enables the following themes to be addressed: the quark current mass dependence of pion TMDs; the impact of the gauge link model on the positivity constraint that bounds the BM function relative to the unpolarised TMD; the equivalence of direct diagrammatic and light-front wave function TMD calculations; and the size of the BM shift. Interpreted astutely, these SCI results enable one to draw insightful pictures of pion TMDs.</description>

      <title>Sea-quark dynamics in decuplet ($\frac{3}{2}^+$) $\rightarrow$ octet ($\frac{1}{2}^+$) transition quadrupole moment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigated the electromagnetic quadrupole transition of baryon decuplet ($J^P= \frac{3}{2}^+$) to octet ($J^P= \frac{1}{2}^+$) using the statistical framework together with the principle of detailed balance. The statistical approach assumed the expansion of hadrons in terms of various quark-gluon Fock states. By specifying the appropriate multiplicity in spin, color $\&amp;$ flavor space, the relative probabilities of strange and non-strange quark-gluon Fock state are calculated. These probabilities further accumulated in the form of statistical parameters, highlighting the importance of sea quarks and gluons in the electromagnetic transition. Our calculations includes the individual contribution of valence and sea (scalar, vector and tensor ) to the transition moment of baryons. The effect of flavor SU(3) symmetry and its breaking in both valence and sea quarks is studied by incorporating the strange quark mass. The strangeness in the sea is constrained by a suppression factor $(1-C_l)^{n-1}$, which depends upon the free energy of gluons. The computed results get affected upto 60 $\%$ and exhibit the dominance of octet sea. The present work has been compared with updated experimental data and various theoretical predictions. The results obtained may offer important insights for future experimental studies.</description>

      <title>On Precision of the Leptonic Mixing Angle $\theta_{23}$ and its Implications for the Flavor Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Among three leptonic mixing angles, $\theta_{23}$ angle, which characterizes the fractional contribution of two flavor eigenstates $\nu_{\mu}$ and $\nu_{\tau}$ to the third mass eigenstate $\nu_3$, is known to be the largest but the least precisely measured. The work investigates possible reach of $\theta_{23}$ precision with two upcoming gigantic accelerator-based long-baseline neutrino experiments, namely Hyper-Kamiokande and DUNE experiments as well as a possible joint analyses of future neutrino facilities. Our simulation yields that each experiment will definitely establish the octant of $\theta_{23}$ angle for all values within 1$\sigma$ parameter interval, while considering the current limitation. However, if the actual value is $0.48\leq \sin^2\theta_{23}\leq 0.54$, it becomes challenging for these two experiments to reject the maximal ($\theta_{23}=\pi/4$) hypothesis and conclude its octant. This octant-blind region can be further explored with the proposed facilities ESSnuSB and a neutrino factory. Accurate determination of the mixing angle $\theta_{23}$, as well as the accuracy of $\delta_{CP}$, is crucial for examining a certain category of discrete non-Abelian leptonic flavor models. Specifically if CP is conserved in leptonic sector, the combined analysis of Hyper-K and DUNE will rule out the majority of these models. However, if the CP is maximally violated, higher precision of $\delta_{CP}$ is necessary for testing these flavor models.</description>

      <title>Spin resolved momentum spectra for vacuum pair production via a generalized two level model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have formulated a generalized two level model for studying the pair production in multidimensional time-dependent electric fields. It can provide momentum spectra with fully spin resolved components for all possible combined spin states of the particle and anti-particle simultaneously. Moreover, we have also investigated the validity of the two level model for fermions (scalar particles) by comparing the results with those by equal-time Dirac-Heisenberg-Wigner (Feshbach-Villars-Heisenberg-Wigner) formalism in different regimes of pair creation, i.e., multiphoton and tunneling dominated mechanisms. It is found that the results are consistent with each other, indicating the good approximation of the two level model. In particular, in terms of the two level model, we found that the contribution of the particle momentum spectra is the greatest when the spin states of the particle and anti-particle are parallel with $S=1$. It is believed that by this two level model one can extend researches on pair production for more different background fields, such as a slowly varying spatial-temporal one. Many other interesting phenomena may also be revealed, including the spin-resolved vortex structure that is contained in the phase feature of the distribution function of the created pairs.</description>

      <title>Effective masses and magnetic moments of charmed baryons in asymmetric hot strange hadronic matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present work, we have studied the masses and magnetic moments of spin$-{\frac{1}{2}}^+$ and spin$-{\frac{3}{2}}^+$ singly and doubly charmed baryons in the strange hadronic medium at finite temperature using the chiral SU(3) quark mean field model. The properties of baryons within the framework of chiral SU(3) mean field model are defined in terms of constituent quark masses and energies, which are modified through the exchange of scalar fields $\sigma$, $\zeta$ and $\delta$ and the vector fields $\omega$, $\rho$ and $\phi$. The scalar-isovector field, $\delta$ and the vector-isovector field, $\rho$ contribute when medium has finite isospin asymmetry. We have calculated the effective masses of constituent quarks and charmed baryons in the nuclear and strange matter within the chiral SU(3) quark mean field model and have used these as the input in SU(4) constituent chiral quark model to compute the effective magnetic moments of these baryons. Considering the configuration mixing, the contributions of valence quarks, quark sea and orbital angular momentum of quark sea have been considered explicitly to calculate the in-medium magnetic moments.</description>

      <title>Fully charmed tetraquark production at the LHC experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop the formalism for production of a fully heavy tetraquark and apply it to the calculation of $pp\to T_{4c}+X$ cross-sections. We demonstrate that the production cross-section of a fully heavy tetraquark, even if it is a diquark-antidiquark cluster, can be obtained in the meson-like basis, for which the spin-color projection technique is well established. Prompted by the recent LHCb, ATLAS and CMS data, we perform a pQCD calculation of ${\cal O}(\alpha_s^5)$ short-distance factors in the dominant channel of gluon fusion, and match these to the four-body $T_{4c}$ wave functions in order to obtain the unpolarized $T_{4c}(0^{++},1^{+-},2^{++})$ cross-sections. The novelty in comparison with the recently published article~\cite{Feng:2023agq} lies in the fact that we predict the absolute values as well as the $d\sigma/dp_T$ spectra in the kinematic ranges accessible at the ongoing LHC experiments. From the comparison with the signal yield at LHCb we derive the constraints on the $\Phi\cdot\text{Br}(J/\psi\,J/\psi)$ (reduced wave function times branching) product for the $T_{4c}$ candidates for $X(6900)$ and observe that $X(6900)$ is compatible with a $2^{++}(2S)$ state.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Secrets of New Physics Through Top Quark Tagging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ubiquity of top-rich final states in the context of beyond the Standard Model (BSM) searches has led to their status as extensively studied signatures at the LHC. Over the past decade, numerous endeavours have been undertaken in the literature to develop methods for efficiently distinguishing boosted top quark jets from QCD jets. Although cut-based strategies for boosted top tagging, which rely on substructure information from fat jets resulting from the hadronic decay of boosted top quarks, were introduced in the literature as early as 2008, recent years have witnessed a surge in the utilization of machine learning-based approaches for the classification of top-jets from QCD jets. The review focuses on the present status of boosted top tagging and its application for BSM searchers.</description>

      <title>Far-from-equilibrium attractors with Full Relativistic Boltzmann approach in 3+1 D: moments of distribution function and anisotropic flows $v_n$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ the Full Relativistic Boltzmann Transport approach for a conformal system in 3+1D to study the universal behaviour in moments of the distribution function and anisotropic flows. We investigate different transverse system sizes $R$ and interaction strength $\eta/s$ and identify universality classes based upon the interplay between $R$ and the mean free path; we show that each of this classes can be identified by a particular value of the opacity $\hat \gamma$, which has been previously introduced in literature. Our results highlight that, at early times, the inverse Reynolds number and momentum moments of the distribution function display universal behaviour, converging to a 1D attractor driven by longitudinal expansion. This indicates that systems of different sizes and interaction strengths tend to approach equilibrium in a similar manner. We provide a detailed analysis of how the onset of transverse flow affects these moments at later times. Moreover, we investigate the system size and $\eta/s$ dependence for the harmonic flows $v_2$, $v_3$, $v_4$ and their response functions, along with the impact of the $\eta/s$ and the system transverse size on the dissipation of initial azimuthal correlations in momentum space. Finally, we introduce the normalised elliptic flow $v_2/v_{2,eq}$, showing the emergence of attractor behaviour in the regime of large opacity. These results offer new insights into how different systems evolve towards equilibrium and the role that system size and interaction play in this process.</description>

      <title>Leading-colour-based unweighted event generation for multi-parton tree-level processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we revisit unweighted event generation for multi-parton tree-level processes in massless QCD. We introduce a two-step approach, in which initially unweighted events are generated at leading-colour (LC) accuracy, followed by a reweighting of these events to full-colour (FC) accuracy and applying an additional unweighting cycle. This method leverages the simple structure of LC integrands, enabling optimized phase-space parameterisations and resulting in high primary unweighting efficiencies, ranging from the percent level for $2 \to 4$ processes to the per-mille level for $2 \to 7$ processes. Given that the LC-accurate matrix elements closely approximate the FC-accurate ones, the secondary unweighting efficiencies exceed 50%. Our results suggest that this two-step approach offers an efficient alternative to direct event generation at FC accuracy.</description>

      <title>Probing the cosmic sterile-neutrino background with IceCube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we take a close look at the interaction between the TeV--PeV energy astrophysical neutrinos and a hypothetical cosmic sterile-neutrino background. These interactions yield absorption features, also called ``dips", in the astrophysical neutrino spectrum, which are studied using the deposited energy distribution of high-energy starting events (HESE) in the IceCube detector. We improve upon the previous analysis by including the effects of regeneration and a realistic source distribution on the propagation of astrophysical neutrinos. We use the latest 7.5-year HESE dataset and include the observation of Glashow resonance in our analysis. We evaluate the impact of these dips on the inferred spectral index and overall normalization of the astrophysical neutrinos. We find a mild preference for dips in the 300--800 TeV range, and the best-fit parameters for the mass of sterile-neutrino and the mediator are 0.5 eV and 23 MeV, respectively. We find that the inclusion of these absorption features lowers the spectral index of astrophysical neutrinos to $2.60^{+0.19}_{-0.16}$. The lower spectral index can reduce the disagreement with the Northern Tracks sample but requires dedicated analysis. We also forecast the event spectrum for IceCube-Gen2 for the two different fits.</description>

      <title>Hunting Primordial Black Hole Dark Matter in Lyman-$\alpha$ Forest</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10617v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A very pressing question in contemporary physics is the identity of Dark Matter (DM), and one that has not been answered affirmatively to any degree so far. Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) are one of the most well-motivated DM candidates. Light enough PBHs have been constrained by either the non-detection of their Hawking radiation itself, or by the non-observation of any measurable effects of this radiation on astrophysical and cosmological observables. We constrain the PBH density by their Hawking radiation effect on the intergalactic medium (IGM) temperature evolution. We use the latest deductions of IGM temperature from Lyman-$\alpha$ forest observations. We put constraints on the fraction of PBH DM with masses $5 \times 10^{15}$ g - $10^{17}$ g separately for spinning and non-spinning BHs. We derive constraints by dealing with the heating effects of the astrophysical reionization of the IGM in two ways. In one way, we completely neglect this heating due to astrophysical sources, thus giving us weaker constraints, but completely robust to the reionization history of the universe. In the second way, we utilise some modelling of the ionization and temperature history, and use it to derive more stringent constraints. We find that for non-spinning PBHs of mass $10^{16}$ g, the current measurements can constrain the PBH-density to be $\lesssim$ 0.1% of the total DM. We find that these constraints from the latest Lyman-$\alpha$ forest temperature measurements are competitive, and hence provide a new observable to probe the nature of PBH DM. The systematics affecting Lyman-$\alpha$ forest measurements are different from other constraining observations, and thus this is a complementary probe.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The existence of bound doubly heavy tetraquark states was confirmed by the recent LHCb discovery of the doubly charmed $T_{cc}$, less than 1 MeV below the meson pair threshold. Others states with two heavy (bottom or charm) quarks could also be bound, perhaps more deeply. Here we discuss our previous work, and the improvements in our current, updated analysis of various heavy-heavy-light-light tetraquark candidates, including the light and heavy quark mass dependence of the binding.</description>

      <title>Quark saturation in the QCD phase diagram</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We determine the onset of Quarkyonic Matter corresponding to values of temperature and baryon chemical potential at which the quark phase space density becomes one. At zero temperature for baryon chemical potentials below the mass of the Lambda baryon, only nucleons contribute to the quark density. This is different at finite temperature, where all baryons, mesons and their resonances can be excited and thus add quarks to the phase space. The probability density to find a quark inside a hadron is determined using the Yukawa ansatz of the IdylliQ model of Quarkyonic Matter. We estimate separately the magnitude of the various contributions of nucleons, Delta baryons, pions as well as further hadrons and resonances. The uncertainty in the parametrization of the probability density to find a quark inside a nucleon is spanned by assuming that at zero temperature the transition density to Quarkyonic Matter is between one and three times that of nuclear matter. Various predictions for a possible critical point associated with the chiral phase transition are found close to a triple point at which the line of the deconfinement transition and the curve associated with the transition to Quarkyonic Matter intersect. These considerations provide an estimate for the region in the QCD phase diagram where Quarkyonic Matter may be found.</description>

      <title>From formation to evaporation: Induced gravitational wave probes of the primordial black hole reheating scenario</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12125v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the Primordial Black Hole (PBH) reheating scenario, where PBHs originate in a general cosmological background. In this scenario, ultralight PBHs with masses $M\lesssim 10^8$g temporarily dominate the Universe and reheat it via Hawking radiation before Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN). We investigate whether the induced Gravitational Wave (GW) spectrum associated with PBH reheating contains information about the pre-PBH-dominated stage, namely the initial equation of state $w$ (after inflation). We first derive the transfer functions of curvature fluctuations for general $w$ with adiabatic and isocurvature initial conditions. We find that, in general, a stiffer equation of state enhances the induced GW amplitude as it allows for a longer PBH dominated phase compared to the radiation dominated case. We also find that the spectral slope of GWs induced by primordial curvature fluctuations is sensitive to $w$, while the spectral slope of GWs induced by PBH number density fluctuations is not. Lastly, we derive constraints of the initial PBH abundance as a function of $w$, using BBN and Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) observations. A stiffer equation of state leads to stricter constraints on the initial energy density fraction, as induced GWs are enhanced. Interestingly, we find that such induced GW signals may enter the observational window of several future GW detectors, such as LISA and the Einstein Telescope. Our formulas, especially the curvature fluctuation transfer functions, are applicable to any early matter-dominated universe scenario.</description>

      <title>Flavor Violating Di- Higgs Coupling</title>

Abstract: Di-Higgs couplings to fermions of the form $h^{2}\overline{f}f$ are absent in the Standard Model, however, they are present in several physics Beyond Standard Model (BSM) extensions, including those with vector-like fermions. In Effective Field Theories (EFTs), such as the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) and the Higgs Effective Field Theory (HEFT), these couplings appear at dimension 6 and can in general, be flavour-violating (FV). In the present work, we employ a bottom-up approach to investigate the FV in the lepton and quarks sectors through the di-Higgs effective couplings. We assume that all FV arises from this type of couplings and assume that the Yukawa couplings $Y_{ij}$ are given by their SM values, i.e. $Y_{ij} = \sqrt{2}m_{i}\delta_{ij}/v$. In the lepton sector, we set upper limits on the Wilson coefficients $C_{ll'}$ from $l \rightarrow 3l'$ decays, $l \rightarrow l\gamma$ decays, muonium oscillations, the $(g-2)_{\mu}$ anomaly, LEP searches, muon conversion in nuclei, FV Higgs decays, and $Z$ decays. We also make projections on some of these coefficients from Belle II, the Mu2e experiment and the LHC's High Luminosity (HL) run. In the quark sector, we set upper limits on the Wilson coefficients $C_{qq'}$ from meson oscillations and from $B$-physics searches. A key takeaway from this study is that current and future experiments should set out to measure the effective di-Higgs couplings $C_{ff'}$, whether these couplings are FV or flavour-conserving. We also present a matching between our formalism and the SMEFT operators and show the bounds in both bases.</description>

Abstract: Photoproduction is an important mode for the production of jets and electro-weak particles at lepton--lepton and lepton--hadron colliders and allows for interesting studies of exclusive production at hadron--hadron colliders. In this talk, I will review recent efforts of extending the Sherpa event generator to include the calculation of photoproduction cross sections for electron and proton beams, including the simulation of underlying events. The framework is validated using data of jet production at the HERA and LEP experiments and lepton production at the LHC. I will discuss advances towards achieving matched NLO accuracy and fully capturing the dynamics of inclusive and exclusive photoproduction at different colliders.</description>

      <title>Electric Dipole Moments as Probes of $B$ Anomaly</title>

Abstract: The measurements of the lepton flavor universality (LFU) in $\mathcal{B}({\bar{B}} \to D^{(\ast)} l \bar{\nu})$ indicate a significant deviation from the standard model prediction at a 3-4$\sigma$ level, revealing a violation of the LFU ($R_{D^{(\ast)}}$ anomaly). It is known that the $R_{D^{(\ast)}}$ anomaly can be easily accommodated by an $SU(2)_L$-singlet vector leptoquark (LQ) coupled primarily to third-generation fermions, whose existence is further motivated by a partial gauge unification. In general, such a LQ naturally leads to additional $CP$-violating phases in the LQ interactions. In this paper, we point out that the current $R_{D^{(\ast)}}$ anomaly prefers the $CP$-violating interaction although $\mathcal{B}({\bar{B}} \to D^{(\ast)} l\bar{\nu})$ are $CP$-conserving observables. The $CP$-violating LQ predicts a substantial size of the bottom-quark electric dipole moment (EDM), the chromo-EDM, and also the tau-lepton EDM. Eventually at low energy, the nucleon and electron EDMs are radiatively induced. Therefore, we conclude that the $R_{D^{(\ast)}}$ anomaly with the $SU(2)_L$-singlet vector LQ provides unique predictions: neutron and proton EDMs with opposite signs and a magnitude of $\mathcal{O}(10^{-27})\,e$cm, and suppressed electron EDM. Furthermore, we show that a similar EDM pattern is predicted in an $SU(2)_L$-doublet scalar LQ scenario that can accommodate the $R_{D^{(\ast)}}$ anomaly as well. These EDM signals could serve as crucial indicators in future experiments.</description>

Abstract: The duration of the neutrino burst from the supernova event SN 1987A is known to be sensitive to exotic sources of cooling, such as axions radiated from the dense and hot hadronic matter thought to constitute the inner core of the supernova. We perform the first quantitative study of the role of hadronic matter beyond the first generation -- in particular strange matter. We do so by consistently including the full baryon and meson octets, and computing axion emissivity induced from baryon-meson to baryon-axion scatterings as well as from baryon decays. We consider a range of supernova thermodynamic conditions, as well as equation-of-state models with different strangeness content. We obtain the first bound on the axial axion-strange-strange coupling, as well as the strongest existing bound on the axion-down-strange counterpart. Our bound on the latter coupling can be as small as $O(10^{-2})$ for $f_a = 10^9$ GeV.</description>

Abstract: Ultralight dark matter (ULDM) particles of mass $m_\phi \lesssim 1~{\rm eV}$ can form boson stars in DM halos. Collapse of boson stars leads to explosive bosenova emission of copious relativistic ULDM particles. In this work, we analyze sensitivity of terrestrial and space-based experiments to detect such relativistic scalar ULDM particles interacting through quadratic couplings with Standard Model constituents, including electrons, photons and gluons. We highlight key differences with searches for linear ULDM couplings. Screening of ULDM with quadratic couplings near the surface of the Earth can significantly impact observations in terrestrial experiments, motivating future space-based experiments. We demonstrate excellent ULDM discovery prospects, especially for quantum sensors, which can probe quadratic couplings orders below existing constraints by detecting bosenova events in the ULDM mass range $10^{-23}\,{\rm eV} \lesssim m_\phi \lesssim 10^{-5}\,{\rm eV}$. We also report updated constraints on quadratic couplings of ULDM in case it comprises cold DM.</description>

Abstract: Naive intuition about scale decoupling breaks down in the presence of fermion masses. Kinematic enhancements can greatly extend the range where one needs to keep a finite mass in calculations to obtain a correct result at even the O(1) level. Treating a light fermion as massive though, leads to a known but somewhat obscure paradox, a seeming leading-order sensitivity to an arbitrarily small mass. We show how a proper formulation in effective field theory not only resolves the physical conundrum, but answers the very practical question of when fermion masses are required. This has important implications for the development of shower Monte Carlo above the weak scale.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03963v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A dark matter model based on QCD-like $SU(N_c)$ gauge theory with electroweakly interacting dark quarks is discussed. Assuming the dark quark mass $m$ is smaller than the dynamical scale $\Lambda_d \sim 4\pi f_d$, the main component of the dark matter is the lightest $G$-parity odd dark pion associated with chiral symmetry breaking in the dark sector. We show that nonzero dark quark mass induces the universal mass contribution to both $G$-parity odd and even pions, and their masses tend to be degenerate. As a result, dark pion annihilation into heavier $G$-parity even dark pion also affects the dark matter relic abundance. Thus, our setup naturally accommodates forbidden dark matter scenario and realizes heavy dark matter whose mass is ${\cal O}(1$-$100)~{\rm TeV}$, which is different from conventional electroweakly interacting dark matter such as minimal dark matter. We also discuss CP-violation from $\theta$-term in the dark gauge sector and find that the predicted size of electron electric dipole moment can be as large as $\sim 10^{-32}~e~{\rm cm}$.</description>

Abstract: We present novel findings concerning the parameter space of axion stars, extended object forming in dense dark matter environments through gravitational condensation. We emphasize their formation within the dense minihalos that potentially surround primordial black holes and in axion miniclusters. Our study investigates the relation between the radius and mass of an axion star in these dense surroundings, revealing distinct morphological characteristics compared to isolated scenarios. We explore the implications of these results when applied to the bound state between a primordial black hole and an axion star and the gravitational microlensing from extended objects, leading to insights on the observational constraints from such ``halo'' axion stars. We provide a constraint on the fraction of the galactic population of axion stars from their contribution to the microlensing events from the EROS-2 survey, using the numerical resolution of the Schr\"odinger-Poisson equation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09226v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the Belle measurements of the process $\Lambda_c^+\to \eta\pi^+\Lambda$, we investigate this process by considering the contributions from the $\Lambda(1670)$, $a_0(980)$, and $\Sigma(1385)$. In addition, we also consider the predicted low-lying baryon $\Sigma^*(1/2^-)$. Our results involving the $\Sigma^*(1/2^-)$ are favored by fitting to the Belle data of the $\eta\Lambda$ and $\pi^+\Lambda$ invariant mass distributions. Furthermore, we predict the $\eta\pi^+$ invariant mass distribution and the angular distribution $d\Gamma/d{\rm cos}\theta$, which are significantly different depending on whether or not the contribution from the $\Sigma^*(1/2^-)$ is considered. Finally, we show that, with the contribution from the $\Sigma^*(1/2^-)$, the calculated Dalizt plot agrees with the Belle measurements. Future precise measurements of the process $\Lambda_c^+\to \eta\pi^+\Lambda$ could shed further light on the existence of the low-lying $\Sigma^*(1/2^-)$.</description>

Abstract: We provide comprehensive calculations of total muon fluxes, energy and angular spectra, and mean muon energies in deep underground laboratories - under flat overburdens and mountains and underwater - using our latest calculation code, MUTE v3. For precise modeling, we compiled rock densities and chemical compositions for various underground labs, as well as topographic map profiles of overburdens, and integrated them into our calculations. Our results show excellent agreement with available data for most underground sites when using the latest surface muon flux model, daemonflux. Moreover, since our calculations do not rely on underground measurements of muons or other secondaries, we can verify the consistency of measurements across different detectors at different sites. MUTE is an open-source, publicly available program, providing a solid framework for accurate muon flux predictions in various underground environments, essential for applications in cosmic ray physics and dark matter searches.</description>

Abstract: Direct measurement of the elastic scattering of real photons on an electromagnetic field would allow the fundamental low-energy constants of quantum electrodynamics (QED) to be experimentally determined. We show that scenarios involving the collision of three laser beams have several advantages over conventional two-beam scenarios. The kinematics of a three-beam collision allows for a higher signal-to-noise ratio in the detection region, without the need for polarimetry and separates out contributions from different orders of photon scattering. A planar configuration of colliding a photon beam from an x-ray free electron laser with two optical beams is studied in detail. We show that measurements of elastic photon scattering and vacuum birefringence are possible with currently available technology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10345v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate how a dark sector can provide a crucial link between a vacuum-dominated early universe and the later radiation-dominated epoch. As an example, we consider a feeble axion-like coupling of dark non-Abelian gauge fields with a single inflaton. In this scenario, a dark heat bath emerges at the end of inflation. As the dark sector cools down, its gauge fields confine into composite glueball states. The reheating of the visible sector is realized through portal interactions. After confinement, discrete symmetries protect part of the glueball states that form relic dark matter, while the others keep decaying into Standard Model degrees of freedom. The dark relic abundance depends mostly on the departure from equilibrium dynamics after the phase transition, constraining the confinement scale of the dark sector. Moreover, indirect detection and Big-Bang nucleosynthesis set bounds on the scale of portal interactions. We show that in a narrow but non-vanishing region of the parameter space, the correct dark matter abundance and sufficient reheating temperature are simultaneously reached.</description>

      <title>Neutrinoless Double Beta Decay from Scalar Leptoquarks: Interplay with Neutrino Mass and Flavor Physics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04670v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform a comprehensive analysis of neutrinoless double beta decay and its interplay with low-energy flavor observables in a radiative neutrino mass model with scalar leptoquarks $S_1(\bar{3},1,1/3)$ and $\widetilde{R}_2(3,2,1/6)$. We carve out the parameter region consistent with constraints from neutrino mass and mixing, collider searches, as well as measurements of several flavor observables, such as muon and electron anomalous magnetic moments, charged lepton flavor violation and rare (semi)leptonic kaon and $B$-meson decays, including the recent anomalies in $R_{D^{(*)}}$ and $B\to K\nu\bar{\nu}$ observables. We perform a global analysis to all existing constraints and show the (anti)correlations between all relevant Yukawa couplings satisfying these restrictions. We find that the most stringent constraint on the parameter space comes from $\mu \to e$ conversion in nuclei and $K^{+} \rightarrow\, \pi^{+}\nu \bar{\nu}$ decay. We also point out a tension between the muon and electron $(g-2)$ anomalies in this context. Taking benchmark points from the combined allowed regions, we study the implications for neutrinoless double beta decay including both the canonical light neutrino and the leptoquark contributions. We find that for normal ordering of neutrino masses, the leptoquark contribution removes the cancellation region that occurs for the canonical case. The effective mass in presence of leptoquarks can lie in the desert region between the standard normal and inverted ordering cases, and this can be probed in future ton-scale experiments like LEGEND-1000 and nEXO.</description>

      <title>The Proton Charge Radius from Dimuon Photoproduction off the Proton</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20375v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the feasibility of measuring the proton charge radius through dimuon photoproduction off a proton target. Our findings indicate that the Bethe-Heitler mechanism, which dominates at small momentum transfers, allows for an extraction of the proton electromagnetic form factors in the extremely low $Q^2$ region below $10^{-3}$ GeV$^2$ in the spacelike region, when the incident photon beam energy exceeds several hundred MeV. The optimal kinematical region and a sensitivity study of the proton charge radius from dimuon photoproduction are presented. Such a measurement is expected to provide an alternative to the elastic muon-proton scattering measurements such as MUSE at PSI and AMBER at CERN.</description>

      <title>Constraints on non-unitary neutrino mixing in light of atmospheric and reactor neutrino data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20388v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While the origin of neutrino masses remains unknown, several key neutrino mass generation models result in a non-unitary three-neutrino mixing matrix. To put such models to test, the deviations of the mixing matrix from unitarity can be measured directly through neutrino oscillation experiments. In this study, we perform a Bayesian analysis of the non-unitary mixing model using the recent public data from atmospheric and reactor neutrino experiments - namely IceCube-DeepCore, Daya Bay, and KamLAND. The novelty of our approach compared to the preceding global fits for non-unitarity is in the detailed treatment of the atmospheric neutrino data, which for the first time includes the relevant flux and detector systematic uncertainties. From the Bayesian posteriors on the individual mixing matrix elements, we derive the non-unitarity constraints in the form of normalisations and closures of the mixing matrix rows and columns. We find comparable constraints for electron and tau row normalisations as other similar studies in literature, and additionally reveal strong correlations between muon and tau row constraints induced by the atmospheric systematic uncertainties. We find that the current data is well described by both unitary and non-unitary mixing models, with a strong preference for the unitary mixing indicated by the Bayes factor. With the upcoming IceCube-Upgrade and JUNO detectors, both featuring superior energy resolution compared to the current atmospheric and reactor neutrino experiments, our constraints on the row normalisations are expected to improve by a factor of 2 (2.5) in the tau (muon) sector and by nearly 25% in the electron sector. In the future, our approach can be expanded to include solar and long-baseline neutrino experiments, with the aim to provide more stringent constraints while keeping track of the nuisance parameters that may be degenerate with non-unitarity.</description>

      <title>Transport coefficients of the heavy quark in the domain of the non-perturbative and non-eikonal gluon radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09824v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Drag and diffusion coefficients of the Heavy Quarks (HQs), such as charm and bottom, are one of the prime tools for discerning the properties of the deconfined QCD medium created in the Heavy Ion Collisions experiments. The innate non-perturbative nature of the QCD medium renders it imperative to estimate the transport coefficients in that domain. The present work evaluates the drag and diffusion coefficients of the moving HQ interacting with the medium particles via two-body collisional and three-body radiative processes to the first order in opacity by employing Gribov mechanism for the non-perturbative regime. We proffer the latest results of the HQ transport coefficients computed for the non-perturbative and non-eikonal gluon radiation off the HQ. The calculations show significant increment of the transport coefficients with the increasing non-eikonality by juxtaposing the results with those of the pertubative and eikonal regions. We hope to shed fresh light towards explaining the experimental data on the nuclear modification facor, $R_{AA}$, the elliptic flow, $v_2$ of the HQ by advocating the importance of the non-eikonality of the gluon radiation off the HQ.</description>

      <title>Neutrino Model in Left-Right Symmetric Linear Seesaw Augmented with $A_4$ Modular Group</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10195v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we have implemented $A_4$ modular symmetry in the left-right symmetric linear seesaw model. Interestingly, such modular symmetry restricts the proliferation of flavon fields, and as a result, the predictibility of the model is enhanced. The fermion sector of the model comprises of quarks, leptons and a sterile fermion in each generation, while the scalar sector consists of Higgs doublets and bidoublets. We investigate numerically various Yukawa coupling co-efficients, the neutrino masses and mixing parameters in our intended model and predictions become consistent with $3\sigma$ range of current neutrino oscillation data. We also studied the non-unitarity, effects on lepton flavor violation in our model and evolution of lepton asymmetry to explain the current baryon asymmetry of the universe.</description>

      <title>Interparticle-Fields Amplified Radiation Reaction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.17832v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The trajectories of relativistic particles in an intense electromagnetic field can be described by the Landau-Lifshitz (LL) equation, where radiation reaction (RR) is accounted for via a self-force, and interparticle fields are often neglected as an approximation. Yet, the inclusion of interparticle fields is necessary to ensure energy-momentum conservation, in particular during coherent emission. We present a simple generalization of the LL equation for many bodies, which includes coherence effects in the self-force. This theory is shown both analytically and numerically to satisfy energy-momentum conservation as expected. By simulating a neutral, relativistic bunch of electrons and positrons ($e^-/e^+$) colliding with a laser pulse, we show that the inclusion of interparticle fields can significantly affect the particle dynamics and the emission spectrum, even though the external field dominates over the interparticle fields.</description>

      <title>Weyl conformal geometry vs Weyl anomaly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.11372v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Weyl conformal geometry is a gauge theory of scale invariance that naturally brings together the Standard Model (SM) and Einstein gravity. The SM embedding in this geometry is possible without new degrees of freedom beyond SM and Weyl geometry, while Einstein gravity is generated by the broken phase of this symmetry. This follows a Stueckelberg breaking mechanism in which the Weyl gauge boson becomes massive and decouples, as discussed in the past (arXiv:1812.08613, 1904.06596, 2104.15118). However, Weyl anomaly could break explicitly this gauge symmetry, hence we study it in Weyl geometry. We first note that in Weyl geometry {\it metricity} can be restored with respect to a new differential operator ($\hat \nabla$) that also enforces a Weyl-covariant formulation. This leads to a metric-like Weyl gauge invariant formalism that enables one to do quantum calculations directly in Weyl geometry, rather than use a Riemannian (metric) geometry picture. The result is the Weyl-covariance in $d$ dimensions of all geometric operators ($\hat R$, etc) {\it and} of their derivatives ($\hat\nabla_\mu\hat R$, etc), including the Euler-Gauss-Bonnet term. A natural, Weyl-invariant dimensional regularisation of quantum corrections exists and Weyl gauge symmetry is then maintained and manifest at the quantum level, in $d$ dimensions. This is related to a non-trivial current of this symmetry, the divergence of which cancels the trace of the energy-momentum tensor. The "usual" Weyl anomaly and Riemannian geometry are recovered in the (spontaneously) broken phase. The relation to holographic Weyl anomaly is discussed.</description>

      <title>Loop Quantum Gravity effects on electromagnetic properties of charged leptons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17197v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The efforts in this contribution consist in reassessing a modified Dirac equation that incorporates a $\gamma^0 \gamma_5$-Lorentz-symmetry violating (LSV) term induced as a Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG) effect. Originally, this equation has been applied and considered as a good scenario for describing a number of investigations on the flight time of cosmic neutrinos, which suggests that the speed, in vacuum, in connection with the geometry that describes a granular space-time, takes the energy-dependent form, e.g., $v(E) =1 \pm E/E_{\textrm{LSV}}$, with $E_{\textrm{LSV}} \approx 6,5 \times 10^{17}$ GeV for neutrinos. Once LQG provides a viable way to understand this picture consistently, we pursue an analysis of this effective Dirac equation to inspect some of its properties. These include: the derivation of the modified fermionic propagator, attainment of the Gordon decomposition of the vector current with minimal electromagnetic coupling to obtain information on the form factors, examination of the non-relativistic limit of the equation, evaluation of the spin- and velocity-dependent corrections to the Coulomb potential due to LQG effects, and the modified Hamiltonian in the low-relativistic regime. The study of the form factors may open up paths to set up bounds on the LQG parameters from the precision measurements of electromagnetic attributes of the charged leptons, such as their respective electric and magnetic dipole moments.</description>

      <title>$\bar b \bar b u d$ and $\bar b \bar b u s$ tetraquarks from lattice QCD using symmetric correlation matrices with both local and scattering interpolating operators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03588v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the $\bar b \bar b u d$ tetraquark with quantum numbers $I(J^P) = 0(1^+)$ as well as the $\bar b \bar b u s$ tetraquark with quantum numbers $J^P = 1^+$ using lattice QCD. We improve on existing work by including both local and scattering interpolating operators on both sides of the correlation functions and use symmetric correlation matrices. This allows not only a reliable determination of the energies of QCD-stable tetraquark ground states, but also of low-lying excited states, which are meson-meson scattering states. The latter is particularly important for future finite-volume scattering analyses. Here, we perform chiral and continuum extrapolations of just the ground-state energies, for which finite-volume effects are expected to be small. Our resulting tetraquark binding energies, $-100 \pm 10\:^{+36}_{-51}\:\:{\rm MeV}$ for $\bar b \bar b u d$ and $-30 \pm 3\:^{+11}_{-31}\:\:{\rm MeV}$ for $\bar b \bar b u s$, are consistent with other recent lattice-QCD predictions.</description>

      <title>$1/N$ Corrections in $\text{QCD}_2$: Small Mass Limit and Threshold States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04031v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate $1/N$ corrections to mesonic spectrum in $1+1$-dimensional Quantum Chromodynamics ($\text{QCD}_2$) with fundamental quarks using effective Hamiltonian method. We express the corrections in terms of 't Hooft equation solutions. First, we consider 2-flavor model with a heavy and a light quark. We show that, in contrast to some claims in earlier literature, the $1/N$ correction to the mass of the heavy-light meson remains finite when the light quark mass is taken to zero. Nevertheless, the corrections become significantly larger in this limit; we attribute this to the presence of massless modes in the spectrum. We also study the corrections to the lightest meson mass in 1-flavor model and show that they are consistent with recent numerical data, but not with the prediction coming from bosonization. Then we study low energy effective theory for 2 flavors. We show that the 3-meson interaction vertex correctly reproduces Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) coupling when both quarks become massless. This coupling does not change even if one of the quarks is massive. We employ Discretized Light Cone Quatization (DLCQ) to check the continuum results and show that the improved version can be used for small quark mass. Finally, we study the states associated with $1\to 2$ meson thresholds. Using degenerate perturbation theory, we show that when the decay is allowed by parity, the infinite $N$ theory has near-threshold bound states that mix one- and two-meson parts. They are $1/3$ two-meson and $2/3$ one-meson and the corrections to their masses have unusual scaling $\sim 1/N^{2/3}$.</description>

      <title>Revisiting evolution of domain walls and their gravitational radiation with CosmoLattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17053v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Employing the publicly available CosmoLattice code, we conduct numerical simulations of a domain wall network and the resulting gravitational waves (GWs) in a radiation-dominated Universe in the $Z_2$-symmetric scalar field model. In particular, the domain wall evolution is investigated in detail both before and after reaching the scaling regime, using the combination of numerical and theoretical methods. We demonstrate that the total area of closed walls is negligible compared to that of a single long wall stretching throughout the simulation box. Therefore, the closed walls are unlikely to have a significant impact on the overall network evolution. This is in contrast with the case of cosmic strings, where formation of loops is crucial for maintaining the system in the scaling regime. To obtain the GW spectrum, we develop a technique that separates physical effects from numerical artefacts arising due to finite box size and non-zero lattice spacing. Our results on the GW spectrum agree well with Refs. [29, 30], which use different codes. Notably, we observe a peak at the Hubble scale, an exponential falloff at scales shorter than the wall width, and a plateau/bump at intermediate scales. We also study sensitivity of obtained results on the choice of initial conditions. We find that different types of initial conditions lead to qualitatively similar domain wall evolution in the scaling regime, but with important variations translating into different intensities of GWs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10176v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transport coefficients play an important role in characterising hot and dense nuclear matter, such as that created in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions (URHIC). In the present work we calculate the electric conductivity of hot and dense hadronic matter by extracting it from the electromagnetic spectral function, through its zero energy limit at vanishing 3-momentum. We utilise the vector dominance model (VDM), in which the photon couples to hadronic currents predominantly through the $\rho$ meson. Therefore, we use hadronic many-body theory to calculate the $\rho$-meson's self-energy in hot and dense hadronic matter, by dressing its pion cloud with $\pi$-$\rho$, $\pi$-$\sigma$, $\pi$-$K$, N-hole, and $\Delta$-hole loops. We then introduce vertex corrections to maintain gauge invariance. Finally, we analyze the low-energy transport peak as a function of temperature and baryon chemical potential, and extract the conductivity along a proposed phase transition line.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03150v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Providing a compelling derivation of Kolmogorov turbulence is a fascinating open challenge in field theory. Here, we pose a more modest question: if we had a field-theoretic description of Kolmogorov turbulence, could we use it to describe deviations caused, for example, by adding a polymer additive or by relativistic corrections? To investigate this issue, we assume a description of developed, homogeneous, and isotropic turbulence along the lines of Martin, Siggia, and Rose, and we work out the first corrections to the equal-time, two-point spectrum caused by adding non-Newtonian terms to the fluid stress tensor. While the results are not conclusive, they show a promising resemblance to turbulent spectra found in both experiments and large-scale numerical simulations.</description>

Abstract: We discuss how to extract numerically the expected lowest quasi-normal mode (QNM) associated with the pressure anisotropy for a Bjorken flux evolution to equilibrium. This QNM was easily decoded subtracting the hydrodynamical attractors and was compared with other authors calculations. After evolutions with transients close to the expected lowest QNM the system goes to a tail (pure imaginary frequency) for late times. We analyze the relevance of Navier-Stokes, second order and Borel attractors at each stage of the evolution, which begins far-from-equilibrium and ends close to equilibrium.</description>

Abstract: True muonium ($\mu^+\mu^-$) is one of the heaviest and smallest electromagnetic bound states not containing hadrons, and has never been observed so far. In this work it is shown that the spin-1 TM state (ortho-TM) can be observed at a discovery level of significance in three months at the CERN SPS North-Area H4A beam line, using 43.7 GeV secondary positrons. In this way, by impinging the positrons on multiple thin low-Z targets, ortho-TM, which decays predominantly to $e^+e^-$, can be produced from $e^+e^- \to TM$ interactions on resonance ($\sqrt{s} \sim 2m_{\mu}$).</description>
