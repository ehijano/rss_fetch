      <title>Certified simultaneous isotopic approximation of curves via subdivision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16911v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a certified algorithm based on subdivision for computing an isotopic approximation to any number of curves in the plane. Our algorithm is based on the certified curve approximation algorithm of Plantinga and Vegter. The main challenge in this algorithm is to correctly and efficiently identify and isolate all intersections between the curves. To overcome this challenge, we introduce a new and simple test that guarantees the global correctness of our output. A main step in our algorithm for approximating any number of curves is to correctly approximate a pair of curves. In addition to developing the details of this special case, we provide complexity analyses for both the number of steps and the bit-complexity of this algorithm using both worst-case bounds as well as those based on continuous amortization.</description>

      <title>Simple Grid Polygon Online Exploration Revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to some significantly contradicting research results, we reconsider the problem of the online exploration of a simple grid cell environment. In this model an agent attains local information about the direct four-neigbourship of a current grid cell and can also successively build a map of all detected cells. Beginning from a starting cell at the boundary of the environment, the agent has to visit any cell of the grid environment and finally has to return to its starting position. The performance of an online strategy is given by competitive analysis. We compare the number of overall cell visits (number of steps) of an online strategy to the number of such visits in the optimal offline solution under full information of the environment in advance. The corresponding worst-case ratio gives the competitive ratio. The aforementioned contradiction among two publications turns out to be as follows: There is a journal publication that claims to present an optimal competitive strategy with ratio 7/6 and a former conference paper that presents a lower bound of 20/17. In this note we extract the flaw in the upper bound and also present a new slightly improved and (as we think) simplified general lower bound of 13/11.</description>

      <title>Mathematical programming algorithms for convex hull approximation with a hyperplane budget</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the following problem in computational geometry: given, in the d-dimensional real space, a set of points marked as positive and a set of points marked as negative, such that the convex hull of the positive set does not intersect the negative set, find K hyperplanes that separate, if possible, all the positive points from the negative ones. That is, we search for a convex polyhedron with at most K faces, containing all the positive points and no negative point. The problem is known in the literature for pure convex polyhedral approximation; our interest stems from its possible applications in constraint learning, where points are feasible or infeasible solutions of a Mixed Integer Program, and the K hyperplanes are linear constraints to be found. We cast the problem as an optimization one, minimizing the number of negative points inside the convex polyhedron, whenever exact separation cannot be achieved. We introduce models inspired by support vector machines and we design two mathematical programming formulations with binary variables. We exploit Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition to obtain extended formulations, and we devise column generation algorithms with ad-hoc pricing routines. We compare computing time and separation error values obtained by all our approaches on synthetic datasets, with number of points from hundreds up to a few thousands, showing our approaches to perform better than existing ones from the literature. Furthermore, we observe that key computational differences arise, depending on whether the budget K is sufficient to completely separate the positive points from the negative ones or not. On 8-dimensional instances (and over), existing convex hull algorithms become computational inapplicable, while our algorithms allow to identify good convex hull approximations in minutes of computation.</description>

      <title>Towards Practical Finite Sample Bounds for Motion Planning in TAMP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17394v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When using sampling-based motion planners, such as PRMs, in configuration spaces, it is difficult to determine how many samples are required for the PRM to find a solution consistently. This is relevant in Task and Motion Planning (TAMP), where many motion planning problems must be solved in sequence. We attempt to solve this problem by proving an upper bound on the number of samples that are sufficient, with high probability, to find a solution by drawing on prior work in deterministic sampling and sample complexity theory. We also introduce a numerical algorithm to compute a tighter number of samples based on the proof of the sample complexity theorem we apply to derive our bound. Our experiments show that our numerical bounding algorithm is tight within two orders of magnitude on planar planning problems and becomes looser as the problem's dimensionality increases. When deployed as a heuristic to schedule samples in a TAMP planner, we also observe planning time improvements in planar problems. While our experiments show much work remains to tighten our bounds, the ideas presented in this paper are a step towards a practical sample bound.</description>

      <title>Unit-length Rectangular Drawings of Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.14142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.14142v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A rectangular drawing of a planar graph $G$ is a planar drawing of $G$ in which vertices are mapped to grid points, edges are mapped to horizontal and vertical straight-line segments, and faces are drawn as rectangles. Sometimes this latter constraint is relaxed for the outer face. In this paper, we study rectangular drawings in which the edges have unit length. We show a complexity dichotomy for the problem of deciding the existence of a unit-length rectangular drawing, depending on whether the outer face must also be drawn as a rectangle or not. Specifically, we prove that the problem is NP-complete for biconnected graphs when the drawing of the outer face is not required to be a rectangle, even if the sought drawing must respect a given planar embedding, whereas it is polynomial-time solvable, both in the fixed and the variable embedding settings, if the outer face is required to be drawn as a rectangle.</description>

      <title>Efficiently Reconfiguring a Connected Swarm of Labeled Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.11028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.11028v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When considering motion planning for a swarm of $n$ labeled robots, we need to rearrange a given start configuration into a desired target configuration via a sequence of parallel, collision-free robot motions. The objective is to reach the new configuration in a minimum amount of time; an important constraint is to keep the swarm connected at all times. Problems of this type have been considered before, with recent notable results achieving constant stretch for not necessarily connected reconfiguration: If mapping the start configuration to the target configuration requires a maximum Manhattan distance of $d$, the total duration of an overall schedule can be bounded to $\mathcal{O}(d)$, which is optimal up to constant factors. However, constant stretch could only be achieved if disconnected reconfiguration is allowed, or for scaled configurations (which arise by increasing all dimensions of a given object by the same multiplicative factor) of unlabeled robots.
  We resolve these major open problems by (1) establishing a lower bound of $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$ for connected, labeled reconfiguration and, most importantly, by (2) proving that for scaled arrangements, constant stretch for connected reconfiguration can be achieved. In addition, we show that (3) it is NP-complete to decide whether a makespan of 2 can be achieved, while it is possible to check in polynomial time whether a makespan of 1 can be achieved.</description>

      <title>Maximum Centre-Disjoint Mergeable Disks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.04350v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a set of disks in the plane, the goal of the problem studied in this paper is to choose a subset of these disks such that none of its members contains the centre of any other. Each disk not in this subset must be merged with one of its nearby disks that is, increasing the latter's radius. This problem has applications in labelling rotating maps and in visualizing the distribution of entities in static maps. We prove that this problem is NP-hard. We also present an ILP formulation for this problem, and a polynomial-time algorithm for the special case in which the centres of all disks are on a line.</description>

      <title>Euler Characteristic Tools For Topological Data Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.14040v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we study Euler characteristic techniques in topological data analysis. Pointwise computing the Euler characteristic of a family of simplicial complexes built from data gives rise to the so-called Euler characteristic profile. We show that this simple descriptor achieve state-of-the-art performance in supervised tasks at a very low computational cost. Inspired by signal analysis, we compute hybrid transforms of Euler characteristic profiles. These integral transforms mix Euler characteristic techniques with Lebesgue integration to provide highly efficient compressors of topological signals. As a consequence, they show remarkable performances in unsupervised settings. On the qualitative side, we provide numerous heuristics on the topological and geometric information captured by Euler profiles and their hybrid transforms. Finally, we prove stability results for these descriptors as well as asymptotic guarantees in random settings.</description>
