      <title>Quantum Hall effect in a chiral cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11757v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the influence of quantum fluctuations in a chiral cavity on the quantum Hall (QH) state, extending previous studies of QH liquids in linearly polarized cavities. Using the Schrieffer-Wolff transformation for perturbative cavity-matter interaction, we identify the system's normal modes, which correspond to the elementary excitations of the dressed electrons and photons. In contrast to the linear case, we find that the chiral cavity modifies the Kohn mode frequency by a contribution proportional to the cyclotron frequency, which can be interpreted as a renormalization of the magnetic field by cavity fluctuations. We show that the AC conductivities display cavity-induced corrections, including an isotropic quantum reactance effect and a rotating total-current response under applied AC fields. These findings are also derived from a hydrodynamic approach, which extends their validity to fractional quantum Hall states. Finally, we examine the role of finite cavity quality factor and find that while photon losses introduce resistive contributions to the impedance, these vanish in the DC limit. Our results provide insights into the interplay between quantum Hall states and chiral cavities, with significant implications for material engineering and cavity-induced topological effects.</description>

      <title>Creating high-dimensional topological physics using a single ring resonator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In spaces of three or more dimensions, there exists topological physics of significant richness that has no lower-dimensional counterparts. To experimentally explore high-dimensional physics, it is advantageous to augment the physical space with synthetic dimensions. An emerging approach is to use a single modulated photonic ring resonator to form multiple synthetic frequency dimensions. However, all the high-dimensional Hamiltonians experimentally demonstrated in this approach are topologically trivial. Here we propose a general scheme to create high-dimensional topological physics using multiple synthetic frequency dimensions in a single ring resonator. This scheme utilizes specifically designed mode-selective modulations and mode conversions to create non-trivial topology. As examples, we numerically demonstrate a three-dimensional, two-band model exhibiting Weyl points and topological insulator phases, and a five-dimensional, four-band model exhibiting Yang monopoles and Weyl surfaces. Our results will facilitate the experimental studies and future applications of topological physics in high dimensions.</description>

      <title>Frustration-free free fermions and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Frustration-free Hamiltonians provide pivotal models for understanding quantum many-body systems. In this paper, we establish a general framework for frustration-free fermionic systems. First, we derive a necessary and sufficient condition for a free fermion model to be frustration-free. In the case of translation-invariant, noninteracting systems, we show that any band touching between the valence and conduction bands is at least quadratic. Furthermore, by extending the Gosset-Huang inequality to fermionic systems, we demonstrate that even in interacting and non-translation-invariant cases, the finite-size gap of gapless excitations scales as $O((\log L)^2/L^2)$, provided the ground-state correlation function exhibits a power-law decay. Our results provide a foundation for studying frustration-free fermionic systems, including flat-band ferromagnetism and $\eta$-pairing states.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Extraction of Coupling Strength for Polaron Hopping from $ab~initio$ Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12983v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurately determining the coupling strength between polaron states is essential to describe charge-hopping transport in materials. In this work, we revisit methodologies to extract coupling strengths using ab initio approaches. Our findings underscore the critical role of incorporating anharmonic effects in the model Hamiltonian when analyzing total energy variations along reaction coordinates. Furthermore, we demonstrate that coupling strength extraction based on total energy calculated from ab initio approaches is fundamentally limited due to the stabilization of diabatic states, which do not involve coupling strength. We demonstrate that such limitation exists in both DFT+U and HSE hybrid functionals, which are widely used in the study of polaron transport. Instead, we suggest extracting coupling strength directly from the electronic structure of a system in neutral conditions. The neutral condition avoids overestimating coupling strength due to additional energy splitting between bonding and anti-bonding states from the charging energy. This study highlights the limitations of existing methods and introduces a robust framework for accurately extracting coupling parameters, paving the way for improved modeling of charge transport in complex materials.</description>
