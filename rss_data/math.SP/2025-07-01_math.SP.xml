      <title>Discrete Spectrum of the Bilayer Graphene Operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the graphene operator $D_m$ perturbed by a decaying potential $\alpha V$, where $\alpha$ is a coupling constant. We study the number $N(\lambda,\alpha)$ of eigenvalues of the operator $D(t)=D_m-tV$ passing through a regular point $\lambda\in\rho(D_m)$ as $t$ changes from $0$ to $\alpha$. We obtain asymptotic formulas for $N(\lambda,\alpha)$ as $\alpha\to\infty$.</description>

      <title>Inertia indices of signed graphs with given cyclomatic number and given number of pendant vertices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\Gamma=(G, \sigma)$ be a signed graph of order $n$ with underlying graph $G$ and a sign function $\sigma: E(G)\rightarrow \{+, -\}$. Denoted by $i_+(\Gamma)$, $\theta(\Gamma)$ and $p(\Gamma)$ the positive inertia index, the cyclomatic number and the number of pendant vertices of $\Gamma$, respectively. In this article, we prove that $i_+(\Gamma)$, $\theta(\Gamma)$ and $p(\Gamma)$ are related by the inequality $i_+(\Gamma)\geq \frac{n-p(\Gamma)}{2}-\theta(\Gamma)$. Furthermore, we completely characterize the signed graph $\Gamma$ for which $i_+(\Gamma)=\frac{n-p(\Gamma)}{2}-\theta(\Gamma)$. As a by-product, the inequalities $i_-(\Gamma)\geq \frac{n-p(\Gamma)}{2}-\theta(\Gamma)$ and $\eta(\Gamma)\leq p(\Gamma)+2\theta(\Gamma)$ are also obtained, respectively.</description>

      <title>Spectral properties of Schr\"odinger operator with translations and Neumann boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a nonlocal differential--difference Schr\"odinger operator on a segment with the Neumann conditions and two translations in the free term. The values of the translations are denoted by $\alpha$ and $\beta$ and are treated as parameters. The spectrum of this operator consists of countably many discrete eigenvalues, which are taken in the ascending order of their absolute values and are indexed by the natural parameter $n.$ Our main result is the representation of the eigenvalues as convergent series in negative powers of $n$ with the coefficients depending on $n,$ $\alpha,$ and $\beta.$ We show that these series converge absolutely and uniformly in $n,$ $\alpha,$ and $\beta$ and they can be also treated as spectral asymptotics for the considered operator with uniform in $\alpha$ and $\beta$ estimates for the error terms. As an example, we find the four--term spectral asymptotics for the eigenvalues with the error term of order $O(n^{-3}).$ This asymptotics involves additional nonstandard terms and exhibits a non--trivial high--frequency phenomenon generated by the translations. We also establish that the system of eigenfunctions and generalized eigenfunctions of the considered operator forms the Bari basis in the space of functions square integrable on the unit segment.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics of the spectra of the Dirichlet and Dirichlet-Neumann problems for the Sturm-Liouville equation with integral perturbation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.24095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The article studies the Dirichlet and Dirichlet-Neumann problems for the Sturm-Liouville equation perturbed by an integral operator with a convolution kernel. Sharp asymptotic formulas for the eigenvalues of these problems are found. The formulas contain information about the Fourier coefficients of the potential and the kernel, and estimates are obtained for the remainder terms of the asymptotics, which take into account both the rate of decrease as the eigenvvalues tend to infinity and the rate of decrease as the norms of the potential and kernel tend to zero. The formulas are also new in the case of the Sturm-Liouville operator, when the convolution kernel is zero.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22759v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Marzo and Ortega-Cerd\`a gave geometric characterizations for $L^p$-Logvinenko-Sereda sets on the standard sphere for all $1\le p&lt;\infty$. Later, Ortega-Cerd\`a and Pridhnani further investigated $L^2$-Logvinenko-Sereda sets and $L^2$-Carleson measures on compact manifolds without boundary. In this paper, we characterize $L^p$-Logvinenko-Sereda sets and $L^p$-Carleson measures on compact manifolds with or without boundary for all $1&lt;p&lt;\infty$. Furthermore, we investigate $L^p$-Logvinenko-Sereda sets and $L^p$-Carleson measures for eigenfunctions on compact manifolds without boundary, and we completely characterize them on the standard sphere $S^m$ for $p &gt; \frac{2m}{m-1}$. For the range $p &lt; \frac{2m}{m-1}$, we conjecture that $L^p$-Logvinenko-Sereda sets for eigenfunctions on the standard sphere $S^m$ are characterized by the tubular geometric control condition and we provide some evidence. These results provide new progress on an open problem raised by Ortega-Cerd\`a and Pridhnani.</description>

      <title>Subordinacy theory for long-range operators: hyperbolic geodesic flow insights and monotonicity theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a comprehensive framework for subordinacy theory applicable to long-range operators on $\ell^2(\mathbb Z)$, bridging dynamical systems and spectral analysis. For finite-range operators, we establish a correspondence between the dynamical behavior of partially hyperbolic (Hermitian-)symplectic cocycles and the existence of purely absolutely continuous spectrum, resolving an open problem posed by Jitomirskaya. For infinite-range operators-where traditional cocycle methods become inapplicable-we characterize absolutely continuous spectrum through the growth of generalized eigenfunctions, extending techniques from higher-dimensional lattice models.
  Our main results include the first rigorous proof of purely absolutely continuous spectrum for quasi-periodic long-range operators with analytic potentials and Diophantine frequencies-in particular, the first proof of the all-phases persistence for finite-range perturbations of subcritical almost Mathieu operators-among other advances in spectral theory of long-range operators.
  The key novelty of our approach lies in the unanticipated connection between stable/vertical bundle intersections in geodesic flows-where they detect conjugate points-and their equally fundamental role in governing (de-)localization for Schr\"odinger operators. The geometric insight, combined with a novel coordinate-free monotonicity theory for general bundles (including its preservation under center-bundle restrictions) and adapted analytic spectral and KAM techniques, enables our spectral analysis of long-range operators.</description>

      <title>Homogenization of an indefinite spectral problem arising in population genetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study an indefinite spectral problem for a second-order self-adjoint elliptic operator in an asymptotically thin cylinder. The operator coefficients and the spectral density function are assumed to be locally periodic in the axial direction of the cylinder. The key assumption is that the spectral density function changes sign, which leads to infinitely many both positive and negative eigenvalues. The asymptotic behavior of the spectrum, as the thickness of the rod tends to zero, depends essentially on the sign of the average of the density function. We study the positive part of the spectrum in a specific case when the local average is negative. We derive a one-dimensional effective spectral problem that is a harmonic oscillator on the real line, and prove the convergence of spectrum. A key auxiliary result is the existence of a positive principal eigenvalue of an indefinite spectral problem with the Neumann boundary condition on a periodicity cell. This study is motivated by applications in population genetics where spectral problems with sign-changing weight naturally appear.</description>

      <title>Microscopic Rates of Convergence for Hermitian Unitary Ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23417v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper provides microscopic rates of convergence (ROC) with respect to the $L^1$-Wasserstein distance for the eigenvalue determinantal point processes (DPPs) from the three major Hermitian unitary ensembles, the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble (GUE), the Laguerre Unitary Ensemble (LUE), and the Jacobi Unitary Ensemble (JUE) to their limiting point processes. We prove ROCs for the bulk of the GUE spectrum, the hard edge of the LUE spectrum, and the soft edges of the GUE, LUE, and JUE spectrums. These results are called microscopic because we are able to directly compare the point counts between the converging and limit DPPs, the most refined type of information possible in this situation. We are able to achieve these results by controlling the trace class norm of the integral operators determined by the DPP kernels.</description>

      <title>Prescription of the Robin spectrum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01451v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $M$ be a compact connected smooth manifold with smooth boundary, and let $\rho$ be a positive continuous function on the boundary which is served as the Robin parameter. In this paper, we study three problems concerning the prescription of finite Robin spectrum: (1) Prescribing finitely many Robin eigenvalues and the volume. (2) Within a fixed conformal class, prescribing the multiplicities of finitely many Robin eigenvalues. (3) Within a fixed conformal class, prescribing finitely many distinct Robin eigenvalues and the volume. A key step in our method is to solve the corresponding problems for the Dirichlet spectrum. As a consequence, we also obtain analogous results for the Dirichlet case.</description>

      <title>Transmission resonances in scattering by $\delta'$-like combs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23837v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new exactly solvable model in quantum mechanics that describes the propagation of particles through a potential field created by regularly spaced $\delta'$-type point interactions, which model the localized dipoles often observed in crystal structures. We refer to the corresponding potentials as $\delta'_\theta$-combs, where the parameter $\theta$ represents the contrast of the resonant wave at zero energy and determines the interface conditions in the Hamiltonians. We explicitly calculate the scattering matrix for these systems and prove that the transmission probability exhibits sharp resonance peaks while rapidly decaying at other frequencies. Consequently, Hamiltonians with $\delta'_\theta$-comb potentials act as quantum filters, permitting tunnelling only for specific wave frequencies. Furthermore, for each $\theta &gt; 0$, we construct a family of regularized Hamiltonians approximating the ideal model and prove that their transmission probabilities have a similar structure, thereby confirming the physical realizability of the band-pass filtering effect.</description>

      <title>On negative eigenvalues of 1D Schr\"{o}dinger operators with $\delta'$-like potentials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14934v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate negative eigenvalues of exactly solvable quantum models, particularly one-dimensional Hamiltonians with $\delta'$-like potentials used to represent localized dipoles. These operators arise as norm resolvent limits of Schr\"odinger operators with suitably regularized potentials. Although the limiting operator is bounded below, we show that the approximating operators may possess a finite but arbitrarily large number of negative eigenvalues that diverge to $-\infty$ as the regularization parameter vanishes. This phenomenon illustrates a spectral instability of Schr\"odinger operators with $\delta'$-like singularities.</description>

      <title>Semiclassical measures of eigenfunctions of the attractive Coulomb operator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.09640v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We characterize the set of semiclassical measures corresponding to sequences of eigenfunctions of the attractive Coulomb operator $\widehat{H}_{\hbar}:=-\frac{\hbar^2}{2}\Delta_{\mathbb{R}^3}-\frac{1}{|x|}$. In particular, any Radon probability measure on the fixed negative energy hypersurface $\Sigma_E$ of the Kepler Hamiltonian $H$ in classical phase space that is invariant under the regularized Kepler flow is the semiclassical measure of a sequence of eigenfunctions of $\widehat{H}_{\hbar}$ with eigenvalue $E$ as $\hbar \to 0$. The main tool that we use is the celebrated Fock unitary conjugation map between eigenspaces of $\widehat{H}_{\hbar}$ and $-\Delta_{\mathbb{S}^3}$. We first prove that for any Kepler orbit $\gamma$ on $\Sigma_E$, there is a sequence of eigenfunctions that converge in the sense of semiclassical measures to the delta measure supported on $\gamma$ as $\hbar \to 0$, and we finish using a density argument in the weak-* topology.</description>

      <title>On the heat kernel of a Cayley graph of $\operatorname{PSL}_2\mathbb{Z}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02340v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we obtain an explicit formula for the heat kernel on the infinite Cayley graph of the modular group $\operatorname{PSL}_2\mathbb{Z}$, given by the presentation $\langle a,b\mid a^2=1, b^3=1\rangle$. Our approach extends the method of Chung--Yau in~\cite{MR1667452} by observing that the Cayley graph strongly and regularly covers a weighted infinite line. We solve the spectral problem on this line to obtain an integral expression for its heat kernel, and then lift this to the Cayley graph using spectral transfer principles for strongly regular coverings. The explicit formula allows us to determine the Laplace spectrum, containing eigenvalues and continuous parts. As a by-product, we suggest a conjecture on the lower bound for the spectral gap of Cayley graphs of $\operatorname{PSL}_2\mathbb{F}_p$ with our generators, inspired by the analogy with Selberg's $1/4$-conjecture. Numerical evidence is provided for small primes.</description>
