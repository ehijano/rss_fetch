      <title>Cryptographic Applications of Twisted Goppa Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article defines multi-twisted Goppa (MTG) codes as subfield subcodes of duals of multi-twisted Reed-Solomon (MTRS) codes and examines their properties. We show that if $t$ is the degree of the MTG polynomial defining an MTG code, its minimum distance is at least $t + 1$ under certain conditions. Extending earlier methods limited to single twist at last position, we use the extended Euclidean algorithm to efficiently decode MTG codes with a single twist at any position, correcting up to $\left\lfloor \tfrac{t}{2} \right\rfloor$ errors. This decoding method highlights the practical potential of these codes within the Niederreiter public key cryptosystem (PKC). Furthermore, we establish that the Niederreiter PKC based on MTG codes is secure against partial key recovery attacks. Additionally, we also reduce the public key size by constructing quasi-cyclic MTG codes using a non-trivial automorphism group.</description>

      <title>Scalable Base Station Configuration via Bayesian Optimization with Block Coordinate Descent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a scalable Bayesian optimization (BO) framework for dense base-station (BS) configuration design. BO can find an optimal BS configuration by iterating parameter search, channel simulation, and probabilistic modeling of the objective function. However, its performance is severely affected by the curse of dimensionality, thereby reducing its scalability. To overcome this limitation, the proposed method sequentially optimizes per-BS parameters based on block coordinate descent while fixing the remaining BS configurations, thereby reducing the effective dimensionality of each optimization step. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms naive optimization in dense deployment scenarios.</description>

      <title>Bounds and Constructions of Codes for Ordered Composite DNA Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper extends the foundational work of Dollma \emph{et al}. on codes for ordered composite DNA sequences. We consider the general setting with an alphabet of size $q$ and a resolution parameter $k$, moving beyond the binary ($q=2$) case primarily studied previously. We investigate error-correcting codes for substitution errors and deletion errors under several channel models, including $(e_1,\ldots,e_k)$-composite error/deletion, $e$-composite error/deletion, and the newly introduced $t$-$(e_1,\ldots,e_t)$-composite error/deletion model.
  We first establish equivalence relations among families of composite-error correcting codes (CECCs) and among families of composite-deletion correcting codes (CDCCs). This significantly reduces the number of distinct error-parameter sets that require separate analysis. We then derive novel and general upper bounds on the sizes of CECCs using refined sphere-packing arguments and probabilistic methods. These bounds together cover all values of parameters $q$, $k$, $(e_1,\ldots,e_k)$ and $e$. In contrast, previous bounds were only established for $q=2$ and limited choices of $k$, $(e_1,\ldots,e_k)$ and $e$. For CDCCs, we generalize a known non-asymptotic upper bound for $(1,0,\ldots,0)$-CDCCs and then provide a cleaner asymptotic bound.
  On the constructive side, for any $q\ge2$, we propose $(1,0,\ldots,0)$-CDCCs, $1$-CDCCs and $t$-$(1,\ldots,1)$-CDCCs with near-optimal redundancies. These codes have efficient and systematic encoders. For substitution errors, we design the first explicit encoding and decoding algorithms for the binary $(1,0,\ldots,0)$-CECC constructed by Dollma \emph{et al}, and extend the approach to general $q$. Furthermore, we give an improved construction of binary $1$-CECCs, a construction of nonbinary $1$-CECCs, and a construction of $t$-$(1,\ldots,1)$-CECCs. These constructions are also systematic.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Connectivity in Ambient Backscatter Communications via Fluid Antenna Readers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ambient backscatter communication (AmBC) enables ultra-low-power connectivity by allowing passive backscatter devices (BDs) to convey information through reflection of ambient signals. However, the cascaded AmBC channel suffers from severe double path loss and multiplicative fading, while accurate channel state information (CSI) acquisition is highly challenging due to the weak backscattered signal and the resource-limited nature of BDs. To address these challenges, this paper considers an AmBC system in which the reader is equipped with a pixel-based fluid antenna system (FAS). By dynamically selecting one antenna position from a dense set of pixels within a compact aperture, the FAS-enabled reader exploits spatial diversity through measurement-driven port selection, without requiring explicit CSI acquisition or multiple RF chains. The intrinsic rate-energy tradeoff at the BD is also incorporated by jointly optimizing the backscatter modulation coefficient under an energy harvesting (EH) neutrality constraint. To efficiently solve this problem, a particle swarm optimization (PSO)-based framework is developed to jointly determine the FAS port selection and modulation coefficient on an optimize-then-average (OTA) basis. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme significantly improves the achievable rate compared with conventional single-antenna readers, with gains preserved under imperfect observations, stringent EH constraints, and different pixel spacings.</description>

      <title>Continuous Fluid Antenna Sampling for Channel Estimation in Cell-Free Massive MIMO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter, we develop a continuous fluid antenna (FA) framework for uplink channel estimation in cell-free massive multiple-input and multiple-output (CF-mMIMO) systems. By modeling the wireless channel as a spatially correlated Gaussian random field, channel estimation is formulated as a Gaussian process (GP) regression problem with motion-constrained spatial sampling. Closed-form expressions for the linear minimum mean squared error (LMMSE) estimator and the corresponding estimation error are derived. A fundamental comparison with discrete port-based architectures is established under identical position constraints, showing that continuous FA sampling achieves equal or lower estimation error for any finite pilot budget, with strict improvement for non-degenerate spatial correlation models. Numerical results validate the analysis and show the performance gains of continuous FA sampling over discrete baselines.</description>

      <title>Spectral Conditions for the Ingleton Inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Ingleton inequality is a classical linear information inequality that holds for representable matroids but fails to be universally valid for entropic vectors. Understanding the extent to which this inequality can be violated has been a longstanding problem in information theory. In this paper, we show that for a broad class
  of jointly distributed random variables $(X,Y)$ the Ingleton inequality holds up to a small additive error, even even though the mutual information between $X$ and $Y$ is far from being extractable. Contrary to common intuition, strongly non-extractable mutual information does not lead to large violations of the Ingleton inequality in this setting. More precisely, we consider pairs $(X,Y)$ that are uniformly distributed on their joint support and whose associated biregular bipartite graph is an expander. For all auxiliary random variables $A$ and $B$ jointly distributed with $(X,Y)$, we establish a lower bound on the Ingleton quantity $I(X:Y | A) + I(X:Y | B) + I(A:B) - I(X:Y)$ in terms of the spectral parameters of the underlying graph. Our proof combines the expander mixing lemma with a partitioning technique for finite sets.</description>

      <title>The Role of Common Randomness Replication in Symmetric PIR on Graph-Based Replicated Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In symmetric private information retrieval (SPIR), a user communicates with multiple servers to retrieve from them a message in a database, while not revealing the message index to any individual server (user privacy), and learning no additional information about the database (database privacy). We study the problem of SPIR on graph-replicated database systems, where each node of the graph represents a server and each link represents a message. Each message is replicated at exactly two servers; those at which the link representing the message is incident. To ensure database privacy, the servers share a set of common randomness, independent of the database and the user's desired message index. We study two cases of common randomness distribution to the servers: i) graph-replicated common randomness, and ii) fully-replicated common randomness. Given a graph-replicated database system, in i), we assign one randomness variable independently to every pair of servers sharing a message, while in ii), we assign an identical set of randomness variable to all servers, irrespective of the underlying graph. In both settings, our goal is to characterize the SPIR capacity, i.e., the maximum number of desired message symbols retrieved per downloaded symbol, and quantify the minimum amount of common randomness required to achieve the capacity. To this goal, in setting i), we derive a general lower bound on the SPIR capacity, and show it to be tight for path and regular graphs through a matching converse. Moreover, we establish that the minimum size of common randomness required for SPIR is equal to the message size. In setting ii), the SPIR capacity improves over the first, more restrictive setting. We show this through capacity lower bounds for a class of graphs, by constructing SPIR schemes from PIR schemes.</description>

      <title>Newton-Direction-Based ReLU-Thresholding Methods for Nonnegative Sparse Signal Recovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15880v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonnegative sparse signal recovery has been extensively studied due to its broad applications. Recent work has integrated rectified linear unit (ReLU) techniques to enhance existing recovery algorithms. We merge Newton-type thresholding with ReLU-based approaches to propose two algorithms: Newton-Direction-Based ReLU-Thresholding (NDRT) and its enhanced variant, Newton-Direction-Based ReLU-Thresholding Pursuit (NDRTP). Theoretical analysis iindicates that both algorithms can guarantee exact recovery of nonnegative sparse signals when the measurement matrix satisfies a certain condition.. Numerical experiments demonstrate NDRTP achieves competitive performance compared to several existing methods in both noisy and noiseless scenarios.</description>

      <title>Statistical-Geometric Degeneracy in UAV Search: A Physics-Aware Asymmetric Filtering Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15893v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Post-disaster survivor localization using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) faces a fundamental physical challenge: the prevalence of Non-Line-of-Sight (NLOS) propagation in collapsed structures. Unlike standard Gaussian noise, signal reflection from debris introduces strictly non-negative ranging biases. Existing robust estimators, typically designed with symmetric loss functions (e.g., Huber or Tukey), implicitly rely on the assumption of error symmetry. Consequently, they experience a theoretical mismatch in this regime, leading to a phenomenon we formally identify as Statistical-Geometric Degeneracy (SGD)-a state where the estimator stagnates due to the coupling of persistent asymmetric bias and limited observation geometry. While emerging data-driven approaches offer alternatives, they often struggle with the scarcity of training data and the sim-to-real gap inherent in unstructured disaster zones. In this work, we propose a physically-grounded solution, the AsymmetricHuberEKF, which explicitly incorporates the non-negative physical prior of NLOS biases via a derived asymmetric loss function. Theoretically, we show that standard symmetric filters correspond to a degenerate case of our framework where the physical constraint is relaxed. Furthermore, we demonstrate that resolving SGD requires not just a robust filter, but specific bilateral information, which we achieve through a co-designed active sensing strategy. Validated in a 2D nadir-view scanning scenario, our approach significantly accelerates convergence compared to symmetric baselines, offering a resilient building block for search operations where data is scarce and geometry is constrained.</description>

      <title>ROIX-Comp: Optimizing X-ray Computed Tomography Imaging Strategy for Data Reduction and Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15917v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In high-performance computing (HPC) environments, particularly in synchrotron radiation facilities, vast amounts of X-ray images are generated. Processing large-scale X-ray Computed Tomography (X-CT) datasets presents significant computational and storage challenges due to their high dimensionality and data volume. Traditional approaches often require extensive storage capacity and high transmission bandwidth, limiting real-time processing capabilities and workflow efficiency. To address these constraints, we introduce a region-of-interest (ROI)-driven extraction framework (ROIX-Comp) that intelligently compresses X-CT data by identifying and retaining only essential features. Our work reduces data volume while preserving critical information for downstream processing tasks. At pre-processing stage, we utilize error-bounded quantization to reduce the amount of data to be processed and therefore improve computational efficiencies. At the compression stage, our methodology combines object extraction with multiple state-of-the-art lossless and lossy compressors, resulting in significantly improved compression ratios. We evaluated this framework against seven X-CT datasets and observed a relative compression ratio improvement of 12.34x compared to the standard compression.</description>

      <title>Online Prediction of Stochastic Sequences with High Probability Regret Bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the classical problem of universal prediction of stochastic sequences with a finite time horizon $T$ known to the learner. The question we investigate is whether it is possible to derive vanishing regret bounds that hold with high probability, complementing existing bounds from the literature that hold in expectation. We propose such high-probability bounds which have a very similar form as the prior expectation bounds. For the case of universal prediction of a stochastic process over a countable alphabet, our bound states a convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}(T^{-1/2} \delta^{-1/2})$ with probability as least $1-\delta$ compared to prior known in-expectation bounds of the order $\mathcal{O}(T^{-1/2})$. We also propose an impossibility result which proves that it is not possible to improve the exponent of $\delta$ in a bound of the same form without making additional assumptions.</description>

      <title>Optimal training-conditional regret for online conformal prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16537v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study online conformal prediction for non-stationary data streams subject to unknown distribution drift. While most prior work studied this problem under adversarial settings and/or assessed performance in terms of gaps of time-averaged marginal coverage, we instead evaluate performance through training-conditional cumulative regret. We specifically focus on independently generated data with two types of distribution shift: abrupt change points and smooth drift.
  When non-conformity score functions are pretrained on an independent dataset, we propose a split-conformal style algorithm that leverages drift detection to adaptively update calibration sets, which provably achieves minimax-optimal regret. When non-conformity scores are instead trained online, we develop a full-conformal style algorithm that again incorporates drift detection to handle non-stationarity; this approach relies on stability - rather than permutation symmetry - of the model-fitting algorithm, which is often better suited to online learning under evolving environments. We establish non-asymptotic regret guarantees for our online full conformal algorithm, which match the minimax lower bound under appropriate restrictions on the prediction sets. Numerical experiments corroborate our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Robust Joint Message and State Transmission under Arbitrarily Varying Jamming</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10896v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Joint message and state transmission under arbitrarily varying jamming is investigated in this paper. The problem is modeled as the transmission over a channel with random states with a fixed distribution and jamming that varies in an unknown manner. We consider cases in which the channel state is known at the encoder strictly causally and noncausally. For each case, both the average error criterion and the maximal error criterion of the message transmission are adopted. The main results of this paper are lower bounds of the capacity--distortion function of the aforementioned scenarios. Some capacity-achieving cases are also provided. The proposed coding schemes are deterministic, and no correlated randomness is needed to achieve reliable communication and estimation. It turns out that the performance of the system under the average error can strictly outperform the maximal error case, which is in accordance with normal communication over arbitrarily varying channels.</description>

      <title>Residual Diffusion Models for Variable-Rate Joint Source Channel Coding of MIMO CSI</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21681v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite significant advancements in deep learning based CSI compression, some key limitations remain unaddressed. Current approaches predominantly treat CSI compression as a source-coding problem, thereby neglecting transmission errors. Conventional separate source and channel coding suffers from the cliff effect, leading to significant deterioration in reconstruction performance under challenging channel conditions. While existing autoencoder-based compression schemes can be readily extended to support joint source-channel coding, they struggle to capture complex channel distributions and exhibit poor scalability with increasing parameter count. To overcome these inherent limitations of autoencoder-based approaches, we propose Residual-Diffusion Joint Source-Channel Coding (RD- JSCC), a novel framework that integrates a lightweight autoencoder with a residual diffusion module to iteratively refine CSI reconstruction. Our flexible decoding strategy balances computational efficiency and performance by dynamically switching between low-complexity autoencoder decoding and sophisticated diffusion-based refinement based on channel conditions. Comprehensive simulations demonstrate that RD-JSCC significantly outperforms existing autoencoder-based approaches in challenging wireless environments. Furthermore, RD-JSCC offers several practical features, including a low-latency 2-step diffusion during inference, support for multiple compression rates with a single model, robustness to fixed-bit quantization, and adaptability to imperfect channel estimation.</description>

      <title>Strong Singleton-Like Bounds, Quasi-Perfect Codes and Distance-Optimal Codes in the Sum-Rank Metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05581v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Codes in the sum-rank metric have received many attentions in recent years, since they have wide applications in the multishot network coding, the space-time coding and the distributed storage. In this paper, by constructing covering codes in the sum-rank metric from covering codes in the Hamming metric, we derive new upper bounds on sizes, the covering radii and the block length functions of codes in the sum-rank metric. As applications, we present several strong Singleton-like bounds that are tighter than the classical Singleton-like bound when block lengths are large. In addition, we give the explicit constructions of the distance-optimal sum-rank codes of matrix sizes $s\times s$ and $2\times 2$ with minimum sum-rank distance four respectively by using cyclic codes in the Hamming metric. More importantly, we present an infinite families of quasi-perfect $q$-ary sum-rank codes with matrix sizes $2\times m$. Furthermore, we construct almost MSRD codes with larger block lengths and demonstrate how the Plotkin sum can be used to give more distance-optimal sum-rank codes.</description>

      <title>Lossy Source Coding with Broadcast Side Information</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07797v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper considers the source coding problem with broadcast side information. The side information is sent to two receivers through a noisy broadcast channel. We provide an outer bound of the rate--distortion--bandwidth (RDB) quadruples and achievable RDB quadruples when the helper uses a separation-based scheme. Some special cases with full characterization are also provided. We then compare the separation-based scheme with the uncoded scheme in the quadratic Gaussian case.</description>

      <title>Convergence of Differential Entropies -- II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13493v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that under convergence in measure of probability density functions, differential entropy converges whenever the entropy integrands $f_n |\log f_n|$ are uniformly integrable and tight -- a direct consequence of Vitali's convergence theorem. We give an entropy-weighted Orlicz condition: $\sup_n \int f_n\, \Psi(|\log f_n|) &lt; \infty$ for a single superlinear~$\Psi$, strictly weaker than the fixed-$\alpha$ condition of Godavarti and Hero (2004). We also disprove the Godavarti-Hero conjecture that $\alpha &gt; 1$ could be replaced by $\alpha_n \downarrow 1$. We recover the sufficient conditions of Godavarti--Hero, Piera--Parada, and Ghourchian-Gohari-Amini as corollaries. On bounded domains, we prove that uniform integrability of the entropy integrands is both necessary and sufficient -- a complete characterization of entropy convergence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2205.08293v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate quantitative implications of the notion of log-concavity through a probabilistic interpretation. In particular, we derive concentration inequalities, moment and entropy bounds for random variables satisfying a precise degree of log-concavity. Along the way, we recover, improve, and simplify several results existing in the literature. Our approach is based on majorization in the convex order.</description>

Abstract: Arranging the bits of a random string or real into k columns of a two-dimensional array or higher dimensional structure is typically accompanied with loss in the Kolmogorov complexity of the columns, which depends on k. We quantify and characterize this phenomenon for arrays and trees and its relationship to negligible classes.</description>

      <title>Scalable Precise Computation of Shannon Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01160v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantitative information flow analyses (QIF) are a class of techniques for measuring the amount of confidential information leaked by a program to its public outputs. Shannon entropy is an important method to quantify the amount of leakage in QIF. This paper focuses on the programs modeled in Boolean constraints and optimizes the two stages of the Shannon entropy computation to implement a scalable precise tool PSE. In the first stage, we design a knowledge compilation language called \ADDAND that combines Algebraic Decision Diagrams and conjunctive decomposition. \ADDAND avoids enumerating possible outputs of a program and supports tractable entropy computation. In the second stage, we optimize the model counting queries that are used to compute the probabilities of outputs. We compare PSE with the state-of-the-art probabilistic approximately correct tool EntropyEstimation, which was shown to significantly outperform the previous precise tools. The experimental results demonstrate that PSE solved 56 more benchmarks compared to EntropyEstimation in a total of 459. For 98\% of the benchmarks that both PSE and EntropyEstimation solved, PSE is at least $10\times$ as efficient as EntropyEstimation.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Codes: Self-Correction from Small(er)-Set Expansion with Tunable Non-locality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07179v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optimal constructions of classical LDPC codes can be obtained by choosing the Tanner graph uniformly at random among biregular graphs. We introduce a class of codes that we call ``diffusion codes'', defined by placing each edge connecting bits and checks on some graph, and acting on that graph with a random SWAP network. By tuning the depth of the SWAP network, we can tune a tradeoff between the amount of randomness -- and hence the optimality of code parameters -- and locality with respect to the underlying graph. For diffusion codes defined on the cycle graph, if the SWAP network has depth $\sim Tn$ with $T&gt; n^{2\beta}$ for arbitrary $\beta&gt;0$, then we prove that almost surely the Tanner graph is a lossless ``smaller set'' vertex expander for small sets up size $\delta \sim \sqrt T \sim n^{\beta}$, with bounded bit and check degree. At the same time, the geometric size of the largest stabilizer is bounded by $\sqrt T$ in graph distance. We argue, based on physical intuition, that this result should hold more generally on arbitrary graphs. By taking hypergraph products of these classical codes we obtain quantum LDPC codes defined on the torus with smaller-set boundary and co-boundary expansion and the same expansion/locality tradeoffs as for the classical codes. These codes are self-correcting and admit single-shot decoding, while having the geometric size of the stabilizer growing as an arbitrarily small power law. Our proof technique establishes mixing of a random SWAP network on small subsystems at times scaling with only the subsystem size, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Graphical model for factorization and completion of relatively high rank tensors by sparse sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17886v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider tensor factorizations based on sparse measurements of the components of relatively high rank tensors. The measurements are designed in a way that the underlying graph of interactions is a random graph. The setup will be useful in cases where a substantial amount of data is missing, as in completion of relatively high rank matrices for recommendation systems heavily used in social network services. In order to obtain theoretical insights on the setup, we consider statistical inference of the tensor factorization in a high dimensional limit, which we call as dense limit, where the graphs are large and dense but not fully connected. We build message-passing algorithms and test them in a Bayes optimal teacher-student setting in some specific cases. We also develop a replica theory to examine the performance of statistical inference in the dense limit based on a cumulant expansion. The latter approach allows one to avoid blind usage of Gaussian ansatz which fails in some fully connected systems.</description>
