      <title>Extensions of pure C*-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a closed ideal $I$ in a C*-algebra $A$, we show that $A$ is pure if and only if $I$ and $A/I$ are pure. More generally, we study permanence of comparison and divisibility properties when passing to extensions.
  As an application we show that stable multiplier algebras of reduced free group C*-algebras are pure.</description>

      <title>The Bisognano-Wichmann property for non-unitary Wightman conformal field theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10625v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Bisognano-Wichmann and Haag duality properties for algebraic quantum field theories are often studied using the powerful tools of Tomita-Takesaki modular theory for nets of operator algebras. In this article, we study analogous properties of nets of algebras generated by smeared Wightman fields, for potentially non-unitary theories. In light of recent work constructing Wightman field theories for (non-unitary) M\"obius vertex algebras, we obtain a broadly applicable non-unitary version of the Bisognano-Wichmann property. In this setting we do not have access to the traditional tools of Hilbert space functional analysis, like functional calculus. Instead, results analogous to those of Tomita-Takesaki theory are derived `by hand' from the Wightman axioms. As an application, we demonstrate Haag duality for nets of smeared Wightman fields for unitary theories.</description>

      <title>Algorithmic methods of finite discrete structures. Topological graph drawing (part III)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The manuscript considers mathematical models for creating a topological drawing of a graph based on the methods of G. Ringel's vertex rotation theory. An algorithm is presented for generating a topological drawing of a flat part of a graph based on the selection of a basis for the cycle subspace C(G) using the Monte Carlo method. A steepest descent method for constructing a topological drawing of a flat subgraph is described in the manuscript. The topological drawing of a graph is constructed using a combination of the methods of vector intersection algebra developed by L. I. Rapport. Three stages of constructing a flat subgraph of a non-separable graph are described. The issues of constructing a Hamiltonian cycle based on constructing a flat subgraph are considered. A new method for constructing a Hamiltonian cycle of a graph based on the cycle graph of a flat subgraph is described.</description>

      <title>Large-scale quantization of trace I: Finite propagation operators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by parallel developments in coarse geometry in mathematics and exact macroscopic quantization in physics, we present a family of general trace formulae which are universally quantized and depend only on large-scale geometric features of the input data. They generalize, to arbitrary dimensions, formulae found by Roe in his partitioned manifold index theorem, as well as the Kubo and Kitaev formulae for 2D Hall conductance used in physics.</description>

      <title>The strong Haagerup inequality for q-circular systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03177v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Together with Speicher, in 2007 the first author proved the strong Haagerup inequality for operator norms of homogeneous holomorphic polynomials in freely independent $\mathscr{R}$-diagonal elements (including in particular circular random variables); the inequality improved the bound from the original Haagerup inequality to grow with $\sqrt{n}$, rather than linearly in $n$, on homogeneous polynomials of degree $n$. In this paper, we prove a similar inequality for $q$-circular systems for $|q|&lt;1$, generalizing the free case when $q=0$. In particular, we prove the strong Haagerup inequality for systems exhibiting neither free independence nor $\mathscr{R}$-diagonality. As an application, we prove a strong ultracontractivity theorem for the $q$-Ornstein--Uhlenbeck semigroup, and prove sharp rates for the Haagerup and ultracontractive inequalities.</description>

      <title>The Rank Ratio Function and the Radius of Comparison</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05764v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For any given Cuntz semigroup, we introduce a function associated to it, called the ``Rank Ratio Function". This function ensures global control over the oscillation of the rank of any pair of elements in the Cuntz semigroup and, also, plays a very important role in computing the relative radii of comparison of the Cuntz semigroups. Along the way, as we study both the C*-algebraic and algebraic aspects of the relative radius of comparison with a deeper analysis, we introduce another function called the ``Radius of Comparison Function" which provides a method for manufacturing non-classifiable C*-algebras with different relative radii of comparison.</description>

      <title>Banach algebras associated to twisted \'etale groupoids: inverse semigroup disintegration and representations on $L^p$-spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.09997v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce Banach algebras associated to twisted \'etale groupoids $(\mathcal{G},\mathcal{L})$ and to twisted inverse semigroup actions. This provides a unifying framework for numerous recent papers on $L^p$-operator algebras and the theory of groupoid $C^*$-algebras. We prove disintegrations theorems that allow to study Banach algebras associated to $(\mathcal{G},\mathcal{L})$ as universal Banach algebras generated by $C_0(X)$ and a twisted inverse semigroup $S$ of partial isometries subject to some relations. They work best when the target of a representation is a dual Banach algebra. For representations on dual Banach spaces, they allow to extend representations to twisted Borel convolution algebras, which is crucial when the groupoid is non-Hausdorff.
  We establish fundamental norm estimates and hierarchy for full and reduced $L^p$-operator algebras for $(\mathcal{G},\mathcal{L})$ and $p \in [1,\infty]$, whose special cases have been studied recently by Gardella-Lupini, Choi-Gardella-Thiel and Hetland-Ortega. We show that in the constructions of $L^p$-analogues of Cuntz or graph algebras, by Phillips and Corti\~{n}as-Rodr\'{\i}guez, the use of spatial partial isometries is not an assumption, in fact it is forced by the relations. We also introduce tight inverse semigroup Banach algebras that cover ample groupoid Banach algebras, and discuss Banach algebras associated to directed graphs.
  Our results cover non-Hausdorff \'{e}tale groupoids and both real and complex algebras. Some of the results are new already for complex $C^*$-algebras.</description>

      <title>Amenability of group actions on compact spaces and the associated Banach algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08357v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The amenability of group actions on topological spaces generalizes amenability of groups and has applications in group theory, such as characterizing $C^{*}$--exact groups. We characterized it in terms of Banach algebras. For a topological group $G$ , group amenability can be characterized through the amenability of the convolution Banach algebra $L^1(G)$. Here a Banach algebra $A$ is called amenable if all derivations from $A$ to any dual--type $A$--$A$--Banach bimodules are inner. We extended this result to discrete group actions on compact Hausdorff spaces, using a certain Banach algebra arising from the action and a weakened amenability condition of Banach algebras. We also proved a fixed point characterization of amenable actions, which improves the result by Dong and Wang (2015).</description>
