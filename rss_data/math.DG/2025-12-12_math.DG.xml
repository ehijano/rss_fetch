      <title>Rotational Weingarten surfaces in Lorentz-Minkowski space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new approach to the study of rotational surfaces in Lorentz-Minkowski space based on the notion of the geometric linear momentum of the generatrix curves with respect to the axes of revolution. This technique allows us to reduce any Weingarten condition on the surface to a first-order ordinary differential equation for the momentum as a function of the distance to the corresponding axis, providing a unified framework that encompasses the three causal types of rotation axes. As a direct application, we classify important families of rotational Weingarten surfaces in this setting, including some linear and quadratic cases. Furthermore, we introduce the non-degenerate quadric surfaces of revolution in Lorentz-Minkowski space and characterize them in terms of a specific cubic Weingarten relation.</description>

      <title>Components of generalised complex structures on transitive Courant algebroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generalised almost complex structures $\mathcal J$ on transitive Courant algebroids $E$ are studied in terms of their components with respect to a splitting $E\cong TM \oplus T^*M \oplus \mathcal G$, where $M$ denotes the base of $E$ and $\mathcal G$ its bundle of quadratic Lie algebras. Necessary and sufficient integrability equations for $\mathcal J$ are established in this formalism. As an application, it is shown that the integrability of $\mathcal J$ implies that one of the components defines a Poisson structure on $M$. Then the structure (normal form) of generalised complex structures for which the Poisson structure is non-degenerate is determined. It is shown that it is fully encoded in a pair $(\omega , \rho )$ consisting of a symplectic structure $\omega$ on $M$ and a representation $\rho : \pi_1(M) \to \mathrm{Aut}(\mathfrak g, \langle \cdot ,\cdot \rangle_{\mathfrak{g}}, J_{\mathfrak{g}})$ by automorphism of a quadratic Lie algebra $(\mathfrak g, \langle \cdot ,\cdot \rangle_{\mathfrak{g}})$ commuting with an integrable (in the sense of Lie algebras) skew-symmetric complex structure $J_{\mathfrak{g}}$. Examples of such representations and obstructions for the existence of non-degenerate generalised complex structures are discussed. Finally, a construction of generalised complex structures on transitive Courant algebroids over complex manifolds for which the Poisson structure degenerates along a complex analytic hypersurface is presented.</description>

      <title>Uniform RC-positivity of direct image bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The concept of RC-positivity and uniform RC-positivity is introduced by Xiaokui Yang to solve a conjecture of Yau on projectivity and rational connectedness of a compact K\"ahler manifold with positive holomorphic sectional curvature. Some main theorems in Yang's proof hold under a weaker condition called weak RC-positivity. It is therefore natural to ask if (uniform) weak RC-positivity implies (uniform) RC-positivity. Another motivation for studying this problem is to understand the relation between rational connectedness of $X$ and (uniform) RC-positivity of the holomorphic tangent bundle $TX$.
  In this paper, we obtain results in this direction. In particular, we show that if a vector bundle $E$ is uniformly weakly RC-positive, then $S^kE\otimes \det E$ is uniformly RC-positive for any $k\geq 0$, and $S^kE$ is uniformly RC-positive for $k$ large. We also discuss an approach that might lead to a solution to the question of whether weak RC-positivity of $E$ implies RC-positivity of $E$.</description>

      <title>Symmetries of extremal horizons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove an intrinsic analogue of Hawking's rigidity theorem for extremal horizons in arbitrary dimensions: any compact cross-section of a rotating extremal horizon in a spacetime satisfying the null energy condition must admit a Killing vector field. If the dominant energy condition is satisfied for null vectors, it follows that an extension of the near-horizon geometry admits an enhanced isometry group containing $SO(2,1)$ or the 2D Poincar\'e group $\mathbb{R}^2 \rtimes SO(1,1)$. In the latter case, the associated Aretakis instability for a massless scalar field is shifted by one order in the derivatives of the field transverse to the horizon. We consider a broad class of examples including Einstein-Maxwell(-Chern-Simons) theory and Yang-Mills theory coupled to charged matter. In these examples we show that the symmetries are inherited by the matter fields.</description>

      <title>Geometric quantization on big line bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend several geometric quantization results to the setting of big line bundles. More precisely, we prove the asymptotic isometry property for the map that associates to a metric on a big line bundle the corresponding sup-norms on the spaces of holomorphic sections of its tensor powers. Building on this, we show that submultiplicative norms on section rings of big line bundles are asymptotically equivalent to sup-norms. As an application, we show that any bounded submultiplicative filtration on the section ring of a big line bundle naturally gives rise to a Mabuchi geodesic ray, and the speed of this ray encodes the statistical invariants of the filtration.</description>

      <title>A simplified proof of a cosmological singularity theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10699v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a previous paper [9], we proved the following singularity theorem applicable to cosmological models with a positive cosmological constant: if a four-dimensional spacetime satisfying the null energy condition contains a compact Cauchy surface which is expanding in all directions, then the spacetime is past null geodesically incomplete unless the Cauchy surface is topologically a spherical space. The proof in [9] made use of the positive resolution of the surface subgroup conjecture [15]. In this note, we demonstrate how the less-broadly-known positive resolution of the virtual positive first Betti number conjecture [1] provides a more streamlined and unified approach to the proof. We illustrate the theorem with some examples and analyze its rigidity under null geodesic completeness.</description>

Abstract: This paper introduces differential-geometric methods to study $n$-dimensional locally conformally flat spaces as submanifolds in $\mathbb{R}^{n+2}$. We derive explicit formulas relating intrinsic and ambient differential-geometric objects, including curvature tensors, the codifferential and laplacian operators. We apply this approach to Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) spaces using newfound embedding formulas, obtaining new and simplified expressions for the photon propagator in four dimensions.</description>

      <title>Stokes' theorem as an entropy-extremizing duality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.16386v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a manifold $\mathcal{M} \subset \mathbb{R}^n$, we consider all codimension-1 submanifolds of $\mathcal{M}$ that satisfy the generalized Stokes' theorem and show that $\partial\mathcal{M}$ uniquely maximizes the associated entropy functional. This provides an information theoretic characterization of the duality expressed by Stokes' theorem, whereby a manifold's boundary is its 'least informative' subset satisfying the Stokes relation.</description>

      <title>A Dynamical Approach to the Berezin--Li--Yau Inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08966v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a dynamical method for proving the sharp Berezin--Li--Yau inequality. The approach is based on the volume-preserving mean curvature flow and a new monotonicity principle for the Riesz mean $R_\Lambda(\Omega_t)$. For convex domains we show that $R_\Lambda$ is monotone non-decreasing along the flow. The key input is a geometric correlation inequality between the boundary spectral density $Q_\Lambda$ and the mean curvature $H$, established in all dimensions: in $d=2$ via circular symmetrization, and in $d\ge 3$ via the boundary Weyl expansion together with the Laugesen--Morpurgo trace minimization principle. Since the flow converges smoothly to the ball, the monotonicity implies the sharp Berezin--Li--Yau bound for every smooth convex domain. As an application, we obtain a sharp dynamical Ces\`aro--P\'olya inequality for eigenvalue averages.</description>

      <title>Einstein metrics on homogeneous superspaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13864v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper initiates the study of the Einstein equation on homogeneous supermanifolds. First, we produce explicit curvature formulas for graded Riemannian metrics on these spaces. Next, we present a construction of homogeneous supermanifolds by means of Dynkin diagrams, resembling the construction of generalised flag manifolds in classical (non-super) theory. We describe the Einstein metrics on several classes of spaces obtained through this approach. Our results provide examples of compact homogeneous supermanifolds on which the Einstein equation has no solutions, discrete families of solutions, and continuous families of Ricci-flat solutions among invariant metrics. These examples demonstrate that the finiteness conjecture from classical homogeneous geometry fails on supermanifolds, and challenge the intuition furnished by Bochner's vanishing theorem.</description>

      <title>Extrinsic systole of Seifert surfaces and distortion of knots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01095v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 1983, Gromov introduced the notion of distortion of a knot, and asked if there are knots with arbitrarily large distortion. In 2011, Pardon proved that the distortion of $T_{p,q}$ is at least $\min\{p,q\}$ up to a constant factor. We prove that the distortion of $T_{p, p+1}\# K$ is at least $p$ up to a constant, independent of $K$. We also prove that any embedding of a minimal genus Seifert surface for $T_{p,p+1}\# K$ in $\mathbb{R}^3$ has small extrinsic systole, in the sense that it contains a non-contractible loop with small $\mathbb{R}^3$-diameter relative to the length of the knot. These results are related to combinatorial properties of the monodromy map associated to torus knots.</description>
