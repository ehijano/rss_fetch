      <title>On the possibility of differential algebraic elimination of the spinor field from the Maxwell-Dirac electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate whether the spinor field can be eliminated from the Maxwell-Dirac equations by differential algebraic methods. A generic truncated power series solution is constructed, the prolonged system of the Maxwell-Dirac electrodynamics is linearized about the solution, and the ranks of the associated coefficient matrices are computed. The results indicate that, generically, the spinor components are uniquely determined by the electromagnetic field and its derivatives. This strongly suggests that differential-algebraic elimination of the spinor field is possible.</description>

      <title>Entanglement-assisted Hamiltonian dynamics learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Approximating the dynamics given by a complex many-body Hamiltonian with a simpler effective model lies at the interface of quantum Hamiltonian learning and quantum simulation. In this context, quantum generative adversarial networks (QGANs) have been shown to outperform standard Trotter-based approximations. However, their performance is often hindered by training plateaus and local minima that become increasingly severe with system size. To overcome these limitations, we propose an entanglement-assisted learning strategy that couples a single randomly initialized auxiliary qubit to the learning system at an intermediate stage of the training process. The interplay between randomization and entanglement significantly enhances the learning performance of the protocol.</description>

      <title>KPZ-like transport in long-range interacting spin chains proximate to integrability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Isotropic integrable spin chains such as the Heisenberg model feature superdiffusive spin transport belonging to an as-yet-unidentified dynamical universality class closely related to that of Kardar, Parisi, and Zhang (KPZ). To determine whether these results extend to more generic one-dimensional models, particularly those realizable in quantum simulators, we investigate spin and energy transport in non-integrable, long-range Heisenberg models using state-of-the-art tensor network methods. Despite the lack of integrability and the asymptotic expectation of diffusion, for power-law models (with exponent $2 &lt; \alpha &lt; \infty$) we observe long-lived $z=3/2$ superdiffusive spin transport and two-point correlators consistent with KPZ scaling functions, up to times $t \sim 10^3/J$. We conjecture that this KPZ-like transport is due to the proximity of such power-law-interacting models to the integrable family of Inozemtsev models, which we show to also exhibit KPZ-like spin transport across all interaction ranges. Finally, we consider anisotropic spin models naturally realized in Rydberg atom arrays and ultracold polar molecules, demonstrating that a wide range of long-lived, non-diffusive transport can be observed in experimental settings.</description>

      <title>Limits of Clifford Disentangling in Tensor Network States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tensor network methods leverage the limited entanglement of quantum states to efficiently simulate many-body systems. Alternatively, Clifford circuits provide a framework for handling highly entangled stabilizer states, which have low magic and are thus also classically tractable. Clifford tensor networks combine the benefits of both approaches, exploiting Clifford circuits to reduce the classical complexity of the tensor network description of states, with promising effects on simulation approaches. We study the disentangling power of Clifford transformations acting on tensor networks, with a particular emphasis on entanglement cooling strategies. We identify regimes where exact or heuristic Clifford disentanglers are effective, explain the link between the two approaches, and characterize their breakdown as non-Clifford resources accumulate. Additionally, we prove that, beyond stabilizer settings, no Clifford operation can universally disentangle even a single qubit from an arbitrary non-Clifford rotation. Our results clarify both the capabilities and fundamental limitations of Clifford-based simulation methods.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Superconducting Nanowire Single Photon Detector Performances using Silicon Capping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Niobium Titanium nitride (NbTiN) based superconducting nanowire single photon detectors (SNSPDs) are known for their high performance across a wide spectral range, from the X-ray to the mid-infrared. Nonetheless, fabrication challenges and performance degradation attributable to surface oxidation and lack of uniformity in films thinner than 5 nm remain a significant barrier for achieving high-quality detectors. In this work, we study the influence of a Silicon capping layer on film properties and on the performance of SNSPDs. A Silicon capping layer effectively suppresses oxidation and increases the superconducting transition temperature. This enables superconductivity in films as thin as 3 nm at 3 K, increases critical current in patterned nanowires and significantly extends the saturation plateau from the visible to the near infrared (up to 2050 nm): These detectors maintain sub-50 ps timing jitter, even for nanowires as wide as 250 nm and with detection areas of 20x20{\mu}m2. Our results establish that thinner films protected by a capping layer allow for the fabrication of wider wires, decreasing nanofabrication challenges and extending the operating temperature range for efficient single photon detection.</description>

      <title>Hardware-Agnostic Modeling of Quantum Side-Channel Leakage via Conditional Dynamics and Learning from Full Correlation Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a sequential coherent side-channel model in which an adversarial probe qubit interacts with a target qubit during a hidden gate sequence. Repeating the same hidden sequence for $N$ shots yields an empirical full-correlation record: the joint histogram $\widehat{P}_g(b)$ over probe bit-strings $b\in\{0,1\}^k$, which is a sufficient statistic for classical post-processing under identically and independently distributed (i.i.d.) shots but grows exponentially with circuit depth. We first describe this sequential probe framework in a coupling- and measurement-agnostic form, emphasizing the scaling of the observation space and why exact analytic distinguishability becomes intractable with circuit depth.
  We then specialize to a representative instantiation (a controlled-rotation probe coupling with fixed projective readout and a commuting $R_x$ gate alphabet) where we (i) derive a depth-dependent leakage envelope whose maximizer predicts a "Goldilocks" coupling band as a function of depth, and (ii) provide an operational decoder, via machine learning, a single parameter-conditioned map from $\widehat{P}_g$ to Alice's per-step gate labels, generalizing across coupling and noise settings without retraining. Experiments over broad coupling and noise grids show that strict sequence recovery concentrates near the predicted coupling band and degrades predictably under decoherence and finite-shot estimation.</description>

Abstract: We present a biologically inspired quantum neural network that encodes neuronal populations as fully connected qubits governed by the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick (LMG) quantum Hamiltonian and stabilized by a synaptic-efficacy feedback implementing activity-dependent homeostatic control. The framework links collective quantum many-body modes and attractor structure to population homeostasis and rhythmogenesis, outlining scalable computational primitives -- stable set points, controllable oscillations, and size-dependent robustness -- that position LMG-based architectures as promising blueprints for bio-inspired quantum brains on future quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking the Lights Out Problem on Real Quantum Hardware</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We implement the Lights Out problem on a 2D grid and on Mobius ladder graphs and evaluate the performance of Grover's search on real quantum hardware. We use two instances using 9 and 16 qubits, and implement them on publicly available quantum hardware by IBM and IQM. Our experiments show improvements in IBM hardware between the Heron r1 and Heron r2 generations, highlighting progress in IBM hardware during the 2023-2024 period. The Lights Out circuits produced output distributions close to uniform on IQM devices. To diagnose device limitations, we additionally ran a small Grover SAT baseline, finding that IQM Garnet performs more reliably than other tested IQM devices. We also observed that QPUs of the same manufacturing revision can differ significantly in performance (a newer device is not guaranteed to be better), and that calibration has a significant impact on the performance of quantum devices, so the choice of device strongly depends on calibration quality.</description>

      <title>Edge-Local and Qubit-Efficient Quantum Graph Learning for the NISQ Era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are a powerful framework for learning representations from graph-structured data, but their direct implementation on near-term quantum hardware remains challenging due to circuit depth, multi-qubit interactions, and qubit scalability constraints. In this work, we introduce a fully quantum graph convolutional architecture designed explicitly for unsupervised learning in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) regime. Our approach combines a variational quantum feature extraction layer with an edge-local and qubit-efficient quantum message-passing mechanism inspired by the Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz (QAOA) framework. Unlike prior models that rely on global operations or multi-controlled unitaries, our model decomposes message passing into pairwise interactions along graph edges using only hardware-native single- and two-qubit gates. This design reduces the qubit requirement from $O(Nn)$ to $O(n)$ for a graph with $N$ nodes and $n$-qubit feature registers, enabling implementation on current quantum devices regardless of graph size. We train the model using the Deep Graph Infomax objective to perform unsupervised node representation learning. Experiments on the Cora citation network and a large-scale genomic SNP dataset demonstrate that our model remains competitive with prior quantum and hybrid approaches.</description>

      <title>Device for MHz-rate rastering of arbitrary 2D optical potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current architectures for neutral-atom arrays utilize devices such as acousto-optic deflectors (AODs) and spatial light modulators (SLMs) to multiplex a single classical control line into N qubit control lines. Dynamic control is speed-limited by the response time of AODs, and geometrically constrained to respect a product structure, limiting motion to row-by-row or column-by-column moves. We propose an optical rastering device that can produce any 2D pattern, not limited to grids, at 1 MHz refresh rates. We demonstrate a design with a resolution of 40 x 40 that can be further scaled up to 100 x 100 to match existing and future neutral atom devices. The ability to simultaneously transport atomic qubits in arbitrary directions will enhance qubit connectivity, enable more efficient circuits, and may have broader applications ranging from LiDAR to fluorescence microscopy.</description>

      <title>Multi-emitter oscillating bound states in Waveguide QED</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Waveguide quantum electrodynamics platforms have emerged as promising candidates for exploring and implementing non-Markovian quantum phenomena. In this work, we investigate the formation and dynamics of superpositions of bound states in a cavity array waveguide coupled to two spatially separated quantum emitters. By tuning the system parameters, we show that spontaneous emission can drive the system into non-local equilibrium states in which both photonic and emitter populations exhibit persistent oscillations. These states arise from the coexistence of bound states embedded in the energy continuum and bound states outside it, leading to hybrid oscillatory modes. We analytically derive the conditions required for the emergence of these states, numerically simulate their formation through spontaneous emission, and predict their long-time behaviour. Our results demonstrate that such bound-state superpositions enable the generation of emitter-emitter interaction through free evolution, while supporting oscillatory breathing modes of the photon density between the emitters.</description>

      <title>Strong-to-Weak Symmetry Breaking in Open Quantum Systems: From Discrete Particles to Continuum Hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the onset of spontaneous strong-to-weak symmetry breaking (SW-SSB) under U(1)-symmetric (i.e., charge-conserving) open-system dynamics. We define this phenomenon for quantum states and classical probability distributions, and explore it in three complementary models, one of which exhibits nontrivial quantum coherence at short times. Our main conclusions are as follows. In one dimension, the strong symmetry is not spontaneously broken at any finite time; however, correlators probing strong-to-weak symmetry breaking develop order on length scales that grow linearly in time, parametrically faster than charge diffusion. We provide numerical evidence for this scaling in multiple distinct probes of SW-SSB, and derive it from a field-theory analysis. Moreover, we relate this scaling to the problem of inferring the charge inside a subregion by measuring its surroundings, and construct explicit decoding protocols that illustrate its origin. In two dimensions, field theory and numerical simulations support a finite-time Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless-like SW-SSB transition. Within continuum hydrodynamics, by contrast, SW-SSB happens at infinitesimal time in two or more dimensions. The SW-SSB transition time can thus be interpreted as marking the emergence of a continuum hydrodynamic description, or (more precisely) the timescale beyond which non-hydrodynamic information such as discrete particle worldlines can no longer be inferred. We support this picture by analyzing a model in which we exploit SW-SSB to derive a classical stochastic hydrodynamic description from the underlying quantum dynamics.</description>

      <title>Contractivity of time-dependent driven-dissipative systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a number of physically relevant contexts, a quantum system interacting with a decohering environment is simultaneously subjected to time-dependent controls and its dynamics is thus described by a time-dependent Lindblad master equation. Of particular interest in such systems is to understand the circumstances in which, despite the ability to apply time-dependent controls, they lose information about their initial state exponentially with time i.e., their dynamics are exponentially contractive. While there exists an extensive framework to study contractivity for time-independent Lindbladians, their time-dependent counterparts are far less well understood. In this paper, we study the contractivity of Lindbladians, which have a fixed dissipator (describing the interaction with an environment), but with a time-dependent driving Hamiltonian. We establish exponential contractivity in the limit of sufficiently small or sufficiently slow drives together with explicit examples showing that, even when the fixed dissipator is exponentially contractive by itself, a sufficiently large or a sufficiently fast Hamiltonian can result in non-contractive dynamics. Furthermore, we provide a number of sufficient conditions on the fixed dissipator that imply exponential contractivity independently of the Hamiltonian. These sufficient conditions allow us to completely characterize Hamiltonian-independent contractivity for unital dissipators and for two-level systems.</description>

      <title>Lie-Algebraic Analysis of Generators: Approximation-Error Bounds and Barren-Plateau Heuristics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lie algebras provide a useful framework for theoretical analysis in quantum machine learning, particularly in hybrid quantum-classical learning. From the viewpoint of function approximation, expectation values of parameterized quantum circuits can be viewed as trigonometric polynomials whose accessible Fourier modes are determined by the spectra of the generators. In this study, we describe: (1) a minimax lower bound on the $ L^{2} $-approximation error over a Sobolev ball when the circuit's effective frequency set is contained in a radius-$K$ ball, which yields a scaling law of the form $ \Omega(K^{\frac{d}{2} - r}) $ for $ r &gt; \frac{d}{2} $ (assuming the target function belongs to the Sobolev space $ W_2^{r}(\mathbb{T}^{d}) $), and we also derive a Jackson-type upper bound on the approximation error of quantum circuits under Sobolev regularity of the target function, expressed in terms of an effective bandwidth determined by generator spectral gaps; (2) a generator-selection rule motivated by enlarging the effective frequency set via non-commuting generators; and (3) a simple heuristic metric based on the trace component of generators, aimed at characterizing training behaviors related to barren plateaus. Simulation experiments on toy problems illustrate the practical implications of the frequency-spectrum perspective and the proposed heuristics.</description>

      <title>Local and Multi-Scale Strategies to Mitigate Exponential Concentration in Quantum Kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fidelity-based quantum kernels provide a direct interface between quantum feature maps and classical kernel methods, but they can exhibit exponential concentration: with increasing system size or circuit expressivity, the Gram matrix approaches the identity and suppresses informative similarity structure. We present an empirical study of two mitigation strategies implemented in Qiskit: (i) local (patch-wise) kernels that aggregate subsystem similarities, and (ii) multi-scale kernels that mix local and global similarity across patch granularities.
  We benchmark baseline, local, and multi-scale kernels under matched preprocessing, splits, and SVM protocols on several tabular datasets, sweeping the feature dimension $d\in\{4,6,\dots,20\}$. We report concentration diagnostics based on off-diagonal kernel statistics, spectral richness via effective rank, and centered alignment with labels. Across datasets, local and multi-scale constructions consistently mitigate concentration and yield richer kernel spectra relative to the global fidelity baseline, while the impact on classification accuracy depends on the dataset and dimension.</description>

      <title>Reductions of QAOA Induced by Classical Symmetries: Theoretical Insights and Practical Implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The performance of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is closely tied to the structure of the dynamical Lie algebra (DLA) generated by its Hamiltonians, which determines both its expressivity and trainability. In this work, we show that classical symmetries can be systematically exploited as a design principle for QAOA. Focusing on the MaxCut problem with global bit-flip symmetry, we analyze reduced QAOA instances obtained by fixing a single variable and study how this choice affects the associated DLAs. We show that the structure of the DLAs can change dramatically depending on which variable is held fixed. In particular, we construct explicit examples where the dimension collapses from exponential to quadratic, uncovering phenomena that do not appear in the original formulation.
  Numerical experiments on asymmetric graphs indicate that such reductions often produce DLAs of much smaller dimension, suggesting improved trainability. We also prove that any graph can be embedded into a slightly larger one (requiring only quadratic overhead) such that the standard reduced DLA coincides with the free reduced DLA, in most cases implying exponential dimension and irreducibility on the Hilbert space for reduced QAOA instances. These results establish symmetry-aware reduction as a principled tool for designing expressive and potentially trainable QAOA circuits.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement learning for path integrals in quantum statistical physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning is rapidly finding its way into the field of computational quantum physics. One of the most popular and widely studied approaches in this direction is to use neural networks to model quantum states (NQS) in the Hamiltonian formulation of quantum mechanics. However, an alternative angle of attack to leverage machine learning in physics is through the path integral formulation, which has so far received far more limited attention. In this paper, we explore how reinforcement learning can be used to compute a class of Euclidean path integrals that yield the thermal density matrix of a quantum system, thereby enabling the computation of the free energy or other thermal expectation values. In particular, we propose a two-step approach with the unique feature that after a variational approximation for a quantity is obtained in a first step, it can then be used to efficiently compute the exact result in a second step. We benchmark this method on several simple systems and then apply it to the quantum rotor chain.</description>

      <title>Squeezed superradiant lasing of a quantum many-body emitter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In conventional lasers, the emitters are typically incoherent, radiating photons independently; in superradiant lasers, many coherent emitters radiate photons collectively, but they essentially do not interact with each other. Here, we present the concept of quantum many-body lasers, in which the emitters interact coherently and radiate collectively. In this proof-of-concept study, we consider a cavity coupled to many pumped spin-1/2 emitters with all-to-all interaction. We find that the squeezing induced by the coherent many-body interaction can be transferred from the spins to photons through superradiant lasing. This work illustrates the concept of using a pumped quantum many-body system to generate bright quantum light with quantum correlations beyond conventional optical coherence, which can facilitate quantum technologies and the study of nonlinear optics in the quantum realm.</description>

      <title>Structured Unitary Tensor Network Representations for Circuit-Efficient Quantum Data Encoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Encoding classical data into quantum states is a central bottleneck in quantum machine learning: many widely used encodings are circuit-inefficient, requiring deep circuits and substantial quantum resources, which limits scalability on quantum hardware. In this work, we propose TNQE, a circuit-efficient quantum data encoding framework built on structured unitary tensor network (TN) representations. TNQE first represents each classical input via a TN decomposition and then compiles the resulting tensor cores into an encoding circuit through two complementary core-to-circuit strategies. To make this compilation trainable while respecting the unitary nature of quantum operations, we introduce a unitary-aware constraint that parameterizes TN cores as learnable block unitaries, enabling them to be directly optimized and directly encoded as quantum operators. The proposed TNQE framework enables explicit control over circuit depth and qubit resources, allowing the construction of shallow, resource-efficient circuits. Across a range of benchmarks, TNQE achieves encoding circuits as shallow as $0.04\times$ the depth of amplitude encoding, while naturally scaling to high-resolution images ($256 \times 256$) and demonstrating practical feasibility on real quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>Tomographically-nonlocal entanglement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.16280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entanglement is a central and subtle feature of quantum theory, whose structure and operational behavior can change dramatically when additional physical constraints, such as symmetries or superselection rules, are imposed. Such constraints can give rise to striking and counter-intuitive phenomena, including local broadcasting of entangled states and failures of entanglement monogamy. These effects naturally arise in tomographically nonlocal theories (like real quantum theory, twirled worlds, or fermionic quantum theory), where composite systems possess holistic degrees of freedom that are inaccessible to local measurements. In this work, we study entanglement in such theories within the framework of generalized probabilistic theories. We show that the failure of tomographic locality leads to two qualitatively distinct forms of entanglement, which we term $\textit{tomographically-local}$ entanglement and $\textit{tomographically-nonlocal}$ entanglement. We analyze the operational consequences of this distinction, proving that tomographically-nonlocal entanglement is useless for Bell nonlocality, steering, and teleportation, but sufficient for dense coding and perfectly secure data hiding. This framework clarifies the origin of several previously puzzling features of entanglement that arise when tomographic locality fails, as can happen even in quantum theory when one considers fermions or fundamental superselection rules.</description>

      <title>What Kind of World Supports Darwinian Evolution? Quantum Foundational Options</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Darwinian evolution requires (i) heritable records, (ii) repeatable copying with variation, and (iii) routine irreversibility. Categorical quantum mechanics (CQM) makes precise why ``copy'' and ``delete'' are not generic quantum operations: they exist only for a realized \emph{classical data} sector (a preferred basis/observable; a commutative structure). Decoherence explains how a pointer basis can be selected dynamically, but it does not by itself select a unique outcome. This motivates a neutral presentation of the main ontological options (unique-history, decohered multiplicity, agent-relative facticity, and a stochastic foundation with variable diffusion). We also note the relevance of the ``agency constraint'' argued by Adlam-McQueen-Waegell: in a strictly coherent, basis-unselected ``purely quantum'' regime, minimal agency fails due to no-cloning and linearity, which sharpens the role of classical resources for record-based processes. Extended Wigner's Friend scenarios then serve as a stress test, since they treat ``friends'' simultaneously as coherent quantum systems and as agents possessing stable records. Finally, a stochastic-mechanics foundation (with variable diffusion) offers a continuous bridge between quantum and classical regimes, and suggests a principled way to implement measurement update as conditioning plus a time-symmetric minimal-change rule.</description>

      <title>A resolution of the Ito-Stratonovich debate in quantum stochastic processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum stochastic processes are widely used in describing open quantum systems and in the context of quantum foundations. Physically relevant quantum stochastic processes driven by multiplicative colored noise are generically non-Markovian and analytically intractable. Further, their Markovian limits are generically inequivalent when using either the Ito or Stratonovich conventions for the same quantum stochastic processes. We introduce a quantum noise homogenization scheme that temporally coarse-grains non-Markovian, colored-noise driven quantum stochastic processes and connects them to their effective white-noise (Markovian) limits. Our approach uses a novel phase-space augmentation that maps the non-Markovian dynamics into a higher dimensional Markovian system and then applies a controlled perturbative coarse-graining scheme in the characteristic time scales of the noise. This allows an explicit analytical algorithm to derive effective Markovian generators with renormalized coefficients and enables imposing various physical constraints on them. We thus resolve the Ito-Stratonovich ambiguity for multiplicative colored noise driven quantum stochastic processes, wherein we show that their consistent Markovian limit corresponds to the Stratonovich convention with renormalized coefficients as well as Ito correction terms. By assuming their Markovian limit unravels completely positive, trace-preserving maps, we further characterize a physically relevant family of non-Markovian quantum stochastic processes driven by multiplicative colored noise.</description>

      <title>Quantum-enhanced sensing via spectral noise reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a direct demonstration of quantum-enhanced sensing in the Fourier domain by comparing single- and two-photon interference in a fiber-based interferometer under strictly identical noise conditions. The simultaneous acquisition of both signals provides a common-mode reference that enables a fair and unambiguous benchmark of quantum advantage. Spectral analysis of the interferometric outputs reveals that quantum correlations do not increase the amplitude of the modulation peak, but instead lower the associated noise floor, resulting in the expected 3 dB improvement in signal-to-noise ratio. This enhancement persists in the sub-shot-noise regime, where the classical signal becomes buried in the spectral background while the two-photon contribution remains resolvable. These observations establish Fourier-domain quantum super-sensitivity as an operational and broadly applicable resource for precision interferometric sensing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.16368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present a logical formalism for reasoning about quantum systems in finite dimension. Contrary to the usual approach in quantum logic, our formalism is based classical first-order logic, which allows us to use the tools of model theory in our study. In particular, we show that our formal theory is complete, meaning that it entirely determines the behaviour of quantum systems. Moreover, we provide a characterization of the models of our formal theory, thus providing new insights in the study of hidden variable models of quantum theory.</description>

      <title>Why the Casimir Force for Magnetic Metals Computed by the Lifshitz Theory Using the Drude Model Disagrees with the Measurement Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Casimir force in configurations with magnetic metal plates and analyze the reasons why the predictions of the Lifshitz theory using the dielectric permittivity of the Drude model are inconsistent with the measurement data. For this purpose, the contributions of the electromagnetic waves with the transverse magnetic and transverse electric polarizations to the Casimir force are computed using the Lifshitz theory expressed in terms of the pure imaginary Matsubara frequencies. Furthermore, the fractions of the evanescent and propagating waves in these contributions are found using an equivalent formulation of the Lifshitz theory along the real frequency axis. All computations are performed for Au-Ni and Ni-Ni plates using the Drude model and the experimentally consistent plasma model over the separation region from 0.5 to 6~mum, where the total force value is determined by conduction electrons. It is shown that the transverse magnetic contribution to the Casimir force does not depend on the used model of the dielectric permittivity, so that the total difference between the predictions of the Lifshitz theory using the Drude model and the measurement data is determined by the transverse electric contribution. In doing so, as opposed to the case of nonmagnetic metals, both fractions of the evanescent and propagating waves in this contribution depend on the model of the dielectric permittivity used in computations, whereas the magnetic properties of the plate metal influence the Casimir force solely through the fraction of propagating waves in the transverse electric contribution. The issue of a more adequate theoretical description of the electromagnetic response of magnetic metals is discussed.</description>

      <title>Solving the Mysteries of Quantum Mechanics: Why Nature Abhors a Continuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Feynman famously asserted that interference is the only real mystery in quantum mechanics (QM). It is concluded that the reason for this mystery, and thereby the related mysteries of complementarity, non-commutativity of observables, the uncertainty principle and violation of Bell's equality, is that the axioms of QM depend vitally on the continuum nature of Hilbert Space, deemed unphysical. We develop a theory of quantum physics - Rational Quantum Mechanics (RaQM) - in which Hilbert Space is gravitationally discretised. The key to solving the mysteries of QM in RaQM is a number-theoretic property of the cosine function, concealed in QM when angles range over the continuum. This number-theoretic property describes mathematically the utter indivisibility of the quantum world and implies that the laws of physics are profoundly holistic. We contrast holism with nonlocality. In theories which embrace the continuum, the violation of Bell's inequality requires the laws of physics to be either nonlocal or not realistic; both incomprehensible concepts. By contrast, holism, as embodied in Mach's Principle or in the fractal geometry of a chaotic attractor, is neither incomprehensible nor unphysical. As part of this, we solve the deepest mystery of all; why nature makes use of complex numbers.</description>

      <title>Enhancing delocalization and entanglement in asymmetric discrete-time quantum walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the enhancement of delocalization and coin-position entanglement in asymmetric discrete-time quantum walks (DTQWs). The asymmetry results from asymmetric coin operations, asymmetric initial states, and asymmetric polarization-dependent losses. By varying these asymmetry factors, the inverse participation ratio and entanglement entropy of the walker are numerically calculated for different coin and loss parameters, both for symmetric and asymmetric initial states. We then experimentally implement a 16-step asymmetric DTQW using a time-multiplexing fiber loop structure. By choosing an asymmetric initial state, both coin-position entanglement and delocalization are simultaneously enhanced under specific coin parameters. Moreover, we observe that with finite asymmetric polarization-dependent loss, the photon probability on the left side decreases significantly, while that on the right side increases and becomes more localized. Interestingly, under specific coin parameters, the entanglement and delocalization exhibit improved robustness against polarization-dependent loss. These results demonstrate that the DTQWs constitute an ideal platform for investigating photonic delocalization and hybrid entanglement.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.16413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Preparing subradiant steady states of collectively emitting quantum two-level emitters (TLEs) is hindered by their dark, weakly interacting nature. Existing approaches rely on patterned driving, local control, or structured environments. We propose a platform-independent protocol based on projective measurements on a single TLE. For permutation-symmetric ensembles, a single measurement yields appreciable occupation of single-excitation subradiant steady states. For generic arrays, repeated measurements on one emitter drive the unmeasured TLEs into a nearly pure state with large overlap with the subradiant Dicke subspace.</description>

      <title>Nonlocal prediction of quantum measurement outcomes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define nonlocal predictability as how well one observer can predict another's measurement outcomes without classical communication, given full knowledge of the shared quantum state and measurement settings. The local bound on nonlocal predictability is defined as the maximum probability with which one observer can correctly predict the other's measurement outcome prior to measurement. We show that product states always meet this bound, while all pure entangled states and some classically correlated states can exceed it. This demonstrates a nonlocal phenomenon since the predictability of measurement outcomes increases after the measurement. Perfect nonlocal predictability for arbitrary projective measurements occurs only for maximally entangled states among all pure states, underscoring their special role. Comparing pure entangled states with their dephased versions, we find that dephasing on one subsystem can enhance nonlocal predictability for a broad class of states and measurements - a counterintuitive, noise-induced advantage that vanishes for maximally entangled states under any projective measurement.</description>

      <title>Edge states and quantum optical high-harmonic generation from topological insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The strong-field process of high-harmonic generation (HHG) has, in recent years, been treated from a quantum optical perspective in the emerging research area of strong-field quantum optics. These investigations show that HHG radiation is, in general, in a nonclassical state of light. However, the quantum optical treatment of HHG from topological nontrivial materials is missing. Here, we aim to address this gap in current knowledge and consider the quantum optical HHG response from the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model, a finite chain of atoms with both a topologically trivial and nontrivial insulating phase, the latter supporting edge states. We find that HHG from both topological phases is squeezed at the band-gap frequency. Interestingly, while the harmonic spectrum discriminates the two topological phases of the system, the degree of squeezing only discriminates the phases for smaller chain lengths. We attribute this difference to a relative increase in overlap between bulk and edge states in the topological nontrivial phase for smaller systems. Our findings reveal how the strength of dipole couplings governs the nonclassical HHG response and define new research questions on topologically protected generation of quantum light in strong-field physics.</description>

      <title>Quantitative study of Silicon Waveguides for the Generation of Quantum Correlated Photon Pairs Bridging Mid-Infrared and Telecom Bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sources of quantum correlated photons pairs bridging the 3um-4um Mid-infrared (MIR) band and Telecom/Near-Infrared/Visible band are of high importance for quantum technologies. Spontaneous Parametric Down Conversion is generally used for realizing such sources, but requires costly implementation platforms with reduced versatility. Here, we explore the potentialities of Spontaneous Four-Wave Mixing (SFWM) in all-solid Silicon On Insulator (SOI) waveguides thanks to an experimentally validated model and propose designs ensuring the production of correlated photon pairs bridging the 3um-4um Mid-infrared band and Telecom C-band. Choosing a pump with a wavelength in the range 2100nm-2210nm and a pulse duration of 5ps, we quantitatively performed simulations targeting a probability of photon pair generation per pulse of 0.05, and we found realistic conditions of utilization (2cm-length straight waveguides, intra-modal Four Wave Mixing with the fundamental TE00 mode) with a pump peak power in between 9.2mW and 32mW. A first design (wCOM) reaches a signal wavelength as high as 3.905um, which is situated in an atmospheric transparency window, while maintaining an idler in the Telecom C-band, making it of high interest for atmospheric Quantum Key Distribution. Two other designs wCH4 and wNO2 aim precise CH4 and NO2 gas sensing with a signal wavelength of 3265nm and 3461nm respectively. In terms of signal/idler wavelength separation, wCOM attains the value of 2364nm which is well above the current record of ~1125nm obtained in quantum regime with SFWM in all-solid SOI waveguides.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium Casimir-Polder Force: Motion-induced Thermal-like Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Casimir-Polder force is analyzed when an atom is moving at a constant velocity relative to a collection of translationally invariant macroscopic bodies with generic shapes and compositions. The interaction is described within an approach that accurately treats the atom-field coupling and accounts for the backaction from the environment onto the moving particle. Previously overlooked aspects are uncovered and linked to the nonequilibrium and nonconservative nature of the interaction. Specifically, we examine a behavior that can be understood by characterizing the underlying physical processes in terms of a motional-induced effective temperature. This phenomenon shares similarities with the Fulling-Davies-Unruh effect, opening new perspectives for the understanding of nonequilibrium physics at work in the system.</description>

      <title>Port-based teleportation under pure-dephasing decoherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study deterministic port based teleportation in the presence of noise affecting both the entangled resource state and the measurement process. We focus on a physically motivated model in which each Bell pair constituting the resource interacts with an identical local environment, corresponding to independently distributed entangled links. Two noisy scenarios are analyzed: one with decoherence acting solely on the resource state and ideal measurements, and another with noisy, noise adapted measurements optimised for the given noise model. In the first case, we derive an analytical lower bound and later a closed-form expression for the entanglement fidelity of the teleportation channel and analyze its asymptotic behaviour. In the second, we combine semi analytical and numerical methods. Surprisingly, we find that noise-adapted measurements perform worse than the noiseless ones. To connect the abstract noise description with microscopic physics, we embed the protocol in a spin boson model and investigate the influence of bath memory and temperature on the teleportation fidelity, highlighting qualitative differences between different environments.</description>

      <title>Bichromatic Quantum Teleportation of Weak Coherent Polarization States on a Metropolitan Fiber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As quantum technologies mature, telecommunication operators have a clear opportunity to unlock and scale new services by providing the connectivity layer that links quantum computers, sensors, clocks, and other quantum devices. Realizing this opportunity requires demonstrating quantum networking protocols, including quantum teleportation, under real-world conditions on existing telecom infrastructure. In this work, we demonstrate quantum teleportation over Deutsche Telekom's metropolitan fiber testbed in Berlin using commercial components deployed at the telecom datacenter. A local Bell-state measurement between 795 nm photons from a weak coherent source and from a bichromatic warm-atom entangled photon source enables conditional state transfer onto an O-band photon, which is transmitted through a 30-km field-deployed fiber loop under real-world environmental conditions. The teleported state is reconstructed after propagation via state tomography, achieving an average teleportation fidelity of 90\% on the deployed link. System performance is evaluated in both the absence and the presence of co-propagating C-band classical traffic within the same fiber, demonstrating compatibility with wavelength-division multiplexed telecom infrastructure carrying live data channels.</description>

      <title>Beyond the Classical Ceiling: Multi-Layer Fully-Connected Variational Quantum Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Standard Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs) struggle to scale to high-dimensional data due to the ``curse of dimensionality,'' which manifests as exponential simulation costs ($\mathcal{O}(2^d)$) and untrainable Barren Plateaus. Existing solutions often bypass this by relying on classical neural networks for feature compression, obscuring the true quantum capability. In this work, we propose the \textbf{Multi-Layer Fully-Connected VQC (FC-VQC)}, a modular architecture that performs \textbf{end-to-end quantum learning} without trainable classical encoders. By restricting local Hilbert space dimensions while enabling global feature interaction via structured block mixing, our framework achieves \textbf{linear scalability $\mathcal{O}(d)$}. We empirically validate this approach on standard benchmarks and a high-dimensional industrial task: \textbf{300-asset Option Portfolio Pricing}. In this regime, the FC-VQC breaks the ``Classical Ceiling,'' outperforming state-of-the-art Gradient Boosting baselines (XGBoost/CatBoost) while exhibiting \textbf{$\approx 17\times$ greater parameter efficiency} than Deep Neural Networks. These results provide concrete evidence that pure, modular quantum architectures can effectively learn industrial-scale feature spaces that are intractable for monolithic ansatzes.</description>

      <title>Amplification of bosonic interactions through squeezing in the presence of decoherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the amplification of bosonic interactions through parametric control that implements squeezing along orthogonal quadratures. We show that bosonic interactions described by certain classes of quadratic and quartic Hamiltonians can be enhanced in this way while simultaneously overcoming noise and decoherence. In general, the amplification method enhances both desired and undesired interactions present in the system. Depending on the case, however, detrimental processes can be less amplified than the desired couplings. We leverage this observation to improve the fidelity for preparing Bell-type entangled states between two bosonic modes in the presence of noise and losses. We also investigate noise models for which the protocol either fails or partially achieves a loss-tolerant state preparation speedup. Our work facilitates faster preparation of complex quantum states and implementation of entangling gates in the presence of decoherence mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Intermodal quantum key distribution over an 18 km free-space channel with adaptive optics and room-temperature detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intermodal quantum key distribution at telecom wavelengths provides a hybrid interface between fiber connections and free-space links, both essential for the realization of scalable and interoperable quantum networks. Although demonstrated over short-range free-space links, long-distance implementations of intermodal quantum key distribution remain challenging, due to turbulence-induced wavefront aberrations which limit efficient single-mode fiber coupling at the optical receiver. Here, we demonstrate a real-time intermodal quantum key distribution field trial over an 18 km free-space link, connecting a remote terminal to an urban optical ground station equipped with a 40 cm-class telescope. An adaptive optics system, implementing direct wavefront sensing and high-order aberration correction, enables efficient single-mode fiber coupling and allows secure key generation of 200 bit/s using a compact state analyzer equipped with room-temperature detectors. We further validate through experimental data a turbulence-based model for predicting fiber coupling efficiency, providing practical design guidelines for future intermodal quantum networks.</description>

      <title>Numerical study of non-relativistic quantum systems and small oscillations induced in a helically twisted geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate bound states of a non-relativistic scalar particle in a three-dimensional helically twisted (torsional) geometry, considering both the free case and the presence of external radial interactions. The dynamics is described by the Schr\"odinger equation on a curved spatial background and, when included, by minimal coupling to a magnetic vector potential incorporating an Aharonov--Bohm flux. After separation of variables, the problem reduces to a one-dimensional radial eigenvalue equation governed by an effective potential that combines torsion-induced Coulomb-like and centrifugal-like structures with magnetic/flux-dependent terms and optional model interactions. Because closed-form analytic solutions are not reliable over the parameter ranges required for systematic scans, we compute spectra and eigenfunctions numerically by formulating the radial equation as a self-adjoint Sturm--Liouville problem and solving it with a finite-difference discretization on a truncated radial domain, with explicit convergence control. We analyze four representative scenarios: (i) no external potential, (ii) Cornell-type confinement, (iii) Kratzer-type interaction, and (iv) the small-oscillation regime around the minimum of a Morse potential. We present systematic trends of the low-lying levels as functions of the torsion parameter, magnetic field, and azimuthal sector, and we show that geometric couplings alone can produce effective confinement even in the absence of an external interaction.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Inspired Tensor Networks for Approximating PDE Flow Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate quantum-inspired tensor networks (QTNs) for approximating flow maps of hydrodynamic partial differential equations (PDEs). Motivated by the effective low-rank structure that emerges after tensorization of discretized transport and diffusion dynamics, we encode PDE states as matrix product states (MPS) and represent the evolution operator as a structured low-rank matrix product operator (MPO) in tensor-train form (e.g., arising from finite-difference discretizations assembled in MPO form). The MPO is applied directly in MPS form, and rank growth is controlled via canonicalization and SVD-based truncation after each step. We provide theoretical context through standard matrix product properties, including exact MPS representability bounds, local optimality of SVD truncation, and a Lipschitz-type multi-step error propagation estimate. Experiments on one- and two-dimensional linear advection-diffusion and nonlinear viscous Burgers equations demonstrate accurate short-horizon prediction, favorable scaling in smooth diffusive regimes, and error growth in nonlinear multi-step predictions.</description>

      <title>Gaussian continuous tensor network states: short-distance properties and imaginary-time evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15987v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study Gaussian continuous tensor network states (GCTNS) - a finitely-parameterized subclass of Gaussian states admitting an interpretation as continuum limits of discrete tensor network states. We show that, at short distance, GCTNS correspond to free Lifshitz vacua, establishing a connection between certain entanglement properties of the two. Two schemes to approximate ground states of (free) bosonic field theories using GCTNS are presented: rational approximants to the exact dispersion relation and Trotterized imaginary-time evolution. We apply them to Klein-Gordon theory and characterize the resulting approximations, identifying the energy scales at which deviations from the target theory appear. These results provide a simple and analytically controlled setting to assess the strengths and limitations of GCTNS as variational ans\"atze for relativistic quantum fields.</description>

      <title>DistributedEstimator: Distributed Training of Quantum Neural Networks via Circuit Cutting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Circuit cutting decomposes a large quantum circuit into a collection of smaller subcircuits. The outputs of these subcircuits are then classically reconstructed to recover the original expectation values. While prior work characterises cutting overhead largely in terms of subcircuit counts and sampling complexity, its end-to-end impact on iterative, estimator-driven training pipelines remains insufficiently measured from a systems perspective. In this paper, we propose a cut-aware estimator execution pipeline that treats circuit cutting as a staged distributed workload and instruments each estimator query into partitioning, subexperiment generation, parallel execution, and classical reconstruction phases. Using logged runtime traces and learning outcomes on two binary classification workloads (Iris and MNIST), we quantify cutting overheads, scaling limits, and sensitivity to injected stragglers, and we evaluate whether accuracy and robustness are preserved under matched training budgets. Our measurements show that cutting introduces substantial end-to-end overheads that grow with the number of cuts, and that reconstruction constitutes a dominant fraction of per-query time, bounding achievable speed-up under increased parallelism. Despite these systems costs, test accuracy and robustness are preserved in the measured regimes, with configuration-dependent improvements observed in some cut settings. These results indicate that practical scaling of circuit cutting for learning workloads hinges on reducing and overlapping reconstruction and on scheduling policies that account for barrier-dominated critical paths.</description>

      <title>Where Multipartite Entanglement Localizes: The Junction Law for Genuine Multi-Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We uncover a "junction law" for genuine multipartite entanglement, suggesting that in gapped local systems multipartite entanglement is controlled and effectively localized near junctions where subsystem boundaries meet. Using the R\'enyi-2 genuine multi-entropy $\mathrm{GM}^{(\mathtt{q})}_2$ as a diagnostic of genuine $\mathtt{q}$-partite entanglement, we establish this behavior in $(2+1)$-dimensional gapped free-fermion lattices with correlation length $\xi$. For partitions with a single junction, $\mathrm{GM}^{(\mathtt{q})}_2$ exhibits a universal scaling crossover in $L/\xi$, growing for $L\ll\xi$ and saturating to a $\xi$-dependent constant for $L\gg\xi$, up to $\mathcal{O}(e^{-L/\xi})$ corrections. In sharp contrast, for partitions without a junction, $\mathrm{GM}^{(\mathtt{q})}_2$ is exponentially suppressed in $L/\xi$ and drops below numerical resolution once $L\gg\xi$. We observe the same pattern for $\mathtt{q}=3$ (tripartite) and $\mathtt{q}=4$ (quadripartite) cases, and further corroborate this localization by translating the junction at fixed system size. We also provide a geometric explanation of the junction law in holography. Altogether, these results show that in this gapped free-fermion setting genuine multipartite entanglement is localized within a correlation-length neighborhood of junctions.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning for Parameterized Quantum State Preparation: A Comparative Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend directed quantum circuit synthesis (DQCS) with reinforcement learning from purely discrete gate selection to parameterized quantum state preparation with continuous single-qubit rotations \(R_x\), \(R_y\), and \(R_z\). We compare two training regimes: a one-stage agent that jointly selects the gate type, the affected qubit(s), and the rotation angle; and a two-stage variant that first proposes a discrete circuit and subsequently optimizes the rotation angles with Adam using parameter-shift gradients. Using Gymnasium and PennyLane, we evaluate Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Advantage Actor--Critic (A2C) on systems comprising two to ten qubits and on targets of increasing complexity with \(\lambda\) ranging from one to five. Whereas A2C does not learn effective policies in this setting, PPO succeeds under stable hyperparameters (one-stage: learning rate approximately \(5\times10^{-4}\) with a self-fidelity-error threshold of 0.01; two-stage: learning rate approximately \(10^{-4}\)). Both approaches reliably reconstruct computational basis states (between 83\% and 99\% success) and Bell states (between 61\% and 77\% success). However, scalability saturates for \(\lambda\) of approximately three to four and does not extend to ten-qubit targets even at \(\lambda=2\). The two-stage method offers only marginal accuracy gains while requiring around three times the runtime. For practicality under a fixed compute budget, we therefore recommend the one-stage PPO policy, provide explicit synthesized circuits, and contrast with a classical variational baseline to outline avenues for improved scalability.</description>

      <title>Quantum Estimation Theory Limits in Neutrino Oscillation Experiments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.16534v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Measurements of the Pontecorvo-Maki-Nakagawa-Sakata (PMNS) neutrino mixing parameters have entered a precision era, enabling increasingly stringent tests of neutrino oscillations. Within the framework of quantum estimation theory, we investigate whether flavor measurements, the only observables currently accessible experimentally, are optimal for extracting the oscillation parameters. We compute the Quantum Fisher Information (QFI) and the classical Fisher Information (FI) associated with ideal flavor projections for all oscillation parameters, considering accelerator muon (anti)neutrino and reactor electron antineutrino beams propagating in vacuum. Two main results emerge. First, flavor measurements saturate the QFI at the first oscillation maximum for $\theta_{13}$, $\theta_{23}$, and $\theta_{12}$, demonstrating their information-theoretic optimality for these parameters. In contrast, they are far from optimal for $\delta_{CP}$. In particular, only a small fraction of the available information on $\delta_{CP}$ is extracted at the first maximum; the sensitivity improves at the second maximum, in line with the strategy of ESS$\nu$SB, a planned facility. Second, the QFI associated with $\delta_{CP}$ is approximately one order of magnitude smaller than that of the mixing angles, indicating that the neutrino state intrinsically encodes less information about CP violation. Nevertheless, this quantum bound lies well below current experimental uncertainties, implying that the present precision on $\delta_{CP}$ is not fundamentally limited. Our results provide a quantitative framework to disentangle fundamental from practical limitations and establish a benchmark for optimizing future neutrino facilities.</description>

      <title>MerLean: An Agentic Framework for Autoformalization in Quantum Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16554v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce MerLean, a fully automated agentic framework for autoformalization in quantum computation. MerLean extracts mathematical statements from \LaTeX{} source files, formalizes them into verified Lean~4 code built on Mathlib, and translates the result back into human-readable \LaTeX{} for semantic review. We evaluate MerLean on three theoretical quantum computing papers producing 2,050 Lean declarations from 114 statements in total. MerLean achieves end-to-end formalization on all three papers, reducing the verification burden to only the newly introduced definitions and axioms. Our results demonstrate that agentic autoformalization can scale to frontier research, offering both a practical tool for machine-verified peer review and a scalable engine for mining high-quality synthetic data to train future reasoning models. Our approach can also be generalized to any other rigorous research in mathematics and theoretical physics.</description>

Abstract: Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs) have emerged as a promising paradigm for quantum machine learning in the NISQ era. While parameter sharing in VQCs can reduce the parameter space dimensionality and potentially mitigate the barren plateau phenomenon, it introduces a complex trade-off that has been largely overlooked. This paper investigates how parameter sharing, despite creating better global optima with fewer parameters, fundamentally alters the optimization landscape through deceptive gradients -- regions where gradient information exists but systematically misleads optimizers away from global optima. Through systematic experimental analysis, we demonstrate that increasing degrees of parameter sharing generate more complex solution landscapes with heightened gradient magnitudes and measurably higher deceptiveness ratios. Our findings reveal that traditional gradient-based optimizers (Adam, SGD) show progressively degraded convergence as parameter sharing increases, with performance heavily dependent on hyperparameter selection. We introduce a novel gradient deceptiveness detection algorithm and a quantitative framework for measuring optimization difficulty in quantum circuits, establishing that while parameter sharing can improve circuit expressivity by orders of magnitude, this comes at the cost of significantly increased landscape deceptiveness. These insights provide important considerations for quantum circuit design in practical applications, highlighting the fundamental mismatch between classical optimization strategies and quantum parameter landscapes shaped by parameter sharing.</description>

      <title>Quantum Cellular Automata: The Group, the Space, and the Spectrum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.16572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over an arbitrary commutative ring $R$, we develop a theory of quantum cellular automata. We then use algebraic K-theory to construct a space $\mathbf{Q}(X)$ of quantum cellular automata (QCA) on a given metric space $X$. In most cases of interest, $\pi_0 \mathbf{Q}(X)$ classifies QCA up to quantum circuits and stabilization. Notably, the QCA spaces are related by homotopy equivalences $\mathbf{Q}(*) \simeq \Omega^n \mathbf{Q}(\mathbb{Z}^n)$ for all $n$, which shows that the classification of QCA on Euclidean lattices is given by an $\Omega$-spectrum indexed by the dimension $n$. As a corollary, we also obtain a non-connective delooping of the K-theory of Azumaya $R$-algebras, which may be of independent interests. We also include a section leading to the $\Omega$-spectrum for QCA over $C^*$-algebras with unitary circuits.</description>

      <title>On the Coupled Cluster Doubles Truncation Variety of Four Electrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16580v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend recent algebro-geometric results for coupled cluster theory of quantum many-body systems to the truncation varieties arising from the doubles approximation (CCD), focusing on the first genuinely nonlinear doubles regime of four electrons. Since this doubles truncation variety does not coincide with previously studied varieties, we initiate a systematic investigation of its basic algebro-geometric invariants. Combining theoretical and numerical results, we show that for $4$ electrons on $n\leq 12$ orbitals, the CCD truncation variety is a complete intersection of degree $2^{\binom{n-4}{4}}$. Using representation-theoretic arguments, we uncover a Pfaffian structure governing the quadratic relations that define the truncation variety for any $n$, and show that an exact tensor product factorization holds in a distinguished limit of disconnected doubles. We connect these structural results to the computation of the beryllium insertion into molecular hydrogen ({Be$\cdots$H$_2$ $\to$ H--Be--H}), a small but challenging bond formation process where multiconfigurational effects become pronounced.</description>

      <title>Entanglement negativity in decohered topological states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate universal entanglement signatures of mixed-state phases obtained by decohering pure-state topological order (TO), focusing on topological corrections to logarithmic entanglement negativity and mutual information: topological entanglement negativity (TEN) and topological mutual information (TMI). For Abelian TOs under decoherence, we develop a replica field-theory framework based on a doubled-state construction that relates TEN and TMI to the quantum dimensions of domain-wall defects between decoherence-induced topological boundary conditions, yielding general expressions in the strong-decoherence regime. We further compute TEN and TMI exactly for decohered $G$-graded string-net states, including cases with non-Abelian anyons. We interpret the results within the strong one-form-symmetry framework for mixed-state TOs: TMI probes the total quantum dimension of the emergent premodular anyon theory, whereas TEN detects only its modular part.</description>

      <title>Causal and Compositional Abstraction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.16612v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Abstracting from a low level to a more explanatory high level of description, and ideally while preserving causal structure, is fundamental to scientific practice, to causal inference problems, and to robust, efficient and interpretable AI. We present a general account of abstractions between low and high level models as natural transformations, focusing on the case of causal models. This provides a new formalisation of causal abstraction, unifying several notions in the literature, including constructive causal abstraction, Q-$\tau$ consistency, abstractions based on interchange interventions, and `distributed' causal abstractions. Our approach is formalised in terms of category theory, and uses the general notion of a compositional model with a given set of queries and semantics in a monoidal, cd- or Markov category; causal models and their queries such as interventions being special cases. We identify two basic notions of abstraction: downward abstractions mapping queries from high to low level; and upward abstractions, mapping concrete queries such as Do-interventions from low to high. Although usually presented as the latter, we show how common causal abstractions may, more fundamentally, be understood in terms of the former. Our approach also leads us to consider a new stronger notion of `component-level' abstraction, applying to the individual components of a model. In particular, this yields a novel, strengthened form of constructive causal abstraction at the mechanism-level, for which we prove characterisation results. Finally, we show that abstraction can be generalised to further compositional models, including those with a quantum semantics implemented by quantum circuits, and we take first steps in exploring abstractions between quantum compositional circuit models and high-level classical causal models as a means to explainable quantum AI.</description>

Abstract: We study the mean-field dynamics of a system of $N$ interacting bosons starting from an initially condensated state. For a broad class of mean-field Hamiltonians, including models with arbitrary bounded interactions and models with unbounded interaction potentials, we prove that the probability of having $n$ particles outside the condensate decays exponentially in $n$ for any finite evolution time. Our results strengthen previously known bounds that provide only polynomial control on the probability of having $n$ excitations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.06285v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Heisenberg limit provides a quadratic improvement over the standard quantum limit, and is the maximum quantum advantage that quantum sensors could provide over classical methods. This limit remains elusive, however, because of the inevitable presence of noise decohering quantum sensors. Namely, if infinite rounds of quantum error correction corrects any part of a quantum sensor's signal, a no-go result purports that the standard quantum limit scaling can not be exceeded using Markovian quantum error correction. We side-step this no-go result and prove that in the limit of a large number of qubits, our quantum field sensing protocol has a precision that approaches the Heisenberg limit despite a linear rate of deletion errors. This is achieved by using an optimally determined, finite number of rounds of quantum error correction married with adaptive, non-Markovian signal recovery procedures. Our protocol is based on permutation invariant quantum error correction codes, which can be designed to admit correction for a tunable number of bit-flip, phase-flip, and deletion errors. We discuss near-term implementations using quantum control assisted by coupling the spins to a common bosonic mode.</description>

      <title>Hierarchically discriminating Haar-randomness in quantum states from a black-box device</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16211v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The concept of randomness in quantum computing has been central to construct benchmarking tools, cryptographic protocols, as well as a proof of beyond classical computation. Discerning whether quantum states (or unitaries) are randomly distributed is a computational task that requires an enormous amount of quantum computational resources. This work addresses such a challenge, a hierarchical discrimination algorithm to efficiently test the if a set of states $S$ generated from a black-box quantum device with an unknown distribution is (in)compatible with a random distribution. To this end, we reduce the complexity of the problem by selecting an observable with known spectrum to study the statistical properties of its expectation values with respect to the quantum states from an unknown (black-box) quantum device. Concurrently, we use our first technical result, a connection between Haar-randomness and the Dirichlet distribution, to analytically compute Haar-random moments of the observable. Our Haar-random discriminator test is then simply to compare those statistical moments such that if $S$ fails the test it is enough to state that the quantum devices does not output randomly distributed states. Else, we can not (yet) confirm that the states follow a Haar-random distribution. We further provide extension to this algorithm by permutation- and unitary-equivalent randomization of observable at increasing computational resources, which allows us to more accurately state whether $S$ is compatible with Haar-randomness. We envision the use of the discriminator test as quantum device benchmark by discriminating if the states generated are Haar-random incompatible.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18651v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The coherence of light from independent ensembles of elementary atomic emitters plays a paramount role in diverse areas of modern optics. We demonstrate the interference of photons scattered from independent ensembles of warm atoms in atomic vapor. It relies on the feasibility of the preservation of coherence of light scattered elastically in the forward and backward directions from Doppler-broadened atomic ensembles, such that photons with chaotic photon statistics from two opposite atomic velocity groups contribute to the same detection mode. While the random phase fluctuations of the scattered light caused by a large thermal motion prevent direct observability of the interference in the detected photon rate, the stable frequency difference between photons collected from scattering off counter-propagating laser beams provides strong periodic modulation of the photon coincidence rate with the period given by the detuning of the excitation laser from the atomic resonance. The presented interferometry represents a sensitive and robust methodology for Doppler-free optical atomic and molecular spectroscopy based on photon correlation measurements on scattered light.</description>

Abstract: We present a novel waveguide design that incorporates a split-diode structure, allowing independent electrical control of transition energies of multiple emitters over a wide range with minimal loss in waveguide coupling efficiency. We use this design to systematically map out the transition from superradiant to independent emission from two quantum dots. We perform both lifetime as well as Hanbury Brown-Twiss measurements on the device, observing anti-dips in the photon coincidences indicating collective emission while at the same time observing a drop in lifetime around zero detuning, indicating superradiant behaviour. Performing both measurement types allows us to investigate detuning regions which show both superradiant rate enhancement and inter-emitter coherence, as well as regions in which correlations persist in the absence of rate enhancement.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17557v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a mixed quantum-classical framework, dubbed the Moving Born-Oppenheimer Approximation (MBOA), to describe the dynamics of slow degrees of freedom (DOFs) coupled to fast ones. As in the Born-Oppenheimer Approximation (BOA), the fast degrees of freedom adiabatically follow a state that depends on the slow ones. Unlike the BOA, this state depends on both the positions and the momenta of the slow DOFs. We study several model systems: a spin-1/2 particle and a spinful molecule moving in a spatially inhomogeneous magnetic field, and a gas of fast particles coupled to a piston. The MBOA reveals rich dynamics for the slow degree of freedom, including reflection, dynamical trapping, and mass renormalization. It also significantly modifies the state of the fast DOFs. For example, the spins in the molecule are entangled and squeezed, while the gas of fast particles develops gradients that are synchronized with the motion of the piston for a long time. The MBOA can be used to describe both classical and quantum systems and has potential applications in quantum chemistry, correlated materials, atomic physics, molecular dynamics, and quantum sensing.</description>

      <title>Quantum machine learning advantages beyond hardness of evaluation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15964v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The most general examples of quantum learning advantages involve data labeled by cryptographic or intrinsically quantum functions, where classical learners are limited by the infeasibility of evaluating the labeling functions using polynomial-sized classical circuits. While broad in scope, such results reveal little about advantages arising from the learning process itself. In cryptographic settings, further insight is possible via random-generatability - the ability to classically generate labeled data - enabling hardness proofs for identification tasks, where the goal is to identify the labeling function from a dataset, even when evaluation is classically intractable. These tasks are particularly relevant in quantum contexts, including Hamiltonian learning and identifying physically meaningful order parameters. However, for quantum functions, random-generatability is conjectured not to hold, leaving no known identification advantages in genuinely quantum regimes.
  In this work, we give the first proofs of quantum identification learning advantages under standard complexity assumptions. We confirm that quantum-hard functions are not random-generatable unless BQP is contained in the second level of the polynomial hierarchy, ruling out cryptographic-style data generation strategies. We then introduce a new approach: we show that verifiable identification - solving the identification task for valid datasets while rejecting invalid ones - is classically hard for quantum labeling functions unless BQP is in the polynomial hierarchy. Finally, we show that, for a broad class of tasks, solving the identification problem implies verifiable identification in the polynomial hierarchy. This yields our main result: a natural class of quantum identification tasks solvable by quantum learners but hard for classical learners unless BQP is in the polynomial hierarchy.</description>

      <title>Indiscernibility of quantum states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10027v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper provides a systematic study of the operational idea that a quantum ``state'' is only defined up to what can be distinguished by a chosen family of observables. Concretely, any von Neumann algebra of observables $\mathscr{M}$ induces an equivalence relation on pure and mixed states by declaring two preparations indiscernible when they give identical statistics for every observable in $\mathscr{M}$. The corresponding quotient, the \emph{Holevo space} associated with $\mathscr{M}$, is the effective (relational) state space of the experiment, explicitly dependent on the observer's available measurements.
  We analyse the resulting geometry and topology of these quotients, and prove a context-complete classical representation theorem: for every von Neumann algebra $\mathscr{M}$ there is a canonical lift $a\mapsto \widehat a$ to bounded continuous functions on the Holevo space, reproducing expectation values pointwise. In the commutative case this reduces to ordinary probability theory on the joint spectrum.
  The framework is illustrated in explicit examples, including position measurements of a free particle and polarisation measurements in the qubit, EPR, and Bell settings. In particular, in the EPR scenario, Charlie's joint observable defines a simplex of joint outcome distributions, whereas the Alice/Bob marginal viewpoint collapses the effective description to a lower-dimensional space by ``forgetting'' the correlation parameter. We show that by varying the polariser settings, the indiscernibility classes become conjugated (and generically reshuffled), and different settings are typically incompatible at the level of observable algebras.</description>

      <title>Multiparameter estimation with position-momentum correlated Gaussian probes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16742v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gaussian quantum probes have been widely used in quantum metrology and thermometry, where the goal is to estimate the temperature of an environment with which the probe interacts. It was recently shown that introducing initial position-momentum (PM) correlations in such probes can enhance the estimation precision compared to standard, uncorrelated Gaussian states. Motivated by these findings, we investigate whether PM correlations can also be advantageous in a simultaneous estimation setting, specifically, when estimating both the PM correlations themselves and the effective environment temperature that interacts with the probe. Using the Quantum Fisher Information Matrix, we derive new precision bounds for this joint estimation task. Additionally, we demonstrate that such correlations can serve as a resource to improve temperature estimation within this multiparameter context. Finally, we analyze the compatibility between the two parameters, establishing conditions under which the derived bounds can be saturated.</description>

      <title>On the Trotter Error in Many-body Quantum Dynamics with Coulomb Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22707v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Efficient simulation of many-body quantum systems is central to advances in physics, chemistry, and quantum computing, with a key question being whether the simulation cost scales polynomially with the system size. In this work, we analyze many-body quantum systems with Coulomb interactions, which are fundamental to electronic and molecular systems. We prove that Trotterization for such unbounded Hamiltonians achieves a $1/4$-order convergence rate, with explicit polynomial dependence on the number of particles. The result holds for all initial wavefunctions in the domain of the Hamiltonian, and the $1/4$-order convergence rate is optimal, as previous work has numerically demonstrated that it can be saturated by a specific initial ground state. The main challenges arise from the many-body structure and the singular nature of the Coulomb potential. Our proof strategy differs from prior state-of-the-art Trotter analyses, addressing both difficulties in a unified framework. Our analysis treats the Coulomb potential as an unbounded operator without modification or regularization, and does not rely on spatial discretization, making it compatible with both first- and second-quantized circuit constructions.</description>

      <title>Fermion-to-Fermion Low-Density Parity-Check Codes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.15323v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Simulating fermionic systems on qubit-based quantum computers often demands significant computational resources due to the requirement to map fermions to qubits. Thus, designing a fault-tolerant quantum computer that operates directly with fermions offers an effective solution to this challenge. Here, we introduce a protocol for fault-tolerant fermionic quantum computation utilizing fermion-to-fermion low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes. Our method employs a fermionic LDPC memory, which transfers its state to fermionic color code processors, where logical operations are subsequently performed. We propose using odd-weight logical Majorana operators to form the code space, serving as memory for the fermionic LDPC code, and provide an algorithm to identify these logical operators. We present examples showing that the encoding rate of fermionic codes often matches that of qubit codes, while the logical failure rate can be significantly lower than the physical error rate. Furthermore, we propose two methods for performing fermionic lattice surgery to facilitate state transfer. Finally, we simulate the dynamics of a fermionic system using our protocol, illustrating effective error suppression.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.08323v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we show that the quantum mechanical notions of density operator, positive operator-valued measure (POVM), and the Born rule, are all simultaneously encoded in the categorical notion of a natural transformation of functors. In particular, we show that given a fixed quantum system, there exists an explicit bijection from the set of density operators on the associated Hilbert space to the set of natural transformations between the canonical measurement and probability functors associated with the system, which formalize the way in which quantum effects (i.e., POVM elements) and their associated probabilities are additive with respect to a coarse-graining of measurements.</description>

      <title>Survival Probability in Quantum Conveyance: Effects of Adiabatic Tunneling and Acceleration Discontinuity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19062v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the real-time manipulation of quantum states, it is necessary to dynamically control the parameters of the system's Hamiltonian. We have studied the survival probability during the conveyance of a particle by a trapping potential, where the particle may escape from the potential well due to quantum mechanical processes. We investigate how nonadiabatic disturbances arise and identify two main ingredients. One of them is a shock-type disturbance at switching points. To transfer a particle from one place to another, it is necessary to switch on the acceleration and switch it off at the endpoint; this effect is referred to as switch disturbance. We analyze this effect and derive an analytical formula from the perspective of adiabatic theory and find that the factor due to this effect does not depend on the details of the transfer protocols. The other ingredient is adiabatic tunneling during conveyance. During conveyance, the particle is accelerated and decelerated, which induces nonadiabatic processes leading to so-called adiabatic tunneling. Taking these two types of effects into account, we show that the escape mechanisms can be described by a compact formula composed of factors representing these effects. In this paper, we quantitatively examine the survival probabilities in conveyance processes by analyzing the decay of survival probability originating from these effects. We find that the decay behavior under various acceleration protocols is almost perfectly reproduced by a combination of switch disturbance and an integral form of adiabatic tunneling. The rate of adiabatic tunneling is also obtained from an analysis assuming constant acceleration, independent of specific conveyance protocols. Therefore, once the relevant factors are determined, the survival probability for any acceleration protocol can be estimated without performing dynamical simulations for each individual case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.20466v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP) models modify the inner-product measure to ensure symmetric position or momentum operators. We show that an alternate approach to these GUPs is to symmetrize the operators rather than modifying the inner product. This preserves the standard momentum space allowing the eigenstates and maximally localized states of the modified position operator to have a standard position representation. We compare both approaches and highlight their merits.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Extended Benders Decomposition with Quantum-Classical Hybrid Solver</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.03647v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a quantum-classical hybrid method for solving large-scale mixed-integer quadratic problems (MIQP). Although extended Benders decomposition is effective for MIQP, its master problem which handles the integer and quadratic variables often becomes a computational bottleneck. To address this challenge, we integrate the D-Wave CQM solver into the decomposition framework to solve the master problem directly. Our results show that this hybrid approach efficiently yields near-optimal solutions and, for certain problem instances, achieves exponential speedups over the leading commercial classical solver. These findings highlight a promising computational strategy for tackling complex mixed-integer optimization problems.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Codes: Self-Correction from Small(er)-Set Expansion with Tunable Non-locality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07179v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optimal constructions of classical LDPC codes can be obtained by choosing the Tanner graph uniformly at random among biregular graphs. We introduce a class of codes that we call ``diffusion codes'', defined by placing each edge connecting bits and checks on some graph, and acting on that graph with a random SWAP network. By tuning the depth of the SWAP network, we can tune a tradeoff between the amount of randomness -- and hence the optimality of code parameters -- and locality with respect to the underlying graph. For diffusion codes defined on the cycle graph, if the SWAP network has depth $\sim Tn$ with $T&gt; n^{2\beta}$ for arbitrary $\beta&gt;0$, then we prove that almost surely the Tanner graph is a lossless ``smaller set'' vertex expander for small sets up size $\delta \sim \sqrt T \sim n^{\beta}$, with bounded bit and check degree. At the same time, the geometric size of the largest stabilizer is bounded by $\sqrt T$ in graph distance. We argue, based on physical intuition, that this result should hold more generally on arbitrary graphs. By taking hypergraph products of these classical codes we obtain quantum LDPC codes defined on the torus with smaller-set boundary and co-boundary expansion and the same expansion/locality tradeoffs as for the classical codes. These codes are self-correcting and admit single-shot decoding, while having the geometric size of the stabilizer growing as an arbitrarily small power law. Our proof technique establishes mixing of a random SWAP network on small subsystems at times scaling with only the subsystem size, which may be of independent interest.</description>

Abstract: Quantum chemistry and condensed matter physics are among the most promising applications of quantum computers. Further, estimating properties of a material is crucial to evaluate its industrial applications. To investigate charge distributions of weakly and strongly correlated systems we calculate Bader charges for various periodic systems by solving many-body Hamiltonians using the variational quantum eigensolver. The Hamiltonians are computed from Kohn-Sham orbitals obtained from a prior DFT calculation. We first demonstrate the accuracy of our method on various doped MgH2 supercells. Further, we show that our approach, compared to standard DFT, significantly improves the Bader charge values for strongly correlated transition metal oxides, where we take DFT+U results as a reference. The computational framework behind our many-body calculations, called Dopyqo, is made openly available as a software package.</description>

      <title>Degeneracy beyond the parity-symmetry protection in one-dimensional spinless models: The parity-violating Kerr parametric oscillator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.09164v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One-dimensional quantum systems that undergo spontaneous symmetry-breaking, having a symmetric (non-degenerate) and a broken-symmetry (doubly-degenerate) phase, have been intensely studied in different branches of physics. In most cases, the spontaneously-broken symmetry is parity. However, it is possible to obtain similar phases in systems without parity symmetry, through an antiunitary symmetry that implies a two-fold symmetry either on momentum or coordinate in the system's classical limit. To illustrate this phenomenon, we use a Kerr parametric oscillator (KPO) with one- and two-photon drives that, despite the breaking of parity symmetry, may have doubly-degenerate levels. Different realizations of squeezed KPOs convey a great deal of attention, as effective Hamiltonians for driven superconducting circuits and the occurrence of degeneracy in such systems could be of practical interest in their application to obtain protected qubits in parity-breaking setups. In addition to this, the reported spectral features strongly indicate the existence of additional symmetries in the system.</description>

Abstract: The Depolarizing channel is one of the most important noise models and constitutes a reliable benchmark for the quantum information field. In this work, we present a simple way to emulate a Depolarizing channel by exploring a maximally non separable spin-orbit mode in a compact linear optical circuit. The evolution of different states has been successfully reproduced. Our results are in excellent agreement compared with the results obtained by the spin-orbit Solovay-Kitaev decomposition for the Depolarizing channel, also presented here for the first time. Our proposal can be a powerful tool for studies of depolarizing effect.</description>

      <title>Spacetime Spins: Statistical mechanics for error correction with stabilizer circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.21991v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A powerful method for analyzing quantum error-correcting codes is to map them onto classical statistical mechanics models. Such mappings have thus far mostly focused on static codes, possibly subject to repeated syndrome measurements. Recent progress in quantum error correction, however, has prompted new paradigms where codes emerge from stabilizer circuits in spacetime -- a unifying perspective encompassing syndrome extraction circuits of static codes, dynamically generated codes, and logical operations. We show how to construct statistical mechanical models for stabilizer circuits subject to independent Pauli errors, by mapping logical equivalence class probabilities of errors to partition functions using the spacetime subsystem code formalism. We also introduce a modular language of spin diagrams for constructing the spin Hamiltonians, which we describe in detail focusing on independent circuit-level X-Z error channels. With the repetition and toric codes as examples, we use our approach to analytically rank logical error rates and thresholds between code implementations with standard and dynamic syndrome extraction circuits, describe the effect of transversal logical Clifford gates on logical error rates, and perform Monte Carlo simulations to estimate maximum likelihood thresholds. Our framework offers a universal prescription to analyze, simulate, and compare the decoding properties of any stabilizer circuit, while revealing the innate connections between dynamical quantum systems and noise-resilient phases of matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.05928v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a universal framework for simulating $N$-dimensional linear It\^o stochastic differential equations (SDEs) on quantum computers with additive or multiplicative noises. Building on a unitary dilation technique, we establish a rigorous mapping from the general linear SDEs \[ dX_t = A(t) X_t\,dt + \sum_{j=1}^J B_j(t)X_t\,dW_t^j \] to stochastic Schr\"odinger equations (SSE) on a dilated Hilbert space. Crucially, this embedding is pathwise exact in that the classical solution is recovered as a projection of the dilated quantum state for each fixed noise realization. We demonstrate that the resulting SSEs are {naturally implementable} on digital quantum processors, where the stochastic Wiener increments are encoded directly by preparing the ancillary qubits. Exploiting this physical mapping, we develop two algorithmic strategies: (1) a trajectory-based approach that uses sequential weak measurements to realize efficient stochastic integrators, including a second-order scheme, and (2) an ensemble-based approach that maps moment evolution to a deterministic Lindblad quantum master equation, enabling simulation without Monte Carlo sampling. We provide error bounds based on a stochastic light-cone analysis and validate the framework with numerical experiments.</description>

Abstract: We analyze the mixing time of open quantum systems governed by the Lindblad master equation, showing it is not only determined by the Liouvillian gap, but also the trace norm of the lowest excited state of Liouvillian superoperator. By utilizing these universal predictors of mixing time, we establish general conditions for the fast and rapid mixing respectively. Specifically, we derive rapid mixing conditions for both the strong and weak dissipation regimes, formulated as sparsity constraints on the Hamiltonian and the local Lindblad operators. Our findings provide a general framework for calculating mixing time and offer a guide for designing dissipation to achieve desired mixing speeds, which has significant implications for efficient experimental state preparation.</description>

      <title>Failure of the mean-field Hartree approximation for a bosonic many-body system with non-Hermitian Hamiltonian</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.13038v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mean-field Hartree theory is a central tool for reducing interacting many-body dynamics to an effective nonlinear one-particle evolution. This approximation has been employed also when the Hamiltonian that governs the many-body dynamics is not Hermitian. Indeed, non-Hermitian Hamiltonians model particle gain/loss or the evolution of open quantum systems between consecutive quantum jumps. Furthermore, the validity of the Hartree approximation for generic non-Hermitian Hamiltonians lies at the basis of a quantum algorithm for nonlinear differential equations. In this work, we show that this approximation can fail. We analytically solve a model of $N$ bosonic qubits with two-body interactions generated by a purely anti-Hermitian Hamiltonian, determine an analytic expression for the limit for $N\to\infty$ of the one-particle marginal state and show that such a limit does not agree with the solution of the non-Hermitian Hartree evolution equation. We further show that there exists an initial condition such that the exact one-particle marginal state undergoes a finite-time transition to a mixed state, a phenomenon that is completely absent in the case of Hermitian Hamiltonians. Our findings challenge the validity of the mean-field Hartree approximation for non-Hermitian Hamiltonians, and call for additional conditions for the validity of the mean-field regime to model the dynamics of particle gain and loss and the open-system dynamics in bosonic many-body systems.</description>

Abstract: Intrinsic randomness is generated when a quantum state is measured in any basis in which it is not diagonal. In an adversarial scenario, we quantify this randomness by the probability that a correlated eavesdropper could correctly guess the measurement outcomes. What if the eavesdropper is never wrong, but can sometimes return an inconclusive outcome? Inspired by analogous concepts in quantum state discrimination, we introduce the unambiguous randomness of a quantum state and measurement, and, relaxing the assumption of perfect accuracy, randomness with a fixed rate of inconclusive outcomes. We solve the maximal unambiguous randomness of any quantum state, optimised over all rank-one projective measurements, and find that it's proportional to the smallest eigenvalue of the state. We also solve these problems for any state and projective measurement in dimension two, as well as for an isotropically noisy state measured in an unbiased basis of any dimension. In the latter case, we find that, given a fixed amount of total noise, an eavesdropper correlated only to the noisy state is always outperformed by an eavesdropper with joint correlations to both a noisy state and a noisy measurement. In fact, we identify a critical error parameter beyond which the joint eavesdropper achieves perfect guessing probability, ruling out any possibility of private randomness.</description>

      <title>Detailed, interpretable characterization of mid-circuit measurement on a transmon qubit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03938v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mid-circuit measurements (MCMs) are critical components of the quantum error correction protocols expected to enable utility-scale quantum computing. MCMs can be modeled by quantum instruments (a type of quantum operation or process), which can be characterized self-consistently using gate set tomography. However, experimentally estimated quantum instruments are often hard to interpret or relate to device physics. We address this challenge by adapting the error generator formalism -- previously used to interpret noisy quantum gates by decomposing their error processes into physically meaningful sums of "elementary errors" -- to MCMs. We deploy our new analysis on a transmon qubit device to tease out and quantify error mechanisms including amplitude damping, readout error, and imperfect collapse. We examine in detail how the magnitudes of these errors vary with the readout pulse amplitude, recover the key features of dispersive readout predicted by theory, and show that these features can be modeled parsimoniously using a reduced model with just a few parameters.</description>

      <title>Photon entanglement-enhanced multidimensional spectroscopy of exciton correlations in photosynthetic aggregates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.05080v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nonlinear spectroscopic techniques using entangled photon pairs can provide an opportunity to exploit non-classical correlations encoded in two-photon wavefunctions to manipulate two-exciton wavefunctions. We propose an entangled photon pair-enhanced multidimensional spectroscopic technique that is sensitive to exciton-exciton interactions and correlations at the femtosecond timescale. Simulations for a dissipative system, namely, the photosynthetic aggregate reveal the superior ability of entangled photon pairs, compared to both transform-limited and frequency-chirped laser pulses, to manipulate excited-state absorption pathways.The corresponding spectral features in the two-dimensional spectrogram are interpreted in terms of one- and two-exciton resonances. The signal scales linearly with the incoming intensity of the photon sources. We show that classifying these resonances using entangled photon source in the perturbative limit allow for probing exciton correlations at the natural energy scale. These insights can be used to explore multi-exciton dynamics in molecular systems using multiphoton entanglement.</description>

      <title>Improving Ground State Accuracy of Variational Quantum Eigensolvers with Soft-coded Orthogonal Subspace Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05980v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new approach to improve the accuracy of ground state estimates in Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) algorithms by employing subspace representations with soft-coded orthogonality constraints. As in other subspace-based VQE methods, such as the Subspace-Search VQE (SSVQE) and Multistate Contracted VQE (MCVQE), once the parameters are optimized to maximize the subspace overlap with the low-energy sector of the Hamiltonian, one diagonalizes the Hamiltonian restricted to the subspace. Unlike these methods, where \emph{hard-coded} orthogonality constraints are enforced at the circuit level among the states spanning the subspace, we consider a subspace representation where orthogonality is \emph{soft-coded} via penalty terms in the cost function. We show that this representation allows for shallower quantum circuits while maintaining high fidelity when compared to single-state (standard VQE) and multi-state (SSVQE or MCVQE) representations, on two benchmark cases: a $3\times 3$ transverse-field Ising model and random realizations of the Edwards--Anderson spin-glass model on a $4\times 4$ lattice.</description>

      <title>Quantum simulation of the Dicke model in a two-dimensional ion crystal: chaos, quantum thermalization, and revivals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06114v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum many-body systems driven far from equilibrium can exhibit chaos, entanglement, and non-classical correlations, yet directly observing these phenomena in large, closed quantum systems remains challenging. Here we realize the Dicke model -- a fundamental description of light-matter interactions -- in a two-dimensional crystal of approximately 100 trapped ions. The ions' internal state is optically coupled to the center of mass vibrational mode via an optical spin-dependent force, enabling unitary many-body dynamics beyond the mean-field and few-body limits. In the integrable regime, where the phonons can be adiabatically eliminated, we observe a dynamical phase transition between ferromagnetic to paramagnetic spin phases. In contrast, when the spins and phonons are strongly coupled, we observe clear signatures of non-integrable chaotic dynamics, including erratic phase-space trajectories and the exponential growth of excitations and entanglement quantified by the one-body R\'enyi entropy. By quenching from an unstable fixed point in the near-integrable regime, quantum noise can generate correlated spin-phonon excitations. Our numerical calculations, in clear agreement with experiment, reveal the generation of two-mode spin-phonon squeezing, 2.6 dB below the standard quantum limit (4.6 dB relative to the initial thermal state), followed by generalized vacuum Rabi collapses and revivals. Our results establish large ion crystals as scalable analog quantum simulators of non-equilibrium light-matter dynamics and provide a controlled platform for experimental studies of information scrambling and entanglement in closed many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Tunable many-body burst in isolated quantum systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.09665v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thermalization in isolated quantum many-body systems can be nonmonotonic, with its process dependent on an initial state. We propose a numerical method to construct a low-entangled initial state that creates a "burst" -- a transient deviation of an observable from its thermal equilibrium value -- at a designated time. We apply this method to demonstrate that a burst of magnetization can be realized for a nonintegrable mixed-field Ising chain on a timescale comparable to the onset of quantum scrambling. Contrary to the typical spreading of information in this regime, the created burst is accompanied by a slow or even negative entanglement growth. Analytically, we show that a burst becomes probabilistically rare after a long time. Our results suggest that a nonequilibrium state is maintained for an appropriately chosen initial state until scrambling becomes dominant. These predictions can be tested with programmable quantum simulators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.15146v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum unitary synthesis addresses the problem of translating abstract quantum algorithms into sequences of hardware-executable quantum gates. Solving this task exactly is infeasible in general due to the exponential growth of the underlying combinatorial search space. Existing approaches suffer from misaligned optimization objectives, substantial training costs and limited generalization across different qubit counts. We mitigate these limitations by using supervised learning to approximate the minimum description length of residual unitaries and combining this estimate with stochastic beam search to identify near optimal gate sequences. Our method relies on a lightweight model with zero-shot generalization, substantially reducing training overhead compared to prior baselines. Across multiple benchmarks, we achieve faster wall-clock synthesis times while exceeding state-of-the-art methods in terms of success rate for complex circuits.</description>

      <title>Steady state coherence in a qubit is incompatible with a quantum map</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.15790v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the recent proposal of steady state coherences in a single qubit in the case of a composite system-bath interaction. Based on a field theoretical approach we reanalyse the issue within a Redfield description. We find that the Redfield approach in accordance with a recent proposal yields steady state coherences but also violates the properties of a quantum map yielding negative populations. The issue is resolved by applying the Lindblad equation which is in accordance with a proper quantum map. The Lindblad equation, however, also implies the absence of steady state coherence. We conclude that steady state coherence in a a qubit is incompatible with a quantum map.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15960v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider symmetry protected topological (SPT) phases with finite non-invertible symmetry $\mathcal{C}$ in 1+1d. In particular, we investigate interfaces and parameterized families of them within the framework of matrix product states. After revealing how to extract the $\mathcal{C}$-SPT invariant, we identify the algebraic structure of symmetry operators acting on the interface of two $\mathcal{C}$-SPT phases. By studying the representation theory of this algebra, we show that there must be a degenerate interface mode between different $\mathcal{C}$-SPT phases. This result generalizes the bulk-boundary correspondence for ordinary SPT phases. We then propose the classification of one-parameter families of $\mathcal{C}$-SPT states based on the explicit construction of invariants of such families. Our invariant is identified with a non-abelian generalization of the Thouless charge pump, which is the pump of a local excitation within a $\mathcal{C}$-SPT phase. Finally, by generalizing the results for one-parameter families of SPT phases, we conjecture the classification of general parameterized families of general gapped phases with finite non-invertible symmetries in both 1+1d and higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>How Subradiance Enables Nonlinearity in Weakly Driven Quantum Arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01386v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Harnessing the nonlinear response of a medium is essential for applications including frequency conversion and light amplification, as well as for the generation of quantum many-body correlations of light or matter. However, achieving these effects typically requires high drive intensities and thick samples, which induce undesired heating effects that typically suppress quantum correlations. In this work, we demonstrate that atom-thin arrays of quantum emitters exhibit a robust nonlinear response even at arbitrarily weak drive intensities. This discovery challenges the long-held assumption that weakly driven ensembles behave classically; instead, we reveal that subradiant states provide a dominant nonlinear contribution that persists in the low-intensity limit. Using a Dynamical Mean-Field Theory (DMFT) approach, we predict that these nonlinearities generate a quantum-correlated steady state composed of interacting pairs of subradiant excitations, characterized by long-range correlations and multi-mode squeezing. Our findings establish a new frontier for nonlinear quantum optics at minimal power, and provide a scalable protocol for preparing multimode squeezing, offering potential for applications in quantum metrology.</description>

      <title>Low Photon Number Non-Invasive Imaging Through Time-Varying Diffusers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18072v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optical imaging plays a crucial role in advancing science and technology, enabling applications in fields ranging from biomedicine to astronomy. However, imaging through scattering media such as biological tissues, fog, or turbulent atmosphere remains a major challenge. Light scattering and absorption in such media make imaging challenging; in the case of time varying scatterers and low-light regime imaging has not been demonstrated so far. We present the first demonstration of non-invasive imaging of dim objects hidden behind dynamic scattering layers, obtaining robust reconstruction even at extremely low photon counts per frame. We achieve this by developing a new data-processing approach. In our experiment, we utilize a photon number resolving camera to capture a sequence of frames, containing on average, less than one photon per pixel. We validate our approach in microscopy, where we reconstruct images of biological samples stained with standard fluorescent dyes. Beyond microscopy, our approach can be applied in LIDAR systems for imaging through fog, and endoscopy using multimode and multicore fibers.</description>

Abstract: The confinement of electromagnetic radiation within extremely small volumes offers an effective means to significantly enhance light-matter interactions, to the extent that zero-point quantum vacuum fluctuations can influence and control the properties of materials. Here, we develop a theoretical framework for the quantum electrodynamics of graphene Landau levels embedded in a deep subwavelength hyperbolic cavity, where light is confined into ultrasmall mode volumes. By studying the spectrum, we discuss the emergence of polaritons, and disentangle the contributions of resonant quantum vacuum effects from those of purely electrostatic interactions. Finally, we study the hybridization between magnetoplasmons and the cavity's electromagnetic modes.</description>

Abstract: Quantum simulations of lattice gauge theories offer the potential to directly study the non-perturbative dynamics of quantum chromodynamics, but naive analyses suggest that they require large computational resources. Large $N_c$ expansions are performed to order 1/$N_c$ to simplify the Hamiltonian of pure SU($N_c$) lattice gauge theories. A reformulation of the electric basis is introduced with a truncation strategy based on the construction of local Krylov subspaces with plaquette operators. Numerical simulations show that these truncated Hamiltonians are consistent with traditional lattice calculations at relatively small couplings. It is shown that the computational resources required for quantum simulation of time evolution generated by these Hamiltonians is 17-19 orders of magnitude smaller than previous approaches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02468v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, there were works claiming that path integral quantisation of gauge theories necessarily requires relaxation of Lagrangian constraints. As has also been noted in the literature, it is of course wrong since there perfectly exist gauge field quantisations respecting the constraints, and at the same time the very idea of changing the classical theory in this way has many times appeared in other works. On the other hand, what was done in the path integral approach is fixing a gauge in terms of zero-momentum variables. We would like to show that this relaxation is what normally happens when one fixes such a gauge at the level of action principle in a Lagrangian theory. Moreover, there is an interesting analogy to be drawn. Namely, one of the ways to quantise a gauge theory is to build an extended Hamiltonian and then add new conditions by hand such as to make it a second class system. The constraints' relaxation occurs when one does the same at the level of the total Hamiltonian, i.e. a second class system with the primary constraints only.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07476v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the coherence of mixed Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) and W states for bosonic and fermionic fields when a subset of $n$ ($n&lt;N$) qubits experiences Hawking radiation near a Schwarzschild black hole. Analytical expressions are derived for the coherence of mixed N-qubit systems, including both the physically accessible and inaccessible parts in curved spacetime. The results show that the mixed W state maintains its coherence more effectively than the GHZ state as the Hawking temperature increases, even though its entanglement is weaker. As the number of qubits grows, W-state coherence becomes increasingly resistant to gravitational decoherence. Furthermore, fermionic fields preserve stronger entanglement, while bosonic fields retain higher coherence, highlighting a clear contrast between different particle statistics. These findings demonstrate how the Schwarzschild spacetime reshapes the balance between quantum coherence and entanglement, offering guidance for future relativistic quantum information applications.</description>

      <title>Resonating Valence Bond Ground States on Corner-sharing Simplices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10471v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Hubbard model in the $U\to\infty$ limit has been known to have resonating valence bond (RVB) ground states on certain corner-sharing simplex lattices. Examples include both the quasi-1D sawtooth lattice with open boundary and a larger class of higher dimensional lattices without boundaries. The two types of results were obtained by different approaches which do not apply to one another. In the second class of lattices, the simplest simplex is a tetrahedron. We hereby generalize both results by studying the singly hole-doped system on the quasi-1D lattice of a tetrahedron chain, which can be considered a stripe of the pyrochlore or checkerboard lattices. The energy level ordering of irreducible representations of each tetrahedron shows that a chain of them has exponentially degenerate partial RVB or dimer-monomer ground states where each tetrahedron hosts one spin-$1/2$ monomer and one spin-$0$ dimer. The exact ground states in the infinitely long chain limit are analytically solved by introducing basis transformations between local Hilbert spaces of neighboring tetrahedra, and its energy agrees with the extrapolation of numerical exact diagonalization results of finite sized systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum Entanglement Index in String Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15939v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define a notion of `quantum entanglement index' with the aim to compute it for black hole horizons in string theory at one-loop order using the stringy replica method. We consider the horizon of BTZ black holes to construct the relevant conical orbifolds, labeled by an odd integer $N$, and compute the partition function as a function of $N$, corresponding to the fractional indexed R\'enyi entropy. We show that it is free of tachyons and naturally finite both in the ultraviolet and the infrared, even though it is generically ultraviolet divergent in the field theory limit. Thus, the index provides a useful diagnostic of the entanglement structure of string theory without the need for analytic continuation in $N$.</description>

      <title>Impact of space-time curvature coupling on the vacuum energy induced by a magnetic topological defect in flat space-time of arbitrary dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06815v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have investigated vacuum polarization of a quantized charged massive scalar field in the presence of a magnetic topological defect, modeled as an impenetrable tube of finite thickness carrying magnetic flux. At the tube's surface, we imposed a general Robin boundary condition. Our analysis demonstrates that, in flat space-time, the total induced vacuum energy is independent of the coupling $\xi$ of the scalar field's interaction with the space-time curvature only in the special cases of Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions. For general Robin boundary conditions, however, the total induced vacuum energy depends on the coupling $\xi$ in a flat space-time and exhibits a nontrivial dependence on the parameter of the Robin boundary condition. We investigated the dependence of this effect not only on Robin's boundary condition parameter, but also on the tube thickness and the space-time dimensionality. We conclude that careful measurements of vacuum polarization effects in flat space-time may, in principle, provide an independent way to probe the $\xi$ coupling.</description>

Abstract: A generalization of the coadjoint orbit action describes the dynamics of an observer (or instrument). We consider how this fits in with the view of observables in field theory being correlations of read-outs of instruments and show how one recovers the usual $S$-matrix formulae. A simple resolution of the Fermi paradox is also pointed out.</description>

      <title>Effects of intertube dipole-dipole interactions in nearly integrable one-dimensional $^{162}$Dy gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05212v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the effects of the intertube dipole-dipole interactions (DDI) in recent experiments with arrays of nearly integrable one-dimensional (1D) dipolar Bose gases of $^{162}$Dy atoms. An earlier theoretical modeling ignored those interactions, which we include here via a modification of the 1D confining potentials. We investigate the effects of the intertube DDI both during the state preparation and during the measurements of the rapidity distributions. We explore how the strength of the contact interactions and the magnetic field angles modify the intertube DDI corrections. We find that those corrections slightly change both the properties of the equilibrium state and the rapidity measurements. Remarkably, however, the changes nearly cancel each other, resulting in measured rapidity distributions that are very close to those predicted in the absence of the intertube DDI.</description>

      <title>Anderson localization: A view from Krylov space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26920v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Krylov subspace expansion is a workhorse method for sparse numerics that has been increasingly explored as source of physical insight into many-body dynamics in recent years. In this work we revisit the venerable Anderson model of localization in dimensions $d=1, 2, 3, 4$ to construct local integrals of motion (LIOM) in Krylov space. These appear as zero eigenvalue edge states of an effective hopping problem in the Krylov superoperator subspace and can be analytically constructed given the Lanczos coefficients. We exploit this idea, focusing on $d=3$, to study the manifestation of the disorder driven Anderson transition in the anatomy of LIOMs. We find that the increasing complexity of the Krylov operators results in a suppression of the fluctuations of the Lanczos coefficients. As such, one can study the phenomenology of the integrals of motion in the disorder averaged Krylov chain. We find edge states localized on vanishing fraction of Krylov space (of dimension $D_K=V^2$ for cubes of volume $V$), both in localized and extended phases. Importantly, in the localized phase, disorder induces powerlaw decaying dimerization in the (Krylov) hopping problem, producing stretched exponential decay of the LIOMs in Krylov space with a stretching exponent $1/2d$. Metallic LIOMs are completely delocalized albeit across only $\propto \sqrt{D_K}$ states. Critical LIOMs exhibit powerlaw decay with an exponent matching the expected value of $0.29$.</description>

      <title>A Versatile Variational Quantum Kernel Framework for Non-Trivial Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10831v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum kernel methods are a promising branch of quantum machine learning, yet their effectiveness on diverse, high-dimensional, real-world data remains unverified. Current research has largely been limited to low-dimensional or synthetic datasets, preventing a thorough evaluation of their potential. To address this gap, we developed an algorithmic framework for variational quantum kernels utilizing resource-efficient ans\"atze for complex classification tasks and introduced a parameter scaling technique to accelerate convergence. We conducted a comprehensive benchmark of this framework on eight challenging, real-world and high-dimensional datasets covering tabular, image, time series, and graph data. Our results show that the proposed quantum kernels demonstrate competitive classification accuracy compared to standard classical kernels in classical simulation, such as the radial basis function (RBF) kernel. This work demonstrates that properly designed quantum kernels can function as versatile, high-performance tools, laying a foundation for quantum-enhanced applications in real-world machine learning. Further research is needed to fully assess the practical performance of quantum methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.03363v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) deployed over quantum enabled and heterogeneous classical networks faces significant performance degradation due to uneven client quality, stochastic teleportation fidelity, device instability, and geometric mismatch between local and global models. Classical aggregation rules assume euclidean topology and uniform communication reliability, limiting their suitability for emerging quantum federated systems. This paper introduces A2G (Adaptive Aggregation with Two Gains), a dual gain framework that jointly regulates geometric blending through a geometry gain and modulates client importance using a QoS gain derived from teleportation fidelity, latency, and instability.</description>

      <title>Coherent-state boundary conditions as the first-principles origin of background fields in QED</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21122v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: QED formulated in prescribed classical background electromagnetic fields is a standard framework for strong-field and laser\textendash matter interactions. It is usually treated as a theory modified by externally imposed fields, obscuring its precise relation to full QED and, in particular, the role of asymptotic boundary conditions for the gauge field. Starting from an operator-based formulation, we show that QED with background fields is not a distinct theory but arises as a well-defined boundary-condition limit of full QED, in which the classical background field emerges from coherent-state boundary conditions on the quantized electromagnetic field. In this limit, the conventional generating functional used in calculations with prescribed background fields is recovered naturally, while relaxing the boundary conditions allows depletion and backreaction effects to be incorporated within the same framework. The central new result is a rigorous operator-level proof of the equivalence between the fixed background-field approximation and coherent-state asymptotic boundary conditions\textemdash a formulation that, to our knowledge, has not been made explicit in previous approaches. We further demonstrate that the apparent time dependence of background fields does not originate from an explicitly time-dependent Hamiltonian, but instead reflects the choice of picture\textemdash Schr\"{o}dinger versus Heisenberg\textemdash in the underlying quantum theory. Rather than introducing new properties of coherent states, our analysis provides a first-principles reinterpretation of the fixed background-field approximation as a controlled and picture-dependent limit of full QED.</description>

      <title>Giant bubbles of Fisher zeros in the quantum XY chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05899v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate an alternative approach based on complex-valued inverse temperature and partition function to probe quantum phases of matter with nontrivial spectra and dynamics. It leverages thermofield dynamics (TFD) to quantitatively characterize quantum and thermal fluctuations, and exploit the correspondence between low-energy excitations and Fisher zeros. Using the quantum XY chain in an external field as a testbed, we show that the oscillatory gap behavior manifests as oscillations in the long-time dynamics of the TFD spectral form factor. We also identify giant bubbles, i.e. large-scale closed lines, of Fisher-zeros near the gapless XX limit. They provide a characteristic energy scale that seems to contradict the predictions of the low energy theory of a featureless Luttinger liquid. We identify this energy scale and relate the motion of these giant bubbles with varying external field to the transfer of spectral weight from high to low energies. The deep connection between Fisher zeros, dynamics, and excitations opens up promising avenues for understanding the unconventional gap behaviors in strongly correlated many-body systems.</description>
