      <title>Quantum Fields on Time-Periodic AdS$_3/\mathbb{Z}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a free complex massive scalar on the quotient spacetime AdS$_3/\mathbb{Z}$, which has the isometry group SO(2,2) rather than its universal cover. This problem is of interest as a special example of QFT on a spacetime with closed timelike curves (CTCs), as a new context in which to study generalizations of AdS/CFT and for its role in celestial holography. A basis of time-periodic solutions to the Klein-Gordon wave equation is found in terms of hypergeometric functions. They fall into a PT even and a PT odd principal series representation, rather than the more familiar highest-weight representations of the cover of SO(2,2). For masses below the Breitenlohner-Freedman (BF) bound, the modes fall on the unitary principal series. The presence of CTCs precludes the usual canonical quantization, but geometric quantization, which begins with a symplectic form on the phase space of classical solutions, is applicable. Operators, commutators, an \sot invariant vacuum and a Fock space are constructed and transform like those of a CFT$_2$. The Fock space norm is positive below the BF bound. In celestial holography, AdS$_3/\mathbb{Z}$ arises as leaves of a hyperbolic foliation of Klein space. Our analysis determines new entries in the symmetry-constrained celestial bulk-to-boundary dictionary. In particular the Klein space $\mathcal{S}$-matrix is dual to a maximally entangled state in the tensor product of two copies of the 'wedge CFT$_2$' associated to the timelike and spacelike wedges of Klein space. Translation invariance is not present in the wedge CFT$_2$ itself but emerges as a property of this maximally entangled state.</description>

      <title>Topological Preparation of Non-Stabilizer States and Clifford Evolution in $SU(2)_1$ Chern-Simons Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a topological framework for preparing families of non-stabilizer states, and computing their entanglement entropies, in $SU(2)_1$ Chern-Simons theory. Using the Kac-Moody algebra, we construct Pauli and Clifford operators as path integrals over 3-manifolds with Wilson loop insertions, enabling an explicit topological realization of $W_n$ and Dicke states, as well as their entanglement properties. We further establish a correspondence between Clifford group action and modular transformations generated by Dehn twists on genus-$g$ surfaces, linking the mapping class group to quantum operations. Our results extend existing topological constructions for stabilizer states to include families of non-stabilizer states, improving the geometric interpretation of entanglement and quantum resources in topological quantum field theory.</description>

      <title>Supersymmetric $\alpha'$-corrections to the Generalized Kerr-Schild Ansatz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the supersymmetric extension of the generalized Kerr-Schild ansatz (gKSA) in Double Field Theory (DFT) including first-order $\alpha'$ corrections. Supersymmetry plays a central role in constraining higher-derivative deformations, and in this work we focus on the structure of the $\mathcal{O}(\alpha')$ Killing Spinor Equations (KSEs). Starting from the $\alpha'$-corrected supersymmetry transformations of the fermionic fields, we derive the corresponding KSEs in DFT and analyze their behavior under the gKSA. The generalized Green-Schwarz transformations impose specific constraints on the perturbations that ensure the linearization of the $\alpha'$-corrected KSEs. We then provide the explicit parameterization of the results in terms of the ten-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=1$ supergravity fields. Our construction establishes a unified framework for exploring supersymmetric backgrounds in $\alpha'$-corrected DFT and offers new tools for generating higher-derivative supergravity solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.15157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We adapt the diffusion method employed in fundamentally nonlocal field theories to determine the number of initial conditions for the classicized dynamics of unitary field theories with fakeons, characterized by inverse powers of the d'Alembertian operator $\Box$. We show that this number is two and we recover all the results obtained with a direct calculation elsewhere, including explicit solutions of linear toy models. Possible applications to nonlocal gravity are discussed.</description>

      <title>Effective string theory on a torus: the 3d Ising domain wall</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use effective string theory (EST) to describe a toroidal 2d domain wall embedded in a 3d torus. In particular, we compute the free energy of the domain wall in an expansion in inverse powers of the area, up to the second non-universal order that involves the Wilson coefficient $\gamma_3$.
  In order to test our predictions, we simulate the 3d Ising model with anti-periodic boundary conditions, using a two-step flat-histogram Monte Carlo method in an ensemble over the boundary coupling $J$
  that delivers high-precision free energy data. The predictions from EST reproduce the lattice results with only two adjustable parameters: the string tension, $1/\ell_s^2$, and $\gamma_3$. We find $\gamma_3 /|\gamma_3^{\text{min}}|= -0.82(15)$, which is compatible with previous estimates.</description>

      <title>Quantum Corrections in the Low-Temperature Fluid/Gravity Correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Attempts to construct a low-temperature version of the fluid/gravity correspondence have faced obstacles manifested in the form of logarithmic terms in the frequency, $\log(\omega)$, leading to non-local in time constitutive relations for the stress tensor and the charge current. These difficulties can be broadly presented as a breakdown of the hydrodynamic description due to additional infrared modes. We employ new quantum insights into the physics of near-extremal black holes, brought about in the context of Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity, as an effective description of quantum fluctuations in the throat, to revisit the fluid/gravity correspondence at very low temperatures. The quantum corrections naturally include a new length scale, $C$, and an effective action that parametrizes the breaking of near-horizon symmetries. We show that with an appropriate choice of order of limits in the derivative expansion within the low-temperature regime, the $\log(\omega)$ infrared divergence can be resolved. By quantum averaging the infrared Schwarzian modes as an effective extra contribution to the long-wavelength fluid modes, the resulting low-temperature effective fluid description is consistent. We present the dispersion relations for all the relevant hydrodynamic modes. We also revisit the shear viscosity to entropy density ratio and find that at very low temperatures the universal $\frac{1}{4\pi}$ bound is violated due to quantum correction.</description>

      <title>A Soft Theorem from vertex-like operators in BFSS Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive a soft theorem at leading and subleading orders within the context of BFSS matrix theory. Specifically, we consider the effective field theory describing interactions between bound states of D0-branes at leading order, which are dual to supergraviton interactions in the eleven-dimensional target space. This theory is obtained from BFSS theory by integrating out heavy degrees of freedom in the large-distance limit at one loop. As part of our analysis, we demonstrate that when treated as a one-dimensional quantum field theory with a UV cutoff, the theory is super-renormalizable and all Feynman diagrams converge. Our main result shows that the theory admits vertex-like operators with the correct quantum numbers to represent supergravitons in target space and that their correlation functions exhibit soft factorisation at both leading and subleading orders.</description>

      <title>Deconfinement-Higgs continuity in ${\rm SU(2)}$ adjoint Higgs model at finite temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the finite-temperature phase structure of the four-dimensional ${\rm SU(2)}$ adjoint Higgs model, focusing on a possible deconfinement-Higgs continuity: the conjecture that the high-temperature deconfined phase of Yang-Mills theory and the finite-temperature Higgs phase form a single thermodynamic phase. We combine three approaches: (i) global symmetry analysis, showing that Higgs and deconfined regimes are expected to share the same symmetry pattern distinct from the confined phase; (ii) a deformation analysis, which yields an explicit continuous path between ``deconfined symmetric'' and ``deconfined Higgs'' regions in a reduced three-dimensional lattice model; and (iii) Hybrid Monte Carlo analysis on $16^3\times 8$ and $12^3\times 6$ lattices, showing results suggestive of continuity. These results indicate that the Higgs and deconfined regimes can be continuously connected, while the confined phase remains distinct.</description>

      <title>Photonic Exceptional Points in Holography and QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, based on holographic confining geometries and AdS/QCD, we build the holographic dual of photonic exceptional points (EPs) of ternary coupled microrings, which makes an open, non-Hermitian quantum system. In our model, we discuss the Ferrell-Glover-Tinkham sum rule for various combinations of gain and loss systems, and specifically, based on our holographic model, we numerically find the behavior of spectra which matches exactly with the experiments. We also discuss the inhomogeneous case of a holographic lattice for three-site photonic EPs. Additionally, in our holographic model, we numerically find the behavior of phase rigidity and the Petermann factor around EPs versus various parameters of the model. We then draw connections between Kaon decay in QCD and non-Hermitian systems, which, by connections to EPs, could shed light on the behavior of strange quarks and the effects of isospin. We then find connections between recent developments in complexified, time-dependent entanglement entropy and EPs, and show how one could be studied using the behavior of the other. Finally, we connect EPs and the $\theta$-vacuum of QCD through topological structures, partition functions, and winding numbers, and find a precise second-order EP in a $\theta$-vacuum model.</description>

      <title>Chiral ring along the RG flow in 5d $\mathcal{N}=1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the Higgs branch chiral ring of a simple class of 5d theories at strong coupling. A deformation by the instanton mass implies that the chiral ring at weak coupling is renormalized by a nilpotent operator, the gaugino bilinear. Consequently, F-term equations alone do not suffice to completely determine the moduli space of vacua and perturbative non-renormalization arguments are invalidated.</description>

      <title>Topological Vertex for Symmetric matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel topological vertex formalism for 5d $\mathcal{N}=1$ SU($N$) gauge theory with a hypermultiplet in the symmetric tensor representation, whose Type IIB brane construction involves an NS5-brane attached to an O7$^+$-plane. Inspired by the identification $\mathrm{O7}^+\sim \mathbb{Z}_2 + 4 \mathrm{D7}$, we introduce two new types of vertices: the $\mathbb{Z}_2$-vertex, which implements the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ orbifold action, and the FD-vertex, which encodes the monodromy cut induced by the O7$^+$-plane. This formalism generalizes the framework presented in arXiv:2412.19655 and establishes a systematic method for computing partition functions for 5-brane configurations that incorporate an O7$^+$-plane. The resulting partition functions are expressed as sums over Young diagrams, providing a powerful computational tool for studying such gauge theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.15732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study spacetime four-point functions of chiral primary operators for superstrings propagating in AdS$_3\times S^3\times T^4$ from the worldsheet perspective, allowing for external states with arbitrary spectral flow charges. We work at small boundary cross-ratio and consider both extremal (supersymmetry-protected) and non-extremal configurations. The string correlators involve a non-trivial integration over the worldsheet moduli, and we demonstrate how the exchange of short and long strings is encoded in distinct integration regions. We interpret our results in terms of the operator product expansion in the boundary theory, and make explicit the precise matching with the available data for the relevant holographic correlators.</description>

      <title>Information-theoretic constraints in quantum gravity and cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this dissertation, we review results on quantum information constraints in gravity that are relevant to cosmological models and demonstrate how this approach sheds light on cosmological holography. Using Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity as a toy model, we establish the validity of the quantum Bousso bound and prove the restricted quantum focusing conjecture (rQFC), which is a central assumption in semiclassical gravity and holography. Interestingly, we find violations of the original QFC in this model. Building on these results, we introduce a covariant prescription for computing holographic entanglement entropy in the static patch holography description of de Sitter space and explore a generalization to closed FLRW spacetimes. This leads us to a formulation of subregion-subregion duality, where entanglement between complementary holographic theories gives rise to bulk connectivity. Causality considerations imply that entanglement wedges are bounded by surfaces that are not extremal in the usual sense, but instead satisfy an extremization with constraint. Finally, we discuss the connected wedge theorem, which establishes a relation between the causal structure of spacetime and information-theoretic constraints in the holographic dual. We argue that maintaining the consistency of static patch holography with this theorem leads to constraints on the causal structure of the dual theory. Our results suggest a novel relationship between static patch holography and the dS/CFT correspondence.</description>

      <title>Differential topology and micro-structure of black hole in Einstein-Euler-Heisenberg spacetimes with exponential entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12855v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exact black holes in the Einstein Euler-Heisenberg theory are explored with an exponential entropy framework by using the topological current $\Psi$-mapping theory. The topology classes are investigated through the canonical, mixed, and grand canonical ensembles. In particular, the magnetic charge is fixed for the canonical ensemble, whereas the magnetic potential is included for the mixed ensemble and the grand canonical ensemble with maintaining its consistency through the magnetic potential. The topological charges are analyzed for each ensemble through critical points. As a result, it is found that the canonical, mixed, and grand canonical ensembles lead to either $1$, $-1$, or no generation/annihilation points. Moreover, it is shown how temperature and heat capacity depend on the horizon radius in order to verify the stability of a black hole. Furthermore, the behavior of the thermodynamic curvatures of a black hole is investigated through the geometric methods.</description>

      <title>Higher power polyadic group rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces and systematically develops the theory of polyadic group rings, a higher arity generalization of classical group rings $\mathcal{R}[\mathsf{G}]$. We construct the fundamental operations of these structures, defining the $\mathbf{m}_{r}$-ary addition and $\mathbf{n}_{r} $-ary multiplication for a polyadic group ring $\mathrm{R}^{[\mathbf{m} _{r},\mathbf{n}_{r}]}=\mathcal{R}^{[m_{r},n_{r}]}[\mathsf{G}^{[n_{g}]}]$ built from an $(m_{r},n_{r})$-ring and an $n_{g}$-ary group. A central result is the derivation of the "quantization" conditions that interrelate these arities, governed by the arity freedom principle, which also extends to operations with higher polyadic powers. We establish key algebraic properties, including conditions for total associativity and the existence of a zero element and identity. The concepts of the polyadic augmentation map and augmentation ideal are generalized, providing a bridge to the classical theory. The framework is illustrated with explicit examples, solidifying the theoretical constructions. This work establishes a new foundation in ring theory with potential applications in cryptography and coding theory, as evidenced by recent schemes utilizing polyadic structures.</description>

Abstract: Nonthermal attractors characterize the emergent self-similar evolution of far-from-equilibrium quantum systems, from nuclear collisions to cold-atom experiments. Within the adiabatic hydrodynamization framework, the approach to the nonthermal attractor can be understood as the decay of excited states of an effective Hamiltonian. We use an exactly solvable case of the Boltzmann equation -- the longitudinally expanding overoccupied gluon plasma dominated by small-angle elastic collisions -- to map the eigenmodes in adiabatic hydrodynamization to the quasinormal mode spectrum of the nonthermal attractor. If generalized, this equivalence may be used as a discovery tool for new phenomena in out-of-equilibrium systems. A byproduct of our analysis is the analytic prescaling solutions for systems undergoing strong longitudinal expansion.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Entropy from Correlation Functions of Scalar Fields in and out of Equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15035v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that odd order R\'enyi entropies $S^{(2q+1)}$ of a system of interacting scalar fields can be calculated as the free energy of $2q+1$ replicas of the system with additional quadratic inter-replica couplings in the subsystem at the time of measurement of the entropy. These couplings replace boundary field matching conditions. This formalism works both in and out of thermal equilibrium, for closed as well as open quantum systems, and provides a general dictionary between measurable correlation functions and entanglement entropy. $S^{(2q+1)}$ can be analytically continued to calculate the von Neumann entropy $S^{\mathrm{vN}}$. We provide an exact formula relating $S^{(2q+1)}$ and $S^{\mathrm{vN}}$ with correlation functions in a non-interacting theory. For interacting theories, we provide rules for constructing all possible Feynman diagrams for $S^{(2q+1)}$. We show that the boundary matching conditions cannot be completely eliminated while calculating R\'enyi entropies of even order due to presence of zero modes in replica space.</description>

      <title>Unusual critical points between atomic insulating phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15111v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a class of quantum phase transitions between featureless bosonic atomic insulators in $(2+1)$ dimensions, where each phase exhibits neither topological order nor protected edge modes. Despite their lack of topology, these insulators may be ``obstructed'' in the sense that their Wannier centers are not pinned to the physical atomic sites. These insulators represent distinct phases, as no symmetry-preserving adiabatic path connects them. Surprisingly, we find that the critical point between these insulators can host a conformally invariant state described by quantum electrodynamics in $(2+1)$ dimensions (QED$_3$). The emergent electrodynamics at the critical point can be stabilized if the embedding of the microscopic lattice symmetries suppresses the proliferation of monopoles, suggesting that even transitions between trivial phases can harbor rich and unexpected physics. We analyze the mechanism behind this phenomenon, discuss its stability against perturbations, and explore the embedding of lattice symmetries into the continuum through anomaly matching. In all the models we analyze, we confirm that the QED$_3$ is indeed emergeable, in the sense that it is realizable from a local lattice Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>Effects of Radiative Corrections on Starobinsky Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze radiative corrections to the Starobinsky model of inflation arising from self-interactions of the inflaton, and from its Yukawa couplings, $y$, to matter fermions, and dimensionful trilinear couplings, $\kappa$, to scalar fields, which could be responsible for reheating the Universe after inflation. The inflaton self-interactions are found to be of higher order in the Hubble expansion rate during inflation, and hence unimportant for CMB observations. In contrast, matter couplings to the Starobinsky inflaton can have significant effects on the spectral index of scalar CMB perturbations, $n_s$, and on the tensor-to-scalar ratio, $r$. Using a renormalization-group improved analysis of the effective inflationary potential, we find that the Planck measurement of $n_s$ constrains the inflaton coupling to light fermions in the Einstein frame: $y &lt; 4.5 \times 10^{-4}$, corresponding to an upper limit on the reheating temperature $T_{\rm RH} &lt; 2 \times 10^{11}~{\rm GeV}$, whereas the ACT DR6 measurement of $n_s$ corresponds to $3.8 \times 10^{-4} &lt; y &lt; 5.6 \times 10^{-4}$ and $1.7 \times 10^{11} ~{\rm GeV} &lt; T_{\rm RH} &lt; 2.8 \times 10^{11}~{\rm GeV}$, while the upper limits on $r$ provide weaker constraints. Planck data also imply a constraint on a trilinear inflaton coupling to light scalars in the Einstein frame: $\kappa \leq 4 \times 10^{12}~{\rm GeV}$, corresponding to $T_{\rm RH} \leq 4.2 \times 10^{13}~{\rm GeV}$. We further present constraints on inflaton couplings to massive fermions and scalars, and analyze constraints on couplings in the Jordan frame.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic Dark Matter Bosonic Stars in regularized 4D Einstein$-$Gauss$-$Bonnet gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we have constructed anisotropic bosonic dark-matter star (DMS) solutions in the context of a regularized four-dimensional Einstein$-$Gauss$-$Bonnet (4D EGB) gravity theory. Using dimensional regularization, we solve modified Tolman$-$Oppenheimer$-$Volkoff equations for a self-interacting complex scalar field in the dilute polytropic regime, $p_r = K \rho^2$, with anisotropy parameterized as $\sigma = \beta\, p_r \left( 1 - e^{-2\lambda} \right)$. We perform a comprehensive numerical analysis across the \((\alpha,\beta)\) parameter domain, where \(\alpha \in [0,8]~\mathrm{km}^2\) and \(\beta \in [-2,0]\), to examine mass$-$radius relations and evaluate multiple stability indicators including static equilibrium \(dM/dp_c\), sound-speed causality, the radial adiabatic index \(\Gamma_r\), and energy conditions. Positive Gauss$-$Bonnet coupling enhances both the maximum mass and compactness (e.g., \(M_{\rm max} \approx 1.62\, M_\odot\) at \(\alpha=0\) rising to \(\approx 2.09\, M_\odot\) at \(\alpha = 8~\mathrm{km}^2\)), while negative anisotropy reduces them (e.g., from \(\approx 2.21\, M_\odot\) at \(\beta=0\) to \(\approx 1.73\, M_\odot\) at \(\beta = -2\)). The resulting configurations remain statically stable up to the mass peak and satisfy physical criteria. This work extends previous isotropic boson-star analyses by systematically incorporating anisotropy within a regularized 4D EGB framework. These findings provide observationally relevant predictions for compact dark-matter objects under modified gravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.15692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by an amazing integrality structure conjecture for the $U(N)$ Chern-Simons quantum invariants of framed knots investigated by Mari\~no and Vafa, a new conjectural formula, named Hecke lifting conjecture, was proposed in \cite{CLPZ23} for framed links. This note is devoted to the study of this Hecke lifting conjecture. We prove this conjecture for torus knots using the explicit formulas of colored HOMFLY-PT invariants of torus knots, and we also verify the conjecture in a limit form for any framed knots.</description>

      <title>Relativistic tidal divergences in circular orbits and the dynamics of light rings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.15705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tidal forces acting on orbiting bodies arise from inhomogeneities in the gravitational field, generating stresses that can deform or even disrupt these objects. In this work, we analyze relativistic tidal forces associated with ultracompact objects described by static and spherically symmetric spacetimes, focusing on observers in circular geodesic motion. We show that, in contrast to the case of radial geodesics, tidal forces diverge as the orbit approaches null circular geodesics. As illustrative examples, we study two uniform-density stellar models: one isotropic and another supported purely by tangential stresses. We conjecture that the divergence of tidal forces near light rings may play a role in the nonlinear stability of ultracompact, horizonless objects.</description>

      <title>Subdimensional entanglement entropy: from virtual response to mixed-state holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15766v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Entanglement entropy (EE) serves as a key diagnostic of quantum phases and phase transitions through bipartitions of the full system. However, recent studies on various topological phases of matter show that EE from bipartitions alone cannot effectively distinguish geometric from topological contributions. Motivated by this limitation, we introduce the \textit{subdimensional entanglement entropy} (SEE), defined for lower-dimensional \textit{subdimensional entanglement subsystems} (SESs), as a response theory characterizing many-body systems via \textit{virtual} deformations of SES geometry and topology. Analytical calculations for cluster states, discrete Abelian gauge theories, and fracton orders reveal distinct subleading SEE terms that sharply differentiate geometric and topological responses. Viewing the reduced density matrix on an SES as a mixed state, we establish a correspondence between stabilizers and mixed-state symmetries, identifying \textit{strong} and \textit{weak} classes. For SESs with nontrivial SEE, weak symmetries act as \textit{transparent patch operators} of the strong ones, forming robust \textit{transparent composite symmetries} (TCSs) that remain invariant under finite-depth quantum circuits and yield \textit{strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking} (SW-SSB). By bridging entanglement, mixed-state and categorical symmetries, holographic principles of topological order, and geometric-topological responses, SEE provides a unified framework that invites further theoretical and numerical exploration of correlated quantum matter.</description>

      <title>Role of exceptional points in the dynamics of the Lindblad Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The out of equilibrium dynamics of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model (SYK), comprising $N$ Majoranas with random all-to-all four-body interactions, minimally coupled to a Markovian bath modeled by the Lindblad formalism, displays intriguing nontrivial features. In particular, the decay rate towards the steady state is a non-monotonic function of the bath coupling $\mu$, and an analogue of the Loschmidt echo for dissipative quantum systems undergoes a first order dynamical phase transitions that eventually becomes a crossover for sufficiently large $\mu$. We provide evidence that these features have their origin in the presence of exceptional points in the purely real eigenvalues of the SYK Liouvillian closest to the zero eigenvalue associated with the steady state. An analytic calculation at small $N$, supported by numerical results for larger $N$, reveals that the value of $\mu \sim 0.1$ at which the exceptional point corresponding to the longest living modes occurs is close to a local maximum of the decay rate. This value marks the start of a region of anomalous equilibration where the relaxation rate diminishes as the coupling to the bath becomes stronger. Moreover, the mentioned change from transition to crossover in the Loschmidt echo occurs at a larger $\mu \sim 0.3$ corresponding with a proliferation of exceptional points in the low energy limit of the Liouvillian spectrum. We expect these features to be generic in the approach to equilibrium in quantum strongly interacting many-body Liouvillians.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.00218v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present two novel analytic AdS black hole solutions in a two-dimensional dilaton gravity theory with two scalar fields non-minimally coupled to gravity. Our solutions contain two arbitrary integration constants in the blackening factor $f(r)$, allowing for an extremal configuration. Solution I reproduces a previously reported AdS black hole when one of the integration constants in $f(r)$ vanishes. For our black hole configurations, the scalar curvature is constant and negative, corresponding to the $AdS_2$ spacetime. In order to elucidate their black hole nature, we explore the causal structure of these solutions with the aid of suitable Kruskal-like coordinates and Penrose diagrams. By employing the Hamilton-Jacobi method, we construct a boundary counter-term that renders a renormalized action with a vanishing variation. We use this finite action for the partition function in the semi-classical approximation. We establish a consistent Thermodynamics, verified by the first law, for our black hole solutions, including the extremal case. Finally, we perform a holographic analysis of the effective theory at the boundary of the black hole solution I. This theory is characterized by a Schwarzian action supplemented by a black hole mass term determined by the two integration constants in $f(r)$. We also examine the holographic implications of the boundary counter-term.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous symmetry breaking in a non-Abelian topological gauge theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.08688v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the spontaneous symmetry breaking mechanism in a non-Abelian topological gauge field theory, built from the twisted $\mathcal{N} = 2$ super-Yang-Mills theory in the presence of a Fujikawa-type potential. Specifically, by employing Fujikawa's Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin method, local degrees of freedom are released from the introduction of a potential in the trivial sector of equivariant cohomology. Such a potential displays a nontrivial vacuum solution, which induces the spontaneous symmetry breaking of the gauge symmetry together with the original fermionic scalar supersymmetry of the topological action. In this case, not only massive vector bosons emerge, but also fermionic fields with massive poles. This result shows that the introduction of a topological phase in non-Abelian gauge theories could provide a mechanism of mass generation for fermions with their masses correlated to the mass of Higgs gauge bosons ($m_B$). For the SSB in the topological case, three different vacuum directions are required. Otherwise, the supersymmetry could not be broken, and mass generation for fermions will not occur. Starting with a theory with symmetry $G = SO(N)$, to obtain a gauge theory at the end of the process, we must have $N \geq 5$. We study a particular symmetry breaking of the type $SO(5) \rightarrow SO(2)$, and obtain their fermionic propagators with mass poles $m^2_F = m^2_B = v^2$ after SSB, being $v^2 $ the energy scale introduced by the Fujikawa-type potential.</description>

      <title>Gravitationally induced decoherence of a scalar field: investigating the one-particle sector and its interplay with renormalisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12790v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the one-particle sector for the field-theoretical model of gravitationally induced decoherence for a scalar field in [1] with a special focus on the renormalisation of the one-particle master equation. In contrast to existing models in the literature, where the renormalisation is usually performed after the Markov and rotating wave approximation and often only for certain limits such as the non- or ultra-relativistic limit, here we apply the renormalisation directly after the one-particle projection. With this strategy, we show that UV-divergent contributions in the one-particle master equation can be identified with the vacuum contributions in the self-energy of the scalar field in the effective quantum field theory and depending on the chosen one-particle projection method, its vacuum bubbles, while the additional thermal contributions in the self-energy are all UV-finite. To obtain the renormalised one-particle master equation, we use an on-shell renormalisation procedure of the underlying effective QFT. We then apply the Markov and rotating wave approximation, specifying a condition under which the Markov approximation can be applied in the case of the ultra-relativistic limit. We compare our results with those available in the literature. This includes an analysis of two different kinds of one-particle projections, a comparison of the application and effects of renormalisation of quantum mechanical and field theoretical models, the non-relativistic and ultra-relativistic limits of the renormalised one-particle master equations, and a comparison with a quantum mechanical toy model for gravitationally induced decoherence in the context of neutrino oscillations.</description>

Abstract: A huge progress in studying holographic theories is that holography can be interpreted via the quantum error correction, which makes equal the entanglement wedge reconstruction, the Jafferis-Lewkowycz-Maldacena-Suh formula, the radial commutativity and the Ryu-Takayanagi formula. We call the equivalence the reconstruction theorem, whose infinite-dimensional generalization via algebraic language was believed to exclude the algebraic version of the Ryu-Takayanagi formula. However, recent developments regarding gravitational algebras have shown that the inclusion of the algebraic Ryu-Takayanagi formula is plausible. In this letter, we prove that such inclusion holds for the cases of type I/II factors, which are expected to describe holographic theories.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we present a recursive method for $\ell$-loop planar integrands in colored quantum field theories. We start with the classical equation of motion and then pick out the comb component, which will help us to define the loop kernels. Then we construct the $\ell$-loop integrands based on some recursion rules for the $\ell$-loop kernels. Finally, we reach a recursion formula for the $\ell$-loop planar integrands. Our method can be easily generalized to general quantum field theories, even non-Lagrangian theories, to obtain the planar part of the whole $\ell$-loop integrands.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00501v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One approach to analyzing entanglement in a gauge theory is embedding it into a factorized theory with edge modes on the entangling boundary. For topological quantum field theories (TQFT), this naturally leads to factorizing a TQFT by adding local edge modes associated with the corresponding CFT. In this work, we instead construct a minimal set of edge modes compatible with the topological invariance of Chern-Simons theory. This leads us to propose a minimal factorization map. These minimal edge modes can be interpreted as the degrees of freedom of a particle on a quantum group. Of particular interest is three-dimensional gravity as a Chern-Simons theory with gauge group SL$(2,\mathbb{R}) \times$ SL$(2,\mathbb{R})$. Our minimal factorization proposal uniquely gives rise to quantum group edge modes factorizing the bulk state space of 3d gravity. This agrees with earlier proposals that relate the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy in 3d gravity to topological entanglement entropy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04696v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present orthogonality relations for quasinormal modes of a wide class of asymptotically AdS black holes. The definition is obtained from a standard product, modified by a CPT operator and placed on a complex radial contour which avoids branch points of the modes. They are inspired by existing constructions for de Sitter and Kerr spacetimes. The CPT operator is needed to map right eigenfunctions of the Hamiltonian into left eigenfunctions. The radial contour connects two copies of the dual QFT on a thermal Schwinger-Keldysh contour, making contact with real-time holography and the double cone wormhole.</description>

      <title>The bi-adjoint scalar $\ell$-loop planar integrand recursion and graded inverse variables</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07077v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Previously in \cite{Tao:2025fch}, we constructed the $\ell$-loop planar integrands using loop components and loop kernels by some recursion rules. In this paper, we propose a new formalism to express the loop kernel recursion. We define ``graded inverse variables" to make the loop kernel recursion more elegant. And the graph factor, including the symmetry factor, can be figured out from each monomial of some variables. This new formalism makes the previous $\ell$-loop integrand recursion clearer.</description>

      <title>Representations of the fractional d'Alembertian and initial conditions in fractional dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21485v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct representations of complex powers of the d'Alembertian operator $\Box$ in Lorentzian signature and pinpoint one which is self-adjoint and suitable for classical and quantum fractional field theory. This self-adjoint fractional d'Alembertian is associated with complex-conjugate poles, which are removed from the physical spectrum via the Anselmi--Piva prescription. As an example of empty spectrum, we consider a purely fractional propagator and its K\"all\'en--Lehmann representation. Using a cleaned-up version of the diffusion method, we formulate and solve the problem of initial conditions of the classical dynamics with a standard plus a fractional d'Alembertian, showing that the number of initial conditions is two. We generalize this result to a much wider class of nonlocal theories and discuss its applications to quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>From Regular to Irregular: A Unified Origin for Argyres-Douglas Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13434v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose that Argyres-Douglas theories of type $D_p(\mathrm{SU}(N))$ and $(A_{p-1}, A_{N-1})$ - both realizable as Type A class $\mathcal{S}$ theories with irregular punctures - can be obtained via a sequence of mass deformations from a common ancestor: a class $\mathcal{S}$ theory with only regular punctures. Building on our previous work, this result establishes that these theories ultimately originate from 6d $\mathcal{N}=(1,0)$ orbi-instanton theories compactified on a torus. The requisite 4d mass deformations are realized as tractable Fayet-Iliopoulos deformations on the 3d mirror quiver. The core of our method is a constructive procedure that utilizes the Euclidean algorithm to define a chain of deformations connecting different $D_p(\mathrm{SU}(N))$ theories. By reversing this chain, we recursively build a "parent" star-shaped quiver for any given $(N,p)$. This quiver is the 3d mirror theory of the required class $\mathcal{S}$ ancestor. We substantiate our general claims with several detailed examples that explicitly illustrate the deformation procedure.</description>

      <title>Entanglement harvesting and curvature of entanglement: A modular operator approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12497v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An operator-algebraic framework based on Tomita-Takesaki modular theory is used to study aspects of quantum entanglement via the application of the modular conjugation operator $J$. The entanglement structure of quantum fields is studied through the protocol of entanglement harvesting whereby quantum correlations evolve through the time evolution of qubit detectors coupled to a Bosonic field. Modular conjugation operators are constructed for Unruh-Dewitt type qubits interacting with a scalar field such that initially unentangled qubits become entangled. The entanglement harvested in this process is directly quantified by an expectation value involving $J$ offering a physical application of this operator. The modular operator formalism is then extended to the Markovian open system dynamics of coupled qubits by expressing entanglement monotones as functionals of a state $\rho$ and its modular reflection $J\rho J$. The second derivative of such functionals with respect to an external coupling parameter, termed the curvature of entanglement, provides a natural measure of entanglement sensitivity. At points of modular self-duality, the curvature of entanglement coincides with the quantum Fisher information measure. These results demonstrate that the modular conjugation operator $J$ captures both the harvesting of entanglement from quantum fields and the curvature of entanglement in coupled qubit dynamics providing parallel modular structures that connect these systems.</description>

Abstract: In this work we discuss the issue of localization of $N=2$ spinning particles. More specifically, we show that we can not confine the spinning particle within the Randall-Sundrum scenario. We argue that this result directly affects studies related to localization of $p$-form fields. We show that, due to the non confinement of the superparticle, we can not localize $p$-forms on the membrane.</description>

      <title>On the K-point in moduli space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.11949v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a class of infinite-distance loci, referred to as K-points, in one-parameter complex-structure moduli spaces of type IIB string theory compactified on Calabi-Yau manifolds. We show that around K-points the effective four-dimensional supergravity exhibits certain unusual properties. The two most prominent being that the leading order dependence of the prepotential on the gauge couplings is non-perturbative and that the leading gauge kinetic terms in the action vanish when evaluated on an anti self-dual graviphoton background. These properties are shared with the conifold locus in moduli space, rather than the large complex-structure locus. The conifold locus is well-known to arise from integrating out a charged BPS state, and so the similarities suggest that the K-point also arises from integrating out a BPS state. We develop such an interpretation, finding that it corresponds to a BPS state which is extremely light, whose mass in Planck units is doubly-exponentially small in the distance to the K-point. The state behaves as if it had complex charges, or as if it couples to the self-dual and anti self-dual parts of the graviphoton differently. Assuming such an integrating-out scenario is indeed the correct physics for the K-point, we discuss the implications for our understanding of infinite distances in moduli space and for the Swampland Distance Conjecture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.15021v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of generic 5-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton-Axion (EMDA) holographic theories with exponential couplings. We find and classify exact, analytic, anisotropic solutions, both zero-temperature vacua and finite-temperature black brane backgrounds, with anisotropy sourced by scalar axions, magnetic fields, and charge densities, that can be interpreted as IR fixed points of renormalisation-group flows from UV-conformal fixed points. The resulting backgrounds feature a hyperscaling violation exponent and up to three independent Lifshitz-like exponents, generated by an equal number of independent coupling constants in the EMDA action. We derive the holographic stress-energy tensor and the corresponding equation of state, and discuss the behavior of the anisotropic speed of sound and butterfly velocity. We show that these theories can be consistently constrained by imposing several natural requirements, including energy conditions, thermodynamic stability, and causality. Additionally, we analyse hard probes in this class of theories, including Brownian motion, momentum broadening and jet quenching, and we demonstrate that a fully analytic treatment is possible, making their dependence on the underlying anisotropy explicit. We highlight the relevance of these models as benchmarks for strongly coupled anisotropic matter in nature, from the quark-gluon plasma created in heavy-ion collisions to dense QCD phases in neutron-star mergers and the cores of compact objects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.22039v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Schwinger model is a model of a two-dimensional $U(1)$ gauge theory coupled to a Dirac fermion. It is an interesting model that exhibits phenomena like confinement and chiral symmetry breaking. In this paper, we study the massless Schwinger and Schwinger-Thirring model on a squashed sphere, $S^2_b$. These models are examples of interacting non-supersymmetric theories where the exact computations in the coupling parameter are possible. Squashing provides a smooth deformation of the metric away from the spherical geometry. We compute the partition function, and the expectation value of the Wilson loop and the fermion condensate exactly in the Schwinger and Schwinger-Thirring model as a function of the squashing parameter and the coupling constant. We then obtain variations in these quantities in response to the squashing deformation. These contain information about correlation functions involving the energy-momentum tensor. We evaluate these variations in the first order in the squashing parameter and exactly in the coupling constant.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.08983v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct one-particle states as unitary, irreducible representations of Poincare group in front form, characterized by a special null vector, dubbed reference vector. We demonstrate that this construction has massive-massless continuation. The state is defined by the reference vector. The little group transformation, defined at a general moving momentum, is equivalent to a change of reference vector. The resulting Wigner D-matrix is parameterized by the rapidities, in addition to the two reference vectors before and after transformation. Boosting the rapidities to infinity, it obtain the massless limit smoothly. We then apply those results to massive spin-1 particle and compute the corresponding Wigner D-matrices. The resulting polarization vectors are equivalent to those in spinor-helicity formalism. In the massless limit, it is shown that longitudinal polarization decouples from the spectrum. The $\epsilon^\mu_\pm \rightarrow \epsilon^\mu_\pm +\xi k^\mu$ shift turns out to be remnant of this decoupling, with $\xi$ determined by the angle between the reference vectors. Our results thus give us a deeper understanding of gauge symmetry: massless spin-1 particle is defined as the infinite boost limit of massive spin-1 particle, gauge symmetry can be understood to origin from obtaining the massless limit for polarization vectors through different reference vectors.</description>

      <title>Massive Gauge Theories from Consistency Conditions of Amplitudes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.09003v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Based on the general principles of Lorentz symmetry and unitary, we introduce two consistency conditions -- on-shell gauge symmetry and strong massive-massless continuation -- in constructing amplitudes of massive gauge theory with elementary particles. In particular we argue on-shell gauge symmetry can be understood as a consequence of Lorentz symmetry, through mixture of a vector boson and a scalar with degenerate mass spectrum. Based on the two conditions, combined with the little group transformation and consistent factorization, we construct 3-point and 4-point vector boson/scalar amplitudes, then analyze the underlying physical models. Given the particle masses, almost all possible vertices, including those involving Goldstone modes, are uniquely fixed. The only exceptions are triple and quartic scalar self-couplings. In addition, all particle masses must have the same physical origin. If the number of vector bosons is smaller than 3, the underlying theories for the amplitudes are either massive gauge theories with spontaneous symmetry breaking (S.S.B) or Stueckelberg theory. The necessary condition for the latter is that the scalars have equal masses. We also discuss different models depending on the number of scalars involved. If the number of vector bosons is larger than 3, the underlying theory must be Yang-Mills theory with S.S.B. In both abelian and non-abelian cases, the specific shape of Higgs potential cannot be determined, which explains the fact that scalar self-couplings are undetermined, and the relations between the masses are generally not linear.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.10519v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We uncover a direct connection between three-dimensional gravity with chiral boundary conditions and a class of forced integrable systems. Starting from the Chern-Simons formulation, we derive consistent boundary conditions on a non-compact spatial slice, leading to boundary dynamics described by the potential modified KdV hierarchy. The dynamics reduce to a forced KdV equation, where the forcing term is determined self-consistently by the eigenfunctions of the associated Schr\"{o}dinger operator. Using the inverse scattering transform, the reflectionless sector is solved via the Gelfand-Levitan-Marchenko method, while the radiative sector exhibits universal dispersive decay. This framework unifies AdS$_3$ boundary dynamics with integrable hierarchies and elucidates the roles of solitons and radiation in the dual conformal field theory.</description>

Abstract: Information-theoretic quantities such as Renyi entropies show a remarkable universality in their late-time behaviour across a variety of chaotic many-body systems. Understanding how such common features emerge from very different microscopic dynamics remains an important challenge. In this work, we address this question in a class of Brownian models with random time-dependent Hamiltonians and a variety of different microscopic couplings. In any such model, the Lorentzian time-evolution of the $n$-th Renyi entropy can be mapped to evolution by a Euclidean Hamiltonian on 2$n$ copies of the system. We provide evidence that in systems with no symmetries, the low-energy excitations of the Euclidean Hamiltonian are universally given by a gapped quasiparticle-like band. The eigenstates in this band are plane waves of locally dressed domain walls between ferromagnetic ground states associated with two permutations in the symmetric group $S_n$. These excitations give rise to the membrane picture of entanglement growth, with the membrane tension determined by their dispersion relation. We establish this structure in a variety of cases using analytical perturbative methods and numerical variational techniques, and extract the associated dispersion relations and membrane tensions for the second and third Renyi entropies. For the third Renyi entropy, we argue that phase transitions in the membrane tension as a function of velocity are needed to ensure that physical constraints on the membrane tension are satisfied. Overall, this structure provides an understanding of entanglement dynamics in terms of a universal set of gapped low-lying modes, which may also apply to systems with time-independent Hamiltonians.</description>

Abstract: I found an extended duality (triality) between Dirac fermions in periodic spacetime metrics, nonrelativistic fermions in gauge fields (e.g., Harper-Hofstadter model), and in periodic scalar fields on a lattice (e.g., Aubry-Andr\'e model). This indicates an unexpected equivalence between spacetime metrics, gauge fields, and scalar fields on the lattice, which are understood as different physical representations of the same mathematical object, the quantum group $\mathcal{U}_q(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$. This quantum group is generated by the exponentiation of two canonical conjugate operators, namely a linear combination of position and momentum (periodic spacetime metrics), the two components of the gauge-invariant momentum (gauge fields), and position and momentum (periodic scalar fields). Hence, on a lattice, Dirac fermions in a periodic spacetime metric are equivalent to nonrelativistic fermions in a periodic scalar field after a proper canonical transformation. The three lattice Hamiltonians (periodic spacetime metric, Harper-Hofstadter, and Aubry-Andr\'e) share the same properties, namely fractal phase diagrams, self-similarity, $S$-duality, topological invariants, flat bands, and topologically quantized current in the incommensurate regimes. In essence, this work unveils an unexpected link between gravity and gauge fields, opens new avenues for studying analog gravity, e.g., the Unruh effect and universe expansions/contractions, suggests the existence of an $S$-duality of spacetime curvatures, and hints at novel pathways to quantized gravity theories.</description>

      <title>Extending knot polynomials of braided Hopf algebras to links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01398v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, a plethora of multivariable knot polynomials were introduced by Kashaev and one of the authors, by applying the Reshetikhin-Turaev functor to rigid $R$-matrices that come for braided Hopf algebras with automorphisms. We study the extension of these knot invariants to links, and use this to identify some of them with known link invariants, as conjectured in that same recent work.</description>

      <title>Direct Sum Structure of the Super Virasoro Algebra and a Fermion Algebra Arising from the Quantum Toroidal $\mathfrak{gl}_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02926v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is known that the $q$-deformed Virasoro algebra can be constructed from a certain representation of the quantum toroidal $\mathfrak{gl}_1$ algebra. In this paper, we apply the same construction to the quantum toroidal algebra of type $\mathfrak{gl}_2$ and study the properties of resulting generators $W_i(z)$ ($i=1,2$). The algebra generated by $W_i(z)$ can be regarded as a $q$-deformation of the direct sum $\mathsf{F} \oplus \mathsf{SVir}$, where $\mathsf{F}$ denotes the free fermion algebra and $\mathsf{SVir}$ stands for the $N=1$ super Virasoro algebra, also referred to as the $N=1$ superconformal algebra or the Neveu-Schwarz-Ramond algebra. Moreover, the generators $W_i(z)$ admit two screening currents, and we show that their degeneration limits coincide with the screening currents of $\mathsf{SVir}$. We also establish quadratic relations satisfied by $W_i(z)$ and show that they generate a pair of commuting $q$-deformed Virasoro algebras, which degenerate into two nontrivial commuting Virasoro algebras included in $\mathsf{F} \oplus \mathsf{SVir}$.</description>

      <title>Dark Walker in the Early Universe: A Strongly Coupled Sector Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06454v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the phenomenology of the ``Dark Walker'' -- an $\text{SU}(3)$ theory with eight flavors of massless fundamental fermions in the dark sector. During inflation, its walking dynamics generate primordial non-Gaussianities through the exchange of unparticles, while accounting for the current dark matter relic abundance if we consider freeze-in of Dark Walker coupled to the Standard Model through the Higgs portal. This provides a simple yet predictive example linking strongly coupled inflationary dynamics to present-day dark matter.</description>

      <title>Learning with errors may remain hard against quantum holographic attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22833v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Learning with Errors (LWE) problem underlies modern lattice-based cryptography and is assumed to be quantum hard. Recent results show that estimating entanglement entropy is as hard as LWE, creating tension with quantum gravity and AdS/CFT, where entropies are computed by extremal surface areas. This suggests a paradoxical route to solving LWE by building holographic duals and measuring extremal surfaces, seemingly an easy task. Three possible resolutions arise: that AdS/CFT duality is intractable, that the quantum-extended Church-Turing thesis (QECTT) fails, or that LWE is easier than believed. We develop and analyze a fourth resolution: that estimating surface areas with the precision required for entropy is itself computationally hard. We construct two holographic quantum algorithms to formalize this. For entropy differences of order N, we show that measuring Ryu-Takayanagi geodesic lengths via heavy-field two-point functions needs exponentially many measurements in N, even when the boundary state is efficiently preparable. For order one corrections, we show that reconstructing the bulk covariance matrix and extracting entropy requires exponential time in N. Although these tasks are computationally intractable, we compare their efficiency with the Block Korkine-Zolotarev lattice reduction algorithm for LWE. Our results reconcile the tension with QECTT, showing that holographic entropy remains consistent with quantum computational limits without requiring an intractable holographic dictionary, and provide new insights into the quantum cryptanalysis of lattice-based cryptography.</description>

      <title>Defect mediated quantum melting of charge ordered insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00099v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2d) electronic systems on a lattice at fractional filling $\nu = p/q$ exhibit a competition between charge ordered insulators, called Wigner-Mott insulators (WMIs), at large Coulomb repulsion and Fermi-liquid metals at large electronic kinetic energy. When those two energy scales are roughly equal, insulating states that restore the lattice translation symmetry, which we call quantum charge liquids (QCLs), may emerge. When gapped, these QCLs must exhibit topological order. In this work, we show that the allowed topological ordered phases that are proximate to the WMI strongly depend on the charge ordering in the WMI. In particular, we show that when $q$ is even, no direct transition exists between a WMI with the smallest allowed unit cell size from filling constraints, i.e., the "minimal" WMI, and the topological order with the smallest ground state degeneracy on a torus allowed by filling constraints, i.e., the "minimal" TO. Furthermore, we describe the quantum melting transition of the WMIs to the proximate QCLs in terms of the proliferation of the topological defects of the WMIs. The field theory of this transition in terms of the topological defects reveals their role as precursors to the anyon excitations in the QCLs.</description>

      <title>Toward a unified view of agnostic parametrizations for deformed black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14707v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A variety of robust and effective descriptions have been devised to extract model-independent information about the fundamental properties of black holes from observational data when searching for deviations from general relativity. In this work, we construct explicit transformation maps establishing the equivalence among three relevant parametrizations for different spacetime patches: Johannsen-Psaltis, Rezzolla-Zhidenko, and Effective Metric Description. We then select representative black hole geometries to determine the minimal number of parameters required within each scheme to reproduce the associated quasi-normal mode spectra with a prescribed degree of accuracy. Our analysis shows that, for the given observables, a finite set of coefficients suffices to attain the desired precision in the three frameworks. Finally, we emphasize how the individual strengths of these effective descriptions can be exploited to probe complementary aspects of black hole physics.</description>
