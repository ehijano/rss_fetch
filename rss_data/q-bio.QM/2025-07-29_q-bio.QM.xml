      <title>Theoretical modeling and quantitative research on aquatic ecosystems driven by multiple factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the complex interactions between water temperature, nutrient levels, and chlorophyll-a dynamics is essential for addressing eutrophication and the proliferation of harmful algal blooms in freshwater ecosystems algal. However, many existing studies tend to oversimplify thse relationships often neglecting the non-linear effects and long-term temporal variations that influence chlorophyll-a growth. Here, we conducted multi-year field monitoring (2020-2024) of the key environmental factors, including total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), water temperature, and chlorophyll-a, across three water bodies in Guangdong Province, China: Tiantangshan Reservoir(S1), Baisha River Reservoir(S2) and Meizhou Reservoir(S3). Based on the collected data, we developed a multi-factor interaction model to quantitatively assess the spatiotemporal dynamics of chlorophyll-a and its environmental drivers. Our research reveal significant temporal and spatial variability in chlorophyll-a concentrations, with strong positive correlations to TN, TP, and water temperature. Long-term data from S1 and S2 demonstrate a clear trend of increasing eutrophication, with TN emerging as a more influential factor than TP in chlorophyll-a proliferation. The developed model accurately reproduces observed patterns, offering a robust theoretical basis for future predictive and management-oriented studies of aquatic ecosystem health.</description>

      <title>Review of Deep Learning Applications to Structural Proteomics Enabled by Cryogenic Electron Microscopy and Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The past decade's "cryoEM revolution" has produced exponential growth in high-resolution structural data through advances in cryogenic electron microscopy (cryoEM) and tomography (cryoET). Deep learning integration into structural proteomics workflows addresses longstanding challenges including low signal-to-noise ratios, preferred orientation artifacts, and missing-wedge problems that historically limited efficiency and scalability. This review examines AI applications across the entire cryoEM pipeline, from automated particle picking using convolutional neural networks (Topaz, crYOLO, CryoSegNet) to computational solutions for preferred orientation bias (spIsoNet, cryoPROS) and advanced denoising algorithms (Topaz-Denoise). In cryoET, tools like IsoNet employ U-Net architectures for simultaneous missing-wedge correction and noise reduction, while TomoNet streamlines subtomogram averaging through AI-driven particle detection. The workflow culminates with automated atomic model building using sophisticated tools like ModelAngelo, DeepTracer, and CryoREAD that translate density maps into interpretable biological structures. These AI-enhanced approaches have achieved near-atomic resolution reconstructions with minimal manual intervention, resolved previously intractable datasets suffering from severe orientation bias, and enabled successful application to diverse biological systems from HIV virus-like particles to in situ ribosomal complexes. As deep learning evolves, particularly with large language models and vision transformers, the future promises sophisticated automation and accessibility in structural biology, potentially revolutionizing our understanding of macromolecular architecture and function.</description>

      <title>Inference for stochastic reaction networks via logistic regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying network structure and inferring parameters are central challenges in modeling chemical reaction networks. In this study, we propose likelihood-based methods grounded in multinomial logistic regression to infer both stoichiometries and network connectivity structure from full time-series trajectories of stochastic chemical reaction networks. When complete molecular count trajectories are observed for all species, stoichiometric coefficients are identifiable, provided each reaction occurs at least once during the observation window. However, identifying catalytic species remains difficult, as their molecular counts remain unchanged before and after each reaction event. Through three illustrative stochastic models involving catalytic interactions in open networks, we demonstrate that the logistic regression framework, when applied properly, can recover the full network structure, including stoichiometric relationships. We further apply Bayesian logistic regression to estimate model parameters in real-world epidemic settings, using the COVID-19 outbreak in the Greater Seoul area of South Korea as a case study. Our analysis focuses on a Susceptible--Infected--Recovered (SIR) network model that incorporates demographic effects. To address the challenge of partial observability, particularly the availability of data only for the infectious subset of the population, we develop a method that integrates Bayesian logistic regression with differential equation models. This approach enables robust inference of key SIR parameters from observed COVID-19 case trajectories. Overall, our findings demonstrate that simple, likelihood-based techniques such as logistic regression can recover meaningful mechanistic insights from both synthetic and empirical time-series data.</description>

      <title>Mathematical model of blood coagulation during endovenous laser therapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Endovenous laser therapy (ELT) as a minimally invasive procedure for ablation of large superficial veins, nevertheless, can cause complications of thrombotic nature. In this regard, the study of the main patterns of thrombus formation during ELT and modelling of endovenous heat-induced thrombosis (EHIT) is relevant. Based on the assumption of diffusion limiting of biochemical processes occurring during the coagulation of blood, by recalculating the reaction rates according to the Stokes-Einstein equation, a simple point model of blood coagulation during ELT was built in this paper. As a result of the use of this model, it was demonstrated that blood heating entails an increase in the rate of thrombin production, a decrease in the time for achieving the peak of its concentration by 5-6 times with its almost constant amplitude. Heating leads to the rapid formation of fibrin clusters and the appearance of a fibrin-polymer network with a smaller cell size. The quantitative dependence on the selected rheological model was also shown. All the data necessary for using the model are given in this article for reproducibility.</description>

      <title>Quantifying lower-limb muscle coordination during cycling using electromyography-informed muscle synergies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19637v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Assessment of muscle coordination during cycling may provide insight into motor control strategies and movement efficiency. This study evaluated muscle synergies and coactivation patterns as indicators of neuromuscular coordination in lower-limb across three power levels of cycling. Twenty recreational cyclists performed a graded cycling test on a stationary bicycle ergometer. Electromyography was recorded bilaterally from seven lower-limb muscles and muscle synergies were extracted using non-negative matrix factorization. The Coactivation Index (CI), Synergy Index (SI), and Synergy Coordination Index (SCI) were calculated to assess muscle coordination patterns. Four muscle synergies were identified consistently across power levels, with changes in synergy composition and activation timing correlated with increased muscular demands. As power level increased, the CI showed reduced muscle coactivation at the knee and greater muscle coactivation at the ankle. The SI revealed a greater contribution of the synergy weights of the extensor muscles than those of the flexor muscles at the knee. In contrast, the relative EMG contribution of hip extensor and flexor muscles remained consistent with increasing power levels. The SCI increased significantly with increasing power level, suggesting a reduction in the size of the synergy space and improved neuromuscular coordination. These findings provide insight into how the central nervous system modulates its response to increasing mechanical demands. Combining synergy and coactivation indices offers a promising approach to assess motor control, inform rehabilitation, and optimize performance in cycling tasks.</description>

      <title>A Metabolic-Imaging Integrated Model for Prognostic Prediction in Colorectal Liver Metastases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Prognostic evaluation in patients with colorectal liver metastases (CRLM) remains challenging due to suboptimal accuracy of conventional clinical models. This study developed and validated a robust machine learning model for predicting postoperative recurrence risk. Preliminary ensemble models achieved exceptionally high performance (AUC $&gt;$ 0.98) but incorporated postoperative features, introducing data leakage risks. To enhance clinical applicability, we restricted input variables to preoperative baseline clinical parameters and radiomic features from contrast-enhanced CT imaging, specifically targeting recurrence prediction at 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively. The 3-month recurrence prediction model demonstrated optimal performance with an AUC of 0.723 in cross-validation. Decision curve analysis revealed that across threshold probabilities of 0.55-0.95, the model consistently provided greater net benefit than "treat-all" or "treat-none" strategies, supporting its utility in postoperative surveillance and therapeutic decision-making. This study successfully developed a robust predictive model for early CRLM recurrence with confirmed clinical utility. Importantly, it highlights the critical risk of data leakage in clinical prognostic modeling and proposes a rigorous framework to mitigate this issue, enhancing model reliability and translational value in real-world settings.</description>

      <title>Modeling enzyme temperature stability from sequence segment perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.19755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Developing enzymes with desired thermal properties is crucial for a wide range of industrial and research applications, and determining temperature stability is an essential step in this process. Experimental determination of thermal parameters is labor-intensive, time-consuming, and costly. Moreover, existing computational approaches are often hindered by limited data availability and imbalanced distributions. To address these challenges, we introduce a curated temperature stability dataset designed for model development and benchmarking in enzyme thermal modeling. Leveraging this dataset, we present the \textit{Segment Transformer}, a novel deep learning framework that enables efficient and accurate prediction of enzyme temperature stability. The model achieves state-of-the-art performance with an RMSE of 24.03, MAE of 18.09, and Pearson and Spearman correlations of 0.33, respectively. These results highlight the effectiveness of incorporating segment-level representations, grounded in the biological observation that different regions of a protein sequence contribute unequally to thermal behavior. As a proof of concept, we applied the Segment Transformer to guide the engineering of a cutinase enzyme. Experimental validation demonstrated a 1.64-fold improvement in relative activity following heat treatment, achieved through only 17 mutations and without compromising catalytic function.</description>

      <title>A nonparametric approach to practical identifiability of nonlinear mixed effects models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mathematical modelling is a widely used approach to understand and interpret clinical trial data. This modelling typically involves fitting mechanistic mathematical models to data from individual trial participants. Despite the widespread adoption of this individual-based fitting, it is becoming increasingly common to take a hierarchical approach to parameter estimation, where modellers characterize the population parameter distributions, rather than considering each individual independently. This hierarchical parameter estimation is standard in pharmacometric modelling. However, many of the existing techniques for parameter identifiability do not immediately translate from the individual-based fitting to the hierarchical setting. Here, we propose a nonparametric approach to study practical identifiability within a hierarchical parameter estimation framework. We focus on the commonly used nonlinear mixed effects framework and investigate two well-studied examples from the pharmacometrics and viral dynamics literature to illustrate the potential utility of our approach.</description>

      <title>Prostate Cancer Classification Using Multimodal Feature Fusion and Explainable AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20714v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Prostate cancer, the second most prevalent male malignancy, requires advanced diagnostic tools. We propose an explainable AI system combining BERT (for textual clinical notes) and Random Forest (for numerical lab data) through a novel multimodal fusion strategy, achieving superior classification performance on PLCO-NIH dataset (98% accuracy, 99% AUC). While multimodal fusion is established, our work demonstrates that a simple yet interpretable BERT+RF pipeline delivers clinically significant improvements - particularly for intermediate cancer stages (Class 2/3 recall: 0.900 combined vs 0.824 numerical/0.725 textual). SHAP analysis provides transparent feature importance rankings, while ablation studies prove textual features' complementary value. This accessible approach offers hospitals a balance of high performance (F1=89%), computational efficiency, and clinical interpretability - addressing critical needs in prostate cancer diagnostics.</description>

      <title>Zero-Shot Learning with Subsequence Reordering Pretraining for Compound-Protein Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20925v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given the vastness of chemical space and the ongoing emergence of previously uncharacterized proteins, zero-shot compound-protein interaction (CPI) prediction better reflects the practical challenges and requirements of real-world drug development. Although existing methods perform adequately during certain CPI tasks, they still face the following challenges: (1) Representation learning from local or complete protein sequences often overlooks the complex interdependencies between subsequences, which are essential for predicting spatial structures and binding properties. (2) Dependence on large-scale or scarce multimodal protein datasets demands significant training data and computational resources, limiting scalability and efficiency. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach that pretrains protein representations for CPI prediction tasks using subsequence reordering, explicitly capturing the dependencies between protein subsequences. Furthermore, we apply length-variable protein augmentation to ensure excellent pretraining performance on small training datasets. To evaluate the model's effectiveness and zero-shot learning ability, we combine it with various baseline methods. The results demonstrate that our approach can improve the baseline model's performance on the CPI task, especially in the challenging zero-shot scenario. Compared to existing pre-training models, our model demonstrates superior performance, particularly in data-scarce scenarios where training samples are limited. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/Hoch-Zhang/PSRP-CPI.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11513v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Variant calling is a fundamental task in genomic research, essential for detecting genetic variations such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and insertions or deletions (indels). This paper presents an enhancement to DeepChem, a widely used open-source drug discovery framework, through the integration of DeepVariant. In particular, we introduce a variant calling pipeline that leverages DeepVariant's convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture to improve the accuracy and reliability of variant detection. The implemented pipeline includes stages for realignment of sequencing reads, candidate variant detection, and pileup image generation, followed by variant classification using a modified Inception v3 model. Our work adds a modular and extensible variant calling framework to the DeepChem framework and enables future work integrating DeepChem's drug discovery infrastructure more tightly with bioinformatics pipelines.</description>

      <title>Predicting Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy Response in Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Using Pre-Treatment Histopathologic Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14730v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) remains a major clinical challenge due to its aggressive behavior and lack of targeted therapies. Accurate early prediction of response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) is essential for guiding personalized treatment strategies and improving patient outcomes. In this study, we present an attention-based multiple instance learning (MIL) framework designed to predict pathologic complete response (pCR) directly from pre-treatment hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E)-stained biopsy slides. The model was trained on a retrospective in-house cohort of 174 TNBC patients and externally validated on an independent cohort (n = 30). It achieved a mean area under the curve (AUC) of 0.85 during five-fold cross-validation and 0.78 on external testing, demonstrating robust predictive performance and generalizability. To enhance model interpretability, attention maps were spatially co-registered with multiplex immuno-histochemistry (mIHC) data stained for PD-L1, CD8+ T cells, and CD163+ macrophages. The attention regions exhibited moderate spatial overlap with immune-enriched areas, with mean Intersection over Union (IoU) scores of 0.47 for PD-L1, 0.45 for CD8+ T cells, and 0.46 for CD163+ macrophages. The presence of these biomarkers in high-attention regions supports their biological relevance to NACT response in TNBC. This not only improves model interpretability but may also inform future efforts to identify clinically actionable histological biomarkers directly from H&amp;E-stained biopsy slides, further supporting the utility of this approach for accurate NACT response prediction and advancing precision oncology in TNBC.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning for Blood-Brain Barrier Permeability Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18557v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Predicting whether a molecule can cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a key step in early-stage neuropharmaceutical development, directly influencing both research efficiency and success rates in drug discovery. Traditional empirical methods based on physicochemical properties are prone to systematic misjudgements due to their reliance on static rules. Early machine learning models, although data-driven, often suffer from limited capacity, poor generalization, and insufficient interpretability. In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) methods have become essential tools for predicting BBB permeability and guiding related drug design, owing to their ability to model molecular structures and capture complex biological mechanisms. This article systematically reviews the evolution of this field-from deep neural networks to graph-based structural modeling-highlighting the advantages of multi-task and multimodal learning strategies in identifying mechanism-relevant variables. We further explore the emerging potential of generative models and causal inference methods for integrating permeability prediction with mechanism-aware drug design. BBB modeling is in the transition from static classification toward mechanistic perception and structure-function modeling. This paradigm shift provides a methodological foundation and future roadmap for the integration of AI into neuropharmacological development.</description>

Abstract: The integration of heterogeneous multi-omics datasets at a systems level remains a central challenge for developing analytical and computational models in precision cancer diagnostics. This paper introduces Multi-Omics Graph Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (MOGKAN), a deep learning framework that utilizes messenger-RNA, micro-RNA sequences, and DNA methylation samples together with Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) networks for cancer classification across 31 different cancer types. The proposed approach combines differential gene expression with DESeq2, Linear Models for Microarray (LIMMA), and Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression to reduce multi-omics data dimensionality while preserving relevant biological features. The model architecture is based on the Kolmogorov-Arnold theorem principle and uses trainable univariate functions to enhance interpretability and feature analysis. MOGKAN achieves classification accuracy of 96.28 percent and exhibits low experimental variability in comparison to related deep learning-based models. The biomarkers identified by MOGKAN were validated as cancer-related markers through Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis. By integrating multi-omics data with graph-based deep learning, our proposed approach demonstrates robust predictive performance and interpretability with potential to enhance the translation of complex multi-omics data into clinically actionable cancer diagnostics.</description>

Abstract: The Cellular-Potts model is a powerful and ubiquitous framework for developing computational models for simulating complex multicellular biological systems. Cellular-Potts models (CPMs) are often computationally expensive due to the explicit modeling of interactions among large numbers of individual model agents and diffusive fields described by partial differential equations (PDEs). In this work, we develop a convolutional neural network (CNN) surrogate model using a U-Net architecture that accounts for periodic boundary conditions. We use this model to accelerate the evaluation of a mechanistic CPM previously used to investigate in vitro vasculogenesis. The surrogate model was trained to predict 100 computational steps ahead (Monte-Carlo steps, MCS), accelerating simulation evaluations by a factor of 590 times compared to CPM code execution. Over multiple recursive evaluations, our model effectively captures the emergent behaviors demonstrated by the original Cellular-Potts model of such as vessel sprouting, extension and anastomosis, and contraction of vascular lacunae. This approach demonstrates the potential for deep learning to serve as efficient surrogate models for CPM simulations, enabling faster evaluation of computationally expensive CPM of biological processes at greater spatial and temporal scales.</description>

      <title>Functional Architecture of the Human Hypothalamus: Cortical Coupling and Subregional Organization Using 7-Tesla fMRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06191</link>

Abstract: The hypothalamus plays an important role in the regulation of the bodys metabolic state and behaviors related to survival. Despite its importance however, many questions exist regarding the intrinsic and extrinsic connections of the hypothalamus in humans, especially its relationship with the cortex. As a heterogeneous structure, it is possible that the hypothalamus is composed of different subregions, which have their own distinct relationships with the cortex. Previous work on functional connectivity in the human hypothalamus have either treated it as a unitary structure or relied on methodological approaches that are limited in modeling its intrinsic functional architecture. Here, we used resting state data from ultrahigh field 7 Tesla fMRI and a data driven analytical approach to identify functional subregions of the human hypothalamus. Our approach identified four functional hypothalamic subregions based on intrinsic functional connectivity, which in turn showed distinct patterns of functional connectivity with cortex. Overall, all hypothalamic subregions showed stronger connectivity with a cortical network, Cortical Network 1 composed primarily of frontal, midline, and limbic cortical areas and weaker connectivity with a second cortical network composed largely of posterior sensorimotor regions, Cortical Network 2. Of the hypothalamic subregions, the anterior hypothalamus showed the strongest connection to Cortical Network 1, while a more ventral subregion containing the anterior hypothalamus extending to the tuberal region showed the weakest connectivity. The findings support the use of ultrahigh field, high resolution imaging in providing a more incisive investigation of the human hypothalamus that respects its complex internal structure and extrinsic functional architecture.</description>
