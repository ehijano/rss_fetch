      <title>Bringing the economics of biodiversity into policy and decision-making: A target and cost-based approach to pricing biodiversity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given ongoing, human-induced, loss of wild species we propose the Target and Cost Analysis (TCA) approach as a means of incorporating biodiversity within government appraisals of public spending. Influenced by how carbon is priced in countries around the world, the resulting biodiversity shadow price reflects the marginal cost of meeting government targets while avoiding disagreements on the use of willingness to pay measures to value biodiversity. Examples of how to operationalize TCA are developed at different scales and for alternative biodiversity metrics, including extinction risk for Europe and species richness in the UK. Pricing biodiversity according to agreed targets allows trade-offs with other wellbeing-enhancing uses of public funds to be sensibly undertaken without jeopardizing those targets, and is compatible with international guidelines on Cost Benefit Analysis.</description>

      <title>One Call Away. Ownership Chains and Ease of Communication in Multinational Enterprises</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.12857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.12857v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study examines how multinational enterprises structure ownership chains to coordinate subsidiaries across multiple national borders. Using a unique global dataset, we first document key stylized facts: 54% of subsidiaries are controlled through indirect ownership, and ownership chains can span up to seven countries. In particular, we find that subsidiaries further down the control hierarchy tend to be more geographically distant from the parent and operate in different time zones. This suggests that the ease of communication along ownership chains is a critical determinant of their structure. On the other hand, tax optimization strategies are not correlated with locations along ownership chains. Motivated by previous findings, we develop a location choice model in which parent firms compete for corporate control of final subsidiaries, but monitoring is costly, and they can delegate control to an intermediate affiliate in another jurisdiction. The model generates a two-stage empirical strategy: (i) a trilateral equation that determines the location of an intermediate affiliate conditional on the location of final subsidiaries; and (ii) a bilateral equation that predicts the location of final investment. Our empirical estimates confirm that the ease of communication at the country level has a significant influence on the location decisions of affiliates along ownership chains. Our findings underscore the importance of communication frictions in shaping global corporate structures, and provide new insights into the geography of multinational ownership networks.</description>

      <title>Aggregation Model and Market Mechanism for Virtual Power Plant Participation in Inertia and Primary Frequency Response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04854v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The declining provision of inertia by synchronous generators in modern power systems necessitates aggregating distributed energy resources (DERs) into virtual power plants (VPPs) to unlock their potential in delivering inertia and primary frequency response (IPFR) through ancillary service markets. To facilitate DER participation in the IPFR market, this paper proposes an aggregation model and market mechanism for VPPs participating in IPFR. First, an energy-reserve-IPFR market framework is developed, in which a VPP acts as an intermediary to coordinate heterogeneous DERs. Second, by taking into account the delay associated with inertial response, an optimization-based VPP aggregation method is introduced to encapsulate the IPFR process involving a variety of DERs. Third, an energy-reserve-IPFR market mechanism with VPP participation is introduced, aiming to minimize social costs, where stochastic deviations of renewable energy generation are explicitly modeled through chance-constrained reformulations, ensuring that the cleared energy, reserve, and IPFR schedules remain secure against forecast errors. Case studies on IEEE 30-bus and IEEE 118-bus systems show that the nadir and quasi-steady-state frequencies are reproduced by the VPP aggregation model with a mean absolute percentage error &lt;= 0.03%, and the proposed market mechanism with VPP participation reduces the total system cost by approximately 40% and increases the net profit by about 30%.</description>

      <title>Trade relationships during and after a crisis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14150v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I study how firms adjust to temporary disruptions in international trade relationships organized through relational contracts. I exploit an extreme, plausibly exogenous weather shock during the 2010-11 La Ni\~na season that restricted Colombian flower exporters' access to cargo terminals. Using transaction-level data from the Colombian-U.S. flower trade, I show that importers with less-exposed supplier portfolios are less likely to terminate disrupted relationships, instead tolerating shipment delays. In contrast, firms facing greater exposure experience higher partner turnover and are more likely to exit the market, with exit accounting for a substantial share of relationship separations. These findings demonstrate that idiosyncratic shocks to buyer-seller relationships can propagate into persistent changes in firms' trading portfolios.</description>
