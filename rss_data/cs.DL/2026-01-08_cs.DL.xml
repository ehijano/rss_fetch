      <title>Global research trends and collaborations in Fibrodysplasia Ossificans Progressiva: A bibliometric analysis (1989-2023)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fibrodysplasia Ossificans Progressiva (FOP) is a rare and debilitating genetic disorder characterized by the progressive formation of bone in muscles and connective tissues. This scientometric analysis examines the global research trends on FOP between 1989 and 2023 using bibliographic data from Web of Science. The study highlights key patterns in publication productivity, influential journals, institutions, and the geographical distribution of research. The findings reveal that the United States leads both in terms of total publications and citation impact, with significant contributions from the UK, Italy, Japan, and other European countries. Additionally, the analysis identifies the major document types, including articles and reviews, and evaluates the collaborative efforts across institutions. The study offers valuable insights into the global research landscape of FOP, providing a foundation for future studies and international collaborations.</description>

      <title>Examining persistence of European open repository infrastructure and its diffusion in the scholarly record</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article seeks to determine the extent to which the principle of persistence is observed by repositories and the organizations that operate them. We also evaluate the impact that negative repository persistence levels may be having on the scholarly record. We do this by interrogating and combining data about European repositories from several repository registries and web scraped sources, including the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine, thereby creating a unique dataset of historic repository locations and their OAI-PMH endpoints. We then use this data as the basis for text mining CORE, a vast corpus of scholarly outputs, to determine the extent to which impersistent European repository content has permeated the scholarly literature. Our findings indicate over a fifth of European repositories (&gt; 20%) could be classified as 'dead', with an even greater proportion (&gt; 40%) of the machine interfaces associated with these repositories similarly dead. Problematically, our analysis indicates that circa 12,000 unique scholarly works cite, refer to, or actively used this repository content, amounting to circa 19,000 unique repository locations, all of which are now unretrievable from their stated resource location. Partly owing to limitations in available repository registry data and the existence of 'zombie' repositories, there are reasons to conclude that the total number of scholarly works referring to dead repository content is far higher. We also find evidence of dead repository content entering the current scholarly record, a phenomenon we describe as 'dead on arrival' referencing. We consider the implications of these observations, proffer explanations, and propose possible policy interventions to address the issue of repository persistence. Our dataset also enables us to make several observations about the nature of impersistent repositories, their profile, and their decay rate.</description>

      <title>Towards a valid bibliometric measure of epistemic breadth of researchers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02005v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The concept of epistemic breadth of the work of a researcher refers to the scope of their knowledge claims, as reflected in published research reports. Studies of epistemic breadth have been hampered by the lack of a validated measure of the concept. Here we introduce a knowledge space approach to the measurement of epistemic breadth and propose to use the semantic similarity network of an author's publication record to operationalize a measure. In this approach, each paper has its own location in a common abstract vector space based on its content. Proximity in knowledge space corresponds to thematic similarity of publications. Candidate measures of epistemic breadth derived from aggregate similarity values of researchers' bodies of work are tested against external validation data of researchers known to have made a major change in research topic and against self-citation data. We find that some candidate measures co-vary well with known epistemic breadth of researchers in the empirical data and can serve as valid indicators of the concept.</description>

      <title>Code Contribution and Credit in Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16242v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Software development has become essential to scientific research, but its relationship to traditional metrics of scholarly credit remains poorly understood. We develop a dataset of approximately 140,000 paired research articles and code repositories, and a predictive model that matches research article authors with software repository developer accounts. We use this dataset to investigate how software development activities influence credit allocation in collaborative scientific settings. Our findings reveal significant patterns distinguishing software contributions from traditional authorship credit. We find that $\sim$30\% of articles include non-author code contributors -- individuals who participated in software development but received no authorship recognition. While code-contributing authors provide a $\sim$4.2\% increase in article citations, this effect becomes non-significant when controlling for domain, article type, and open access status. First authors are significantly more likely to be code contributors than other author positions. Notably, we identify a negative relationship between coding frequency and scholarly impact metrics. Authors who contribute code more frequently exhibit progressively lower h-indices than non-coding colleagues, even when controlling for publication count, author position, domain, and article type. These results suggest a disconnect between software contributions and credit, highlighting important implications for institutional reward structures and science policy.</description>
