      <title>On the Cooling of Compact Stars in Light of the HESS J1731-347 Remnant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent analyses on the central compact object in the HESS J1731-347 supernova remnant reported not only surprising structural properties (mass $M$ and radius $R$), but also an interesting thermal evolution. More precisely, it has been estimated that $M=0.77^{+0.20}_{-0.17}M_\odot$ and $R=10.4^{+0.86}_{-0.78}$ km (at the $1\sigma$ level), while a redshited surface temperature of $153^{+4}_ {-2}$ keV at an age of 2-6 kyrs has been reported. In the present work, we conduct an in-depth investigation on the possible nature (hadronic, hybrid, quark) of this compact object by attempting to not only explain its mass and radius but also the corresponding estimations for its temperature and age. In the case of hybrid stars we also examine possible effects of the symmetry energy on the activation of different neutrino emitting process, and hence on the resulting cooling curves. We found that the reported temperature and age may be compatible to hadronic stellar configurations regardless of whether pairing effects are included. In the scenario of hybrid stars, we found that the strange quark matter core has to be in a superconducting state in order to reach an agreement with the observational constraints. In addition, the hadronic phase must be soft enough so that the direct Urca process is not activated. Furthermore, we have shown that the considered cooling constraints can be reconciled within the framework of strange stars. However, quark matter has to be in a superconducting state and the quark direct Urca process needs to be blocked.</description>

      <title>Impact of the EPOS.LHC-R hadronic interaction model on the Centaurus A ultrahigh-energy cosmic-ray scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the impact of the recent EPOS.LHC-R hadronic interaction model on the scenario in which most of the cosmic rays with energies above 5 EeV originate in the nearby Centaurus A radiogalaxy. The heavier composition inferred when considering this hadronic model implies that the amount of H and He emitted by the source is reduced compared to what was found with previous hadronic models. The elements of the CNO group play a more predominant role in the instep region just above the ankle while the elements of the Si and Fe groups can contribute significantly in the suppression region of the energy spectrum above 50 EeV. We also obtain the predictions for the amplitude of the dipolar anisotropy in different energy bins above 4 EeV, showing that they can be well consistent with the measurements for appropriate values of the extragalactic turbulent magnetic field and source lifetime. A new method to extract the information on the cosmic ray masses from that of the depth of the maximum development of the air showers is also introduced.</description>

      <title>Numerical Simulations of the Circularized Accretion Flow in Population III Star Tidal Disruption Events. I. The Accretion Flow and the Wind</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tidal Disruption Events (TDEs) have recently been proposed as potential probes for Population III stars. However, the properties of the accretion flow and the wind from the Pop III star TDE system are not clear. By performing radiative hydrodynamic simulations, we study the 'circularized' accretion flow of the Pop III star TDE system. The masses of the black hole (BH) and the disrupted star are $10^6$ and $300$ solar masses, respectively. We focus on the properties of the wind. We find that the black hole accretion rate is highly super-Eddington. A strong wind is driven by radiation pressure. Due to the presence of a strong wind, only $25\%$--$35\%$ of the fallback debris is accreted by the BH. The remaining part is taken away by the wind. The kinetic power of the wind can be as high as $10^{46} {\rm \ erg \ s^{-1}}$. The properties of the wind obtained in this paper may be useful for understanding the radiation properties of Pop III star TDEs in the context of the wind 'reprocessing' model.</description>

      <title>Multiband Gravitational Wave Detection Prospects for M31 UCXB-1 System in Low and Middle Frequency Band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent discovery of M31 UCXB-1, the first extragalactic ultracompact X-ray binary (UCXB) with an orbital period of $T_{\rm orb} \sim 465$ s, presents a unique laboratory for studying close binary evolution and an unprecedented target for continuous gravitational wave (GW) searches. Its identification as a strong candidate black hole-white dwarf (BH-WD) system, combined with its exceptionally short period and high X-ray luminosity, suggests it may be one of the most vital low-frequency GW sources in M31. In this \textit{Letter}, we investigate the detectability of its GW signal for future space-borne detectors in multiband GW detection. We find that while its signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) for low-frequency detectors remains marginal for high-confidence detection, middle-frequency detectors such as DECIGO and BBO are far more promising, potentially achieving S/N $\varrho&gt;8$ within reasonable observational duration. With a primary mass of only $m_1 &gt; 5.4M_\odot$ (or $6.6M_\odot$), the network of all low and middle frequency detector (or BBO alone) is capable of detecting GW from this system with a $\varrho &gt; 8$, during 10-year observation. Furthermore, orbital eccentricity can enhance the GW strain at higher harmonics, further improving its detectability, especially for middle-frequency detectors. This study establishes M31 UCXB-1 as a key prototype of short-period UCXBs, cementing its role as a cornerstone for multiband, multi-messenger astrophysics and a vital bridge between X-ray astronomy and the future GW era.</description>

      <title>VLBI Diagnostics of Off-axis Jets in Radio Flares of Tidal Disruption Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origin of late-time radio flares in tidal disruption events remains unclear. In particular, the peculiar radio flare observed in AT2018hyz has motivated two leading scenarios: a delayed outflow launched $\sim1000\,\rm days$ after discovery, or an off-axis relativistic jet directed far from our line of sight. Very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) imaging provides the most direct way to distinguish between these scenarios. In this paper, we calculate synthetic radio images for both models and examine their observational signatures. The motion of the emission centroid is the most powerful diagnostic for breaking the degeneracy. In the delayed-outflow scenario, the centroid motion is confined within a non-relativistic distance, whereas in the off-axis jet scenario it exhibits apparent superluminal motion. Detecting such superluminal motion would therefore provide a smoking-gun signature of the off-axis jet interpretation. We also find that the jet image exhibits characteristic features, including a non-monotonic evolution of the image aspect ratio. These results are expected to be generic and applicable to other jetted explosions, such as microquasars and gamma-ray bursts.</description>

      <title>Investigating the signs of evolutionary characteristics in the energy spectrum of shock wave acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Under ideal conditions, the theory of shock acceleration for cosmic rays predicts that different elements should exhibit strictly identical spectral indices when accelerated to the same rigidity (R). However, recent high-precision measurements of elemental energy spectra have definitively established the existence of variations in spectral indices across different elements. This study constrains the spectral indices of cosmic-ray elements using AMS-02 and DAMPE observations within the Spatially Dependent Propagation (SDP) model. For elements with A/Z = 2, spectral indices shows significant positive correlations with both atomic number Z and mass number A, likely due to A or Z-dependent fragmentation cross-sections. Predictions indicate that the observed spectra of Ni and Zn will align with the Fe spectrum, while their injection spectra will exhibit slightly softer spectral indices compared to Fe. Future observations from AMS-02, DAMPE and HERD are expected to verify these findings, while theoretical models are needed to systematically explain this phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Spectral State Switching in Mrk 421: Results from the AstroSat LAXPC/SXT Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We carried a detailed time and flux resolved X-ray spectral analysis of the high-synchrotron-peaked blazar Mrk\,421 using simultaneous AstroSat and LAXPC20/SXT observations. The 100\,s binned LAXPC20 light curve obtained during 3--8 January 2017 reveals pronounced flux variability. The source exhibits a fractional variability amplitude of $F_{\mathrm{rms}} = 0.210 \pm 0.005$ in the SXT band and $F_{\mathrm{rms}} = 0.316 \pm 0.006$ in the LAXPC20 band. During this interval, the source reached a peak count rate of 122.94\,counts\,s$^{-1}$. This enabled us to carry flux resolved spectroscopy by selecting ten flux states, S1--S10 each having a width of 8\,counts\,s$^{-1}$. We noted that the spectra in these flux states are well described by a synchrotron-convolved broken power-law (BPL), which consistently provides a better fit than a log-parabola. The low-energy particle index (index before the break) is found to cluster around two discrete values across flux states indicating two spectra states in the source. The break energy consistently moves to high energy with increase in flux level in these states. Time-resolved spectroscopy (10-ks segments) confirms that the flux histogram is best modelled as a double lognormal distribution and the index histogram is bimodal. Inclusion of two additional long observations spanning 2017-2019 shows the same double-state behaviour on longer timescales. Together, the results indicate that Mrk\,421 routinely occupies two dominant spectral; in a leptonic synchrotron framework this can be explained by Gaussian-like fluctuations in acceleration conditions producing lognormal flux states.</description>

      <title>Long-term monitoring of repeating FRB 20220912A with the uGMRT at low radio frequencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Some repeating FRBs exhibit occasional extreme repetition rates, but very few show a sustained high activity level. One such hyperactive repeater is FRB 20220912A, which was discovered by CHIME/FRB Collaboration on 2022 September 12. Here, we present results from a long-term monitoring campaign of FRB 20220912A using the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT) in the frequency range from 300 to 750 MHz. Over the course of nearly two years, we detected a total of 643 bursts in this frequency range. The source exhibited extreme activity for a few months after its discovery and sustained its active phase for over 500 days, with unsystematic modulations in the activity during this phase. The cumulative energy distributions in both bands show a break, consistent with other active repeaters like FRB 20121102A, FRB 202011124A, etc., suggesting common underlying emission mechanisms. Moreover, we show that the energy distribution shape for FRB 20220912A remains broadly same across a large range of frequencies and over time. Overall, the extended high activity, estimated total energy output, persistent power-law tails in the energy distributions, and the lack of detectable short timescale periodicity favor progenitor models invoking young dynamic magnetars, potentially emitting pulses across large rotation phase ranges.</description>

      <title>A Rare Millisecond Pulsar with Cross-Pole Emission: Single-Pulse Insights from PSR J1857+0943</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studies of subpulse variability in millisecond pulsars (MSPs) offer important constraints on their emission physics. Using the high sensitivity of FAST, we present the first identification of distinct single pulse fluctuation behaviour in PSR J1857+0943. We find that the third component(MP\_C3) of the main pulse may originate from a different region than the other two main-pulse components and may instead share a common origin with the interpulse. This conclusion is supported by four observational evidence as follows: First, the LRCCF shows a clear anticorrelation between MP\_C3 and the interpulse. Second, the single-pulse polarization at the main-pulse longitude reveals obvious component mixing. Third, the modulation period of the interpulse components is roughly twice that of MP\_C3. Fourth, the reduced modulation index in MP\_C3 suggests possible mixing of emission from different regions. The interpretation in this letter contrasts with the usual assumption that the main pulse and interpulse originate from opposite magnetic poles. Hence, PSR J1857+0943 provides a rare laboratory for probing component-dependent plasma behaviour in an MSP magnetosphere. Our results offer direct evidence that the main pulse can include emission associated with more than one magnetic pole and highlight the importance of single-pulse diagnostics for understanding the geometry and dynamics of pulsars with interpulse emission. In addition, we analyse the jitter properties of this pulsar and measure a one-hour jitter of $\sigma_{J,1\rm h} = 78 \pm 3~\mathrm{ns}$ at 1.25 GHz, consistent with previous studies.</description>

      <title>The First X-ray Polarimetry of GRS 1739--278 Reveals Its Rapidly Spinning Black Hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a joint spectro-polarimetric analysis of the black hole X-ray binary GRS~1739--278 during its 2025 mini-outburst, using simultaneous observations from \ixpe\ and \nustar. The \ixpe\ data show a polarization degree of ${\rm PD} = (2.3 \pm 0.4)\%$ and a polarization angle of ${\rm PA} = 62^\circ \pm 5^\circ$ in the 2--8~keV range. The model-independent analysis reveals that the PD increases from $\sim 2\%$ at 2~keV to $\sim 10\%$ in the 6--8~keV band, while the PA remains stable across the \ixpe\ band within statistical uncertainties. Broadband spectral modeling of the combined \ixpe\ and \nustar\ datasets shows that hard Comptonization contributes negligibly in this soft-state observation, while a substantial reflected component is required in addition to the thermal disk emission. We then model the \ixpe\ Stokes spectra using the \texttt{kynbbrr} model. The best-fitting results indicate that high-spin configurations enhance the contribution of reflected returning radiation, which dominates the observed polarization properties. From the \texttt{kynbbrr} modeling, we infer an extreme black hole spin of $a = 0.994^{+0.004}_{-0.003}$ and a system inclination of $i = 54^\circ{}^{+8^\circ}_{-4^\circ}$. Owing to the large contribution from returning radiation, the observed polarization direction is nearly parallel to the projected system axis, the position angle of which is predicted to be $58^\circ \pm 4^\circ$. Our results demonstrate that X-ray polarimetry, combined with broadband spectroscopy, directly probes the geometry and relativistic effects in accretion disks around stellar-mass black holes.</description>

      <title>Superradiant and dynamical spin-down of neutron stars with gravitational wave implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutron stars such as pulsars and magnetars lose angular momentum primarily through electromagnetic dipole radiation, gravitational waves, $r$-mode oscillation, and also affected by fallback accretion processes. However, anomalous spin variations, particularly sudden enhanced spin-down rates, indicate additional spin-down mechanisms. We propose superradiant spin-down as a potential explanation for these events. By modelling the interplay between conventional and superradiant spin-down channels, we evaluate their impact on neutron star rotational evolution. We also discuss gravitational-wave emission produced by quadrupole deformation, $r$-mode oscillations, and axion-induced bosonic clouds around an isolated neutron star, highlighting their potential as distinct multimessenger probes in upcoming detectors.</description>

      <title>Multiband optical variability on diverse timescales of the blazar Ton 599 from 2011 to 2023</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: (Shortened)Context: We analyze the optical variability of the FSRQ Ton 599 using BVRI photometry from the WEBT collaboration (2011-2023), complemented by photometric and spectroscopic data from the Steward Observatory.\\ Aims: To characterize short- and long-term optical variability -- including flux distributions, intranight changes, color evolution, and spectra -- to constrain physical parameters and processes in the central engine.\\ Methods: We tested flux distributions in each filter against normal and log-normal, explored the RMS-flux relation and derived PSDs. We quantified intranight variability using a $\chi^2$ test and fractional variability. From variability timescales, we estimated the emitting region size and magnetic field. Long-term variability was studied by segmenting the light curve into 12 intervals and analyzing flux statistics. For multi-filter flares, we computed spectral slopes, redshift-corrected fluxes, monochromatic luminosities and generated Color-magnitude and color-time diagrams. From low-flux spectra, we measured Mg II line and estimated the black hole mass.\\ Results: Ton 599 showed strong optical variability. Log-normal distributions fit the fluxes better, and all bands show a positive RMS-flux relation with red-noise PSDs.Intranight variability is detected, and used in constraining the emission region and magnetic field.The R band reaches a peak flux of 23.5 mJy, corresponding to a monochromatic luminosity of $log({\nu}L{\nu})= 48.48 [erg/s]$. We found a redder-when-brighter trend at low fluxes (thermal), achromatic behavior at intermediate levels (possibly due to jet orientation changes), and a bluer-when-brighter trend at high fluxes (synchrotron). Long-term color changes are modest, short-term are significant, with a negative correlation between the amplitude of color changes and the average flux. The estimated SMBH mass is order of $10^8 M_\odot$.</description>

      <title>Inferring Eccentricity of Binary Black Holes from Spin-Orbit Misalignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Orbital eccentricity remains one of the least accessible parameters in observations of binary black hole (BBH) systems, largely erased by gravitational radiation long before detection. We introduce a new method to recover this lost parameter by using a more accessible and routinely measurable quantity: spin-orbit misalignment. In isolated binary evolution, a natal kick from the second supernova both tilts the orbital plane and injects orbital eccentricity, forging a direct and quantifiable connection between spin-tilt and post-supernova eccentricity. By measuring this spin-tilt using gravitational waves, we can not only constrain the natal kick, but we can also reconstruct the binary's formation eccentricity. We apply this method to GW190412 and GW241011, assuming an isolated formation channel, and show how their eccentricity at formation can be constrained even in the absence of direct eccentricity measurements. As more advanced detectors come online, improved signal-to-noise ratios will tighten spin-tilt constraints, allowing more precise and reliable estimates of BBH formation eccentricity. Combining this method with multiband observations from LISA and next-generation (XG) detectors will allow us to recover not only eccentricity but also the binary's orbital separation and redshift at formation, offering a clearer picture of the birth environments of BBH systems and processes that drive their merger.</description>

Abstract: Supernovae (SNe), the catastrophic end of stars' lives, are among the most energetic phenomena in the universe. Mapping the aftermath of the explosions to the properties of pre-SN stars is challenging due to the lack of knowledge about the evolution of different types of stars. The immediate surroundings of pre-SN stars carry the signature of the progenitors, and radio observations are the best way to examine the ambient media. Since radio emission originates from the interaction of supersonic SN ejecta with the relatively stationary circumstellar medium, with a few years of radio study, the mass-loss history of progenitor stars can be probed from just before the explosion of the star to thousands of years before the onset of the SN. Moreover, this can provide crucial details about the explosions, which are poorly understood to date. In this paper, we review the radio properties of different types of core-collapse explosions and thermonuclear runaways to understand their mass-loss evolution--which allows us to unravel the imprints of the progenitors on the surrounding media and thus the nature of the exploded stars. Additionally, we discuss the current state of the art in this field, including existing and the next-generation radio facilities with enhanced capabilities that provide further details about these explosions.</description>

      <title>ESO Expanding Horizons White Paper: Electromagnetic counterparts of massive BH mergers with LISA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), adopted by ESA and scheduled for the second half of the next decade, will drive a new revolution in the rapidly growing field of gravitational-wave astronomy, by extending GW observations into the hiterto unexplored millihertz regime. One of the key source classes of LISA is merging massive black hole binaries in the 1e4-1e7 Msun mass range detectable to very high redshifts $z\sim 15$. MBHBs lighter than 1e6 Msun can potentially be identified during their inspiral weeks before coalescence, allowing for complementary electromagnetic observations before, during, and after the two MBHs merge. This white paper aims at defining the optimal strategy to maximize the number of detected EM counterparts of LISA MBHB events.</description>

      <title>Neural Network for Simulating Radio Emission from Extensive Air Showers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.21407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmic ray shower detection using large radio arrays has gained significant traction in recent years. With massive improvements in signal modelling and microscopic simulations, the analysis of incoming events is still severely limited by the simulation cost of radio emission to interpret the data. In this work, we show that a neural network can be used for simulating such radio pulses. This work serves as a proof of concept that simple neural networks can be used for emergent deterministic macroscopic phenomena of microscopic simulations. We also demonstrate how such a neural network can be used for the physics use case of $X_\mathrm{max}$ reconstruction, while retaining comparable resolution to using full Monte-Carlo simulations for radio emission.

      <title>Pre-Supernova (Anti)Neutrino Emission Due to Weak-Interaction Reactions with Hot Nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21604v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reliable predictions of (anti)neutrino spectra and luminosities are essential for assessing the feasibility of detecting pre-supernova neutrinos. Using the stellar evolution code MESA, we calculate the (anti)neutrino spectra and luminosities under realistic conditions of temperature, density, and electron fraction. Our study includes (anti)neutrinos produced by both thermal processes and nuclear weak-interaction reactions. By comparing the results of the thermal quasiparticle random-phase approximation with the standard technique based on the effective $Q$-value method, we investigate how thermal effects influence the spectra and luminosities of emitted (anti)neutrinos. Our findings show that a thermodynamically consistent treatment of Gamow--Teller transitions in hot nuclei enhances both the energy luminosity and the average energies of the emitted (anti)neutrinos.</description>

      <title>A self-consistent 3D MHD model producing a solar blowout jet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. Solar blowout jets are a distinct subclass of ubiquitous extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) and X-ray coronal jets. Aims. Most existing models of blowout jets prescribe an initial magnetic field configurations and apply ad-hoc changes in the photosphere to trigger the jets. In contrast, we aim for a self-consistent magneto-convective description of the jet initiation. Methods. We employ a 3D radiation magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model of a solar coronal hole region using the MURaM code. The computational domain extends from the upper convection zone to the lower corona. We synthesize the emission in the extreme UV and X-rays for a direct comparison to observations and examine the evolution of the magnetic field structure of the event. Results. In the simulation a twisted flux tube forms self-consistently, emerges through the surface and interacts with the pre-existing open field. Initially the resulting jet is of the standard type with a narrow spire. The release of the twist into the open field causes a broadening of the jet spire turning the jet into a blowout type. At the same time this creates a fast heating front propagating at the local Alfv\'en speed. The properties of the modeled jet closely match observations of blowout jets: a slow (180 km/s) mass upflow and a fast (500 km/s) propagating front form, the latter being a signature of the heating front. Also the timing of the jet with respect to the flux emergence and subsequent cancellation matches observations. Conclusions. The near-surface magneto-convection self-consistently generates a twisted flux tube that emerges through the photosphere. The tube then interacts with the pre-existing magnetic field by means of interchange reconnection. This transfers the twist to the open field region and produces a blowout jet that matches the main characteristics of this type of jet found in observations.</description>

      <title>Methods for Detecting Gravitational Waves from mini-Extreme-Mass-Ratio Inspirals I: Statistics Based on Time-Frequency Signal Tracks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21738v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mini-extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (mini-EMRIs), composed of a stellar-mass compact object and a much lighter companion, are promising sources of continuous gravitational waves in the frequency band of ground-based interferometers such as LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA. Such systems, consisting of sub-solar-mass compact objects, provide a unique probe of exotic compact objects, including primordial black holes. Detecting such long-lived signals, however, remains challenging. Here, we adapt standard methods used in searches for quasi-monochromatic signals to search for mini-EMRIs, and derive a statistical framework that explicitly handles spectral leakage. In particular, we introduce a new method that sums along the tracks in the time-frequency plane carved out by possible mini-EMRI signals, which we call $\Sigma$Track. This refinement establishes a general basis for analyzing long-duration transient signals with rapid frequency evolutions, regardless of the underlying mechanism for gravitational-wave emission. We also compute a new semi-analytic sensitivity estimate within our new statistical framework, which is valid under the assumption that the signal is weak with respect to the noise level. We then establish a statistic that quantifies how to discretize the search parameter space for our method, which works for mini-EMRIs, as well as arbitrary signal types. Our results provide a foundation for mini-EMRI searches and demonstrate the potential of current ground-based detectors to probe the existence of sub-solar-mass compact objects.</description>

      <title>Methods for Detecting Gravitational Waves from mini-Extreme-Mass-Ratio Inspirals II: A Spectral-Leakage-Aware Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mini-Extreme-Mass-Ratio Inspirals (mini-EMRIs), comprising a sub-solar exotic compact object (such as a primordial black hole or boson star) orbiting a much heavier stellar-origin or exotic compact object, represent key targets for ground-based gravitational-wave detectors to probe the early universe and the nature of dark matter. However, detecting such systems, which could spend hours to years in LIGO, Virgo and KAGRA data, poses a computational challenge to standard matched-filtering methods. However, semi-coherent methods are constrained by the quasi-monochromatic assumption, which restricts the coherence time to avoid spectral leakage caused by frequency evolution. In this work, we extend the development of our method, $\Sigma$Track, to the regime in which the quasi-monochromatic approximation is relaxed, in two ways. First, we establish an analytical model for the spectral leakage, extending the validity of conventional analyses beyond the quasi-monochromatic regime. Second, we propose the $\Sigma R$ statistic -- a novel detection metric formed by a weighted summation of power ratios -- which effectively recovers the signal energy dispersed across adjacent frequency bins. Building on this framework, we further introduce an innovative frequency-layered search strategy that dynamically optimizes the coherence time across the observation band. We benchmark our method against a globally optimized Hough transform pipeline using a fiducial mini-EMRI signal from a binary with masses $(1.5, 10^{-5})\,M_\odot$. The results demonstrate that our framework achieves an order-of-magnitude enhancement in the effective detection volume, significantly expanding the horizon for discovering mini-EMRIs and sub-solar exotic compact objects with ground-based gravitational wave detectors. This approach can be similarly applied to EMRI searches for future space-based gravitational wave detectors.</description>

      <title>Detection of very high-energy gamma-ray emission from the radio galaxy M87 with LHAASO</title>

Abstract: The nearby radio galaxy M87 is a very-high-energy (VHE) gamma-ray emitter established by observations with ground-based gamma-ray detectors. Here we report the long-term monitoring of M87 from 2021 to 2024 with Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO). M87 has been detected by LHAASO with a statistical significance $\sim 9\sigma$. The observed energy spectrum extends to 20 TeV, with a possible hardening at $\sim 20$ TeV and then a clear softening at higher energies. Assuming that the intrinsic spectrum is described by a single power law up to 20 TeV, a tight upper bound on the extragalactic background light (EBL) intensity is obtained. A strong VHE flare lasting eight days, with the rise time of $\tau_{r}^{\rm rise} = 1.05\pm0.49$~days and decay time of $\tau_{d}^{\rm decay} = 2.17\pm0.58$~days, was found in early 2022. A possible GeV flare is seen also in the Fermi-LAT data during the VHE flare period. The variability time as short as one day seen in the LHAASO data suggests a compact emission region with a size of $\sim 3\times 10^{15}\delta\, {\rm cm}$ ($\delta$ being the Doppler factor of the emitting region), corresponding to a few Schwarzschild radii of the central supermassive black hole in M87. The continuous monitoring of the source reveals a duty cycle of $\sim 1\%$ for VHE flares with a flux above $ 10^{-11}{\rm~erg~cm^{-2}~s^{-1}}$.</description>

      <title>Sombrero Galaxy as an Accelerator of Ultrahigh Energy Cosmic Ray Nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13315v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by a recent proposal that points to the Sombrero galaxy as a source of the highest energy cosmic rays, we investigate the feasibility of accelerating light and heavy nuclei in the supermassive black hole located at the center of this dormant galaxy. We show that cosmic ray nuclei concentrated in the immediate vicinity of the supermassive black hole could be efficiently accelerated up to the maximum observed energies without suffering catastrophic spallations. Armed with our findings we stand against the conventional wisdom and conjecture that accelerators of the highest energy cosmic rays must anti-correlate with the (electromagnetic) source power.</description>

      <title>Precise measurements of the cosmic ray proton energy spectrum in the "knee'' region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14447v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the high-purity identification of cosmic-ray (CR) protons and a precise measurement of their energy spectrum from 0.15 to 12 PeV using the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO). Abundant event statistics, combined with the simultaneous detection of electrons/photons, muons, and Cherenkov light in air showers, enable spectroscopic measurements with statistical and systematic precision comparable to satellite data at lower energies. The proton spectrum shows significant hardening relative to low-energy extrapolations, culminating at 3 PeV, followed by sharp softening. This distinct spectral structure closely aligned with the knee in the all-particle spectrum points to the emergence of a new CR component at PeV energies that might be linked to the dozens of PeVatrons recently discovered by LHAASO, and offers crucial clues to the origin of Galactic cosmic rays.</description>

      <title>Search for Lorentz Invariance Violation with spectral lags of GRB 190114C using profile likelihood</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05737v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We search for Lorentz invariance violation (LIV) using the spectral lag data for GRB 190114C using frequentist analysis, where we deal with the astrophysical nuisance parameters using profile likelihood. For this use case, we find a global minima for the $\chi^2$ as a function of energy scale of LIV ($E_{QG}$), well below the Planck scale. The best-fit $2\sigma$ central intervals for $E_{QG}$ are given by $2.81^{+0.96}_{-0.72}\times 10^{14}$ GeV and $9.10^{+2.59}_{-0.64}\times 10^{5}$ for linear and quadratic LIV, respectively and agree with the Bayesian estimates hitherto obtained in a previous work. Therefore, the results from frequentist analysis GRB 190114C agrees with Bayesian analysis and presents yet another proof of principles applications of profile likelihood in the search for LIV.</description>

      <title>NICER Magnetar Burst Catalog</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12291v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a comprehensive catalog of short bursts from magnetars based on eight years of NICER observations. A total of 1130 bursts were identified, making this the largest magnetar burst catalog to date. The sample is dominated by SGR 1935+2154, which contributes 76% of all detected bursts. We analyzed burst durations, spectral properties, and their correlations across multiple sources. Bursts from SGR 1935+2154 exhibit significantly longer durations, with a mean of 317 ms, compared to a mean of 23 ms for bursts from other magnetars. Two microsecond-scale bursts were detected for the first time, originating from 1E 1048.1-5937 and CXOU J010043.1-721134. Spectral analysis in the 0.5--8 keV range using both blackbody and power-law models shows that bursts with higher fluences have harder spectra. In contrast, correlations between burst duration and spectral parameters are weak or absent. This catalog provides a valuable dataset for studying magnetar short bursts, enabling future modeling efforts and improving our understanding of the diversity and physical mechanisms of magnetar bursts.</description>

      <title>Minijets and Broken Stationarity in a Blazar : Novel Insights into the Origin of $\gamma$-ray Variability in CTA 102</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21240v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-energy blazar light curves, in X-rays and beyond, have historically preferred a log-normal flux distribution, signifying multiplicative processes either in the jet itself or due to connection(s) with accretion. Here we present 18 year archival Fermi-LAT light curves (0.1-100 GeV) of the flat spectrum radio quasar (FSRQ) CTA 102 from August 2008 to November 2025, which underwent a huge flare in 2017, with a $\sim$ factor of 100 jump in $\gamma$-ray flux, along with similar flaring in X-rays. Our statistical analyses confirm that neither the pre nor the post-flare total GeV light curves follow a strictly log-normal distribution. Instead, we observe a statistically significant reduction in skewness from the pre to the post-flare light curves, which implies the blazar transitioned from an energetic state with frequent flaring to a more plateaued state with occasional flaring. We further find that this state transition can be explained through magnetic relaxation, where many reconnection events caused the 2017 flare, after which the magnetic field was ordered and its energy reached a minimum. To explain this further, we use a Monte Carlo simulation of a modified minijets-in-a-jet model where GeV flares are produced only when a maximum number of minijets move toward the broad line region and towards the line of sight, in the context of an external Compton model. The flux distributions (both observed and simulated) could be fit by a modified log-normal power-law distribution, implying our minijets model can reproduce the GeV flares in CTA 102 as well as their flux distributions.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Bayesian model selection for equation of state of cold neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03831v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a computational framework, Bayesian Evidence calculation fOr Model Selection (BEOMS) to evaluate multiple Bayesian model selection methods in the context of determining the equation of state (EOS) for cold neutron star (NS), focusing on their performance with current and next-generation gravitational wave (GW) observatories. We conduct a systematic comparison of various EOS models by using posterior distributions obtained from EOS-agnostic Bayesian inference of binary parameters applied to GWs from a population of binary neutron star (BNS) mergers. The cumulative evidence for each model is calculated in a multi-dimensional parameter space characterized by neutron star masses and tidal deformabilities. Our findings indicate that Bayesian model selection is most effective when performed in the two-dimensional subspace of component mass and tidal deformability, requiring fewer events to distinguish between EOS models with high confidence. Furthermore, we establish a relationship between the precision of tidal deformability measurements and the accuracy of model selection, taking into account the evolving sensitivities of current and planned GW observatories. BEOMS offers computational efficiency and can be adapted to execute model selection for gravitational wave data from other sources.</description>

      <title>High-energy astrochemistry in the molecular interstellar medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10060v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the past decade, there has been a significant shift in astrochemistry with a renewed focus on the role of non-thermal processes on the molecular interstellar medium, in particular energetic particles (such as cosmic ray particles and fast electrons) and X-ray radiation. This has been brought about in large part due to new observations of interstellar complex organic molecules (iCOMS) in environments that would inhibit their formation, such as cold, dense gas in prestellar cores or in the highly energetic environments in galactic centers. In parallel, there has been a plethora of new laboratory investigations on the role of high-energy radiation and electrons on the chemistry of astrophysical ices, demonstrating the ability of this radiation to induce complex chemistry. In recent years, theoretical models have also begun to include newer cosmic-ray-driven processes in both the gas and ice phases. In this review, we unify aspects of the chemistry driven by X-ray radiation and energetic particles into a ``high-energy astrochemistry'', defining this term and reviewing the underlying chemical processes. We conclude by examining various laboratories where high-energy astrochemistry is at play and identify future issues to be tackled.</description>
