      <title>Fading ergodicity meets maximal chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fading ergodicity provides a theoretical framework for understanding deviations from the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) near ergodicity-breaking transitions. In this work, we demonstrate that the breakdown of the ETH at the interaction-driven ergodicity-breaking critical point in the quantum sun model gives rise to to the maximally divergent fidelity susceptibility. We further extend our analysis to the energy-driven ergodicity-breaking transition associated with the many-body mobility edge. Specifically, we show that fidelity susceptibilities at energies away from the middle of the spectrum exhibit a divergent peak near the mobility edge. Finally, we argue that fading ergodicity provides a simple and accurate description of the ETH breakdown in the quantum sun model, which is accompanied with the emergence of a peak in fidelity susceptibility and the onset of maximal chaos at the ergodicity-breaking critical point.</description>

      <title>Energy diffusion in the long-range interacting spin systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate energy diffusion in long-range interacting spin systems, where the interaction decays algebraically as $V(r) \propto r^{-\alpha}$ with the distance $r$ between the sites. We consider prototypical spin systems, the transverse Ising model, and the XYZ model in the $D$-dimensional lattice with finite $\alpha &gt;D$ which guarantees the thermodynamic extensivity. In one dimension, both normal and anomalous diffusion are observed, where the anomalous diffusion is attributed to anomalous enhancement of the amplitude of the equilibrium current correlation. We prove the power-law clustering property of arbitrary orders of joint cumulants in general dimensions. Applying this theorem to equal-time current correlations, we further prove several theorems leading to the statement that the sufficient condition for normal diffusion in one dimension is $\alpha &gt; 3/2$ regardless of the models. The fluctuating hydrodynamics approach consistently explains L\'{e}vy diffusion for $\alpha &lt; 3/2$, which implies the condition is optimal. In higher dimensions of $D \geq 2$, normal diffusion is indicated as long as $\alpha &gt; D$. Pecular behavior for $\alpha &lt;D$ is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Panoscopic non-equilibrium fluctuation identity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantifying and characterizing fluctuations far away from equilibrium is a challenging task. We introduce and experimentally confirm an identity for a driven classical system, relating the different non-equilibrium cumulants of the observable conjugate to the driving protocol. The identity is valid from micro- to macroscopic length scales, and it encompasses the fluctuation dissipation theorem. We apply it in experiments of a Brownian probe particle confined and driven by an optical potential and suspended in a nonlinear and non-Markovian fluid.</description>

      <title>Identities for nonlinear memory kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Perturbing a system far away from equilibrium via a time dependent protocol can formally be described by a nonlinear Volterra series expansion. Here we derive identities for the nonlinear memory kernels arising in such nonlinear expansion, including the possibility of a nonlinear coupling between perturbation and system. These identities rely on local detailed balance, and they include the fluctuation dissipation theorem as the lowest order identity. We test them in simulations for driven over- and underdamped Brownian particles. These identities for memory kernels can be recast in a series relation for the non-equilibrium cumulants of the observable conjugate to the driving and the observable described by the Volterra series.</description>

      <title>Planckian Bounds From Local Uncertainty Relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce ``local uncertainty relations'' in thermal many-body systems, from which fundamental bounds in quantum systems can be derived. These lead to universal non-relativistic speed limits (independent of interaction range) and transport coefficient bounds (e.g., those of the diffusion constant and viscosity) that are compared against experimental data.</description>

      <title>Modeling biases in binary decision-making within the generalized nonlinear q-voter model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10172v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Binary decision frameworks are widely used in the social sciences, including management and economics, to understand collective behavior. In group decision-making, opinions evolve through social influence, shaping outcomes that lead to either consensus or polarization. The $q$ voter model, also known as the non-linear voter model, has been extensively studied in this context. However, the impact of an individual's current opinion on their future stance has been largely overlooked. To fill this gap, we introduce a generalized model in which an agent's opinion depends not only on its neighbors but also on its own state. As in the original $q$-voter model, a unanimous influence group of size $q$ causes the agent to adopt the group's opinion. However, if the group is not unanimous, the agent will change its opinion with a probability influenced by its current state. This introduces a bias toward a choice that reflects external factors such as politics or advertising. Our model generalizes previous $q$-voter models, including the original one, while allowing for a wider range of scenarios. We analyze the model on a complete graph, deriving the phase diagram and the exit probability for finite systems. We support our analytical approach with Monte Carlo simulations and show that they overlap even for small systems of size $N=64$. Our results show that the exit probability depends on $q$. For $q \geq 3$, the exit probability exhibits a shape that was not observed in previous models, which implies that increasing initial support for a decision does not necessarily change the final collective outcome.</description>

      <title>Superballistic paradox in electron fluids: Evidence of tomographic transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electron hydrodynamics encompasses the exotic fluid-like behavior of electrons in two-dimensional materials such as graphene. It accounts for superballistic conduction, also known as the Gurzhi effect, where increasing temperature reduces the electrical resistance. In analogy with conventional fluids, the Gurzhi effect is only expected in the hydrodynamic regime, with the decrease in the resistance occurring at intermediate temperatures. Nonetheless, experiments on electron fluids consistently show that superballistic conduction starts at close-to-zero temperatures. To address this paradox, we study hydrodynamic flow, and we find that replacing the classical dynamics with tomographic dynamics, where only head-on collisions are allowed between electrons, solves the dilemma. The latter strengthens superballistic conduction, with potential applications in low-dissipation devices, and explains its differences with the Molenkamp effect and conventional fluids dynamics. Our study reveals that the superballistic paradox is resolved by considering the electrons not as classical particles but as fermions.</description>

      <title>Unconventional Transport in a System with a Tower of Quantum Many-Body Scars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10387v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the observation of unconventional transport phenomena in a spin-1 model that supports a tower of quantum many-body scars, and we discuss their properties uncovering their peculiar nature. In quantum many-body systems, the late-time dynamics of local observables are typically governed by conserved operators with local densities, such as energy and magnetization. In the model under investigation, however, there is an additional dynamical symmetry restricted to the subspace of the Hilbert space spanned by the quantum many-body scars. That significantly slows the decay of autocorrelation functions of certain coherent states and is responsible for an unconventional form of transport. We show that excited states with energy close to that of the quantum many-body scars play a crucial role in sustaining the transport; counterintuitively, quantum many-body scars are completely irrelevant for the aforementioned mechanism. Finally, we propose a generalized eigenstate thermalization hypothesis to describe specific properties of states with energy close to the scars.</description>

      <title>Fluctuation theorems for quasistatic work</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.16337v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When a thermally isolated system performs a driving process in the quasistatic regime, its variation of average energy is equal to its quasistatic work. Even though presenting this simple definition, few attempts have been made to describe such quantity from the fluctuation theorem point of view. In this work, based on Jarzynski's equality, four forms of such equality are deduced. To corroborate the result, a relation with the strong inequality $\langle W\rangle\ge \langle W_{\rm qs}\rangle$ is pursued. It is concluded in the end that any of the fluctuation theorems deduced cannot derive such a postulate. Also, no contradiction is observed if the strong inequality breaks down.</description>

      <title>Fluctuation theorem for time-averaged work</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.17016v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There is evidence that taking the time average of the work performed by a thermally isolated system effectively "transforms" the adiabatic process into an isothermal one. This approach allows inherent quantities of adiabatic processes to be accessed through the definitions of isothermal processes. A fluctuation theorem is then established, linking the time-averaged work to the quasistatic work. Numerical evidence supporting this equality is provided for a classical harmonic oscillator with a driven linear equilibrium position parameter. Furthermore, the strong inequality for the average work is derived from the deduced fluctuation theorem using optimality arguments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06142v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the critical relaxation of the Ising model, the so-called model A, and study its operator product expansion. Within perturbation theory, we focus on the operator product expansions of the two-point function and the response function. At the fixed point, we normalize the coefficients and the scaling variables so that the result displays universality. The role of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem is also discussed, and it is shown that it provides non-perturbative relations among the operator product expansion coefficients. Finally, the large N limit is considered.</description>

      <title>Memory-induced long-range order in dynamical systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06834v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Time non-locality, or memory, is a non-equilibrium property shared by all physical systems. Here, we show that memory is sufficient to induce a phase of spatial long-range order (LRO) even if the system's primary dynamical variables are coupled locally. This occurs when the memory degrees of freedom have slower dynamics than the primary degrees of freedom. In addition, such an LRO phase is non-perturbative, and can be understood through the lens of a correlated percolation transition of the fast degrees of freedom mediated by memory. When the two degrees of freedom have comparable time scales, the length of the effective long-range interaction shortens. We exemplify this behavior with a model of locally coupled spins and a single dynamic memory variable, but our analysis is sufficiently general to suggest that memory could induce a phase of LRO in a much wider variety of physical systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12863v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform a principal component analysis (PCA) of two one-dimensional lattice models belonging to distinct nonequilibrium universality classes - directed bond percolation and branching and annihilating random walks with even number of offspring. We find that the uncentered PCA of datasets storing various system's configurations can be successfully used to determine the critical properties of these nonequilibrium phase transitions. In particular, in both cases, we obtain good estimates of the critical point and the dynamical critical exponent of the models. For directed bond percolation we are, furthermore, able to extract critical exponents associated with the correlation length and the order parameter. We discuss the relation of our analysis with low-rank approximations of datasets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16974v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the monitored quantum dynamics of Gaussian mixed states and derive the universal Fokker-Planck equations that govern the stochastic time evolution of entire density-matrix spectra, obtaining their exact solutions. From these equations, we reveal an even-odd effect in purification dynamics: whereas entropy exhibits exponential decay for an even number $N$ of complex fermions, algebraic decay with divergent purification time occurs for odd $N$ as a manifestation of dynamical criticality. Additionally, we identify the universal fluctuations of entropy in the chaotic regime, serving as a non-unitary counterpart of the universal conductance fluctuations in mesoscopic electronic transport phenomena. Furthermore, we elucidate and classify the universality classes of non-unitary quantum dynamics based on fundamental symmetry. We also validate the universality of these analytical results through extensive numerical simulations across different types of models.</description>

      <title>Ergodicity breaking and restoration in models of heat transport with microscopic reversibility</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00430v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The behavior of lattice models in which time reversibility is enforced at the level of trajectories (microscopic reversibility) is studied analytically. Conditions for ergodicity breaking are explored, and a few examples of systems characterized by an additional conserved quantity besides energy are presented. All the systems are characterized by ergodicity restoration when put in contact with a thermal bath, except for specific choices of the interactions between the atoms in the system and the bath. The study shows that the additional conserved quantities return to play a role in non-equilibrium conditions. The similarities with the behavior of some mesoscale systems, in which the transition rates satisfy detailed balance but not microscopic reversibility, are discussed.</description>

      <title>The $S=\frac{1}{2}$ XY and XYZ models on the two or higher dimensional hypercubic lattice do not possess nontrivial local conserved quantities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18504v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the $S=\frac{1}{2}$ quantum spin system on the $d$-dimensional hypercubic lattice with $d\ge2$ with uniform nearest-neighbor interaction of the XY or XYZ type and arbitrary uniform magnetic field. By extending the method recently developed for quantum spin chains, we prove that the model possesses no local conserved quantities except for the trivial ones, such as the Hamiltonian. This result strongly suggests that the model is non-integrable. We note that our result applies to the XX model without a magnetic field, which is one of the easiest solvable models in one dimension.</description>

      <title>Dynamical invariant based shortcut to equilibration in open quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11659v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose using the dynamical invariant also known as the Lewis-Riesenfeld invariant, to speed-up the equilibration of a driven open quantum system. This allows us to reverse engineer the time-dependent master equation that describes the dynamics of the open quantum system and systematically derive a protocol that realizes a shortcut to equilibration. The method does not require additional constraints on the timescale of the dynamics beside the Born-Markov approximation and can be generically applied to boost single particle quantum engines significantly. We demonstrate it with the damped harmonic oscillator, and show that our protocol can achieve a high-fidelity control in shorter timescales than simple non-optimized protocols. We find that the system is heated during the dynamics to speed-up the equilibration, which can be considered as an analogue of the Mpemba effect in quantum control.</description>

      <title>Competing structures in a minimal double-well potential model of condensed matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17901v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The microscopic structure of several amorphous substances often reveals complex patterns such as medium- or long-range order, spatial heterogeneity, and even local polycrystallinity. To capture all these features, models usually incorporate a refined description of the particle interaction that includes an ad hoc design of the inside of the system constituents, and use temperature as a control parameter. We show that all these features can emerge from a minimal athermal two-dimensional model where particles interact isotropically by a double-well potential, which includes an excluded volume and a maximum coordination number. The rich variety of structural patterns shown by this simple geometrical model apply to a wide range of real systems including water, silicon, and different amorphous materials.</description>

      <title>Quantum Chaos in Random Ising Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14376v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report a systematic investigation of universal quantum chaotic signatures in the transverse field Ising model on an Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi network. This is achieved by studying local spectral measures such as the level spacing and the level velocity statistics. A spectral form factor analysis is also performed as a global measure, probing energy level correlations at arbitrary spectral distances. Our findings show that these measures capture the breakdown of chaotic behavior upon varying the connectivity and strength of the transverse field in various regimes. We demonstrate that the level spacing statistics and the spectral form factor signal this breakdown for sparsely and densely connected networks. The velocity statistics capture the surviving chaotic signatures in the sparse limit. However, these integrable-like regimes extend over a vanishingly small segment in the full range of connectivity.</description>

      <title>Annealing Dynamics of Regular Rotor Networks: Universality and Its Breakdown</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09316v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The spin-vector Monte Carlo model is widely used as a benchmark for the classicality of quantum annealers but severely restricts the time evolution. The spin-vector Langevin (SVL) model has been proposed and tested as an alternative, closely reproducing the real-time dynamics of physical quantum annealers such as D-Wave machines in the dissipative regime. We investigate the SVL annealing dynamics of classical O(2) rotors on regular graphs, identifying universal features in the nonequilibrium dynamics when changing the range of interactions and the topology of the graph. Regular graphs with low connectance or edge density exhibit universal scaling dynamics consistent with the Kibble-Zurek mechanism, which leads to a power-law dependence of the density of defects and the residual energy as a function of the annealing time. As the interaction range is increased, the power-law scaling is suppressed, and an exponential scaling with the annealing time sets in. Our results establish a universal breakdown of the Kibble-Zurek mechanism in classical systems characterized by long-range interactions, in sharp contrast with previous findings in the quantum domain.</description>

      <title>Non-Adiabatic Quantum Optimization for Crossing Quantum Phase Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09596v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the optimal driving of the ground state of a many-body quantum system across a quantum phase transition in finite time. In this context, excitations caused by the breakdown of adiabaticity can be minimized by adjusting the schedule of the control parameter that drives the transition. Drawing inspiration from the Kibble-Zurek mechanism, we characterize the timescale of onset of adiabaticity for several optimal control procedures. Our analysis reveals that schedules relying on local adiabaticity, such as Roland-Cerf's local adiabatic driving and the quantum adiabatic brachistochrone, fail to provide a significant speedup over the adiabatic evolution in the transverse-field Ising and long-range Kitaev models. As an alternative, we introduce a novel framework, Non-Adiabatic Quantum Optimization (NAQO), that, by exploiting the Landau-Zener formula and taking into account the role of higher-excited states, outperforms schedules obtained via both local adiabaticity and state-of-the-art numerical optimization. NAQO is not restricted to exactly solvable models, and we further confirm its superior performance in a disordered non-integrable model.</description>

      <title>Persistent Topological Negativity in a High-Temperature Mixed-State</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00066v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the entanglement structure of the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state as it thermalizes under a strongly-symmetric quantum channel describing the Metropolis-Hastings dynamics for the $d$-dimensional classical Ising model at inverse temperature $\beta$. This channel outputs the classical Gibbs state when acting on a product state in the computational basis. When applying this channel to a GHZ state in spatial dimension $d&gt;1$, the resulting mixed state changes character at the Ising phase transition temperature from being long-range entangled to short-range-entangled as temperature increases. Nevertheless, we show that the topological entanglement negativity of a large region is insensitive to this transition and takes the same value as that of the pure GHZ state at any finite temperature $\beta&gt;0$. We establish this result by devising a local operations and classical communication (LOCC) ``decoder" that provides matching lower and upper bounds on the negativity in the thermodynamic limit which may be of independent interest. This perspective connects the negativity to an error-correction problem on the $(d-1)$-dimensional bipartitioning surface and explains the persistent negativity in certain correlated noise models found in previous studies. Numerical results confirm our analysis.</description>

      <title>A fluctuation-dissipation theorem perspective on radiative responses to temperature perturbations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12585v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Radiative forcing drives warming in the Earth system, leading to changes in sea surface temperatures (SSTs) and associated radiative feedbacks. The link between changes in the top-of-the-atmosphere (TOA) net radiative flux and SST patterns, known as the "pattern effect", is typically diagnosed by studying the response of atmosphere-only models to SST perturbations. In this work, we diagnose the pattern effect through response theory, by performing idealized warming perturbation experiments from unperturbed data alone. First, by studying the response at short time scales, where the response is dominated by atmospheric variability, we recover results that agree with the literature. Second, by extending the framework to longer time scales, we capture coupled interactions between the slow ocean component and the atmosphere, yielding a novel "sensitivity map" quantifying the response of the net radiative flux to SST perturbations in the coupled system. Here, feedbacks are captured by a spatiotemporal response operator, rather than time-independent maps as in traditional studies. Both formulations skillfully reconstruct changes in externally forced simulations and provide practical strategies for climate studies. The key distinction lies in their perspectives on climate feedbacks. The first formulation, closely aligned with prediction tasks, follows the traditional view in which slow variables, such as SSTs, exert a one-way influence on fast variables. The second formulation broadens this perspective by incorporating spatiotemporal interactions across state variables. This alternative approach explores how localized SST perturbations can alter the coupled dynamics, leading to temperature changes in remote areas and further impacting the radiative fluxes at later times.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19036v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using quantum equations of motion for interacting bosons, stochastic molecular dynamics simulations with quantized momenta are performed for Lennard-Jones helium-4. The viscosity of the quantum liquid is significantly less than that of the classical liquid, being almost 5 times smaller at the lowest temperature studied. The classical and quantum liquids are identical except for Bose-Einstein condensation, which pinpoints the molecular mechanism for superfluidity. The results rely on the existence of stochastic but real particle trajectories, which has implications for the interpretation of quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>Entanglement enhancement induced by noise in inhomogeneously monitored systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06712v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study how stronger noise can enhance the entanglement in inhomogeneously monitored quantum systems. We consider a free fermions model composed of two coupled chains - a system chain and an ancilla chain, each subject to its own different noise - and explore the dynamics of entanglement within the system chain under different noise intensities. Our results demonstrate that, contrary to the detrimental effects typically associated with noise, certain regimes of noise on the ancilla can significantly enhance entanglement within the system. Numerical simulations demonstrate the robustness of such entanglement enhancement across various system sizes and noise parameters. This enhancement is found to be highly dependent on the hopping strength in the ancilla, suggesting that the interplay between unitary dynamics and noise can be tuned to optimize the entanglement of a quantum system.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we use the formalism of finite-temperature quantum field theory to investigate the Casimir force between flat, ideally conductive surfaces containing confined, but mobile ions. We demonstrate that, in the Gaussian approximation, the ionic fluctuations contribute separately from the electromagnetic fluctuations that are responsible for the standard Casimir effect. This is in line with the "separation hypothesis", has been previously applied on a purely intuitive basis. Our analysis demonstrates the significance of calculating the zero Matsubara frequency component in the electromagnetic contribution, using the formula developed by Schwinger et al., as opposed to the approach based on Lifshitz theory used by other researchers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01435v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fictitious magnetic fields can be introduced in quantum magnets by the strain engineering and the Aharonov-Casher effect. Here, we study impacts of a uniform fictitious magnetic field and corresponding Landau quantization on the Neel order in the $S=1/2$ Heisenberg model on the square lattice as a prototypical system of quantum magnets. We first analyze the system by using the spin-wave approximation. It is found that the staggered magnetization is enhanced by the fictitious magnetic field and it shows a simple scaling behavior with respect to the magnetic length, in contrast to a naive expectation based on the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. We also perform density matrix renormalization group calculations to fully take quantum effects into account and obtain quantitatively more accurate results. The enhancement is found to be anomalously strong and it shows a non-trivial scaling behavior or a fluctuation induced discontinuity. These results are beyond the well known understanding of correlated systems under magnetic fields called the magnetic catalysis.</description>

      <title>Understanding Dynamics in Coarse-Grained Models: V. Extension of Coarse-Grained Dynamics Theory to Non-Hard Sphere Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17186v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Coarse-grained (CG) modeling has gained significant attention in recent years due to its wide applicability in enhancing the spatiotemporal scales of molecular simulations. While CG simulations, often performed with Hamiltonian mechanics, faithfully recapitulate structural correlations at equilibrium, they lead to ambiguously accelerated dynamics. In the first paper of this series [J. Chem. Phys. 158, 034103 (2023)], we proposed the excess entropy scaling relationship to understand the CG dynamics. Then, in the following companion paper [J. Chem. Phys. 158, 034104 (2023)], we developed a theory to map the CG system into a dynamically-consistent hard sphere system to analytically derive an expression for fast CG dynamics. However, many chemical and physical systems do not exhibit hard sphere-like behavior, limiting the extensibility of the developed theory. In this paper, we aim to generalize the theory to the non-hard sphere system based on the Weeks-Chandler-Andersen perturbation theory. Since non-hard sphere-like CG interactions affect the excess entropy term as it deviates from the hard sphere description, we explicitly account for the extra entropy to correct the non-hard sphere nature of the system. This approach is demonstrated for two different types of interactions seen in liquids, and we further provide a generalized description for any CG models using the generalized Gaussian CG models using Gaussian basis sets. Altogether, this work allows for extending the range and applicability of the hard sphere CG dynamics theory to a myriad of CG liquids.</description>

      <title>Analytical solution for the polydisperse random close packing problem in 2D</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03354v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An analytical theory for the random close packing density, $\phi_\textrm{RCP}$, of polydisperse hard disks is provided using an equilibrium model of crowding [A. Zaccone, Phys. Rev. Lett. 128, 028002 (2022)] which has been justified on the basis of extensive numerical analysis of the maximally random jammed (MRJ) line in the phase diagram of hard spheres [Anzivino et al., J. Chem. Phys. 158, 044901 (2023)]. The solution relies on the equations of state for the hard disk fluid and provides predictions for $\phi_\textrm{RCP}$ as a function of the ratio, $s$, of the standard deviation of the distribution of disk diameters to its mean. For a power-law size distribution with $s=0.246$, the theory yields $\phi_\textrm{RCP} =0.892$, which compares well with the most recent numerical estimate $\phi_\textrm{RCP} =0.905$ based on the Monte-Carlo swap algorithms [Ghimenti, Berthier, van Wijland, Phys. Rev. Lett. 133, 028202 (2024)].</description>
