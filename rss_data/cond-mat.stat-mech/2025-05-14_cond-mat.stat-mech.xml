      <title>Energy-Efficient Pseudo-Ratchet for Brownian Computers through One-Dimensional Quantum Brownian Motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brownian computers utilize thermal fluctuations as a resource for computation and hold promise for achieving ultra-low-energy computations. However, the lack of a statistical direction in Brownian motion necessitates the incorporation of ratchets that facilitate the speeding up and completion of computations in Brownian computers. To make the ratchet mechanism work effectively, an external field is required to overcome thermal fluctuations, which has the drawback of increasing energy consumption. As a remedy for this drawback, we introduce a new approach based on one-dimensional (1D) quantum Brownian motion, which exhibits intrinsic unidirectional transport even in the absence of external forces or asymmetric potential gradients, thereby functioning as an effective pseudo-ratchet. Specifically, we exploit that quantum resonance effects in 1D systems divide the momentum space of particles into subspaces. These subspaces have no momentum inversion symmetry, resulting in the natural emergence of unidirectional flow. We analyze this pseudo-ratchet mechanism without energy dissipation from an entropic perspective and show that it remains consistent with the second law of thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Critical dynamics of three-dimensional $Z_N$ gauge models and the inverted XY universality class</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the critical relaxational dynamics of the three-dimensional (3D) lattice $Z_N$ gauge models with $N=6$ and $N=8$, whose equilibrium critical behavior at their topological transitions belongs to the inverted XY (IXY) universality class (this is also the universality class of the continuous transitions of the 3D lattice U(1) gauge Higgs models with a one-component complex scalar field), which is connected to the standard XY universality class by a nonlocal duality relation of the partition functions. Specifically, we consider the purely relaxational dynamics realized by a locally reversible Metropolis dynamics, as commonly used in Monte Carlo simulations. To determine the corresponding dynamic exponent $z$, we focus on the out-of-equilibrium critical relaxational flows arising from instantaneous quenches to the critical point, which are analyzed within an out-of-equilibrium finite-size scaling framework. We obtain the estimate $z=2.59(3)$. A numerical analysis of the equilibrium critical dynamics give consistent, but less accurate, results. This dynamic exponent is expected to characterize the critical slowing down of the purely relaxational dynamics of all topological transitions that belong to the 3D IXY universality class. We note that this result implies that the critical relaxational dynamics of the 3D IXY universality class is slower than that of the standard 3D XY universality class, whose relaxational dynamic exponent $z\approx 2.02$ is significantly smaller, although they share the same length-scale critical exponent $\nu\approx 0.6717$.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian replica exchange augmented with diffusion-based generative models and importance sampling to assess biomolecular conformational basins and barriers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Enhanced sampling techniques are essential for exploring biomolecular conformational dynamics that occur on timescales inaccessible to conventional molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. This study introduces a framework that combines Hamiltonian replica exchange (REST2) with denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) and importance sampling to enhance the mapping of conformational free-energy landscapes. Building on previous applications of DDPMs to temperature replica exchange (TREM), we propose two key improvements. First, we adapt the method to REST2 by treating potential energy as a fluctuating variable. This adaptation allows for more efficient sampling in large biomolecular systems. Second, to further improve resolution in high-barrier regions, we develop an iterative scheme combining replica exchange, DDPM, and importance sampling along known collective variables. Benchmarking on the mini-protein CLN025 demonstrates that DDPM-refined REST2 achieves comparable accuracy to TREM while requiring fewer replicas. Application to the enzyme PTP1B reveals a loop transition pathway consistent with prior complex biased simulations, showcasing the approach's ability to uncover high-barrier transitions with minimal computational overhead with respect to conventional replica exchange approaches. Overall, this hybrid strategy enables more efficient exploration of free-energy landscapes, expanding the utility of generative models in enhanced sampling simulations.</description>

      <title>Observation of Near-Critical Kibble-Zurek Scaling in Rydberg Atom Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Kibble-Zurek scaling reveals the universal dynamics when a system is linearly ramped across a symmetry-breaking phase transition. However, in reality, inevitable finite-size effects or symmetrybreaking perturbations can often smear out the critical point and render the phase transition into a smooth crossover. In this letter, we show experimentally that the precise Kibble-Zurek scaling can be retained in the near-critical crossover regime, not necessarily crossing the critical point strictly. The key ingredient to achieving this near-critical Kibble-Zurek scaling is that the system size and the symmetry-breaking field must be appropriately scaled following the variation of ramping speeds. The experiment is performed in a reconfigurable Rydberg atom array platform, where the Rydberg blockade effect induces a Z2 symmetry-breaking transition. The atom array platform enables precise control of the system size and the zigzag geometry as a symmetry-breaking field. Therefore, we can demonstrate notable differences in the precision of the Kibble-Zurek scaling with or without properly scaling the system size and the zigzag geometry. Our results strengthen the Kibble-Zurek scaling as an increasingly valuable tool for investigating phase transition in quantum simulation platforms.</description>

      <title>Experimental demonstration of kinetic proofreading inherited in ligation-based information replication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08232v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We experimentally demonstrate that information replication by templated ligation of DNA strands inherits a kinetic proofreading mechanism and achieves significant error suppression through cascade replication. A simple simulation model derived from the experimental results shows that templated ligation has a significant advantage over replication by polymerization for error suppression of long strands. This mechanism provides a plausible route for high-fidelity replication in prebiotic chemistry and illustrates how physical principles such as nonequilibrium kinetics and network architecture can drive reliable molecular information replication. The approach also offers new strategies for error suppression in biotechnology.</description>

      <title>Quantum Time Crystal Clock and its Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding different aspects of time is at the core of many areas in theoretical physics. Minimal models of continuous stochastic and quantum clocks have been proposed to explore fundamental limitations on the performance of timekeeping devices. Owing to the level of complexity in the clock structure and its energy consumption, such devices show trade-offs whose characterization remains an open challenge. Indeed, even conceptual designs for thermodynamically efficient quantum clocks are not yet well understood. In condensed matter theory, time-crystals were found as an exciting new phase of matter, featuring oscillations in (pseudo)-equilibrium with first experimental observations appearing recently. This naturally prompts the question: \textit{can time crystals be used as quantum clocks and what is their performance from a thermodynamic perspective?} We answer this question and find that quantum crystals are indeed genuine quantum clocks with a performance enhanced by the spontaneous breaking of time-translation symmetry.</description>

      <title>Capacity of Entanglement in Lifshitz Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08297v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the capacity of entanglement in certain integrable scale-invariant theories which exhibit Lifshitz scaling symmetry with a generic dynamical exponent z at the critical point. This measure characterizes the width of the eigenvalue spectrum of the reduced density matrix and is a quantum informational counterpart of heat capacity. We explore various aspects of capacity of entanglement, such as the corresponding universal terms for the ground state, its z-dependence and also its temporal evolution after a global quantum quench in two dimensions. We carefully examine the existence of a convenient entropic c-function based on this quantity both in bosonic and fermionic theories. While in the relativistic case the corresponding c-function displays a monotonic behavior under the RG flow, this is not the case for the nonrelativistic theories. We also investigate the dynamics of capacity of entanglement after a mass quench and show that it follows the quasiparticle interpretation for the spreading of entanglement. Finally, we discuss how these results are consistent with the behavior of other entanglement measures including the entanglement entropy.</description>

      <title>Engineering long-range and multi-body interactions via global kinetic constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Long-range and multi-body interactions are crucial for quantum simulation and quantum computation. Yet, their practical realization using elementary pairwise interactions remains an outstanding challenge. We propose an experimental scheme based on the Bose-Hubbard system with a periodic driving of the on-site energy and global-range density-density interactions, a setup readily implementable via cold atoms in optical lattices with cavity-mediated interactions. Optimally chosen driving parameters can induce global kinetic constraints, where tunneling rates are selectively suppressed depending on the particle number imbalance between all even and odd sites. This mechanism, together with the flexible tunability of local tunneling rates, provides efficient implementation schemes of a family of global controlled gates for quantum computation. We illustrate this scheme for the $N$-qubit Toffoli gate, circumventing the need for a two-body gate decomposition, and elaborate on the efficient preparation of entangled many-body states.</description>

      <title>Bubble formation in active binary mixture model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08637v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phase separation, the spontaneous segregation of density, is a ubiquitous phenomenon observed across diverse physical and biological systems. Within a crowd of self-propelled elements, active phase separation emerges from the interplay of activity and density interactions. A striking feature of active phase separation is the persistent formation of dilute-phase bubbles within the dense phase, which has been explored in theoretical models. However, the fundamental parameters that systematically control bubble formation remain unclear in conventional active particle models. Here, we introduce an active binary mixture model, where active solutes and solvents dynamically exchange their positions, and find that spontaneous bubble formation can be tuned by the asymmetry in their activities. Numerical simulations reveal that moderate solvent activity enhances bubble formation, while larger solvent activity, comparable to solute activity, suppresses it. By employing mean-field theory, which captures essential phase behaviors, we consider the mechanism for the enhancement of bubble formation induced by solvent activity. Beyond these findings, when solute and solvent activities are equal, numerical simulations indicate that critical phenomena of active phase separation under the suppression of bubbles belong to the Ising universality class. Our findings establish activity asymmetry as a key control parameter for active matter phase transitions, offering new insights into universality in nonequilibrium systems.</description>

      <title>Plastic deformation as a phase transition: a combinatorial model of plastic flow in copper single crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08689v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Continuum models of plasticity fail to capture the richness of microstructural evolution because the continuum is a homogeneous construction. The present study shows that an alternative way is available at the mesoscale in the form of truly discrete constructions and in the discrete exterior calculus. A pre-existing continuum mean-field model with two parameters is rewritten in the language of the latter to model the properties of a network of plastic slip events in a perfect copper single crystal under uniaxial tension. The behaviour of the system is simulated in a triangular 2D mesh in 3D space employing a Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. Phases of distinct character emerge and both first-order and second-order phase transitions are observed. The phases can be interpreted as representing crystallographic phenomena like cross-slip, strain localisation and partial dislocations. The first-order transitions mostly occur as functions of the applied stress, while the second-order transitions occur exclusively as functions of the mean-field coupling parameter. The former are reminiscent of transitions in other statistical-mechanical models, while the latter find parallels in experimental observations.</description>

      <title>Summation of Divergent Series and Quantum Phase Transitions in Kitaev Chains with Long-Range Hopping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.09566v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the quantum phase transitions (QPTs) in extended Kitaev chains with long-range ($1/r^{\alpha}$) hopping. Formally, there are two QPT points at $\mu=\mu_0(\alpha)$ and $\mu_\pi(\alpha)$ ($\mu$ is the chemical potential) which correspond to the summations of $\sum_{m=1}^{\infty}m^{-\alpha}$ and $\sum_{m=1}^{\infty}(-1)^{m-1}m^{-\alpha}$, respectively. When $\alpha\leq0$, both the series are divergent and it is usually believed that no QPTs exist. However, we find that there are two QPTs at $\mu=\mu_0(0)$ and $\mu_\pi(0)$ for $\alpha=0$ and one QPT at $\mu=\mu_\pi(\alpha)$ for $\alpha&lt;0$. These QPTs are second order. The $\mu_0(0)$ and $\mu_\pi(\alpha\leq0)$ correspond to the summations of the divergent series obtained by the analytic continuation of the Riemann $\zeta$ function and Dirichlet $\eta$ function. Moreover, it is found that the quasiparticle energy spectra are discontinue functions of the wave vector $k$ and divide into two branches. This is quite different from that in the case of $\alpha&gt;0$ and induces topological phases with the winding number $\omega:=\pm1/2$. At the same time, the von Neumann entropy are power law of the subchain length $L$ no matter in the gapped region or not. In addition, we also study the QPTs, topological properties, and von Neumann entropy of the systems with $\alpha&gt;0$.</description>

      <title>Random matrix universality in dynamical correlation functions at late times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12103v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the behavior of two-time correlation functions at late times for finite system sizes considering observables whose (one-point) average value does not depend on energy. In the long time limit, we show that such correlation functions display a ramp and a plateau determined by the correlations of energy levels, similar to what is already known for the spectral form factor. The plateau value is determined, in absence of degenerate energy levels, by the fluctuations of diagonal matrix elements, which highlights differences between different symmetry classes. We show this behavior analytically by employing results from Random Matrix Theory and the Eigenstate Thermalisation Hypothesis, and numerically by exact diagonalization in the toy example of a Hamiltonian drawn from a Random Matrix ensemble and in a more realistic example of disordered spin glasses at high temperature. Importantly, correlation functions in the ramp regime do not show self-averaging behaviour, and, at difference with the spectral form factor the time average does not coincide with the ensemble average.</description>

      <title>General Theory for Group Resetting with Application to Avoidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02524v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a general theoretical framework for group resetting dynamics in multi-particle systems in a drift potential. While traditional resetting models typically focus on a single particle, our setup considers a group of particles whose collective dynamics determine the resetting process. More recently, resetting has also been used as a regulatory mechanism to avoid adverse outcomes, such as preventing critically high water levels in dams or deleveraging financial portfolios. Here, we extend current resetting theories to group dynamics, with applications ranging from bacterial evolution under antibiotic pressure to multiple-searcher optimization algorithms. Combining renewal theory and extreme value statistics, we derive a Fokker-Planck equation for the spatial distribution of the group's center of mass, treated as an effective particle. This formalism allows us to analytically calculate essential observables including the stationary mean position, variance, and a dimensionless measure of risk--the squared coefficient of variation. Our results demonstrate how the group size and resetting rate affect the probability of avoiding the danger region. This theoretical approach opens new perspectives on designing optimal group-level search and avoidance strategies through resetting.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional real space renormalization group with well-controlled approximations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13758v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We make Kadanoff's block idea into a reliable three-dimensional (3D) real space renormalization group (RG) method. Kadanoff's idea, expressed in spin representation, offers a qualitative intuition for clarifying scaling behavior in criticality, but has difficulty as a quantitative tool due to uncontrolled approximations. A tensor-network reformulation equips the block idea with a measure of RG errors. In 3D, we propose an entanglement filtering scheme to enhance such a block-tensor map, with the lattice reflection symmetry exploited. When the proposed RG is applied to the cubic-lattice Ising model, the RG errors are reduced to about 2% by retaining more couplings. The estimated scaling dimensions of the two relevant fields have errors 0.4% and 0.1% in the best case, compared with the accepted values. The proposed RG is promising as a systematically-improvable real space RG method in 3D. The unique feature of our method is its ability to numerically obtain a 3D critical fixed point in a high-dimensional tensor space. A fixed-point tensor contains much more information than a handful of observables estimated in conventional techniques for analyzing critical systems.</description>

      <title>Behavior of Ising spins and ecological oscillators on dynamically rewired small-world networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10619</link>

Abstract: Many ecological populations are known to display a cyclic behavior with period 2. Previous work has shown that when a metapopulation (group of coupled populations) with such dynamics is allowed to interact via nearest neighbor dispersal in two dimensions, it undergoes a phase transition from disordered (spatially asynchronous) to ordered (spatially synchronous) that falls under the 2-D Ising universality class. While nearest neighbor dispersal may satisfactorily describe how most individuals migrate between habitats, we should expect a small fraction of individuals to venture on a journey to further locations. We model this behavior by considering ecological oscillators on dynamically rewired small-world networks, in which at each time step a fraction $p$ of the nearest neighbor interactions is replaced by a new interaction with a random node on the network. We measure how this connectivity change affects the critical point for synchronizing ecological oscillators. Our results indicate that increasing the amount of long-range interaction (increasing $p$) favors the ordered regime, but the presence of memory in ecological oscillators leads to quantitative differences in how much long-range dispersal is needed to order the network, relative to an analogous network of Ising spins. We also show that, even for very small values of $p$, the phase transition falls into the mean-field universality class, and argue that ecosystems where dispersal can occasionally happen across the system's length scale will display a phase transition in the mean-field universality class.</description>

      <title>Martingale approach for first-passage problems of time-additive observables in Markov processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03441v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a method based on martingales to study first-passage problems of time-additive observables exiting an interval of finite width in a Markov process. In the limit that the interval width is large, we derive generic expressions for the splitting probability and the cumulants of the first-passage time. These expressions relate first-passage quantities to the large deviation properties of the time-additive observable. We find that there are three qualitatively different regimes depending on the properties of the large deviation rate function of the time-additive observable. These regimes correspond to exponential, super-exponential, or sub-exponential suppression of events at the unlikely boundary of the interval. Furthermore, we show that the statistics of first-passage times at both interval boundaries are in general different, even for symmetric thresholds and in the limit of large interval widths. While the statistics of the times to reach the likely boundary are determined by the cumulants of the time-additive observables in the original process, those at the unlikely boundary are determined by a dual process. We obtain these results from a one-parameter family of positive martingales that we call Perron martingales, as these are related to the Perron root of a tilted version of the transition rate matrix defining the Markov process. Furthermore, we show that each eigenpair of the tilted matrix has a one-parameter family of martingales. To solve first-passage problems at finite thresholds, we generally require all one-parameter families of martingales, including the non-positive ones. We illustrate this by solving the first-passage problem for run-and-tumble particles exiting an interval of finite width.</description>

      <title>Operator-state correspondence in simple current extended conformal field theories: Toward a general understanding of chiral conformal field theories and topological orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15621v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we revisit the operator-state correspondence in the Majorana conformal field theory (CFT) with emphasis on its semion representation. Whereas the semion representation (or $Z_{2}$ extension of the chiral Ising CFT) gives a concise ``abelian" (or invertible) representation in the level of fusion rule and quantum states, there exists subtlety when considering the chiral multipoint correlation function. In this sense, the operator-state correspondence in the semion sector of the fermionic theory inevitably contains difficulty coming from its anomalous conformal dimension $1/16$ as a $Z_{2}$ symmetry operator. By analyzing the asymptotic behaviors of the existing correlation functions, we propose a nontrivial correspondence between the chiral conformal blocks and bulk correlation functions containing both order and disorder fields. One can generalize this understanding to $Z_{N}$ models or fractional supersymmetric models (in which there exist long-standing open problems). We expect this may improve our understanding of the simple current extension of CFT which can appear commonly in the studies of topologically ordered systems.</description>

      <title>Spectral anomalies and broken symmetries in maximally chaotic quantum maps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.14067v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spectral statistics such as the level spacing statistics and spectral form factor (SFF) are widely expected to accurately identify ``ergodicity'', including the presence of underlying macroscopic symmetries, in generic quantum systems ranging from quantized chaotic maps to interacting many-body systems. By studying various quantizations of maximally chaotic maps that break a discrete classical symmetry upon quantization, we demonstrate that this approach can be misleading and fail to detect macroscopic symmetries. Notably, the same classical map can exhibit signatures of different random matrix symmetry classes in short-range spectral statistics depending on the quantization. While the long-range spectral statistics encoded in the early time ramp of the SFF are more robust and correctly identify macroscopic symmetries in several common quantizations, we also demonstrate analytically and numerically that the presence of Berry-like phases in the quantization leads to spectral anomalies, which break this correspondence. Finally, we provide numerical evidence that long-range spectral rigidity remains directly correlated with ergodicity in the quantum dynamical sense of visiting a complete orthonormal basis.</description>

      <title>Dissipation driven phase transition in the non-Hermitian Kondo model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09510v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian Hamiltonians capture several aspects of open quantum systems, such as dissipation of energy and non-unitary evolution. An example is an optical lattice where the inelastic scattering between the two orbital mobile atoms in their ground state and the atom in a metastable excited state trapped at a particular site and acting as an impurity, results in the two body losses. It was shown in \cite{nakagawa2018non} that this effect is captured by the non-Hermitian Kondo model. which was shown to exhibit two phases depending on the strength of losses. When the losses are weak, the system exhibits the Kondo phase and when the losses are stronger, the system was shown to exhibit the unscreened phase where the Kondo effect ceases to exist, and the impurity is left unscreened. We re-examined this model using the Bethe Ansatz and found that in addition to the above two phases, the system exhibits a novel $\widetilde{YSR}$ phase which is present between the Kondo and the unscreened phases. The model is characterized by two renormalization group invariants, a generalized Kondo temperature $T_K$ and a parameter `$\alpha$' that measures the strength of the loss. The Kondo phase occurs when the losses are weak which corresponds to $0&lt;\alpha&lt;\pi/2$. As $\alpha$ approaches $\pi/2$, the Kondo cloud shrinks resulting in the formation of a single particle bound state which screens the impurity in the ground state between $\pi/2&lt;\alpha&lt;\pi$. As $\alpha$ increases, the impurity is unscreened in the ground state but can be screened by the localized bound state for $\pi&lt;\alpha&lt;3\pi/2$. When $\alpha&gt;3\pi/2$, one enters the unscreened phase where the impurity cannot be screened. We argue that in addition to the energetics, the system displays different time scales associated with the losses across $\alpha=\pi/2$, resulting in a phase transition driven by the dissipation in the system.</description>

      <title>Designed self-assembly of programmable colloidal atom-electron equivalents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23784v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To unlock the potential for assembling complex colloidal "molecules", we investigate a minimal binary system of programmable colloidal atom-electron equivalents (PAE-EE), where electron equivalents (EEs) are multivalent linkers with two distinct types of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) ends complementary to those ssDNAs on binary programmable atom equivalents (PAEs). We derive a statistical mechanical framework for calculating the effective interaction between PAEs mediated by EEs with arbitrary valency, which quantitatively agrees with simulations that explicitly include EEs. Our analysis reveals an anomalous dependence of PAE-PAE interactions on the EE valency, showing that EE-mediated interactions converge at the large valency limit. Moreover, we identify an optimal EE valency that maximizes the interaction difference between targeted and non-targeted binding pairs of PAEs. These findings offer design principles for targeted self-assembly in PAE-EE systems.</description>

      <title>Edge modes and boundary impurities in the anisotropic Heisenberg spin chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00194v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of boundary phenomena in a spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ anisotropic Heisenberg chain (XXZ-$\frac{1}{2}$) in the gapped antiferromagnetic phase, with a particular focus on the interplay between fractionalized spin-$\frac{1}{4} $ edge modes and a coupled spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ impurity at the edge. Employing a combination of Bethe Ansatz, exact diagonalization, and density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) methods, we explore the intricate phase diagram that emerges when the impurity is coupled either integrably or non-integrably to the chain. For integrable antiferromagnetic impurity couplings, we identify two distinct phases: the Kondo phase, where the impurity is screened by a multiparticle Kondo effect, and the antiferromagnetic bound mode phase, where an exponentially localized bound state screens the impurity in the ground state. When coupled ferromagnetically while maintaining integrability, the impurity behaves as a free spin-$\frac{1}{2}$, leading to either a ferromagnetic bound mode phase, where the impurity remains free in the ground state but may be screened at higher energy excitations or an unscreened (or local moment) phase where impurity remains unscreened in every eigenstate whereas for non-integrable ferromagnetic coupling, the impurity is not free. In the case of non-integrable antiferromagnetic coupling, a third phase emerges, characterized by mid-gap excitations with two degenerate states below the mass gap on top of the Kondo and antiferromagnetic bound mode phases, further enriching the phase diagram. Our findings highlight the nuanced behavior of boundary impurities in gapped antiferromagnetic systems, offering new insights into Kondo effects and impurity screening in the presence of fractionalized edge modes and bulk antiferromagnetic order.</description>

      <title>Generation of magnetic chiral solitons, skyrmions, and hedgehogs with electric fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07210v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electric-field controls of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions (DMIs) have recently been discussed from the microscopic viewpoint. Since the DMI plays a critical role in generating topological spin textures (TSTs) such as the chiral soliton, the magnetic skyrmion, and the magnetic hedgehog, electric-field controls of these TSTs have become an important issue. This paper shows that such electric-field-induced DMI indeed creates and annihilates TSTs by numerically solving the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation for many-body spin systems at finite temperatures. We show that when a strong electric field is applied in a proper way to one- or two-dimensional ferromagnets, the Hamiltonians are changed into the well-known spin models for the chiral soliton or the skyrmion lattice, and the TST states emerge. We utilize a machine-learning method to count the number of generated TSTs. In the three-dimensional (3D) case, we demonstrate the electric-field induction of a magnetic hedgehog structure as follows: Applying a strong enough electric field along a proper direction to a skyrmion-string state (a triple-$\boldsymbol{q}$ state) at low but finite temperatures, we find that the field-induced DMI can drive a quadruple-$\boldsymbol{q}$ state with hedgehog-antihedgehog pairs. This result indicates that we have succeeded in constructing a simple 3D short-range interacting spin model hosting a magnetic hedgehog structure.</description>
