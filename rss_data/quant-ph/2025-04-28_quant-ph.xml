      <title>Recoherence, adiabaticiy and Markovianity in Gaussian maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent discovery of situations where cosmological fluctuations recohere during inflation, we investigate the relationship between quantum recoherence (late-time purification after a transient phase of decoherence), adiabaticity, and Markovianity. To that end, we study a simple setup of two linearly-coupled harmonic oscillators, and compute the purity of one oscillator when the interaction is switched off. We find that there exists a critical value for the coupling strength below which the purity oscillates and above which it decays exponentially. This decay cannot be captured with perturbation theory, hence, decoherence is always a non-perturbative phenomenon. When the interaction is turned off, the purity either freezes to its value prior to the turn-off, or it smoothly goes back to a value very close to one (recoherence). This depends on the rate at which the turn-off occurs. We thus develop a new adiabatic-expansion scheme and find complete recoherence at any finite order in the inverse turn-off time. Therefore, decoherence is always a non-adiabatic effect. The critical value of the turn-off time above which recoherence takes place is then expressed in terms of the other time scales of the problem. Finally, we show that even though the dynamics of the system is never Markovian, when decoherence takes place, it can always be interpreted as resulting from a locally Markovian process. We introduce a new measure of Markovianity dubbed the Bures velocity and use it to optimise Markovian approximations.</description>

      <title>Qubit-efficient quantum chemistry with the ADAPT variational quantum eigensolver and double unitary downfolding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we combine the recently developed double unitary coupled cluster (DUCC) theory with the adaptive, problem-tailored variational quantum eigensolver (ADAPT-VQE) to explore accuracy of unitary downfolded Hamiltonians for quantum simulation of chemistry. We benchmark the ability of DUCC effective Hamiltonians to recover dynamical correlation energy outside of an active space. We consider the effects of strong correlation, commutator truncation, higher-body terms, and approximate external amplitudes on the accuracy of these effective Hamiltonians. When combining these DUCC Hamiltonians with ADAPT-VQE, we observe similar convergence of the ground state as compared to bare active space Hamiltonians, demonstrating that DUCC Hamiltonians provide increased accuracy without increasing the load on the quantum processor.</description>

      <title>Experimental neuromorphic computing based on quantum memristor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning has recently developed novel approaches, mimicking the synapses of the human brain to achieve similarly efficient learning strategies. Such an approach retains the universality of standard methods, while attempting to circumvent the excessive requirements, which hinder their scalability. In this context, quantum (or quantum inspired) algorithms may bring further enhancement. However, high-performing neural networks invariably display non-linear behaviours, which is diametrically opposed to the linear evolution of closed quantum systems. We propose a solution to this issue and report the first neuromorphic architecture based on a photonic quantum memristor. In detail, we show how the memristive feedback loop enhances the non-linearity and hence the performance of the algorithm. We benchmark our model on two tasks, i.e. non-linear function and time series prediction. In these cases, we highlight the essential role of the quantum memristive element and demonstrate the possibility of using it as a building block in more sophisticated networks.</description>

      <title>Realizing supersymmetry in a digitized quantum device</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The tricritical Ising model serves as an example of emergent spacetime supersymmetry, which can arise in condensed matter systems. In this work, we present a variational quantum algorithm to create this tricritical state on a digitized quantum computer. We successfully prepare the state on an IBM quantum device and verify the critical correlations of supercurrents associated with the state. Additionally, we examine how other signatures of supersymmetry, namely universal gap ratios and the central charge, can be probed on quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Micromagnons and long-range entanglement in ferrimagnetic ground states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While significant attention has been devoted to studying entanglement in photonic systems, solid-state spin lattices remain relatively underexplored. Motivated by this gap, we investigate the entanglement structure of one-dimensional ferrimagnetic chains composed of alternating spin-1/2 and spin-3/2 particles. We characterize the ground-state correlations using exact diagonalization and the Density Matrix Renormalization Group method. Although the bipartite entanglement is restricted to nearest neighbors, we reveal the presence of long-range genuine multipartite entanglement between spatially separated spin pairs. These findings advance our understanding of quantum correlations in ferrimagnetic materials.</description>

      <title>Phase-space approach to cavity field dynamics in a squeezed thermal reservoir</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum systems, such as a single-mode cavity field coupled to a thermal bath, typically experience destructive effects due to interactions with their noisy environment. When the bath combines both thermal fluctuations and a nonclassical feature like quadrature squeezing, forming a squeezed thermal reservoir, the system's behaviour can change substantially. In this work, we study the evolution of the cavity field in this generalized environment using an alternative phase-space approach based on the Glauber-Sudarshan $P$-function. We derive a compact analytical expression for the time-dependent $P$-function for arbitrary initial cavity field states and demonstrate its utility through specific examples. Additionally, we obtain analytical expressions, as a function of time, for some statistical properties of the cavity field, as well as for the nonclassical depth, $\tau_m$, a nonclassicality measure calculated directly from the $P$-function.</description>

      <title>Highly integrated broadband entropy source for quantum random number generators based on vacuum fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we designed and experimentally verified a highly integrated broadband entropy source for a quantum random number generator (QRNG) based on vacuum fluctuations. The core of the entropy source is a hybrid laser-and-silicon-photonics chip, which is only 6.3 $ \times $ 2.6 $ \times $ 1.5 mm$^{3}$ in size. A balanced homodyne detector based on cascaded radio-frequency amplifiers in the entropy source achieves a 3 dB bandwidth of 2.4 GHz and a common-mode rejection ratio above 25 dB. The quantum-to-classical-noise ratio is 9.51 dB at a photoelectron current of 1 mA. The noise equivalent power and equivalent transimpedance are 8.85$\,\text{pW}/\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$ , and 22.8 k$\Omega$, respectively. After optimization using equalizer technology that eliminates the dependence of adjacent samples, the quantum random number generation rate reaches 67.9 Gbps under average conditional minimum entropy and 61.9 Gbps under the worst-case conditional minimum entropy. The developed hybrid chip enhances the integrability and speed of QRNG entropy sources based on vacuum fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Semiclassical approximation for barrier billiards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Barrier billiards are simple examples of pseudo-integrable models which form an appealing but poorly investigated subclass of dynamical systems. The paper examines the semiclassical limit of the exact quantum transfer operator for barrier billiards constructed in [J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. \textbf{55}, 024001 (2022)]. The obtained asymptotic expressions are used to provide analytical arguments to support the conjecture that spectral statistical properties of barrier billiards are described by the semi-Poisson distribution and to derive the trace formulas for such billiards which in the transfer operator approach is not automatic.</description>

      <title>Quantum Classification Outside the Promised Class</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the important problem of quantum classification of Boolean functions from a entirely novel perspective. Typically, quantum classification algorithms allow us to classify functions with a probability of $1.0$, if we are promised that they meet specific unique properties. The primary objective of this study is to explore whether it is feasible to obtain any insights when the input function deviates from the promised class. For concreteness, we use a recently introduced quantum algorithm that is designed to classify with probability $1.0$ using just a single oracular query a large class of imbalanced Boolean functions. Fist, we establish a completely new concept characterizing ``nearness'' between Boolean function. Utilizing this concept, we show that, as long as the input function is close enough to the promised class, it is still possible to obtain useful information about its behavioral pattern from the classification algorithm. In this regard, the current study is among the first to provide evidence that shows how useful it is to apply quantum classification algorithms to functions outside the promised class in order to get a glimpse of important information.</description>

      <title>Simulation of a rapid qubit readout dependent on the transmission of a single fluxon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The readout speed of qubits is a major limitation for error correction in quantum information science. We show simulations of a proposed device that gives readout of a fluxonium qubit using a ballistic fluxon with an estimated readout time of less than 1 nanosecond, without the need for an input microwave tone. This contrasts the prevalent readout based on circuit quantum electrodynamics, but is related to previous studies where a fluxon moving in a single long Josephson junction (LJJ) can exhibit a time delay depending on the state of a coupled qubit. Our readout circuit contains two LJJs and a qubit coupled at their interface. We find that the device can exhibit single-shot readout of a qubit -- one qubit state leads to a single dynamical bounce at the interface and fluxon reflection, and the other qubit state leads to a couple of bounces at the interface and fluxon transmission. Dynamics are initially computed with a separate degree of freedom for all Josephson junctions of the circuit. However, a collective coordinate model reduces the dynamics to three degrees of freedom: one for the fluxonium Josephson junction and one for each LJJ. The large mass imbalance in this model allows us to simulate the mixed quantum-classical dynamics, as an approximation for the full quantum dynamics. Calculations give backaction on the qubit at $\leq 0.1\%$.</description>

      <title>On the two-dimensional hydrogen atom in a circular box in the presence of an electric field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the quantum-mechanical two-dimensional hydrogen atom with an electric field confined to a circular box of impenetrable wall. In order to obtain the energy spectrum we resort to the Rayleigh-Ritz method with a polynomial basis sets. We discuss the limits of large and small box radius and the symmetry of the solutions of the Schr\"{o}dinger equation. An interesting feature of the model is the appearance of accidental degeneracy and the splitting of degenerate energy levels due to the presence of the electric field.</description>

      <title>Harmonizing de Broglie-Bohm's Causal Interpretation with the Copenhagen Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The non-relativistic quantum theory has been interpreted causally by de Broglie, David Bohm, and others, where a quantum entity is viewed as a particle with a definite position and momentum. This interpretation opposes the Copenhagen orthodox interpretation, which expresses uncertainty through the commutator relationship between position and momentum operators. This is further exacerbated by the de Broglie-Bohm interpretation, which uses no operators corresponding to these observables. We reconcile these opposing viewpoints by introducing mathematical nonlinear operators for the momentum observable. While nonlinear non-Hermitian operators cannot be easily used as matrices in the Hilbert space, we show that they are implicitly embedded in de Broglie-Bohm's interpretation of quantum theory.</description>

      <title>A Preliminary Investigation on the Usage of Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithms for Test Case Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Regression testing is key in verifying that software works correctly after changes. However, running the entire regression test suite can be impractical and expensive, especially for large-scale systems. Test suite optimization methods are highly effective but often become infeasible due to their high computational demands. In previous work, Trovato et al. proposed SelectQA, an approach based on quantum annealing that outperforms the traditional state-of-the-art methods, i.e., Additional Greedy and DIV-GA, in efficiency.
  This work envisions the usage of Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithms (QAOAs) for test case selection by proposing QAOA-TCS. QAOAs merge the potential of gate-based quantum machines with the optimization capabilities of the adiabatic evolution. To prove the effectiveness of QAOAs for test case selection, we preliminarily investigate QAOA-TCS leveraging an ideal environment simulation before evaluating it on real quantum machines. Our results show that QAOAs perform better than the baseline algorithms in effectiveness while being comparable to SelectQA in terms of efficiency. These results encourage us to continue our experimentation with noisy environment simulations and real quantum machines.</description>

      <title>Phases of Floquet code under local decoherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Floquet code is a dynamical quantum memory with a periodically evolving logical space. As a defining feature, the code exhibits an anyon automorphism after each period, giving rise to a non-trivial evolution of each logical state. In this paper, we study the Floquet code under local decoherence and demonstrate that below the decoherence threshold, the code is in a robust phase characterized by the anyon automorphism. We first derive the 3D statistical mechanics model for the maximum likelihood decoder of the 2D Floquet code under local Pauli decoherence. We identify a class of two-qubit Pauli channels under which the 3D statistical mechanics model becomes decoupled 2D models and obtain the threshold for such decoherence channels. We then propose a diagnostic of the anyon automorphism in the presence of local decoherence. We analytically show that this diagnostic distinguishes the Floquet code from the toric code under repeated syndrome measurements and undergoes a phase transition at the threshold.</description>

      <title>QFGN: A Quantum Approach to High-Fidelity Implicit Neural Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Implicit neural representations have shown potential in various applications. However, accurately reconstructing the image or providing clear details via image super-resolution remains challenging. This paper introduces Quantum Fourier Gaussian Network (QFGN), a quantum-based machine learning model for better signal representations. The frequency spectrum is well balanced by penalizing the low-frequency components, leading to the improved expressivity of quantum circuits. The results demonstrate that with minimal parameters, QFGN outperforms the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) models. Despite noise on hardware, the model achieves accuracy comparable to that of SIREN, highlighting the potential applications of quantum machine learning in this field.</description>

      <title>A correspondence between the Rabi model and an Ising model with long-range interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By means of Trotter's formula, we show that transition amplitudes between coherent states in the Rabi model can be understood in terms of a certain Ising model featuring long-range interactions (i.e., beyond nearest neighbors) in its thermodynamic limit. Specifically, we relate the transition amplitudes in the Rabi Model to a sum over $n$ binary variables of the form of a partition function of an Ising model with $n$ spin sites, where $n$ is also the number of steps in Trotter's formula. From this, we show that a perturbative expansion in the energy splitting of the two-level subsystem in the Rabi model is equivalent to an expansion in the number of spin domains in the Ising model. We conclude by discussing how calculations in one model give nontrivial information about the other model, and vice-versa, as well as applications and generalizations this correspondence may find.</description>

      <title>Inverse-Transpilation: Reverse-Engineering Quantum Compiler Optimization Passes from Circuit Snapshots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Circuit compilation, a crucial process for adapting quantum algorithms to hardware constraints, often operates as a ``black box,'' with limited visibility into the optimization techniques used by proprietary systems or advanced open-source frameworks. Due to fundamental differences in qubit technologies, efficient compiler design is an expensive process, further exposing these systems to various security threats. In this work, we take a first step toward evaluating one such challenge affecting compiler confidentiality, specifically, reverse-engineering compilation methodologies. We propose a simple ML-based framework to infer underlying optimization techniques by leveraging structural differences observed between original and compiled circuits. The motivation is twofold: (1) enhancing transparency in circuit optimization for improved cross-platform debugging and performance tuning, and (2) identifying potential intellectual property (IP)-protected optimizations employed by commercial systems. Our extensive evaluation across thousands of quantum circuits shows that a neural network performs the best in detecting optimization passes, with individual pass F1-scores reaching as high as 0.96. Thus, our initial study demonstrates the viability of this threat to compiler confidentiality and underscores the need for active research in this area.</description>

      <title>Quantum computation with the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis instead of wavefunction preparation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The eigenstate thermalization hypothesis connects a time-average of expectation values for non-integrable systems to the normalized trace of an operator. It is shown here that the hypothesis can be a suitable way to take an expectation value over an equal superposition of eigenstates on the quantum computer. The complexity of taking the expectation value relies on an efficient time-evolution implementation with complexity $O(T)$ where $T$ is the cost of a single time-step going as $O(\log_2N)$ and sampling at each time step. The resulting algorithm is demonstrated for the expectation value of the inverse of an operator and then generalized to the gradient of a logarithm-determinant. The method scales as $O(\tau TM/\varepsilon^3)$ with a factor $M$ relating to the number of digits of precision, $\varepsilon$, and $\tau$ the averaging time. This is independent of the condition number of the input operator and does not require a quantum memory. There is a potential for a many-body localized state--which would increase the thermalization time--but many circuits of practical interest are uniform enough to avoid this, and it is also expected that the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis holds beyond the currently available system sizes that are studied. The boundary where this algorithm would be considered a classical versus quantum algorithm is also considered.</description>

      <title>Rapid passage to ordered states in Rydberg atom arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a finite lifetime, a ubiquitous challenge in quantum systems is how to prepare a target state in the shortest possible time. This issue is particularly relevant for Rydberg atom arrays in optical tweezers where the dephasing time is typically restricted to a few microseconds. In this work, we develop a rapid passage to ordered many-body states in a Rydberg atomic chain, which allows the transition of the system to various ordered phases in the phase diagram, such as the Z$_2$-, Z$_3$-, and Z$_4$-ordered antiferromagnetic states. Our scheme ramps the parameter in a "non-adiabatic to quasi-adiabatic to non-adiabatic (NQN)" manner. The NQN configuration significantly reduces the time cost required for the state preparation using entirely adiabatic methods, and is generally appliable to sizable number of atoms. Moreover, we experimentally validate the NQN scheme on the neutral-atom quantum cloud computer Aquila.</description>

      <title>The effect of the number of parameters and the number of local feature patches on loss landscapes in distributed quantum neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum neural networks hold promise for tackling computationally challenging tasks that are intractable for classical computers. However, their practical application is hindered by significant optimization challenges, arising from complex loss landscapes characterized by barren plateaus and numerous local minima. These problems become more severe as the number of parameters or qubits increases, hampering effective training. To mitigate these optimization challenges, particularly for quantum machine learning applied to classical data, we employ an approach of distributing overlapping local patches across multiple quantum neural networks, processing each patch with an independent quantum neural network, and aggregating their outputs for prediction. In this study, we investigate how the number of parameters and patches affects the loss landscape geometry of this distributed quantum neural network architecture via Hessian analysis and loss landscape visualization. Our results confirm that increasing the number of parameters tends to lead to deeper and sharper loss landscapes. Crucially, we demonstrate that increasing the number of patches significantly reduces the largest Hessian eigenvalue at minima. This finding suggests that our distributed patch approach acts as a form of implicit regularization, promoting optimization stability and potentially enhancing generalization. Our study provides valuable insights into optimization challenges and highlights that the distributed patch approach is a promising strategy for developing more trainable and practical quantum machine learning models for classical data tasks.</description>

      <title>Experimental Multi-Dimensional Side-Channel-Secure Quantum Key Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum key distribution (QKD) theoretically provides unconditional security between remote parties. However, guaranteeing practical security through device characterisation alone is challenging in real-world implementations due to the multi-dimensional spaces in which the devices may be operated. The side-channel-secure (SCS)-QKD protocol, which only requires bounding the upper limits of the intensities for the two states, theoretically provides a rigorous solution to the challenge and achieves measurement-device-independent security in detection and security for whatever multi-dimensional side channel attack in the source. Here, we demonstrate a practical implementation of SCS-QKD, achieving a secure key rate of $6.60$ kbps through a 50.5 km fibre and a maximum distribution distance of 101.1 km while accounting for finite-size effects. Our experiment also represents an approximate forty-times improvement over the previous experiment.</description>

      <title>Emergence of Imaginary Time Crystals in the non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parity-time symmetry constrains the spectrum of non-Hermitian systems to be either real or come in complex conjugate pairs. The transition between a symmetry-preserving phase with real energies and a symmetry-broken phase with complex energies is marked by exceptional points, one of the hallmarks of non-Hermitian systems. Because of these properties, these systems are widely studied, both theoretically and experimentally. In this work, we investigate the thermodynamic properties of the gain and loss Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model for both bosons and fermions, and establish the existence of an imaginary time crystal phase, an imaginary time analogue of a time crystal. This phase occurs when there is a resonance condition between the Matsubara frequencies and the spectrum of the system, making the Green's function of the system oscillate in imaginary time with the Matsubara frequency. We show that this phase appears in the symmetry-broken region. In particular, the topological edge states of this system exhibit oscillations that are present for bosons. Finally, we discuss the applicability of our results for experiments. We examine signatures of these phases in terms of correlation functions in real time and oscillations in thermodynamic potential in inverse temperature $\beta$, and explore possible experimental platforms to realize this system.</description>

      <title>Classical simulation of parity-preserving quantum circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a classical simulation method for fermionic quantum systems which, without loss of generality, can be represented by parity-preserving circuits made of two-qubit gates in a brick-wall structure. We map such circuits to a fermionic tensor network and introduce a novel decomposition of non-Matchgate gates into a Gaussian fermionic tensor and a residual quartic term, inspired by interacting fermionic systems. The quartic term is independent of the specific gate, which allows us to precompute intermediate results independently of the exact circuit structure and leads to significant speedups when compared to other methods. Our decomposition suggests a natural perturbative expansion which can be turned into an algorithm to compute measurement outcomes and observables to finite accuracy when truncating at some order of the expansion. For particle number conserving gates, our decomposition features a unique truncation cutoff reducing the computational effort for high precision calculations. Our algorithm significantly lowers resource requirements for simulating parity-preserving circuits while retaining high accuracy, making it suitable for simulations of interacting systems in quantum chemistry and material science. Lastly, we discuss how our algorithm compares to other classical simulation methods for fermionic quantum systems.</description>

      <title>The symplectic rank of non-Gaussian quantum states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-Gaussianity is a key resource for achieving quantum advantages in bosonic platforms. Here, we investigate the symplectic rank: a novel non-Gaussianity monotone that satisfies remarkable operational and resource-theoretic properties. Mathematically, the symplectic rank of a pure state is the number of symplectic eigenvalues of the covariance matrix that are strictly larger than the ones of the vacuum. Operationally, it (i) is easy to compute, (ii) emerges as the smallest number of modes onto which all the non-Gaussianity can be compressed via Gaussian unitaries, (iii) lower bounds the non-Gaussian gate complexity of state preparation independently of the gate set, (iv) governs the sample complexity of quantum tomography, and (v) bounds the computational complexity of bosonic circuits. Crucially, the symplectic rank is non-increasing under post-selected Gaussian operations, leading to strictly stronger no-go theorems for Gaussian conversion than those previously known. Remarkably, this allows us to show that the resource theory of non-Gaussianity is irreversible under exact Gaussian operations. Finally, we show that the symplectic rank is a robust non-Gaussian measure, explaining how to witness it in experiments and how to exploit it to meaningfully benchmark different bosonic platforms. In doing so, we derive lower bounds on the trace distance (resp. total variation distance) between arbitrary states (resp. classical probability distributions) in terms of the norm distance between their covariance matrices, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Characterization of Schmidt modes in high-gain SU(1,1) interferometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimode quantum light has promising applications in many areas of physics, such as quantum communications and quantum computing. However, its multimode nature also makes it challenging to measure its properties. Recently [Optica Quantum 3, 36 (2025)], a method for the simultaneous measurement of the level of squeezing in multiple broadband Schmidt modes has been developed using a phase-sensitive amplification technique. Effectively, this setup corresponds to an SU(1,1) interferometer. Here, we aim to provide a thorough theoretical analysis of this technique and the broadband SU(1,1) interferometer in general in terms of its Schmidt modes. Utilizing the joint Schmidt decomposition of the transfer functions, we investigate the shape and the phase profile of the modes of a single parametric down-conversion (PDC) section and a full (in general, unbalanced) SU(1,1) interferometer for different parametric gain regimes. We consider the complicated interplay between the modes, which is reflected in their overlap coefficients, present a rigorous theoretical approach for the aforementioned multimode phase-sensitive amplification technique, and discuss approximations to make this method experimentally feasible.</description>

      <title>GRADE: Grover-based Benchmarking Toolkit for Assessing Quantum Hardware</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing holds the potential to provide speedups in solving complex problems that are currently difficult for classical computers. However, the realization of this potential is hindered by the issue of current hardware reliability, primarily due to noise and architectural imperfections. As quantum computing systems rapidly advance, there exists a need to create a generalizable benchmarking tool that can assess reliability across different hardware platforms. In this paper, we introduce GRADE (Grover-based Reliability Assessment for Device Evaluation), an open-source benchmarking toolkit to evaluate the reliability of quantum hardware using a generalized form of Grover's algorithm.
  GRADE operates by implementing Grover's algorithm to search through a variety of primitive collections that are customizable by the user, analyzing the probability distribution of the results to assess accuracy and stability. This approach aims to evaluate the hardware performance of Grover's algorithm, which is fundamental in unordered search problems, making it an ideal candidate for benchmarking purposes, as it is one of the few generalizable quantum algorithms that provide a direct speedup. Importantly, GRADE can adapt to a wide range of quantum computing platforms, ensuring it can be applied across different hardware architectures. Additionally, our work provides a scoring function for evaluating the hardware performance for multi-target Grover's implementation. Our work validates this approach across a multitude of simulators and hardware platforms from varying providers, demonstrating its adaptability to differing backend providers.</description>

      <title>A Cautionary Note on Quantum Oracles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, the quantum oracle model introduced by Aaronson and Kuperberg (2007) has found a lot of use in showing oracle separations between complexity classes and cryptographic primitives. It is generally assumed that proof techniques that do not relativize with respect to quantum oracles will also not relativize with respect to classical oracles. In this note, we show that this is not the case: specifically, we show that there is a quantum oracle problem that is contained in the class QMA, but not in a class we call polyQCPH. The class polyQCPH is equal to PSPACE with respect to classical oracles, and it is a well-known result that QMA is contained in PSPACE (also with respect to classical oracles).
  We also show that the same separation holds relative to a distributional oracle, which is a model introduced by Natarajan and Nirkhe (2024). We believe our findings show the need for some caution when using these non-standard oracle models, particularly when showing separations between quantum and classical resources.</description>

      <title>Precision Polarization Tuning for Light Shift Mitigation in Trapped-Ion Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trapped-ion qubits are among the most promising candidates for quantum computing, quantum information processing, and quantum simulation. In general, trapped ions are considered to have sufficiently long coherence times, which are mainly characterized under laser-free conditions. However, in reality, essential laser fields for quantum manipulation introduce residual light shift, which seriously degrades the coherence due to power fluctuations. Here, we present a comprehensive study of AC Stark shifts in the hyperfine energy levels of the $^{171}\mathrm{Yb}^+$ ion, revealing an asymmetric light shift between two circular polarizations in the clock qubit and pronounced vector light shifts in the Zeeman qubits. By precisely tuning these polarizations, a remarkable enhancement in coherence time is observed, reaching over a hundredfold for the clock qubit and more than tenfold for the Zeeman qubits, when comparing conditions of maximum and minimum shifts. These findings advance the practical realization of scalable trapped-ion quantum processors, enabling deep quantum circuit execution and long duration adiabatic operations.</description>

      <title>Rapid and efficient wavefront correction for spatially entangled photons using symmetrized optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatial entanglement is a key resource in quantum technologies, enabling applications in quantum communication, imaging, and computation. However, propagation through complex media distorts spatial correlations, posing a challenge for practical implementations. We introduce a symmetrized genetic algorithm (sGA) for adaptive wavefront correction of spatially entangled photons, leveraging the insight that only the even-parity component of wavefront distortions affects two-photon correlations. By enforcing symmetry constraints, sGA reduces the optimization parameter space by half, leading to faster convergence and improved enhancement within finite number of generations compared to standard genetic algorithms (GA). Additionally, we establish the dependence of enhancement on the signal-to-noise ratio of the feedback signal, which is controlled by detector integration time. This technique enables correction of entanglement degradation, enhancing quantum imaging, secure quantum communication, and quantum sensing in complex environments.</description>

      <title>Self-testing of Nonmaximal Genuine Entangled States using Tripartite Hardy Relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that, in the tripartite scenario with all parties' local events being space-like separated, Hardy-type nonlocality constitutes a stronger manifestation of nonlocal correlations than those captured by Mermin-type inequalities, an important distinction that has hitherto remained unrecognised. To substantiate this assertion, we develop a general framework for the characterisation of tripartite correlations by extending the notion of Settings Independence and Outcome Independence beyond their bipartite formulation. This framework highlights the pivotal role of Hardy-type reasoning in the detection and certification of genuine multipartite nonlocality. Furthermore, we show that the tripartite Hardy-nonlocality enables the self-testing of a broad class of pure nonmaximally genuine entangled tripartite states. A key advantage of Hardy-based self-testing over methods based on tripartite Bell inequalities is its ability to certify quantum correlations even in the presence of nonmaximal violations. This, in turn, facilitates the device-independent certification of randomness from Hardy-type correlations. Unlike Bell functionals, which typically enable self-testing of only a single extremal point per inequality, Hardy relation self-tests a set of extremal quantum correlations for any nonzero Hardy probability. We find that the maximum certifiable randomness using Hardy-type correlations is $\log_2 7\approx 2.8073$-bits, highlighting both the practical and foundational significance of Hardy-based techniques for quantum randomness generation.</description>

      <title>Automatic Configuration Protocols for Optical Quantum Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Before quantum networks can scale up to practical sizes, there are many deployment and configuration tasks that must be automated. Currently, quantum networking testbeds are largely manually configured: network nodes are constructed out of a combination of free-space and fiber optics before being connected to shared single-photon detectors, time-to-digital converters, and optical switches. Information about these connections must be tracked manually; mislabeling may result in experimental failure and protracted debugging sessions. In this paper, we propose protocols and algorithms to automate two such manual processes. First, we address the problem of automatically identifying connections between quantum network nodes and time-to-digital converters. Then, we turn to the more complex challenge of identifying the nodes attached to a quantum network's optical switches. Implementation of these protocols will help enable the development of other protocols necessary for quantum networks, such as network topology discovery, link quality monitoring, resource naming, and routing. We intend for this paper to serve as a roadmap for near-term implementation.</description>

      <title>Improved T counts and active volume estimates for high-level arithmetic subroutines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surface code based quantum computers show great promise for fault-tolerant quantum computing, but most architectures needlessly increase the spacetime volume of a computation due to qubits sitting idly during a computation. Active volume architectures, with long-range connectivity, aim to remove idle spacetime volume leaving only the spacetime volume that logically contributes to a computation. In this work we optimise and derive the active volumes for several industry-leading low- and high-level arithmetic subroutines and achieve significant T-count reductions. We discuss a simple method for estimating and optimising active volumes using orientated ZX diagrams. We also demonstrate that circuit structure, beyond gate counts alone, impacts the active volume of a subroutine and therefore should be taken into consideration when designing circuits.</description>

      <title>QFDNN: A Resource-Efficient Variational Quantum Feature Deep Neural Networks for Fraud Detection and Loan Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social financial technology focuses on trust, sustainability, and social responsibility, which require advanced technologies to address complex financial tasks in the digital era. With the rapid growth in online transactions, automating credit card fraud detection and loan eligibility prediction has become increasingly challenging. Classical machine learning (ML) models have been used to solve these challenges; however, these approaches often encounter scalability, overfitting, and high computational costs due to complexity and high-dimensional financial data. Quantum computing (QC) and quantum machine learning (QML) provide a promising solution to efficiently processing high-dimensional datasets and enabling real-time identification of subtle fraud patterns. However, existing quantum algorithms lack robustness in noisy environments and fail to optimize performance with reduced feature sets. To address these limitations, we propose a quantum feature deep neural network (QFDNN), a novel, resource efficient, and noise-resilient quantum model that optimizes feature representation while requiring fewer qubits and simpler variational circuits. The model is evaluated using credit card fraud detection and loan eligibility prediction datasets, achieving competitive accuracies of 82.2% and 74.4%, respectively, with reduced computational overhead. Furthermore, we test QFDNN against six noise models, demonstrating its robustness across various error conditions. Our findings highlight QFDNN potential to enhance trust and security in social financial technology by accurately detecting fraudulent transactions while supporting sustainability through its resource-efficient design and minimal computational overhead.</description>

      <title>Fooling the Decoder: An Adversarial Attack on Quantum Error Correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural network decoders are becoming essential for achieving fault-tolerant quantum computations. However, their internal mechanisms are poorly understood, hindering our ability to ensure their reliability and security against adversarial attacks. Leading machine learning decoders utilize recurrent and transformer models (e.g., AlphaQubit), with reinforcement learning (RL) playing a key role in training advanced transformer models (e.g., DeepSeek R1). In this work, we target a basic RL surface code decoder (DeepQ) to create the first adversarial attack on quantum error correction. By applying state-of-the-art white-box methods, we uncover vulnerabilities in this decoder, demonstrating an attack that reduces the logical qubit lifetime in memory experiments by up to five orders of magnitude. We validate that this attack exploits a genuine weakness, as the decoder exhibits robustness against noise fluctuations, is largely unaffected by substituting the referee decoder, responsible for episode termination, with an MWPM decoder, and demonstrates fault tolerance at checkable code distances. This attack highlights the susceptibility of machine learning-based QEC and underscores the importance of further research into robust QEC methods.</description>

      <title>Security of a secret sharing protocol on the Qline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Secret sharing is a fundamental primitive in cryptography, and it can be achieved even with perfect security. However, the distribution of shares requires computational assumptions, which can compromise the overall security of the protocol. While traditional Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) can maintain security, its widespread deployment in general networks would incur prohibitive costs. In this work, we present a quantum protocol for distributing additive secret sharing of 0, which we prove to be composably secure within the Abstract Cryptography framework. Moreover, our protocol targets the Qline, a recently proposed quantum network architecture designed to simplify and reduce the cost of quantum communication. Once the shares are distributed, they can be used to securely perform a wide range of cryptographic tasks, including standard additive secret sharing, anonymous veto, and symmetric key establishment.</description>

      <title>Impossibility via W states and feasibility via W-like states for perfect quantum teleportation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the two-party perfect quantum teleportation of an unknown 1-qubit state in the case of sharing various 3-qubit entangled states between a sender and a receiver: GHZ state, W state and W-like state. We give an impossibility proof that the W state cannot be used as the sharing state to realize the perfect quantum teleportation for transmitting an arbitrary 1-qubit state, in sharp contrast with the GHZ state which is well known to realize the perfect quantum transportation. Moreover, we give a procedure of obtaining a modified entangled state which we call the W-like state to achieve the perfect quantum transportation under a prescribed measurement basis.</description>

      <title>Non-stabilizerness generation in a multi-particle quantum walk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the generation of non-stabilizerness, or magic, in a multi-particle quantum walk by analyzing the time evolution of the stabilizer R\'enyi entropy $M_2$. Our study considers both single- and two-particle quantum walks in the framework of the XXZ Heisenberg model with varying interaction strengths. We demonstrate that the spread of magic follows the light-cone structure dictated by the system's dynamics, with distinct behaviors emerging in the easy-plane ($\Delta &lt; 1$) and easy-axis ($\Delta &gt; 1$) regimes. For $\Delta &lt; 1$, magic generation is primarily governed by single-particle dynamics, while for $\Delta &gt; 1$, doublon propagation dominates, resulting in a significantly slower growth of $M_2$. Furthermore, the magic exhibits logarithmic growth in time for both one and two-particle dynamics. Additionally, by examining the Pauli spectrum, we show that the statistical distribution of level spacings exhibits Poissonian behavior, independent of interaction strength or particle number. Our results shed light on the role of interactions on magic generation in a many-body system.</description>

      <title>Efficient quantum state preparation through seniority driven operator selection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum algorithms require accurate representations of electronic states on a quantum device, yet the approximation of electronic wave functions for strongly correlated systems remains a profound theoretical challenge, with existing methods struggling to balance the competing demands of chemical accuracy and gate efficiency. Moreover, a critical limitation of the most of the state-of-the-art methods developed to date lies in their substantial reliance on extensive pre-circuit measurements, which introduce significant overheads and contribute to inefficiencies in practical implementation. To address these interconnected challenges and establish a harmonious synergy between them, we propose an algorithmic framework that focuses on efficiently capturing the molecular strong correlation through an ordered set of computationally less demanding rank-one and seniority-zero excitations, yielding a parameterized ansatz with shallow gate depth. Furthermore, to achieve minimal pre-circuit measurement overhead, we implement a selective pruning of excitations through a hybrid approach that combines intuition-based selection with shallow-depth, rank-one excitations driven uni-parameter circuit optimization strategy. With the incorporation of qubit-based excitations via particle-preserving exchange circuits, we demonstrate a further reduction in quantum complexities, enhancing the overall resource efficiency of the approach. With a range of challenging applications on strongly correlated systems, we demonstrate that our dynamic ansatz not only significantly enhances computational efficiency but also delivers exceptional accuracy, robustness, and resilience to the noisy environments inherent in near-term quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>Stochastic quantum adiabatic algorithm with fractional Brownian motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adiabatic Quantum Computing relies on the quantum adiabatic theorem, which states that a quantum system evolves along its ground state with time if the governing Hamiltonian varies infinitely slowly. However, practical limitations force computations to be performed within limited times, exposing the system to transitions into excited states, and thereby reducing the success probability. Here we investigate the counterintuitive hypothesis that incorporating stochastic noise, specifically noise driven by fractional Brownian motion, in a non-Markovian setup can enhance the performance of adiabatic quantum computing by improving its success probability at limited evolution times. The study begins by developing the mathematical framework to introduce stochastic noise multiplicatively into the Schr\"{o}dinger equation, resulting in a stochastic Schr\"{o}dinger equation. To preserve It\^{o} integrability within the non-Markovian framework, a semimartingale approximation for fractional Brownian motion is employed. We perform numerical simulations to compare the performance of the quantum adiabatic algorithm with and without noise driven by fractional Brownian motion using the NP-complete Exact Cover-3 problem, transformed into the Ising model. Our results exhibit an improvement in success probability in the presence of noise driven by fractional Brownian motion with Hurst parameter $0&lt;H&lt;\frac{1}{2}$ and an increase in speedup as $H$ approaches 0. Although simulations are limited to problems involving a modest number of qubits, evidence suggests that the proposed approach scales favorably with the system size.</description>

      <title>Quantum oracles for the finite element method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In order to assess potential advantages of quantum algorithms that require quantum oracles as subroutines, the careful evaluation of the overall complexity of the oracles themselves is crucial. This study examines the quantum routines required for the implementation of oracles used in the block-encoding of the $N \times N$ stiffness and mass matrices, which typically emerge in the finite element analysis of elastic structures. Starting from basic quantum adders, we show how to construct the necessary oracles, which require the calculation of polynomials, square root and the implementation of conditional operations. We propose quantum subroutines based on fixed-point arithmetic that, given an $r$-qubit register, construct the oracle using $\mathcal{O}((K + L + N_{\mathrm{geo}} + N_{\mathrm{D}}) r)$ ancilla qubits and have a $\mathcal{O}((K + L)r^2 + \log_2(N_{\mathrm{geo}} + N_{\mathrm{D}}))$ runtime, with $K$ the order at which we truncate the polynomials, $L$ the number of iterations in the Newton-Raphson subroutine for the square root, while $N_{\mathrm{geo}}$ and $N_{\mathrm{D}}$ are the number of hypercuboids used to approximate the geometry and the boundary, respectively. Since in practice $r$ scales as $r = \mathcal{O}(\log_2 N)$, and assuming that the other parameters are fixed independently of $N$, this shows that the oracles, while still costly in practice, do not endanger potential polynomial or exponential advantages in $N$.</description>

      <title>Quantum Error Correction in Quaternionic Hilbert Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose quaternion-based strategies for quantum error correction by extending quantum mechanics into quaternionic Hilbert spaces. Building on the properties of quaternionic quantum states, we define quaternionic analogues of Pauli operators and quantum gates, ensuring inner product preservation and Hilbert space conditions. A simple encoding scheme maps logical qubits into quaternionic systems, introducing natural redundancy and enhanced resilience against noise. We construct a quaternionic extension of the five-qubit code, introducing a framework of 15 syndrome measurements to detect quaternionic errors, including quaternionically rotated error components. Numerical estimates show that the quaternionic five-qubit code achieves a logical error threshold of approximately $p_{th} \approx 0.015$, demonstrating improved performance compared to the standard complex-valued code. These results suggest a new pathway for quantum error correction in high-noise environments, leveraging the richer structure of quaternionic quantum mechanics to improve fault tolerance.</description>

      <title>Optimizing the Charging of Open Quantum Batteries using Long Short-Term Memory-Driven Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controlling the charging process of a quantum battery involves strategies to efficiently transfer, store, and retain energy, while mitigating decoherence, energy dissipation, and inefficiencies caused by surrounding interactions. We develop a model to study the charging process of a quantum battery in an open quantum setting, where the battery interacts with a charger and a structured reservoir. To overcome the limitations of static charging protocols, a reinforcement learning (RL) charging strategy is proposed, which utilizes the deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm alongside long short-term memory (LSTM) networks. The LSTM networks enable the RL model to capture temporal correlations driven by non-Markovian dynamics, facilitating a continuous, adaptive charging strategy. The RL protocols consistently outperform conventional fixed heuristic strategies by real-time controlling the driving field amplitude and coupling parameters. By penalizing battery-to-charger backflow in the reward function, the RL-optimized charging strategy promotes efficient unidirectional energy transfer from charger to battery, achieving higher and more stable extractable work. The proposed RL controller would provide a framework for designing efficient charging schemes in broader configurations and multi-cell quantum batteries.</description>

      <title>Factorization of multimeters: a unified view on nonclassical quantum phenomena</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum theory exhibits various nonclassical features, such as measurement incompatibility, contextuality, steering, and Bell nonlocality, which distinguish it from classical physics. These phenomena are often studied separately, but they possess deep interconnections. This work introduces a unified mathematical framework based on commuting diagrams that unifies them. By representing collections of measurements (multimeters) as maps to the set of column-stochastic matrices, we show that measurement compatibility and simulability correspond to specific factorizations of these maps through intermediate systems. We apply this framework to put forward connections between different nonclassical notions and provide factorization-based characterizations for steering assemblages and Bell correlations, including a perspective on the CHSH inequality witnessing measurement incompatibility. Furthermore, we investigate robustness to noise of nonlocal features by examining factorization conditions for maps involving noisy state spaces, providing geometric criteria for when noisy multimeters can be simulated by simpler measurement settings.</description>

      <title>Warm-Starting QAOA with XY Mixers: A Novel Approach for Quantum-Enhanced Vehicle Routing Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum optimization algorithms, such as the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm, are emerging as promising heuristics for solving complex combinatorial problems. To improve performance, several extensions to the standard QAOA framework have been proposed in recent years. Two notable directions include: warm-starting techniques, which incorporate classical approximate solutions to guide the quantum evolution, and custom mixer Hamiltonians, such as XY mixers, which constrain the search to feasible subspaces aligned with the structure of the problem. In this work, we propose an approach that integrates these two strategies: a warm-start initialization with an XY mixer ansatz, enabling constraint-preserving quantum evolution biased toward high-quality classical solutions. The method begins by reformulating the combinatorial problem as a MaxCut instance, solved approximately using the Goemans-Williamson algorithm. The resulting binary solution is relaxed and used to construct a biased superposition over valid one-hot quantum states, maintaining compatibility with the XY mixer's constraints. We evaluate the approach on 5-city instances of the Traveling Salesperson Problem, a canonical optimization problem frequently encountered as a subroutine in real-world Vehicle Routing Problems. Our method is benchmarked against both the standard XY-mixer QAOA and a warm-start-only variant based on MaxCut relaxation. Results show that the proposed combination consistently outperforms both baselines in terms of the percentage and rank of optimal solutions, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining structured initializations with constraint-aware quantum evolution for optimization problems.</description>

      <title>Quantum circuit lower bounds in the magic hierarchy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the magic hierarchy, a quantum circuit model that alternates between arbitrary-sized Clifford circuits and constant-depth circuits with two-qubit gates ($\textsf{QNC}^0$). This model unifies existing circuit models, such as $\textsf{QAC}^0_f$ and models with adaptive intermediate measurements. Despite its generality, we are able to prove nontrivial lower bounds.
  We prove new lower bounds in the first level of the hierarchy, showing that certain explicit quantum states cannot be approximately prepared by circuits consisting of a Clifford circuit followed by $\textsf{QNC}^0$. These states include ground states of some topologically ordered Hamiltonians and nonstabilizer quantum codes. Our techniques exploit the rigid structure of stabilizer codes and introduce an infectiousness property: if even a single state in a high distance code can be approximately prepared by one of these circuits, then the entire subspace must lie close to a perturbed stabilizer code. We also show that proving state preparation lower bounds beyond a certain level of the hierarchy would imply classical circuit lower bounds beyond the reach of current techniques in complexity theory.
  More broadly, our techniques go beyond lightcone-based methods and highlight how the magic hierarchy provides a natural framework for connecting circuit complexity, condensed matter, and Hamiltonian complexity.</description>

      <title>Towards Non-Abelian Quantum Signal Processing: Efficient Control of Hybrid Continuous- and Discrete-Variable Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robust quantum control is crucial for achieving operations below the quantum error correction threshold. Quantum Signal Processing (QSP) transforms a unitary parameterized by $\theta$ into one governed by a polynomial function $f(\theta)$, a feature that underpins key quantum algorithms. Originating from composite pulse techniques in NMR, QSP enhances robustness against systematic control errors. We extend QSP to a new class, non-abelian QSP, which utilizes non-commuting control parameters, $\hat\theta_1, \hat\theta_2, \dots$, representing quantum harmonic oscillator positions and momenta. We introduce a fundamental non-abelian composite pulse sequence, the Gaussian-Controlled-Rotation (GCR), for entangling and disentangling a qubit from an oscillator. This sequence achieves at least a $4.5\times$ speedup compared to the state-of-the-art abelian QSP pulse BB1, while maintaining performance. Though quantum fluctuations in the control parameters are unavoidable, the richer commutator algebra of non-abelian QSP enhances its power and efficiency. Non-abelian QSP represents the highest tier of QSP variants tailored for hybrid oscillator-qubit architectures, unlocking new possibilities for such systems. We demonstrate the utility of GCR in high-fidelity preparation of continuous-variable oscillator states, including squeezed, Fock, cat, and GKP states, using fully analytical schemes that match numerically optimized methods in fidelity and depth while enabling mid-circuit error detection. Furthermore, we propose a high-fidelity QSP-based end-of-the-line GKP readout and a measurement-free, error-corrected gate teleportation protocol for logical operations on GKP bosonic qudits, bridging the gap between idealized theoretical and experimentally realistic versions of the GKP code. Finally, we showcase a GCR-based phase estimation algorithm for oscillator-based quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Twin-Space Representation of Classical Mapping Model in the Constraint Phase Space Representation: Numerically Exact Approach to Open Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08044v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The constraint coordinate-momentum \textit{phase space} (CPS) has recently been developed to study nonadiabatic dynamics in gas-phase and condensed-phase molecular systems. Although the CPS formulation is exact for describing the discrete (electronic/ vibrational/spin) state degrees of freedom (DOFs), when system-bath models in condense phase are studied, previous works often employ the discretization of environmental bath DOFs, which breaks the time irreversibility and may make it difficult to obtain numerically converged results in the long-time limit. In this paper, we develop an exact trajectory-based phase space approach by adopting the twin-space (TS) formulation of quantum statistical mechanics, in which the density operator of the reduced system is transformed to the wavefunction of an expanded system with twice the DOFs. The classical mapping model (CMM) is then used to map the Hamiltonian of the expanded system to its equivalent classical counterpart on CPS. To demonstrate the applicability of the TS-CMM approach, we compare simulated population dynamics and nonlinear spectra for a few benchmark condensed phase system-bath models with those obtained from the hierarchical equations of motion method, which shows that our approach yields accurate dynamics of open quantum systems.</description>

      <title>A thermodynamic road to gravity and quantum phenomena: non-relativistic self-gravitating weakly nonlocal fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07296v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A thermodynamic analysis of weakly nonlocal non-relativistic fluids is presented under the assumption that an additional scalar field - a so-called internal variable - also contributes to the dynamics. The most general evolution of this field and the constitutive relations for the pressure tensor and the energy current density are determined by the Liu procedure. The classical holography of perfect (i.e., non-dissipative) fluids is generally proved, according to which the divergence of the pressure tensor can be given by the gradient of a corresponding scalar potential. Both Newtonian gravity and quantum fluid mechanics are covered as special cases of our fluid model. The unified framework generalises and couples quantum physics and gravitational phenomena, shedding light on the common background of several known modifications and generalisations together with thermodynamic restrictions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.18653v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Levitated optomechanics is an emerging field in quantum science that explores the quantum motion of mesoscopic particles levitated in a vacuum. Expanding this approach to particles with intrinsic quantum defects opens new opportunities for quantum sensing and nontrivial quantum state generation. Here, we explore silicon carbide (SiC) nanoparticles as a promising platform that offers a range of controllable quantum defects and material tunability. We demonstrate stable optical levitation of 3C-polytype SiC nanoparticles containing single photon emitters in a vacuum. We observe stable fluorescence from the levitated particle, confirming the preservation of the emitters in the levitated state. We also investigate particle loss at low pressure and explore thermal annealing as a potential method to improve trapping stability. Our results establish SiC as a viable platform for levitated optomechanics, providing additional quantum degrees of freedom and material engineering capabilities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.18661v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Achieving atomic resolution in electron microscopy has historically been hindered by spherical aberration, a fundamental limitation of conventional electron lenses. Its correction typically requires complex assemblies of electromagnetic multipoles. Here, we demonstrate that spherical aberration in a cylindrically symmetric electron lens can be fully compensated via interaction with a shaped light field. By analyzing distortions in high-magnification point-projection electron images of optical standing waves, we quantify the spherical aberration before and after light-induced correction. This approach introduces a new paradigm for optical control in electron beam shaping and opens a pathway towards compact and tunable light-based aberration correctors for high-resolution electron microscopy.</description>

      <title>Metasurface-Assisted Adaptive Quantum Phase Contrast Imaging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.18809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum imaging employs the nonclassical correlation of photons to break through the noise limitation of classical imaging, realizing high sensitivity, high SNR imaging and multifunctional image processing. To enhance the flexibility and imaging performance of the optical systems, metasurfaces composed of subwavelength structural units provide a powerful optimization approach, enabling advanced applications in quantum state modulation and high-precision imaging. Conventional phase contrast imaging is fundamentally constrained by its single-phase modulation scheme, precluding adaptive switching between imaging modalities. Therefore, the development of high-contrast imaging techniques that can be used in any combination of phases has been a challenge in the field of optical imaging. Here, we propose a novel imaging scheme combining a polarization-entangled light source and a polarization multiplexed metasurface, which realizes remotely switchable bright-dark phase contrast imaging, demonstrating the flexibility and high integration of the system. Experiments show the system can realize high contrast and high SNR imaging under low phase gradient conditions (phase difference as low as {\pi}/5) and exhibit excellent phase resolution. In addition, the system is suitable for imaging biological samples under low-throughput light conditions, providing an efficient and non-destructive shooting solution for biomedical imaging and promoting the development of phase-sensitive imaging technology.</description>

      <title>Critical Non-Hermitian Edge Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18926v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We unveil a unique critical phenomenon of topological edge modes in non-Hermitian systems, dubbed the critical non-Hermitian edge modes (CNHEM). Specifically, in the thermodynamic limit, the eigenvectors of edge modes jump discontinuously under infinitesimal on-site staggered perturbations. The CNHEM arises from the competition between the introduced on-site staggered potentials and size-dependent non-reciprocal coupling between edge modes, and are closely connected to the exceptional point (EP). As the system size increases, the coupling between edge modes decreases while the non-reciprocity is enhanced, causing the
  eigenvectors to gradually collapse toward the EP. However, when the on-site potentials dominate, this weakened coupling assists the eigenvectors to stay away from the EP. Such a critical phenomenon is absent in Hermitian systems, where the coupling between edge modes is reciprocal.</description>

      <title>Superconducting Quantum Interference Devices based on InSb nanoflag Josephson junctions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.18965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Planar Josephson junctions (JJs) based on InSb nanoflags have recently emerged as an intriguing platform in superconducting electronics. This letter presents the fabrication and investigation of superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs) employing InSb nanoflag JJs. We provide measurements of interference patterns in both symmetric and asymmetric geometries. The interference patterns in both configurations can be modulated by a back-gate voltage, a feature well reproduced through numerical simulations. The observed behavior aligns with the skewed current-phase relations of the JJs, demonstrating significant contributions from higher harmonics. We explore the magnetic field response of the devices across a wide range of fields ($\pm 30$ mT), up to the single-junction interference regime, where a Fraunhofer-like pattern is detected. Finally, we assess the flux-to-voltage sensitivity of the SQUIDs to evaluate their performance as magnetometers. A magnetic flux noise of $S^{1/2}_\Phi = 4.4 \times 10^{-6} \Phi_0 / \sqrt{Hz}$ is identified, indicating potential applications in nanoscale magnetometry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19159v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the spectral form factor (SFF) of the quadratic $R$-para-particle Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev ($R$-PSYK$_2$) model with various random matrix ensemble couplings. We generalize previous work on Gaussian Unitary Ensemble (GUE) couplings to all three Gaussian ensembles (GUE, GOE, GSE) and three circular ensembles (CUE, COE, CSE). Through analytical and numerical methods, we establish precise correspondences between GUE and CUE results, demonstrating their SFFs satisfy $\mathcal{K}_{\text{GUE}}(2t) \approx \mathcal{K}_{\text{CUE}}(t)$ in the time regime $1 \ll t \ll N$. For the symplectic ensembles, we observe similar behavior with appropriate time rescaling, while we only provide the calculation method for the orthogonal ensembles.</description>

      <title>Long-range quantum entanglement in dielectric mu-near-zero metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Entanglement is paramount in quantum information processing. Many quantum systems suffer from spatial decoherence in distances over a wavelength and cannot be sustained over short time periods due to dissipation. However, long range solutions are required for the development of quantum information processing on chip. Photonic reservoirs mediating the interactions between qubits and their environment are suggested. Recent research takes advantage of extended wavelength inside near-zero refractive index media to solve the long-range problem along with less sensitivity on the position of quantum emitters. However, those recent proposals use plasmonic epsilon near-zero waveguides that are intrinsically lossy. Here, we propose a fully dielectric platform, compatible with the Nitrogen Vacancy (NV) diamond centers on-chip technology, to drastically improve the range of entanglement over 17 free-space wavelengths, or approximatively 12.5 microns, using mu near-zero metamaterials. We evaluate transient and steady state concurrence demonstrating an order of magnitude enhancement compared to previous works. This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first time that such a long distance is reported using this strategy. Moreover, value of the zero time delay second order correlation function g_12^((2)) (0) are provided, showing antibunching signature correlated with a high degree of concurrence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adiabatic vacua play a central role in quantum fields in cosmological spacetimes, where they serve as distinguished initial conditions and as reference states for the renormalization of observables. In this paper we introduce new methods based on linear complex structures which provide a powerful tool for determining adiabatic vacua. The new methods generalize both the standard WKB appoach and the Lewis-Riesenfeld invariants, and allow us to study the problem of many coupled bosonic degrees of freedom with general quadratic time-dependent Hamiltonian. We show that the adiabatic number operator and the adiabatic vacuum of finite order can be expressed in terms of the adiabatic complex structure of the same order. We compare our results to standard techniques which apply only to a single degree of freedom, and comment on its applicability to problems in quantum fields in cosmological spacetimes, many-body systems and quantum thermodynamics, where the Hamiltonian is time dependent with slowly-changing parameters.</description>

Abstract: The development of large-scale, programmable photonic circuits capable of performing generic matrix-vector multiplication is essential for both classical and quantum information processing. However, this goal is hindered by high losses, hardware errors, and difficulties in programmability. We propose an enhanced architecture for programmable photonic circuits that minimizes circuit depth and offers analytical programmability, properties that have not been simultaneously achieved in previous circuit designs. Our proposal exploits a previously overlooked representation of general nonunitary matrices as sums of two unitaries. Furthermore, similar to the traditional SVD-based circuits, the circuits in our unitary-sum-based architecture inherit the advantages of the constituent unitary circuits. Overall, our proposal provides a significantly improved solution for matrix-vector multiplication compared to the established approaches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19465v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-Q nanophotonic resonators are crucial for many applications in classical and quantum optical processing, communication, sensing, and more. We achieve ultra-high quality factors by preparing a highly transparent and strongly dispersive medium within a resonator, causing a reduction in the group velocity that leads to a nearly three order of magnitude increase in the quality factor. We implement this via spectral hole burning in erbium-doped thin-film lithium niobate microring resonators, and show Q-factors exceeding $10^8$. Additionally, we show that the interplay between the spectrally narrowed resonance and the broader bare resonance produces a Fano lineshape, which we dynamically control via electro-optic tuning. Finally, we present a theoretical model for our experimentally observed resonator linewidths, which are not well-described by the standard Bloch equations. Our results show a dramatic reduction in the erbium dephasing rate under a strong optical drive, leading to much narrower linewidths than would otherwise be expected given the large circulating intensity in the resonator.</description>

      <title>Gapped Boundaries of Kitaev's Quantum Double Models: A Lattice Realization of Anyon Condensation from Lagrangian Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19512v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The macroscopic theory of anyon condensation, rooted in the categorical structure of topological excitations, provides a complete classification of gapped boundaries in topologically ordered systems, where distinct boundaries correspond to the condensation of different Lagrangian algebras. However, an intrinsic and direct understanding of anyon condensation in lattice models, grounded in the framework of Lagrangian algebras, remains undeveloped. In this paper, we propose a systematic framework for constructing all gapped boundaries of Kitaev's quantum double models directly from the data of Lagrangian algebras. Central to our approach is the observation that bulk interactions in the quantum double models admit two complementary interpretations: the anyon-creating picture and anyon-probing picture. Generalizing this insight to the boundary, we derive the consistency condition for boundary ribbon operators that respect the mathematical axiomatic structure of Lagrangian algebras. Solving these conditions yields explicit expressions for the local boundary interactions required to realize gapped boundaries. Our construction provides a microscopic characterization of the bulk-to-boundary anyon condensation dynamics via the action of ribbon operators. Moreover, all these boundary terms are supported within a common effective Hilbert space, making further studies on pure boundary phase transitions natural and convenient. Given the broad applicability of anyon condensation theory, we believe that our approach can be generalized to extended string-net models or higher-dimensional topologically ordered systems.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the non-Hermitian (NH) attractive Hubbard model with spin depairing, which is a spin-resolved asymmetric hopping that nonreciprocally operates spins in the opposite direction. We find that spin depairing stabilizes a superfluid state unique to the NH system. This phase is characterized not only by a finite order parameter, but also by the emergence of exceptional points (EPs) in the momentum space - a feature that starkly contrasts with previously discussed NH fermionic superfluidity, where EPs are absent within the superfluid state and emerge only at the onset of the superfluid breakdown. We uncover the rich mechanism underlying this ``exceptional fermionic superfluidity'' by analyzing the interplay between EPs and the effective density of states of the complex energy dispersion. Furthermore, we reveal that the exceptional superfluid state breaks down induced by strong spin depairing on the cubic lattice, while it remains robust on the square lattice.</description>

      <title>Fermionizing the ideal Bose gas via topological pumping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the coherence and correlations of many-body states appearing in topological pumping in a one-dimensional Bose gas. By analyzing the system at zero and infinite interaction strengths, we reveal a rescaling of momentum distributions accompanied by a self-similar behavior in first- and second-order correlation functions. In excited states of non-interacting bosons, the momentum distribution shows a comb-like structure similar to that of non-interacting fermions but at a higher density. This is mirrored by Friedel oscillations in the one-body density matrix. At the same time, the density-density correlations still exhibit the bosonic enhancement. Our work illustrates how topological pumping induces a nontrivial mapping between bosonic and fermionic correlations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19748v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The silicon vacancy center in diamond is a promising system for quantum technologies due to its exceptional optical and spin properties. This has led to great interest in the silicon-vacancy center as well as in the other group IV vacancy centers. In this work, we model the charge cycle of the group IV vacancy centers from the $-2$ to $0$ charge state. As a first step, we compute the onset energies for all relevant one- and two-step ionization processes. Based on these results, we then derive the rate equations using Fermi's golden rule.</description>

      <title>Unconventional Relaxation Dynamics in Co_8Zn_7Mn_5 and Co_8Zn_8Mn_4: Evidence of Inertial Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetization relaxation dynamics serve as an essential tool for uncovering the intrinsic mechanisms governing the magnetic response and energy dissipation in magnetic systems. In this work, we examine the relaxation dynamics for Beta Mn type Co_8Zn_7Mn_5 and Co_8Zn_8Mn_4 across a frequency range of 1 kHz to 10 kHz, spanning different magnetic phases. While most magnetic systems tend to follow the Debye-like relaxation with non-zero distribution or the Cole-Cole formalism, our analysis reveal that these conventional models fail to capture frequency dependence of ac susceptibility across different magnetic phases in Co_8Zn_7Mn_5 and Co_8Zn_8Mn_4. Instead, an inertial component is needed to successfully describe the dynamics, suggesting the presence of unconventional relaxation behavior. The characteristic relaxation time is found to be of the order of 10^-5 s for both the compositions. The field dependent variation of relaxation time exhibits a non-monotonic nature, with the double peak like structure at the skyrmion phase transitions, implying slower relaxation dynamics at the phase boundaries. Furthermore, the presence of non-zero difference between isothermal and adiabatic susceptibility in the pure phases implies slower relaxation dynamics, which is consistent with the presence of finite dissipation in pure phases. The inertial term has been previously invoked to describe the dynamics in spin ice systems due to the propagation of magnetic monopoles. However, its necessity in this system, points to a wider significance in magnetization dynamics that goes beyond the conventional spin ices and skyrmions.</description>

      <title>Finite temperature phase diagram of the extended Bose-Hubbard model in the presence of disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the finite- and non-zero temperature phase diagram of the Extended Bose-Hubbard Model for both pure and disordered systems. Such a system can be experimentally realized by trapping ultracold Rydberg atoms in optical lattices. By regulating the Rydberg excitation level and the lattice spacing, the system can be engineered to effectively have (i) only the nearest-neighbor interaction and (ii) both nearest-neighbor and next-nearest-neighbor interactions. For both of these situations, we construct the mean-field phase diagrams. It is found that the presence of a non-zero temperature significantly changes the phase diagram because now there is a competition between quantum and thermal fluctuations. We observe that conventional Mott insulator (MI) or charge-density-wave (CDW) lobes vanish at higher temperatures. In a pure system, they melt into a normal fluid. In contrast, the only insulating phase that survives at high temperatures in the presence of disorder is a Bose glass. It is evident that the CDW lobes melt at a lower temperature and the Mott lobes melt at higher temperatures. These transition temperatures depend on the on-site and nearest-neighbor interaction strengths, respectively. It is also found that, with the addition of disorder, the insulating lobes are destroyed at a relatively lower temperature. The mathematical framework that we present here is capable of treating long-range interactions, disorder, and finite temperature simultaneously, and versatile enough so that it can be extended to study different forms of disorder or longer-range interactions.</description>

Abstract: The aim of this work is to show how supersymmetric (SUSY) quantum mechanics can be applied to the Jaynes-Cummings (JC) Hamiltonian of quantum optics. These SUSY transformations connect pairs of Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonians characterized by different detuning parameters as well as Jaynes-Cummings to anti-Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonians. Therefore, JC Hamiltonians can be classified in hierarchies or sequences which are connected through SUSY transformations. As a byproduct, the symmetries of JC Hamiltonians are found as well as the special case of a sequence of resonant-like interacting systems having the form of a simple shape invariant JC Hamiltonian hierarchy.</description>

Abstract: We explore the relation of Van Vleck-Primas perturbation theory of quantum mechanics with the Lie-series-based perturbation theory of Hamiltonian systems in classical mechanics. In contrast to previous works on the relation of quantum and classical perturbation theories, our approach is not based on the conceptual similarities between the two methods. Instead, we show that for quantum systems with a finite-dimensional Hilbert space, the Van Vleck-Primas procedure can be recast exactly into a classical perturbation problem. As a non-obvious consequence, this approach gives a new way of calculating the geometric phase of quantum systems using tools from the theory of classical canonical transformations</description>

      <title>Bayesianism, Conditional Probability and Laplace Law of Succession in Quantum Mechanics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2112.08622v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a comparative study between classical probability and quantum probability from the Bayesian viewpoint, where probability is construed as our rational degree of belief on whether a given statement is true. From this viewpoint, including conditional probability, three issues are discussed: i) Given a measure of the rational degree of belief, does it satisfy the axioms of the probability? ii) Given the probability satisfying these axioms, is it seen as the measure of the rational degree of belief? iii) Can the measure of the rational degree of belief be evaluated in terms of the relative frequency of events occurring? Here we show that as with the classical probability, all these issues can be resolved affirmatively in the quantum probability, provided that the relation to the relative frequency is slightly modified from the Laplace law of succession in case of a small number of observations. This implies that the relation between the Bayesian probability and the relative frequency in quantum mechanics is the same as that in the classical probability theory, including conditional probability.</description>

      <title>ResQNets: A Residual Approach for Mitigating Barren Plateaus in Quantum Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.03527v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The barren plateau problem in quantum neural networks (QNNs) is a significant challenge that hinders the practical success of QNNs. In this paper, we introduce residual quantum neural networks (ResQNets) as a solution to address this problem. ResQNets are inspired by classical residual neural networks and involve splitting the conventional QNN architecture into multiple quantum nodes, each containing its own parameterized quantum circuit, and introducing residual connections between these nodes. Our study demonstrates the efficacy of ResQNets by comparing their performance with that of conventional QNNs and plain quantum neural networks (PlainQNets) through multiple training experiments and analyzing the cost function landscapes. Our results show that the incorporation of residual connections results in improved training performance. Therefore, we conclude that ResQNets offer a promising solution to overcome the barren plateau problem in QNNs and provide a potential direction for future research in the field of quantum machine learning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.05851v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present Qibosoq, an open-source server-side software package designed for radio frequency system on chip (RFSoC) for executing arbitrary pulse sequences and algorithms on self-hosted quantum processing units using only open-source software. Qibosoq connects the RFSoC firmware provided by Qick, a Quantum Instrumentation Control Kit, with Qibo, a quantum computing middleware framework that enables both experimental and gate-based applications. It simplifies the work of experimentalists and developers by managing client-server communication protocols, implementing tests, and validation procedures, thereby reducing the complexity of experimental setups. The client-side integration is achieved with dedicated drivers implemented in Qibolab, the specialized software module of Qibo for quantum hardware control. Therefore, this setup provides a seamless mechanism to deploy circuit-based algorithms on custom self-hosted quantum hardware platforms controlled by RFSoC electronics.</description>

      <title>Robustness measures for quantifying nonlocality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07077v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We suggest generalized robustness for quantifying nonlocality and derive its equivalence to the maximum violation ratio of Bell inequalities defined as vectors with non-negative elements. We investigate its properties by comparing it with white-noise and standard robustness measures. As a result, we show that white-noise robustness does not fulfill monotonicity under local operations and shared randomness, whereas the other measures do. To compare the standard and generalized robustness measures, we introduce the concept of inequivalence, which indicates a reversal in the order relationship depending on the choice of monotones. From an operational perspective, the inequivalence of monotones for resourceful objects implies the absence of free operations that connect them. Applying this concept, we find that standard and generalized robustness measures are inequivalent between even- and odd-dimensional cases up to eight dimensions. This is obtained using randomly performed CGLMP measurement settings in a maximally entangled state. This study contributes to the resource theory of nonlocality and sheds light on comparing monotones by using the concept of inequivalence valid for all resource theories.</description>

Abstract: Practical applications of quantum computing depend on fault-tolerant devices with error correction. Today, the most promising approach is a class of error-correcting codes called surface codes. We study the problem of compiling quantum circuits for quantum computers implementing surface codes. Optimal or near-optimal compilation is critical for both efficiency and correctness. The compilation problem requires (1) mapping circuit qubits to the device qubits and (2) routing execution paths between interacting qubits. We solve this problem efficiently and near-optimally with a novel algorithm that exploits the dependency structure of circuit operations to formulate discrete optimization problems that can be approximated via simulated annealing, a classic and simple algorithm. Our extensive evaluation shows that our approach is powerful and flexible for compiling realistic workloads.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a synthetic Mach-Zehnder interferometer for digitized quantum computing devices to probe fractional exchange statistics of anyonic excitations that appear in quantum spin liquids. Employing an IonQ quantum computer, we apply this scheme to the toric ladder, a quasi-one-dimensional reduction of the toric code. We observe interference patterns resulting from the movement of `electric' excitations in the presence and absence of `magnetic' ones. We model the noise in IonQ via depolarizing Lindbladian dynamics, and find quantitative agreement with the measurements obtained from the quantum device. The synthetic Mach-Zehnder interferometer can thus also serve as an effective means to probe the coherence length and time scales of multi-qubit noisy quantum devices.</description>

Abstract: The photonic platform holds great promise for quantum computing. Nevertheless, the intrinsic probabilistic characteristics of its native fusion operations introduces substantial randomness into the computing process, posing significant challenges to achieving scalability and efficiency in program execution. In this paper, we introduce a randomness-aware compilation framework designed to concurrently achieve scalability and efficiency. Our approach leverages an innovative combination of offline and online optimization passes, with a novel intermediate representation serving as a crucial bridge between them. Through a comprehensive evaluation, we demonstrate that this framework significantly outperforms the most efficient baseline compiler in a scalable manner, opening up new possibilities for realizing scalable photonic quantum computing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04243v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we consider quantum unital Otto heat engines. The latter refers to the fact that both the unitaries of the adiabatic strokes and the source of the heat provided to the engine preserve the maximally mixed state. We show how to compute the cumulants of either the dephased or undephased engine. For a qubit, we give the analytical expressions of the averages and variances for arbitrary unitaries and unital channels. We do a detailed comparative study between the dephased and undephased heat engines. More precisely, we focus on the effect of the parameters on the average work and its reliability and efficiency. As a case study of unital channels, we consider a quantum projective measurement. We show on which basis we should projectively measure the qubit, either the dephased or undephased heat engine, to extract higher amounts of work, increase the latter's reliability, and increase efficiency. Further, we show that non-adiabatic transitions are not always detrimental to thermodynamic quantities. Our results, we believe, are important for heat engines fueled by quantum measurement.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we study the learnability of quantum circuits in the near term. We demonstrate the natural robustness of quantum statistical queries for learning quantum processes, motivating their use as a theoretical tool for near-term learning problems. We adapt a learning algorithm for constant-depth quantum circuits to the quantum statistical query setting, and show that such circuits can be learned in our setting with only a linear overhead in the query complexity. We prove average-case quantum statistical query lower bounds for learning, within diamond distance, random quantum circuits with depth at least logarithmic and at most linear in the system size. Finally, we prove that pseudorandom unitaries (PRUs) cannot be constructed using circuits of constant depth by constructing an efficient distinguisher using existing learning algorithms. To show the correctness of our distinguisher, we prove a new variation of the quantum no free lunch theorem.</description>

      <title>Chaos and magic in the dissipative quantum kicked top</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16585v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider an infinite-range interacting quantum spin-1/2 model, undergoing periodic kicking and dissipatively coupled with an environment. In the thermodynamic limit, it is described by classical mean-field equations that can show regular and chaotic regimes. At finite size, we describe the system dynamics using stochastic quantum trajectories. We find that the asymptotic nonstabilizerness (alias the magic, a measure of quantum complexity), averaged over trajectories, mirrors to some extent the classical chaotic behavior, while the entanglement entropy has no relation with chaos in the thermodynamic limit.</description>

Abstract: Quantum algorithms for Hamiltonian simulation and linear differential equations more generally have provided promising exponential speed-ups over classical computers on a set of problems with high real-world interest. However, extending this to a nonlinear problem has proven challenging, with exponential lower bounds having been demonstrated for the time scaling. We provide a quantum algorithm matching these bounds. Specifically, we find that for a non-linear differential equation of the form $\frac{d|u\rangle}{dt} = A|u\rangle + B|u\rangle^{\otimes2}$ for evolution of time $T$, error tolerance $\epsilon$ and $c$ dependent on the strength of the nonlinearity, the number of queries to the differential operators that approaches the scaling of the quantum lower bound of $e^{o(T\|B\|)}$ queries in the limit of strong non-linearity. Finally, we introduce a classical algorithm based on the Euler method allowing comparably scaling to the quantum algorithm in a restricted case, as well as a randomized classical algorithm based on path integration that acts as a true analogue to the quantum algorithm in that it scales comparably to the quantum algorithm in cases where sign problems are absent.</description>

      <title>Entanglement of photonic modes from a continuously driven two-level system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07991v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ability to generate entangled states of light is a key primitive for quantum communication and distributed quantum computation. Continuously driven sources, including those based on spontaneous parametric downconversion, are usually probabilistic, whereas deterministic sources require accurate timing of the control fields. Here, we experimentally generate entangled photonic modes by continuously exciting a quantum emitter, a superconducting qubit, with a coherent drive, taking advantage of mode matching in the time and frequency domain. Using joint quantum state tomography and logarithmic negativity, we show that entanglement is generated between modes extracted from the two sidebands of the resonance fluorescence spectrum. Because the entangled photonic modes are perfectly orthogonal, they can be transferred into distinct quantum memories. Our approach can be utilized to distribute entanglement at a high rate in various physical platforms, with applications in waveguide quantum electrodynamics, distributed quantum computing, and quantum networks.</description>

      <title>Purcell-enhanced single-photon emission from InAs/GaAs quantum dots coupled to broadband cylindrical nanocavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11642v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: On-chip emitters that can generate single and entangled photons are essential building blocks for developing photonic quantum information processing technologies in a scalable fashion. Semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) are attractive candidates that emit high-quality quantum states of light on demand, however at a rate limited by their spontaneous radiative lifetime. In this study, we utilize the Purcell effect to demonstrate up to a 38-fold enhancement in the emission rate of InAs QDs by coupling them to metal-clad GaAs nanopillars. These cavities, featuring a sub-wavelength mode volume of 4.5x10-4 ({\lambda}/n)3 and low quality factor of 62, enable Purcell-enhanced single-photon emission across a large bandwidth of 15 nm. The broadband nature of the cavity eliminates the need for implementing tuning mechanisms typically required to achieve QD-cavity resonance, thus relaxing fabrication constraints. Ultimately, this QD-cavity architecture represents a significant stride towards developing solid-state quantum emitters generating near-ideal single-photon states at GHz-level repetition rates.</description>

      <title>NetQIR: An Extension of QIR for Distributed Quantum Computing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03712v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of quantum computing has highlighted the need for scalable and efficient software infrastructures to fully exploit its potential. Current quantum processors face significant scalability constraints due to the limited number of qubits per chip. In response, distributed quantum computing (DQC) -- achieved by networking multiple quantum processor units (QPUs) -- is emerging as a promising solution. To support this paradigm, robust intermediate representations (IRs) are needed to translate high-level quantum algorithms into executable instructions suitable for distributed systems. This paper presents NetQIR, an extension of Microsoft's Quantum Intermediate Representation (QIR), specifically designed to facilitate DQC by incorporating new instruction specifications. NetQIR was developed in response to the lack of abstraction at the network and hardware layers identified in the existing literature as a significant obstacle to effectively implementing distributed quantum algorithms. Based on this analysis, NetQIR introduces new essential abstraction features to support compilers in DQC contexts. It defines network communication instructions independent of specific hardware, abstracting the complexities of inter-QPU communication. Leveraging the QIR framework, NetQIR aims to bridge the gap between high-level quantum algorithm design and low-level hardware execution, thus promoting modular and scalable approaches to quantum software infrastructures for distributed applications.</description>

      <title>Speed Limits and Scrambling in Krylov Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06855v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the relationship between Krylov complexity and operator quantum speed limits (OQSLs) of the complexity operator and level repulsion in random/integrable matrices and many-body systems. An enhanced level-repulsion corresponds to increased OQSLs in random/integrable matrices. However, in many-body systems, the dynamics is more intricate due to the tensor product structure of the models. Initially, as the integrability-breaking parameter increases, the OQSL also increases, suggesting that breaking integrability allows for faster evolution of the complexity operator. At larger values of integrability-breaking, the OQSL decreases, suggesting a slowdown in the operator's evolution speed. Information-theoretic properties, such as scrambling, coherence and entanglement, of Krylov basis operators in many-body systems, are also investigated. The scrambling behaviour of these operators exhibits distinct patterns in integrable and chaotic cases. For systems exhibiting chaotic dynamics, the Krylov basis operators remain a reliable measure of these properties of the time-evolved operator at late times. However, in integrable systems, the Krylov operator's ability to capture the entanglement dynamics is less effective, especially during late times.</description>

      <title>Accurately Simulating the Time Evolution of an Ising Model with Echo Verified Clifford Data Regression on a Superconducting Quantum Computer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07439v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an error mitigation strategy composed of Echo Verification (EV) and Clifford Data Regression (CDR), the combination of which allows one to learn the effect of the quantum noise channel to extract error mitigated estimates for the expectation value of Pauli observables. We analyse the behaviour of the method under the depolarizing channel and derive an estimator for the depolarization rate in terms of the ancilla purity and postselection probability. We also highlight the sensitivity of this probability to noise, a potential bottleneck for the technique. We subsequently consider a more general noise channel consisting of arbitrary Pauli errors, which reveals a linear relationship between the error rates and the estimation of expectation values, suggesting the learnability of noise in EV by regression techniques. Finally, we present a practical demonstration of Echo Verified Clifford Data Regression (EVCDR) on a superconducting quantum computer and observe accurate results for the time evolution of an Ising model over spin-lattices consisting of up to 35 sites and circuit depths up to 173 entangling layers.</description>

      <title>Magneto-optical properties of Group-IV--vacancy centers in diamond upon hydrostatic pressure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10407v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, the negatively charged group-IV--vacancy defects in diamond, labeled as G4V(-) or G4V centers, have attracted significant attention in quantum information processing. In this study, we investigate the magneto-optical properties of G4V centers under high compressive hydrostatic pressures up to 180 GPa. The spin-orbit splitting of the electronic ground and excited states, as well as the hyperfine tensors, are calculated using plane-wave supercell density functional theory, providing distinctive fingerprints that uniquely characterize these defects. To this end, we develop a theory for calculating the hyperfine tensors when the electronic states are subject to the Jahn--Teller effect. We find that the zero-phonon-line energy increases with hydrostatic pressure, with the deformation potential increasing from SiV(-) to PbV(-). On the other hand, our calculated photoionization threshold energies indicate that PbV(-)-based quantum sensors can operate only up to 32 GPa, whereas SnV(-), GeV(-), and SiV(-) remain photostable up to 180 GPa. We also find that the spin-orbit splitting increases in both the electronic ground and excited states with increasing pressure. The optical transitions associated with the hyperfine fine structure of the dopant atoms are interpreted using our theoretical framework, which reproduces existing experimental data at zero strain. We show that the hyperfine levels are weakly dependent on magnetic field, and increasing pressure leads to optical transitions at longer wavelengths. Finally, we estimate the spin coherence times of the G4V centers under increasing hydrostatic pressure across different temperature regimes.</description>

      <title>Quantum Kernel Methods under Scrutiny: A Benchmarking Study</title>

Abstract: Since the entry of kernel theory in the field of quantum machine learning, quantum kernel methods (QKMs) have gained increasing attention with regard to both probing promising applications and delivering intriguing research insights. Benchmarking these methods is crucial to gain robust insights and to understand their practical utility. In this work, we present a comprehensive large-scale study examining QKMs based on fidelity quantum kernels (FQKs) and projected quantum kernels (PQKs) across a manifold of design choices. Our investigation encompasses both classification and regression tasks for five dataset families and 64 datasets, systematically comparing the use of FQKs and PQKs quantum support vector machines and kernel ridge regression. This resulted in over 20,000 models that were trained and optimized using a state-of-the-art hyperparameter search to ensure robust and comprehensive insights. We delve into the importance of hyperparameters on model performance scores and support our findings through rigorous correlation analyses. Additionally, we provide an in-depth analysis addressing the design freedom of PQKs and explore the underlying principles responsible for learning. Our goal is not to identify the best-performing model for a specific task but to uncover the mechanisms that lead to effective QKMs and reveal universal patterns.</description>

Abstract: Quantum computing is rapidly advancing, harnessing the power of qubits' superposition and entanglement for computational advantages over classical systems. However, scalability poses a primary challenge for these machines. By implementing a hybrid workflow between classical and quantum computing instances, D-Wave has succeeded in pushing this boundary to the realm of industrial use. Furthermore, they have recently opened up to mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problems, expanding their applicability to many relevant problems in the field of optimisation. However, the extent of their suitability for diverse problem categories and their computational advantages remains unclear. This study conducts a comprehensive examination by applying a selection of diverse case studies to benchmark the performance of D-Wave's hybrid solver against that of industry-leading solvers such as CPLEX, Gurobi, and IPOPT. The findings indicate that D-Wave's hybrid solver is currently most advantageous for integer quadratic objective functions and shows potential for quadratic constraints. To illustrate this, we applied it to a real-world energy problem, specifically the MILP unit commitment problem. While D-Wave can solve such problems, its performance has not yet matched that of its classical counterparts.</description>

      <title>The role of higher-order terms in trapped-ion quantum computing with magnetic gradient induced coupling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10498v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Trapped-ion hardware based on the Magnetic Gradient Induced Coupling (MAGIC) scheme is emerging as a promising platform for quantum computing. Nevertheless, in this -- as in any other -- quantum-computing platform, many technical questions still have to be resolved before large-scale and error-tolerant applications are possible. In this work, we present a thorough discussion of the structure and effects of higher-order terms in the MAGIC setup, which can occur due to anharmonicities in the external potential of the ion crystal (e.g., through Coulomb repulsion) or through curvature of the applied magnetic field. These terms generate systematic shifts in the leading-order interactions and take the form of three-spin couplings, two-spin couplings, local fields, as well as diverse phonon-phonon conversion mechanisms. We find that most of these are negligible in realistic situations, with only two contributions that need careful attention. First, there are undesired longitudinal fields contributing shifts to the resonance frequency, whose strength increases with chain length and phonon occupation numbers; while their mean effect can easily be compensated by additional $Z$ rotations, phonon number fluctuations need to be avoided for precise gate operations. Second, anharmonicities of the Coulomb interaction can lead to well-known two-to-one conversions of phonon excitations. Both of these error terms can be mitigated by sufficiently cooling the phonons to the ground-state. Our detailed analysis constitutes an important contribution on the way of making magnetic-gradient trapped-ion quantum technology fit for large-scale applications, and it may inspire new ways to purposefully design interaction terms.</description>

      <title>Performance of Quantum Approximate Optimization with Quantum Error Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12104v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum algorithms must be scaled up to tackle real-world applications. Doing so requires overcoming the noise present on today's hardware. The quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) is a promising candidate for scaling up, due to its modest resource requirements and documented asymptotic speedup over state-of-the-art classical algorithms for some problems. However, achieving better-than-classical performance with QAOA is believed to require fault tolerance. In this paper, we demonstrate a partially fault-tolerant implementation of QAOA using the $[[k+2,k,2]]$ ``Iceberg'' error detection code. We observe that encoding the circuit with the Iceberg code improves the algorithmic performance as compared to the unencoded circuit for problems with up to $20$ logical qubits on a trapped-ion quantum computer. Additionally, we propose and calibrate a model for predicting the code performance. We use this model to characterize the limits of the Iceberg code and extrapolate its performance to future hardware with improved error rates. In particular, we show how our model can be used to determine the necessary conditions for QAOA to outperform the Goemans-Williamson algorithm on future hardware. To the best of our knowledge, our results demonstrate the largest universal quantum computing algorithm protected by partially fault-tolerant quantum error detection on practical applications to date, paving the way towards solving real-world applications with quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Preserving phase coherence and linearity in cat qubits with exponential bit-flip suppression</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17556v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cat qubits, a type of bosonic qubit encoded in a harmonic oscillator, can exhibit an exponential noise bias against bit-flip errors with increasing mean photon number. Here, we focus on cat qubits stabilized by two-photon dissipation, where pairs of photons are added and removed from a harmonic oscillator by an auxiliary, lossy buffer mode. This process requires a large loss rate and strong nonlinearities of the buffer mode that must not degrade the coherence and linearity of the oscillator. In this work, we show how to overcome this challenge by coloring the loss environment of the buffer mode with a multi-pole filter and optimizing the circuit to take into account additional inductances in the buffer mode. Using these techniques, we achieve near-ideal enhancement of cat-qubit bit-flip times with increasing photon number, reaching over $0.1$ seconds with a mean photon number of only $4$. Concurrently, our cat qubit remains highly phase coherent, with phase-flip times corresponding to an effective lifetime of $T_{1,\text{eff}} \simeq 70$ $\mu$s, comparable with the bare oscillator lifetime. We achieve this performance even in the presence of an ancilla transmon, used for reading out the cat qubit states, by engineering a tunable oscillator-ancilla dispersive coupling. Furthermore, the low nonlinearity of the harmonic oscillator mode allows us to perform pulsed cat-qubit stabilization, an important control primitive, where the stabilization can remain off for a significant fraction (e.g., two thirds) of a $3~\mathrm{\mu s}$ cycle without degrading bit-flip times. These advances are important for the realization of scalable error-correction with cat qubits, where large noise bias and low phase-flip error rate enable the use of hardware-efficient outer error-correcting codes.</description>

Abstract: While quantum state tomography (QST) remains the gold standard for benchmarking and verifying quantum devices, it requires an exponentially large number of measurements and classical computational resources for generic quantum many-body systems, making it impractical even for intermediate-size quantum devices. Fortunately, many physical quantum states often exhibit certain low-dimensional structures that enable the development of efficient QST. A notable example is the class of states represented by matrix product operators (MPOs) with a finite matrix/bond dimension, which include most physical states in one dimension and where the number of independent parameters describing the states only grows linearly with the number of qubits. Whether a sample efficient quantum state tomography protocol, where the number of required state copies scales only linearly as the number of parameters describing the state, exists for a generic MPO state still remains an important open question.
  In this paper, we answer this fundamental question affirmatively by using a class of informationally complete positive operator-valued measures (IC-POVMs) -- including symmetric IC-POVMs (SIC-POVMs) and spherical $t$-designs -- focusing on sample complexity while not accounting for the implementation complexity of the measurement settings. For SIC-POVMs and (approximate) spherical 2-designs, we show that the number of state copies to guarantee bounded recovery error of an MPO state with a constrained least-squares estimator depends on the probability distribution of the MPO under the POVM but scales only linearly with $n$ when the distribution is approximately uniform. For spherical $t$-designs with $t\ge3$, we prove that only a number of state copies proportional to the number of independent parameters in the MPO is needed for a guaranteed recovery of \emph{any} state represented by an MPO.</description>

      <title>Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm and Quantum-enhanced Markov Chain Monte Carlo: A Hybrid Approach to Data Assimilation in 4DVAR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03853v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel hybrid quantum-classical framework that integrates the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) and Quantum-enhanced Markov Chain Monte Carlo (QMCMC) with variational particle filters to tackle the computational challenges in Four-Dimensional Variational Data Assimilation (4DVAR). 4DVAR, widely used in numerical weather prediction, suffers from inefficiencies in high-dimensional, non-linear systems. Our approach, the Quantum Variational Particle Filter (QVPF), uses QAOA to optimize particle proposals and QMCMC to efficiently compute particle weights and resample, accelerating convergence while reducing the computational load.
  The QVPF framework addresses the curse of dimensionality by minimizing the number of particles required for accurate state estimation, thus improving efficiency in systems with complex dynamics. The hybrid model offers enhanced accuracy by integrating quantum algorithms into the variational particle filter, making it particularly suited for applications in climate modeling, space weather prediction, and defense. The potential for achieving unprecedented resolution in predictive models could transform sectors that rely on high-resolution forecasting.
  We present the mathematical foundations of the approach, along with discussions on algorithmic implementation and hardware requirements. Early results suggest that this hybrid framework could significantly improve data assimilation, with future implementations on near-term quantum devices offering a practical pathway for scaling up. This work demonstrates how quantum computing can address the growing need for more accurate and computationally feasible methods in large-scale data assimilation.</description>

      <title>Quantum Algorithm for the Advection-Diffusion Equation by Direct Block Encoding of the Time-Marching Operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07909v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A quantum algorithm for simulating multidimensional scalar transport problems using a time-marching strategy is presented. A direct unitary block encoding of the explicit time-marching operator is constructed, resulting in the intrinsic success probability of the squared solution norm without the need for amplitude amplification, thereby retaining a linear dependence on the simulation time. The algorithm separates the explicit time-marching operator into an advection-like component and a corrective shift operator. The advection-like component is mapped to a Hamiltonian simulation and combined with the shift operator through the linear combination of unitaries algorithm. State-vector simulations of a scalar transported in a steady two-dimensional Taylor-Green vortex support the theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Universal quantum computation using Ising anyons from a non-semisimple Topological Quantum Field Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14860v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a framework for topological quantum computation using newly discovered non-semisimple analogs of topological quantum field theories in 2+1 dimensions. These enhanced theories offer more powerful models for quantum computation. The conventional theory of Ising anyons, which is believed to describe excitations in the $\nu = 5/2$ fractional quantum Hall state, is not universal for quantum computation via braiding of quasiparticles. However, we show that the non-semisimple theory introduces new anyon types that extend the Ising framework. By adding just one new anyon type, universal quantum computation can be achieved through braiding alone. This result opens new avenues for realizing fault-tolerant quantum computing in topologically ordered systems.</description>

      <title>Entanglement dynamics for Squeezed Coherent Thermal States in the Jaynes-Cummings model with atoms in Bell and Werner states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18466v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the dynamics of entanglement within the Jaynes-Cummings model (JCM), focusing on the behavior of atoms in both Bell and Werner states, when subjected to thermal and squeezed photons represented by squeezed coherent thermal states (SCTS). We study the entanglement between the two atoms as well as between atoms and field. Using concurrence and negativity, we have calculated the atom-atom and atom-field entanglements, respectively. The phenomenon of entanglement sudden death (ESD) and how various interactions (such as Ising-type, dipole-dipole, and Kerr-nonlinearity) affect these dynamics are studied. This work compares the effects of these interactions on different subsystems of atom-field system, providing insights into how thermal and quantum noise impact entanglement behavior in these subsystems.</description>

      <title>Spin-dependent Force from an NV center Ensemble on a Microlever</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18762v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the observation of spin-dependent force induced by Nitrogen Vacancy (NV) centers embedded in a diamond crystal attached to a tethered oscillator. This result was obtained using a spin-dependent torque generated by a micro-diamond containing billions of NV centers, placed at the end of a commercially available silicon cantilever. %We demonstrate that the fundamental flexural mode of the cantilever is excited by the spins of the NV centers. These spins are uniformly coupled to an externally applied homogeneous magnetic field, which enables the NV centers to exert a measurable spin-dependent torque on the cantilever, driving its center of mass motion. Our experiment highlights the intricate interplay between the spin properties of NV centers and the mechanical behavior of the oscillator in the presence of a pure torque, providing a set of tools for exploring quantum effects in state of the art micro-mechanical systems.</description>

      <title>Expressibility, entangling power and quantum average causal effect for causally indefinite circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08609v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Parameterized quantum circuits are the core of new technologies such as variational quantum algorithms and quantum machine learning, which makes studying its properties a valuable task. We implement parameterized circuits with definite and indefinite causal order and compare their performance under particular descriptors. One of these is the expressibility, which measures how uniformly a given quantum circuit can reach the whole Hilbert space. Another property that we focus on this work is the entanglement capability, more specifically the concurrence and the entangling power. We also find the causal relation between the qubits of our system with the quantum average causal effect measure. We have found that indefinite circuits offer expressibility advantages over definite ones while maintaining the level of entanglement generation. Our results also point to the existence of a correlation between the quantum average causal effect and the entangling power.</description>

      <title>Boosting quantum annealing performance through direct polynomial unconstrained binary optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04398v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum annealing aims at solving optimization problems of practical relevance using quantum-computing hardware. Problems of interest are typically formulated in terms of quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) Hamiltonians. However, many optimization problems are much more naturally formulated in terms of polynomial unconstrained binary optimization (PUBO) functions of higher order. As we show with various problem examples, leveraging the PUBO formulation can bring considerable savings in terms of required number of qubits. Moreover, in numerical benchmarks for the paradigmatic 3-SAT problem, we find scenarios where the scaling of the minimum energy gap during the optimization sweep differs significantly, suggesting the possibility of an exponentially faster annealing time when using the PUBO as compared to the QUBO formulation. This advantage persists even when considering the overhead caused by the higher-order interactions necessary for PUBO cost Hamiltonians. As an interesting side effect, the analysis on minimum energy gaps of different 3-SAT instance generators reveals different degrees of hardness, which will be of interest also for classical benchmark calculations. Our findings show a promising path to improving the resource efficiency and sweeping speed of quantum annealing protocols on both analog and digital platforms, which are important prerequisites when aiming at solving larger optimization problems with relevance to industry.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian simulation-based quantum-selected configuration interaction for large-scale electronic structure calculations with a quantum computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07218v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum-selected configuration interaction (QSCI) is an approach for quantum chemical calculations using current quantum computers. In conventional QSCI, Slater determinants used for the wave function expansion are sampled by iteratively performing approximate wave function preparation and subsequent measurement in the computational basis, and then the subspace Hamiltonian matrix is diagonalized on a classical computer. In this approach, preparation of a high-quality approximate wave function is necessary to accurately compute total energies. Here we propose a Hamiltonian simulation-based QSCI (HSB-QSCI) to avoid this difficulty, by sampling the Slater determinants from quantum states generated by the real-time evolution of approximate wave functions. We provide numerical simulations for the lowest spin-singlet and triplet states of oligoacenes (benzene, naphthalene, and anthracene), phenylene-1,4-dinitrene, and hexa-1,2,3,4,5-pentaene. We found that the HSB-QSCI is applicable not only to molecules where the Hartree--Fock provides a good approximation of the ground state, but also to strongly correlated systems where preparing a high-quality approximate wave function is hard. Hardware demonstrations of the HSB-QSCI are also reported for carbyne molecules expressed by up to 36 qubits, using an IBM Quantum processor. The HSB-QSCI captures more than 99.75\% of the correlation energies in the active space by considering about 1\% of all the Slater determinants in 36 qubit systems, illustrating the ability of the proposed method to efficiently consider important electronic configurations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07552v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend the theory of the radiation pressure to include quadratic fluctuations in the position of a moving mirror. This enables the introduction of a generalized radiation pressure operator that captures higher-order effects in the mirror-field coupling. For mechanical resonators with frequencies comparable to the fundamental cavity frequency, the resulting corrections to the optomechanical Hamiltonian are quadratic in the standard radiation pressure coupling. These corrections are expected to play a significant role in the strong coupling regime of optomechanics, electromechanics, and superconducting circuit analogs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08764v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In two prior papers of this series, it was proposed that a wavefunction model of a heavy particle and a collection of light particles might generate ``Brownian-Motion-Like" trajectories as well as diffusive motion (displacement proportional to the square-root of time) of the heavy particle, but did not exhibit a concrete instance. Here we introduce a one-space-dimensional model which, granted a finite perturbation series, fulfills the criteria for BML trajectories and diffusion. We note that Planck's constant and the molecular mass of light particles make an appearance in the diffusion coefficient, which further differentiates the present theory from the work of Poincar{\'e} and Einstein in the previous century.</description>

      <title>Environment engineering to protect quantum coherence in tripartite systems under dephasing noise</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15082v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The practical success of quantum technology hinges on sustaining quantum coherence, which is vulnerable to environmental interactions causing decoherence. We investigate coherence in tripartite quantum systems under the influence of noisy environment. In this study, we explore the dynamics of the relative entropy of coherence for tripartite pure and mixed states in the presence of structured dephasing environments at finite temperatures. Our findings demonstrate that the system's resilience to decoherence is strongly influenced by the bath type and configuration. Specifically, when each qubit interacts with an independent environment, the coherence dynamics differ from those observed in a shared bath setting. In a Markov, memoryless environment, coherence in both pure and mixed states decay faster, whereas coherence is preserved for longer time in the presence of environment memory. This highlights the crucial role of environment memory in enhancing the robustness of tripartite coherence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08843v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the wireless charging of a quantum battery (QB) via $n$ charging units, whose coupling is mediated by a common bosonic reservoir. We consider the general scenarios in which the charger energy is not maximal and the QB has residual ergotropy initially. It is found that the charging performance improves with the increase of the coupling strength. In the strong coupling regime, the charging time is insensitive to the charger energy, the number of charging units, and the residual ergotropy in the QB, while the ergotropy charged on the QB strongly depends on the charger energy and ergotropy, and the residual ergotropy in the QB does not help to enhance its performance. Moreover, the multiple charging units help to enhance the charging performance in the weak and moderate coupling regimes, while they are less efficient in the strong coupling regime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12447v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The precise one-shot characterisation of operational tasks in classical and quantum information theory relies on different forms of smooth entropic quantities. A particularly important connection is between the hypothesis testing relative entropy and the smoothed max-relative entropy, which together govern many operational settings. We first strengthen this connection into a type of equivalence: we show that the hypothesis testing relative entropy is equivalent to a variant of the smooth max-relative entropy based on the information spectrum divergence, which can be alternatively understood as a measured smooth max-relative entropy. Furthermore, we improve a fundamental lemma due to Datta and Renner that connects the different variants of the smoothed max-relative entropy, introducing a modified proof technique based on matrix geometric means and a tightened gentle measurement lemma. We use the unveiled connections and tools to strictly improve on previously known one-shot bounds and duality relations between the smooth max-relative entropy and the hypothesis testing relative entropy, sharpening also bounds that connect the max-relative entropy with R\'enyi divergences.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we propose an efficient method to reduce error floors in quantum error correction using non-binary low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes. We identify and classify cycle structures in the parity-check matrix where estimated noise becomes trapped, and develop tailored decoding methods for each cycle type. For Type-I cycles, we propose a method to make the difference between estimated and true noise degenerate. Type-II cycles are shown to be uncorrectable, while for Type-III cycles, we utilize the fact that cycles in non-binary LDPC codes do not necessarily correspond to codewords, allowing us to estimate the true noise. Our method significantly improves decoding performance and reduces error floors.</description>

Abstract: The fact that in the course of an open evolution there is, in a vast majority of cases, a creation of system-environment entanglement out of the initial coherences, has been known for many years. However, how much entanglement can be created under general assumptions has not been analyzed yet. In this work, we investigate system-environment entanglement generation under a broad and important class of interactions known as pure dephasing interactions. Using completely general initial states, we derive a series of bounds on the amount of the created entanglement, connecting it to the initial system coherences as well as to the decohrence strength, making quantitatively precise the statement that larger entanglement leads to more decoherence. Interestingly, we obtain lower bounds, certifying minimal amount of entanglement that can be produced. As an illustration, we apply our results to the spin-boson model, where a qubit interacts with a bosonic bath, showing time evolution of the entanglement and the Markovian/non-Markovian crossover. Our results help to better understand and quantify the complicated correlations, produced during an open evolution, which will hopefully lead to better/new decoherence mitigation techniques.</description>

      <title>Quantum Circuit Design using a Progressive Widening Enhanced Monte Carlo Tree Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03962v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The performance of Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) strongly depends on the choice of the parameterized quantum circuit to optimize. One of the biggest challenges in VQAs is designing quantum circuits tailored to the particular problem. This article proposes a gradient-free Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) technique to automate the process of quantum circuit design. Our proposed technique introduces a novel formulation of the action space based on a sampling scheme and a progressive widening technique to explore the space dynamically. When testing our MCTS approach on the domain of random quantum circuits, MCTS approximates unstructured circuits under different values of stabilizer R\'enyi entropy. It turns out that MCTS manages to approximate the benchmark quantum states independently from their degree of nonstabilizerness. Next, our technique exhibits robustness across various application domains, including quantum chemistry and systems of linear equations. Compared to previous MCTS research, our technique reduces the number of quantum circuit evaluations by a factor of 10 up to 100 while achieving equal or better results. In addition, the resulting quantum circuits exhibit up to three times fewer CNOT gates, which is important for implementation on noisy quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>Perfect state transfer between real pure states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08103v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pure states correspond to one-dimensional subspaces of $\mathbb{C}^n$ represented by unit vectors. In this paper, we develop the theory of perfect state transfer (PST) between real pure states with emphasis on the adjacency and Laplacian matrices as Hamiltonians of a graph representing a quantum spin network. We characterize PST between real pure states based on the spectral information of a graph and prove three fundamental results: (i) every periodic real pure state $\mathbf{x}$ admits perfect state transfer with another real pure state $\mathbf{y}$, (ii) every connected graph admits perfect state transfer between real pure states, and (iii) for any pair of real pure states $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{y}$ and for any time $\tau$, there exists a real symmetric matrix $M$ such that $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{y}$ admits perfect state transfer relative to $M$ at time $\tau$. We also determine all real pure states that admit PST in complete graphs, complete bipartite graphs, paths, and cycles. This leads to a complete characterization of pair and plus state transfer in paths and complete bipartite graphs. We give constructions of graphs that admit PST between real pure states. Finally, using results on the spread of graphs, we prove that amongst all $n$-vertex simple unweighted graphs, the least minimum PST time between real pure states relative to the Laplacian is attained by any join graph, while the it is attained by the join of an empty graph and a complete graph of appropriate sizes relative to the adjacency matrix.</description>

Abstract: We propose and theoretically analyse a superconducting electric circuit which can be used to experimentally realize an autonomous quantum heat engine. Using a quasiclassical, non-Markovian theoretical model, we demonstrate that coherent microwave power generation can emerge solely from the heat flow through the circuit determined by non-linear circuit quantum electrodynamics. The predicted energy generation rate is sufficiently high for its experimental observation with contemporary techniques, rendering this work a significant step toward the first experimental realization of an autonomous quantum heat engine based on Otto cycles.</description>

      <title>Unitality Conditions on Subsystems in Quantum Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11956v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is known that non-unital noise such as the amplitude damping can sometimes increase quantum correlations, while unital noise such as the dephasing usually decreases quantum correlations. It is, therefore, important to delineate the conditions, when noise can enhance the quantumness of the system. Here, we show that if the noise acting on the system is unital (non-unital), then the noise acting on the environment must also be unital (non-unital), for the evolution to be unitary in the joint system-environment space. For example, if the first two qubits are treated as system and the third qubit is treated as environment, then both the system and the environment evolve unitally in case of a three-qubit GHZ state, and both of them evolve non-unitally in case of a three-qubit W state. Our result may be of interest in quantum information, and we anticipate it to be useful in various contexts, such as to better tackle noise in quantum computing and quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Co-Designing Eigen- and Singular-value Transformation Oracles: From Algorithmic Applications to Hardware Compilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16029v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We co-design a family of quantum eigenvalue transformation oracles that can be efficiently implemented on hybrid discrete/continuous-variable (qubit/qumode) hardware. To showcase the oracle's representation-theoretic power, and near-term experimental accessibility, we encode a Gaussian imaginary time evolution spectral filter. In doing so, we define a continuous linear combination of unitaries block-encoding. Due to the ancilla qumode's infinite-dimensional nature, continuous variable qumodes constitute a powerful compilation tool for encoding continuous spectral functions without discretization errors while minimizing resource requirements. We then focus on the ubiquitous task of eigenstate preparation in quantum spin models. For completeness, we provide an end-to-end compilation -- applicable in both near-term and large-scale quantum processors -- expressing high-level oracles in terms of an experimentally realizable instruction set architecture. Our algorithms scale linearly with the spatial extent of the target system, and we provide details for 1D and 2D examples. Finally, we examine the leading-order effects of physical errors and highlight open research directions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18670v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum optics plays a crucial role in developing quantum computers on different platforms. In photonics, precise control over light's degrees of freedom, including discrete variables (polarization, photon number, orbital angular momentum) and continuous variables (phase, amplitude quadratures, frequency), is fundamental. Our model manipulates photonic systems to encode and process quantum information via the photon's spatial degree of freedom, employing polarization as an auxiliary qubit. We propose a programmable photonic circuit that simulates quantum channels, including phase-damping, amplitude-damping, and bit-flip channels, through adjustable interferometric parameters. Furthermore, the interferometer extends to complex channels, such as the squeezed generalized amplitude damping. This work contributes to advancing quantum simulation techniques and serves as a foundation for exploring quantum computing applications, while highlighting pathways for their practical implementation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19661v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the fundamental constraint on work far beyond the adiabatic regime is crucial to investigating fast and efficient energy extraction or consumption processes. In this study, we derive thermodynamic speed limits for non-adiabatic work and quantify the fundamental costs of non-adiabatic work extraction or consumption processes in open quantum systems, where the costs are quantified by geometric and thermodynamic quantities. We further decompose the non-adiabatic work into classical and quantum contributions and derive their thermodynamic speed limits, clarifying the classical and quantum nature of the fundamental costs. The obtained results are numerically demonstrated by driven two-level systems.</description>

      <title>Enhancing quantum computations with the synergy of auxiliary field quantum Monte Carlo and computational basis tomography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20066v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce QC-CBT-AFQMC, a hybrid algorithm that incorporates computational basis tomography (CBT) into the quantum-classical auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (QC-AFQMC) method proposed by Huggins et al. [Nature 603, 416-420 (2022)], replacing the use of classical shadows. While the original QC-AFQMC showed high accuracy for quantum chemistry calculations, it required exponentially costly post-processing. Subsequent work using Matchgate shadows [Commun. Math. Phys. 404, 629 (2023)] improved scalability, but still suffers from prohibitive computational requirements that limit practical applications. Our QC-CBT-AFQMC approach uses shallow Clifford circuits with a quadratic reduction of two-qubit gates over the original algorithm, significantly reducing computational requirements and enabling accurate calculations under limited measurement budgets. We demonstrate its effectiveness on the hydroxyl radical, ethylene, and nitrogen molecule, producing potential energy curves that closely match established benchmarks. We also examine the influence of CBT measurement counts on accuracy, showing that subtracting the active space AFQMC energy mitigates measurement-induced errors. Furthermore, we apply QC-CBT-AFQMC to estimate reaction barriers in [3+2]-cycloaddition reactions, achieving agreement with high-level references and successfully incorporating complete basis set extrapolation techniques. These results highlight QC-CBT-AFQMC as a practical quantum-classical hybrid method that bridges the capabilities of quantum devices and accurate chemical simulations.</description>

      <title>On Exact Sizes of Minimal CNOT Circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01467v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Computing a minimum-size circuit that implements a certain function is a standard optimization task. We consider circuits of CNOT gates, which are fundamental binary gates in reversible and quantum computing. Algebraically, CNOT circuits on $n$ qubits correspond to $GL(n,2)$, the general linear group over the field of two elements, and circuit minimization reduces to computing distances in the Cayley graph $G_n$ of $GL(n,2)$ generated by transvections. However, the super-exponential size of $GL(n,2)$ has made its exploration computationally challenging.
  In this paper, we develop a new approach for computing distances in $G_n$, allowing us to synthesize minimum circuits that were previously beyond reach (e.g., we can synthesize optimally all circuits over $n=7$ qubits). Towards this, we establish two theoretical results that may be of independent interest. First, we give a complete characterization of all isometries in $G_n$ in terms of (i) permuting qubits and (ii) swapping the arguments of all CNOT gates. Second, for any fixed $d$, we establish polynomials in $n$ of degree $2d$ that characterize the size of spheres in $G_n$ at distance $d$, as long as $n\geq 2d$. With these tools, we revisit an open question of [Bataille, 2022] regarding the smallest number $n_0$ for which the diameter of $G_{n_0}$ exceeds $3(n_0-1)$. It was previously shown that $6\leq n_0 \leq 30$, a gap that we tighten considerably to $8\leq n_0 \leq 20$. We also confirm a conjecture that long cycle permutations lie at distance $3(n-1)$, for all $n\leq 8$, extending the previous bound of $n\leq 5$.</description>

      <title>SSR: A Swapping-Sweeping-and-Rewriting Optimizer for Quantum Circuit Transformation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03227v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum circuit transformation (QCT), necessary for adapting any quantum circuit to the qubit connectivity constraints of the NISQ device, often introduces numerous additional SWAP gates into the original circuit, increasing the circuit depth and thus reducing the success rate of computation. To minimize the depth of QCT circuits, we propose a Swapping-Sweeping-and-Rewriting optimizer. This optimizer rearranges the circuit based on generalized gate commutation rules via a genetic algorithm, extracts subcircuits consisting of CNOT gates using a circuit sweeping technique, and rewrites each subcircuit with a functionally equivalent and depth-optimal circuit generated by an SAT solver. The devised optimizer effectively captures the intrinsic patterns of the QCT circuits, and the experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm can significantly reduce the depth of QCT circuits, 26.68\% at most and 12.18\% on average, across all benchmark circuits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11500v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Exploring an efficient and scalable architecture of fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC) is vital for demonstrating useful quantum computing. Here, we propose and evaluate a scalable and practical architecture with a cavity-quantum-electrodynamics (CQED) network. Our architecture takes advantage of the stability of neutral atoms and the flexibility of a CQED network. We show a concrete framework for implementing surface codes and numerically analyze the logical error rate and threshold values beyond the simplified circuit-level noise model on several network structures. Although the requirement of CQED parameters is demanding given the current performance of experimental systems, we show that an error-decoding algorithm tailored to our proposed architecture, where the loss information of ancillary photons is utilized, greatly improves the error threshold. For example, the internal cooperativity, a good figure of merit of the cavity performance for quantum computing, required for FTQC is relaxed to 1/5 compared to the normal error-decoding for the surface code. Since our proposal and results can be extended to other LDPC codes straightforwardly, our approach will lead to achieve more reliable FTQC using CQED.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12790v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) enables efficient fine-tuning of pre-trained language models through low-rank matrix approximation, achieving effectiveness in many scenarios. However, its representation capacity is constrained in complex tasks or high-rank dependency settings, potentially limiting model adaptability. To overcome the expressive bottleneck in classical low-rank approximation for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs), we propose Quantum Tensor Hybrid Adaptation (QTHA), a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method that integrates a quantum neural network (QNN) with a tensor network. QTHA explores quantum tensor hybrid fine-tuning within low-rank spaces by decomposing pre-trained weights into quantum neural network and tensor network representations, leveraging quantum state superposition to overcome classical rank limitations. Experiments demonstrate that QTHA achieves performance comparable to or surpassing LoRA in parameter-efficient fine-tuning. Compared to LoRA, QTHA reduces trainable parameters by 76% while reducing training loss by up to 17% and improving test set performance by up to 17% within the same training steps. This research not only enables lightweight adaptation of quantum resources to the billion-parameter models but also validates the feasibility of quantum hardware optimization driven by LLM tasks. It establishes the first engineering-ready foundation for future quantum-enhanced Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) systems.</description>

      <title>Exploring new variational quantum circuit ansatzes for solving $SU(2)$ matrix models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13368v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we explored and experimented with new forms of parameterized quantum circuits to be used as variational ansatzes for solving the bosonic and supersymmetric $SU(2)$ matrix models at different couplings using the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) algorithm. Working with IBM Qiskit quantum computing platform, we show that two types of quantum circuits named TwoLocal and EvolvedOperatorAnsatz can outperform the popular EfficientSU2 circuits which have been routinely used in the recent quantum physics literature to run VQE. With their more customizable constructions that allow for more flexibility beyond choosing the types of parameterized rotation gates, both types of new circuit ansatzes used in this work have led to performances that are either better than or at least comparable to EfficientSU2 in the setting of $SU(2)$ matrix models. In particular, in the strong coupling regime of the bosonic model, both TwoLocal and EvolvedOperatorAnsatz circuits provided a better approximation to the exact ground state, while in the supersymmetric model, shallow EvolvedOperatorAnsatz circuits, with a small number of parameters, attained a comparable or even better performance compared to the much deeper EfficientSU2 circuits with around 8 to 9 times more parameters. The results of this work demonstrate conclusively the potential of TwoLocal and EvolvedOperatorAnsatz quantum circuits as efficient new types of variational ansatzes that should be considered more frequently in future VQE studies of quantum physics systems.</description>

This study benchmarks a ground-state algorithm, Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE), against three leading quantum dynamics algorithms, Trotterization, Variational Quantum Imaginary Time Evolution (VarQTE), and Adaptive Variational Quantum Dynamics Simulation (AVQDS), applied to the same PDE on small quantum hardware. While Trotterization is fully quantum, VarQTE and AVQDS are variational algorithms that reduce circuit depth for noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. However, hardware results from these dynamics methods show sizable errors due to noise and limited shot statistics. To establish a noise-free performance baseline, we implement the VQE-based solver on a noiseless statevector simulator. Our results show VQE can reach final-time infidelities as low as ${O}(10^{-9})$ with $N=4$ qubits and moderate circuit depths, outperforming hardware-deployed dynamics methods that show infidelities $\gtrsim 10^{-1}$. By comparing noiseless VQE to shot-based and hardware-run algorithms, we assess their accuracy and resource demands, providing a baseline for future quantum PDE solvers. We conclude with a discussion of limitations and potential extensions to higher-dimensional, nonlinear PDEs relevant to engineering and finance.</description>

      <title>Dissipation and noise in strongly driven Josephson junctions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06877v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In circuit quantum electrodynamical systems, the quasiparticle-related losses in Josephson junctions are suppressed due to the gap in the superconducting density of states which is much higher than the typical energy of a microwave photon. In this work, we show that a strong drive even at a frequency lower than twice the superconductor gap parameter can activate dissipation in the junctions due to photon-assisted breaking of the Cooper pairs. Both the decay rate and noise strength associated with the losses are sensitive to the dc phase bias of the junction and can be tuned in a broad range by the amplitude and the frequency of the external driving field, making the suggested mechanism potentially attractive for designing tunable dissipative elements. We also predict pronounced memory effects in the driven Josephson junctions, which are appealing for both theoretical and experimental studies of non-Markovian physics in superconducting quantum circuits. We illustrate our theoretical findings by studying the spectral properties and the steady-state population of a low-impedance resonator coupled to the driven Josephson junction: we show the emergence of non-Lorentzian spectral lines and broad tunability of effective temperature of the steady state.</description>

      <title>Collective Superradiance: Estimating the Peak Emission Rate and Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09985v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Determining the peak photon emission time and rate for an ensemble of $N$ quantum systems undergoing collective superradiant decay typically requires tracking the time evolution of the density operator, a process with computational costs scaling exponentially with $N$. We present compact, analytic formulas for evaluating the peak emission rate and time for initially fully excited quantum emitter ensembles, valid for any geometric configuration and emitter type. These formulas rely solely on the variance of the eigenvalues of a real symmetric $N \times N$ matrix, which describes collective dissipation. We demonstrate the versatility of these results across various environments, including free space, solid-state, and waveguide reservoirs. For large $N$ the formulas simplify further to depend on just two parameters: average nearest-neighbor spacing and emitter number. Finally, we present scaling laws and bounds on the spatial size of emitter ensembles, such that superradiance is maintained, independent of emitter number or density.</description>

      <title>Work Statistics and Quantum Trajectories: No-Click Limit and non-Hermitian Hamiltonians</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11664v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a generalized framework for quantum work statistics in continuously monitored quantum systems that extends the conventional two-point measurement scheme to include the effects of multiple generalized measurements and post-selection of no-click trajectories. By deriving a modified generating function for work, our approach naturally incorporates non-Hermitian dynamics arising from quantum jump processes and reveals deviations from the standard Jarzynski equality due to measurement-induced asymmetries. We illustrate our theoretical framework by analyzing a one-dimensional transverse-field Ising model under local spin monitoring. In this model, increased measurement strength projects the system onto the no-click state, leading to a suppression of energy fluctuations and measurement-induced energy saturation, reminiscent of the quantum Zeno effect.</description>

      <title>Quantum Geometry of Finite XY Chains: A Comparison of Neveu-Schwarz and Ramond Sectors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13346v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a geometrical analysis of finite length XY quantum chains. We begin by examining the ground state and the first excited state of the model, emphasizing the impact of finite size effects under two distinct choices of the Jordan Wigner transformation: the Neveu Schwartz (NS) and Ramond (R) sectors. We explore the geometric features of the system by analyzing the quantum (Berry) curvature derived from the Fubini Study metric, which is intimately connected to the quantum Fisher information. This approach uncovers a rich interplay between boundary conditions and quantum geometry. In the gamma h parameter space, we identify distinct sign changing arcs of the curvature, confined to some region. These arcs mark transitions between the NS and R sectors, indicating fundamental changes in the structure of the fermionic ground state. Remarkably, the number of such transition lines increases with system size, hinting at an emergent continuum of topological boundary effects in the thermodynamic limit. Our findings highlight a novel mechanism where boundary conditions shape quantum geometric properties, offering new insights into finite size topology and the structure of low dimensional quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Addressing the Minor-Embedding Problem in Quantum Annealing and Evaluating State-of-the-Art Algorithm Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13376v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study addresses the minor-embedding problem, which involves mapping the variables of an Ising model onto a quantum annealing processor. The primary motivation stems from the observed performance disparity of quantum annealers when solving problems suited to the processor's architecture versus those with non-hardware-native topologies. Our research has two main objectives: i) to analyze the impact of embedding quality on the performance of D-Wave Systems quantum annealers, and ii) to evaluate the quality of the embeddings generated by Minorminer, an algorithm provided by D-Wave and widely recognized as the standard minor-embedding technique in the literature. Regarding the first objective, our experiments reveal a clear correlation between the average chain length of embeddings and the relative errors of the solutions sampled. This underscores the critical influence of embedding quality on quantum annealing performance. For the second objective, we focus on the Minorminer technique, assessing its capacity to embed problems, the quality of the embeddings produced, and the robustness of the results. We also compare its performance with Clique Embedding, another algorithm developed by D-Wave, which is deterministic and designed to embed fully connected Ising models into quantum annealing processors, serving as a worst-case scenario. The results demonstrate that there is significant room for improvement for Minorminer, as it has not consistently outperformed the worst-case scenario.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Non-local Observable on Quantum Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13414v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conventional Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs) for Quantum Machine Learning typically rely on a fixed Hermitian observable, often built from Pauli operators. Inspired by the Heisenberg picture, we propose an adaptive non-local measurement framework that substantially increases the model complexity of the quantum circuits. Our introduction of dynamical Hermitian observables with evolving parameters shows that optimizing VQC rotations corresponds to tracing a trajectory in the observable space. This viewpoint reveals that standard VQCs are merely a special case of the Heisenberg representation.
  Furthermore, we show that properly incorporating variational rotations with non-local observables enhances qubit interaction and information mixture, admitting flexible circuit designs. Two non-local measurement schemes are introduced, and numerical simulations on classification tasks confirm that our approach outperforms conventional VQCs, yielding a more powerful and resource-efficient approach as a Quantum Neural Network.</description>

      <title>Absence of Entanglement Growth in Dicke Superradiance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13646v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dicke superradiance describes an ensemble of $N$ permutationally invariant two-level systems collectively emitting radiation with a peak radiated intensity scaling as $N^2$. Although individual Dicke states are typically entangled, the density matrix during superradiant decay is a mixture of such states, raising the subtle question of whether the total state is entangled or separable. We resolve this by showing analytically that for all $N$, starting from the fully excited state, the collective decay preserves separability for all times. This answers a longstanding question on the role of entanglement in Dicke superradiance and underscores that, despite collective dissipation, separable states remain separable under these dynamics.</description>

      <title>Light-matter interaction inside an optical cavity: A perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14266v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Light-matter interaction inside an optical cavity and formation of polaritonic states have gained interest in the past decades as it has direct applications in many research fields. Different regimes of light-matter coupling have been studied using different approximations, one of which is rotating wave approximation(RWA), which is said to be valid for weak coupling and near resonant regimes. In this study, we have categorized the light-matter coupling into four regimes depending on the validity of the RWA as moderate, $\lambda/\omega_c\leq 0.1$, strong, $0.1 \leq \lambda/\omega_c\leq 0.5$, ultra-strong, $0.5 \leq\lambda/\omega_c\leq 1.0$ and deep-strong, $\lambda/\omega_c\geq 1.0$ coupling, where $\lambda$ is the coupling strength and $\omega_c$ is the cavity frequency. In experiments, vacuum Rabi-splitting has been observed which is a clear indication of formation of polaritonic states. It is a common misunderstanding that the cavity remains in vacuum state when the coupled system is in the ground state. Here we show that upon coupling, the cavity has non-zero excitation even in the ground state, which is not captured by RWA. In fact, RWA breaks down completely to predict the ground state properties as it fails to capture the interaction between the matter and the cavity field.</description>

      <title>Quantum Simulation of the Unruh Temperature via the Thermal Properties of Virtually Evolving Bose-Einstein Condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14685v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel theoretical model to simulate the Unruh temperature by relating it to the critical temperature of multiple Bose-Einstein thermal baths. These thermal baths are conceptualized as snapshots of a Bose-Firework originating from an evolving driven Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). The critical temperature of each snapshot is determined from the heat capacity, which is numerically estimated by calculating the partition function derived from the system's Hamiltonian. By analyzing the relationship between the average number of the phononic excitations at the critical temperature, acceleration, and the critical temperature itself, our model demonstrates a significant agreement with the Unruh temperature formula, thereby validating our hypothesis. This theoretical approach offers a cost-effective and time-efficient alternative to resource-intensive experimental simulations. Furthermore, it provides a unique perspective on quantum simulation by utilizing the critical phenomena of condensed matter systems to probe fundamental quantum relativistic effects.</description>

      <title>Quantum simulation of interacting bosons with propagating waveguide photons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15441v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optical networks composed of interconnected waveguides are a versatile platform to simulate bosonic physical phenomena. Significant work in the non-interacting regime has demonstrated the capabilities of this platform to simulate many exotic effects such as photon transport in the presence of gauge fields, dynamics of quantum walks, and topological transition and dissipation phenomena. However, the extension of these concepts to simulating interacting quantum many-body phenomena such as the Bose-Hubbard and the fractional quantum Hall (FQH) physics has remained elusive. In this work, we address this problem and demonstrate a framework for quantum many-body simulation as well as drive and dissipation in photonic waveguides. Specifically, we show that for waveguide photons, a tunable on-site interaction can be simulated using a photon-number-selective phase gate. We propose an implementation of such a phase gate based on a three-level-atom-mediated photon subtraction and addition. We apply this approach to bosonic lattice models and propose circuits that can accurately simulate the Bose-Hubbard and FQH Hamiltonian as benchmarking examples. Moreover, we show how to simulate the Lindbladian evolution with engineered dissipators such that the steady state of the Lindbadlian corresponds to the ground state of desired Hamiltonians. Our scheme extends the waveguide photonic simulation platform to the strongly interacting quantum many-body regime while retaining all of its crucial advantages, such as single-site addressability, Hamiltonian parameter controllability, and hardware efficiency.</description>

      <title>Quantum Error Correction with Girth-16 Non-Binary LDPC Codes via Affine Permutation Construction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17790v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a method for constructing quantum error-correcting codes based on non-binary low-density parity-check codes with Tanner graph girth 16. While conventional constructions using circulant permutation matrices are limited to girth 12, our method employs affine permutation matrices and a randomized sequential selection procedure to eliminate short cycles and achieve girth 16.
  Numerical experiments show that the proposed codes significantly reduce the number of low-weight codewords. Joint belief propagation decoding over depolarizing channels reveals that although a slight degradation appears in the waterfall region, a substantial improvement is achieved in the error floor performance.
  We also evaluated the minimum distance and found that the proposed codes achieve a larger upper bound compared to conventional constructions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17886v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modular trapped-ion (TI) architectures offer a scalable quantum computing (QC) platform, with native transport behaviors that closely resemble the Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD) paradigm. We present FluxTrap, a SIMD-aware compiler framework that establishes a hardware-software co-design interface for TI systems. FluxTrap introduces a novel abstraction that unifies SIMD-style instructions -- including segmented intra-trap shift SIMD (S3) and global junction transfer SIMD (JT-SIMD) operations -- with a SIMD-enriched architectural graph, capturing key features such as transport synchronization, gate-zone locality, and topological constraints. It applies two passes -- SIMD aggregation and scheduling -- to coordinate grouped ion transport and gate execution within architectural constraints. On NISQ benchmarks, FluxTrap reduces execution time by up to $3.82 \times$ and improves fidelity by several orders of magnitude. It also scales to fault-tolerant workloads under diverse hardware configurations, providing feedback for future TI hardware design.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.18173v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on an industry-grade CMOS-compatible qubit fabrication approach using a CMOS pilot line, enabling a yield of functional devices reaching 92.8%, with a resistance spread evaluated across the full wafer 200 mm diameter of 12.4% and relaxation times (T1) approaching 80 us. Furthermore, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of wafer-scale room temperature (RT) characteristics collected from multiple wafers and fabrication runs, focusing on RT measurements and their correlation to low temperature qubit parameters. From defined test structures, a across-wafer junction area variation of 10.1% and oxide barrier variation of 7.2% was calculated. Additionally, we notably show a close-correlation between qubit junction resistance and frequency in accordance with the Ambegaokar-Baratoff relation with a critical temperature Tc of about 0.71 K. This overarching relation sets the stage for pre-cooldown qubit evaluation and sorting. In particular, such early-on device characterization and validation are crucial for increasing the fabrication yield and qubit frequency targeting, which currently represent major scaling challenges. Furthermore, it enables the fabrication of large multichip quantum systems in the future. Our findings highlight the great potential of CMOS-compatible industry-style fabrication of superconducting qubits for scalable quantum computing in a foundry pilot line cleanroom.</description>

Abstract: Chirality in integrated quantum photonics has emerged as a promising route towards achieving scalable quantum technologies with quantum nonlinearity effects. Topological photonic waveguides, which utilize helical optical modes, have been proposed as a novel approach to harnessing chiral light-matter interactions on-chip. However, uncertainties remain regarding the nature and strength of the chiral coupling to embedded quantum emitters, hindering the scalability of these systems. In this work, we present a comprehensive investigation of chiral coupling in topological photonic waveguides using a combination of experimental, theoretical, and numerical analyses. We quantitatively characterize the position-dependence nature of the light-matter coupling on several topological photonic waveguides and benchmark their chiral coupling performance against conventional line defect waveguides for chiral quantum optical applications. Our results provide crucial insights into the degree and characteristics of chiral light-matter interactions in topological photonic quantum circuits and pave the way towards the implementation of quantitatively-predicted quantum nonlinear effects on-chip.</description>

Abstract: The disorder-induced quantum phase transition between superfluid and non-superfluid states of bosonic particles in one dimension is generally expected to be of the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) type. Here, we show that hard-core lattice bosons with integrable power-law hopping decaying with distance as $1/r^\alpha$ - corresponding in spin language to a $XY$ model with power-law couplings - undergo a non-BKT continuous phase transition instead. We use exact quantum Monte-Carlo methods to determine the phase diagram for different values of the exponent $\alpha$, focusing on the regime $\alpha &gt; 2$. We find that the scaling of the superfluid stiffness with the system size is scale-invariant at the transition point for any $\alpha\leq 3$ - a behavior incompatible with the BKT scenario and typical of continuous phase transitions in higher dimension. By scaling analysis near the transition point, we find that our data are consistent with a correlation length exponent satisfying the Harris bound $\nu \geq 2$ and demonstrate a new universal behavior of disordered bosons in one dimension. For $\alpha&gt;3$ our data are consistent with a BKT scenario where the liquid is pinned by infinitesimal disorder.</description>

      <title>Cons-training Tensor Networks: Embedding and Optimization Over Discrete Linear Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09005v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we introduce a novel family of tensor networks, termed constrained matrix product states (MPS), designed to incorporate exactly arbitrary discrete linear constraints, including inequalities, into sparse block structures. These tensor networks are particularly tailored for modeling distributions with support strictly over the feasible space, offering benefits such as reducing the search space in optimization problems, alleviating overfitting, improving training efficiency, and decreasing model size. Central to our approach is the concept of a quantum region, an extension of quantum numbers traditionally used in U(1) symmetric tensor networks, adapted to capture any linear constraint, including the unconstrained scenario. We further develop a novel canonical form for these new MPS, which allow for the merging and factorization of tensor blocks according to quantum region fusion rules and permit optimal truncation schemes. Utilizing this canonical form, we apply an unsupervised training strategy to optimize arbitrary objective functions subject to discrete linear constraints. Our method's efficacy is demonstrated by solving the quadratic knapsack problem, achieving superior performance compared to a leading nonlinear integer programming solver. Additionally, we analyze the complexity and scalability of our approach, demonstrating its potential in addressing complex constrained combinatorial optimization problems.</description>

      <title>Entanglement renormalization of fractonic anisotropic $\mathbb{Z}_N$ Laplacian models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18206v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gapped fracton phases constitute a new class of quantum states of matter which connects to topological orders but does not fit easily into existing paradigms. They host unconventional features such as sub-extensive and robust ground state degeneracies as well as sensitivity to lattice geometry. We investigate the anisotropic $\mathbb{Z}_N$ Laplacian model [1] which can describe a family of fracton phases defined on arbitrary graphs. Focusing on representative geometries where the 3D lattices are extensions of 2D square, triangular, honeycomb and Kagome lattices into the third dimension, we study their ground state degeneracies and mobility of excitations, and examine their entanglement renormalization group (ERG) flows. All models show bifurcating behaviors under ERG but have distinct ERG flows sensitive to both $N$ and lattice geometry. In particular, we show that the anisotropic $\mathbb{Z}_N$ Laplacian models defined on the extensions of triangular and honeycomb lattices are equivalent when $N$ is coprime to $3$. We also point out that, in contrast to previous expectations, the model defined on the extension of Kagome lattice is robust against local perturbations if and only if $N$ is coprime to $6$.</description>

      <title>Consistency of EFT illuminated via relative entropy: A case study in scalar field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21062v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Relative entropy is a non-negative quantity and offers a powerful means of achieving a unified understanding of fundamental properties in physics, including the second law of thermodynamics and positivity bounds on effective field theories (EFTs). We analyze the relative entropy in scalar field theories and show that the non-negativity of relative entropy is potentially violated in perturbative calculations based on operator and loop expansions. Conversely, this suggests that the consistency of the EFT description in the scalar field theory can be identified by the sign of the relative entropy. In fact, we revisit an EFT of single-field inflation and present a relation between its non-linear parameter $f_{\rm NL}$ and the consistency condition of the EFT description derived from the relative entropy method. We find that interesting regions of $f_{\rm NL}$ that are observationally allowed can be constrained from the relative entropy by imposing the consistency of the EFT description when the EFT is generated via the interaction with heavy fields in UV theories.</description>

      <title>Measurement and feed-forward correction of the fast phase noise of lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10021v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lasers are the workhorse of quantum engineering in the atomic-molecular-optic community. However, phase noise of the laser, which can be especially large in popular semiconductor-based lasers, can limit fidelity of operation. Here, we present a fully-fiberized instrument detecting and correcting the fast, sub-microsecond, phase fluctuations of lasers. We demonstrate a measurement noise floor of less than 0.1 Hz$^{2}$/Hz, and a noise suppression of more than 20 dB for Fourier frequencies in the 1 to 10 MHz region (reaching up to 30 dB at 3 MHz), where noise is critical for Rydberg-based quantum gates. Finally, we observe the improvement offered by this fast phase noise eater on a Raman transition driven by two such stabilized lasers. These measurement and correction techniques are important tools for high-fidelity manipulation of the excited electronic states of atoms and molecules.</description>

      <title>Limitations of tensor network approaches for optimization and sampling: A comparison against quantum and classical Ising machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16431v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optimization problems pose challenges across various fields. In recent years, quantum annealers have emerged as a promising platform for tackling such challenges. To provide a new perspective, we develop a heuristic tensor network (TN) based algorithm to reveal the low-energy spectrum of Ising spin-glass systems with interaction graphs relevant to present-day quantum annealers. Our deterministic approach combines a branch-and-bound search strategy with an approximate calculation of marginals via TN contractions. Its application to quasi-two-dimensional lattices with large unit cells of up to 24 spins, realized in current quantum annealing processors, requires a dedicated approach that utilizes sparse structures in the TN representation and GPU hardware acceleration. We benchmark our approach on random problems defined on Pegasus and Zephyr graphs with up to a few thousand spins, comparing it against the D-Wave Advantage quantum annealer and Simulated Bifurcation algorithm. Apart from the quality of the best solutions, we compare the diversity of low-energy states sampled by all the solvers. For the biggest considered i.i.d. problems with over 5000 spins, the state-of-the-art TN approach leads to solutions that are $0.1\%$ to $1\%$ worse than the best solutions obtained by Ising machines while being two orders of magnitude slower. We attribute those results to approximate contraction failures. For embedded tile planting instances, our approach gets to approximately $0.1\%$ from the planted ground state, a factor of $3$ better than the Ising solvers. While all three methods can output diverse low-energy solutions, e.g., differing by at least a quarter of spins with energy error below $1\%$, our deterministic branch-and-bound approach finds sets of a few such states at most. On the other hand, both Ising machines prove capable of sampling sets of thousands of such solutions.</description>

      <title>Geometric bound on structure factor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02656v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that a quadratic form of quantum geometric tensor in $k$-space sets a bound on the $q^4$ term in the static structure factor $S(q)$ at small $\vec{q}$. Bands that saturate this bound satisfy a condition similar to Laplace's equation, leading us to refer to them as $\textit{harmonic bands}$. We provide examples of harmonic bands in one- and two-dimensional systems, including (higher) Landau levels. The geometric bound further leads to a topological bound on the $q^4$ term, which is saturated only when the band geometry satisfies the trace condition and, additionally, the quantum geometric tensor is uniform in $k$-space. We speculate that these bounds taken together provide a useful guide for identifying Chern bands that favor (Abelian or non-Abelian) fractional Chern insulators.</description>

      <title>Soft symmetries of topological orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03314v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: (2+1)D topological orders possess emergent symmetries given by a group $\text{Aut}(\mathcal{C})$, which consists of the braided tensor autoequivalences of the modular tensor category $\mathcal{C}$ that describes the anyons. In this paper we discuss cases where $\text{Aut}(\mathcal{C})$ has elements that neither permute anyons nor are associated to any symmetry fractionalization but are still non-trivial, which we refer to as soft symmetries. We point out that one can construct topological defects corresponding to such exotic symmetry actions by decorating with a certain class of gauged SPT states that cannot be distinguished by their torus partition function. This gives a physical interpretation to work by Davydov on soft braided tensor autoequivalences. This has a number of important implications for the classification of gapped boundaries, non-invertible spontaneous symmetry breaking, and the general classification of symmetry-enriched topological phases of matter. We also demonstrate analogous phenomena in higher dimensions, such as (3+1)D gauge theory with gauge group given by the quaternion group $Q_8$.</description>

      <title>Variationally optimizing infinite projected entangled-pair states at large bond dimensions: A split corner transfer matrix renormalization group approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10298v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Projected entangled-pair states (PEPS) have become a powerful tool for studying quantum many-body systems in the condensed matter and quantum materials context, particularly with advances in variational energy optimization methods. A key challenge within this framework is the computational cost associated with the contraction of the two-dimensional lattice, crucial for calculating state vector norms and expectation values. The conventional approach, using the corner transfer matrix renormalization group (CTMRG), involves combining two tensor network layers, resulting in significant time and memory demands. In this work, we introduce an alternative "split-CTMRG" algorithm, which maintains separate PEPS layers and leverages new environment tensors, reducing computational complexity while preserving accuracy. Benchmarks on quantum lattice models demonstrate substantial speedups for variational energy optimization, rendering this method valuable for large-scale PEPS simulations.</description>

      <title>Enforced Gaplessness from States with Exponentially Decaying Correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01977v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is well known that an exponentially localized Hamiltonian must be gapless if its ground state has algebraic correlations. We show that even certain exponentially decaying correlations can imply gaplessness. This is exemplified by the deformed toric code $\propto \exp(\beta \sum_{\ell} Z_{\ell}) |\mathsf{TC}\rangle$, where $|\mathsf{TC}\rangle$ is a fixed-point toric code wavefunction. Although it has a confined regime for $\beta &gt; \beta_c$, recent work has drawn attention to its perimeter law loop correlations. Here, we show that these unusual loop correlations -- namely, perimeter law coexisting with a 1-form symmetry whose disorder operator has long-range order -- imply that any local parent Hamiltonian must either be gapless or have a degeneracy scaling with system size. Moreover, we construct a variational low-energy state for arbitrary local frustration-free Hamiltonians, upper bounding the finite-size gap by $O(1/L^3)$ on periodic boundary conditions. Strikingly, these variational states look like loop waves -- non-quasiparticle analogs of spin waves -- generated from the ground state by non-local loop operators. Our findings have implications for identifying the subset of Hilbert space to which gapped ground states belong, and the techniques have wide applicability. For instance, a corollary of our first result is that Glauber dynamics for the ordered phase of the two-dimensional classical Ising model on the torus must have a gapless Markov transition matrix, with our second result bounding its gap.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06735v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-Abelian anyons such as Majorana zero modes (MZMs) have the potential to enable fault-tolerant quantum computing through topological protection. Experimentally reported InSb topological superconductor nanowires (TSNW) are investigated theoretically and numerically to evaluate their suitability to host MZMs. We employ eigenspectra analysis and quantum transport based on the non-equilibrium Green's function (NEGF) formalism to investigate the eigenenergies, Majorana wave functions via local density of states, transmission spectra for Andreev processes, and zero-bias conductance peaks (ZBCPs) in InSb TSNWs. For 1.6 {\mu}m- and 2.2 {\mu}m-long InSb TSNWs we demonstrate the existence of the optimum design space defined by the applied magnetic field and electrochemical potential, which leads to clear ZBCP signatures with a Majorana localization length down to ~340 nm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18977v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diamond lattice magnets, formed by a framework of corner-sharing tetrahedra of magnetic cations, offer unique opportunities to realize novel states of matter for potential utility in information technology. However, research has mostly focused on AB2X4 spinels with Td magnetic ions. This hinders the atomically enabled tunability of competing interactions at different energy scales and the ability to harness many-body electronic states in quantum materials, making the discovery of quantum fluctuations and spin dynamics less accessible. We discover a new material CaCo2TeO6 featuring a diamond lattice of two distinct Oh-Co2+ sites. This material displays strong quantum fluctuations, increased competing magnetic exchange interactions, and field-induced tunability of magnetic structures. The results demonstrate how simple, fundamental refinements in ligand fields can profoundly influence the phase space of quantum matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22843v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Flat band physics is a central theme in modern condensed matter physics. By constructing a tight--binding single particle system that has vanishing momentum dispersion in one or more bands, and subsequently including more particles and interactions, it is possible to study physics in strongly interacting regimes. Inspired by the glued trees that first arose in one of the few known examples of quantum supremacy, we define and analyze two infinite families of tight binding single particle Bose--Hubbard models that have only flat bands, and only compact localized states despite having any nonnegative number of translation symmetries. The first class of model that we introduce is constructed by replacing a sufficiently large fraction of the edges in a generic countable graph with glued trees modified to have complex hoppings. The second class arises from thinking of complex weighted glued trees as rhombi that can then be used to tile two dimensional space, giving rise to the familiar dice lattice and infinitely many generalizations thereof, of which some are Euclidian while others are hyperbolic.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.24362v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recursion method provides a powerful framework for studying quantum many-body dynamics in the Lanczos basis recursively constructed within the Krylov space of operators. Recently, it has been demonstrated that the recursion method, when supplemented by the universal operator growth hypothesis, can effectively compute autocorrelation functions and transport coefficients at infinite temperature. We extend the scope of the recursion method to far-from-equilibrium quench dynamics. We apply the method to spin systems in one, two, and three spatial dimensions. In one dimension we find an evidence that the convergence of the method is limited in time by the dynamical quantum phase transition.</description>

      <title>Quantum-stabilized states in magnetic dipolar quantum gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06221v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A decade ago, a universal stabilization mechanism driven by quantum fluctuations was discovered in ultracold Bose gases of highly magnetic atoms. This mechanism prevents these systems from collapsing and instead allows exotic states of matter to arise, including ultradilute quantum droplets, crystallized quantum states, and specifically supersolids. We review the experimental and theoretical progress in understanding these quantum-stabilized states, their emergence, and intriguing properties.</description>

      <title>Potential for Polynomial Solution for NP-Complete Problems using Quantum Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15529v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose two new methods for solving Set Constraint Problems, as well as a potential polynomial solution for NP-Complete problems using quantum computation. While current methods of solving Set Constraint Problems focus on classical techniques, we offer both a quantum-inspired matrix method and a quantum matrix method that neutralizes common contradictions and inconsistencies that appear in these types of problems. We then use our new method to show how a potential polynomial solution for NP-Complete problems could be found using quantum computation. We state this as a potential solution, rather than an actual solution, as the outcome of any quantum computation may not be the same as the expected outcome. We start by formally defining a Set Constraint Problem. We then explain current, classical methods that are used to solve these problems and the drawbacks of such methods. After this, we explain a new quantum-inspired matrix method that allows us to solve these problems, with classical limitations. Then, we explain a new quantum matrix method that solves these problems using quantum information science. Finally, we describe how we can extend this method to potentially solve NP-Complete problems in polynomial time using quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Modern Computational Methods in Reinsurance Optimization: From Simulated Annealing to Quantum Branch &amp; Bound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16530v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose and implement modern computational methods to enhance catastrophe excess-of-loss reinsurance contracts in practice. The underlying optimization problem involves attachment points, limits, and reinstatement clauses, and the objective is to maximize the expected profit while considering risk measures and regulatory constraints. We study the problem formulation, paving the way for practitioners, for two very different approaches: A local search optimizer using simulated annealing, which handles realistic constraints, and a branch &amp; bound approach exploring the potential of a future speedup via quantum branch &amp; bound. On the one hand, local search effectively generates contract structures within several constraints, proving useful for complex treaties that have multiple local optima. On the other hand, although our branch &amp; bound formulation only confirms that solving the full problem with a future quantum computer would require a stronger, less expensive bound and substantial hardware improvements, we believe that the designed application-specific bound is sufficiently strong to serve as a basis for further works. Concisely, we provide insurance practitioners with a robust numerical framework for contract optimization that handles realistic constraints today, as well as an outlook and initial steps towards an approach which could leverage quantum computers in the future.</description>

      <title>Three-local Charge Conservation Implies Quantum Integrability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17773v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is shown that the existence of a local conserved charge supported by three neighboring sites, or its local version, Reshetikhin's condition, suffices to guarantee the existence of all higher conserved charges and hence the integrability of a quantum spin chain. This explains the 'coincidence' that no counterexample is known to Grabowski and Mathieu's long-standing conjecture despite the folklore that the conservation of local charges of order higher than 4 imposes additional constraints not implied by the conservation of the three-local charge.</description>
