      <title>New properties of length-extremals in free step-2 rank-4 Carnot groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the free, step-2, rank-4 sub-Riemannian Carnot group, we give a clean expression for length-extremals, we provide an explicit equation for conjugate points, we relate it with the conjectured cut-locus of the origin. Finally, we give some upper estimates for the cut-time of extremals.</description>

      <title>Continous linear canonical Dunkl wavelet transform: properties and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to establish and study the linear canonical Dunkl wavelet transform. We begin by introducing the generalized translation operator and generalized convolution product for the linear canonical Dunkl transform and we establish their basic properties. Next, we introduce the new proposed wavelet transform and we investigate its fundamentals properties. In the end, we derive some uncertainty inequalities for the desired wavelet transform as applications.</description>

      <title>Matrix weighted inequalities for fractional type integrals associated to operators with new classes of weights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $e^{-tL}$ be a analytic semigroup generated by $-L$, where $L$ is a non-negative self-adjoint operator on $L^2(\mathbb{R}^d)$. Assume that the kernels of $e^{-tL}$, denoted by $p_t(x,y)$, only satisfy the upper bound: for all $N&gt;0$, there are constants $c,C&gt;0$ such that \begin{align}\label{upper bound} |p_t(x,y)|\leq\frac{C}{t^{d/2}}e^{-\frac{|x-y|^2}{ct}}\Big(1+\frac{\sqrt{t}}{\rho(x)}+ \frac{\sqrt{t}}{\rho(y)}\Big)^{-N} \end{align} holds for all $x,y\in\mathbb{R}^d$ and $t&gt;0$. We first establish the quantitative matrix weighted inequalities for fractional type integrals associated to $L$ with new classes of matrix weights, which are nontrivial extension of the results established by Li, Rahm and Wick [23]. Next, we give new two-weight bump conditions with Young functions satisfying wider conditions for fractional type integrals associated to $L$, which cover the result obtained by Cruz-Uribe, Isralowitz and Moen [6]. We point out that the new classes of matrix weights and bump conditions are larger and weaker than the classical ones given in [17] and [6], respectively. As applications, our results can be applied to settings of magnetic Schr\"{o}dinger operator, Laguerre operators, etc.</description>

      <title>Hardy's Theorem for the $(k,\frac{2}{n})-$Fourier Transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By comparing a function and its $ (k, \frac{2}{n})-$Fourier transform to a Gaussian analogue, we establish a Hardy-type uncertainty principle. We extend these results to an $L^p-L^q$ framework, proving a Cowling-Price-type theorem for the $(k, \frac{2}{n})$-Fourier transform. Optimal cases are identified and discussed in detail for both theorems. Furthermore, we investigate the heat equation in this context, deriving a dynamical version of Hardy's theorem that illustrates the temporal evolution of the uncertainty principle in this generalized setting.</description>

      <title>Quantitative relaxation dynamics from generic initial configurations in the inertial Kuramoto model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the relaxation dynamics of the inertial Kuramoto model toward a phase-locked state from a generic initial phase configuration. For this, we propose a sufficient framework in terms of initial data and system parameters for asymptotic phase-locking. It can be roughly stated as set of conditions such as a positive initial order parameter, a coupling strength sufficiently larger than initial frequency diameter and intrinsic frequency diameter, but less than the inverse of inertia. Under the proposed framework, generic initial configuration undergoes three dynamic stages (initial layer, condensation and relaxation stages) before it reaches a phase-locked state asymptotically. The first stage is the initial layer stage in analogy with fluid mechanics, during which the effect of the initial natural frequency distribution is dominant, compared to that of the sinusoidal coupling between oscillators. The second stage is the condensation stage, during which the order parameter increases, and at the end of which a majority cluster is contained in a sufficiently small arc. Finally, the third stage is the persistence and relaxation stage, during which the majority cluster remains stable (persistence) and the total configuration relaxes toward a phase-locked state asymptotically (relaxation). The intricate proof involves with several key tools such as the quasi-monotonicity of the order parameter (for the condensation stage), a nonlinear Gr\"onwall inequality on the diameter of the majority cluster (for the persistence stage), and a variant of the classical {\L}ojasiewicz gradient theorem (for the relaxation stage).</description>

      <title>A Variable Coefficient Free Boundary Problem for $L^p$-solvability of Parabolic Dirichlet Problems in Graph Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate variable coefficient analogs of a recent work of Bortz, Hofmann, Martell and Nystr\"om [BHMN25]. In particular, we show that if $\Omega$ is the region above the graph of a Lip(1,1/2) (parabolic Lipschitz) function and $L$ is a parabolic operator in divergence form \[L = \partial_t - \text{div} A \nabla\] with $A$ satisfying an $L^1$ Carleson condition on its spatial and time derivatives, then the $L^p$-solvability of the Dirichlet problem for $L$ and $L^*$ implies that the graph function has a half-order time derivative in BMO. Equivalently, the graph is parabolic uniformly rectifiable.
  In the case of $A$ symmetric, we only require that the Dirichlet problem for $L$ is solvable, which requires us to adapt a clever integration by parts argument by Lewis and Nystr\"om. A feature of the present work is that we must overcome the lack of translation invariance in our equation, which is a fundamental tool in similar works, including [BHMN25].</description>

      <title>Sharp embeddings between weighted Paley-Wiener spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.06442v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we address the problem of estimating the operator norm of the embeddings between multidimensional weighted Paley-Wiener spaces. These can be equivalently thought as Fourier uncertainty principles for bandlimited functions. By means of radial symmetrization mechanisms, we show that such problems can all be shifted to dimension one. We provide precise asymptotics in the general case and, in some particular situations, we are able to identify the sharp constants and characterize the extremizers. The sharp constant study is actually a consequence of a more general result we prove in the setup of de Branges spaces of entire functions, addressing the operator given by multiplication by $z^k$, $k \in \mathbb{N}$. Applications to sharp higher order Poincar\'{e} inequalities and other related extremal problems are discussed.</description>

      <title>Unimodality preservation by ratios of functional series and integral transforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01755v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An elementary, but very useful lemma due to Biernacki and Krzy\.{z} (1955) asserts that the ratio of two power series inherits monotonicity from that of the sequence of ratios of their respective coefficients. Over the last two decades it has been realized that, under some additional assumptions, similar claims hold for more general series ratios as well as for unimodality in place of monotonicity. This paper continues this line of research: we consider ratios of general functional series and integral transforms and furnish natural sufficiency conditions for preservation of unimodality by such ratios. Numerous series and integral transforms appearing in applications satisfy our sufficiency conditions, including Dirichlet, factorial and inverse factorial series, Laplace, Mellin and generalized Stieltjes transforms, among many others. Finally, we illustrate our general results by exhibiting certain statements on monotonicity patterns for ratios of some special functions. The key role in our considerations is played by the notion of sign regularity.</description>

      <title>Complete asymptotic expansions of the Humbert function $\Psi_1$ for two large arguments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21985v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In our recent work [SIGMA \textbf{20} (2024), 074, 13 pages], the leading behaviour of the Humbert function $\Psi_1[a,b;c,c';x,y]$ when $x\to\infty$ and $y\to +\infty$ has been derived in a direct and simple manner. In this paper, we obtain the complete asymptotics of $\Psi_1$ in the general case $x,y\to\infty$ along a new path. Indeed, our proof is based on a sharp estimate on ${}_2F_2[a,b-n;c,d-n;z]$, which is valid uniformly for $n\in\mathbb{Z}_{\geqslant 0}$ and large $z$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09028v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}$ be a nonempty and open set, then for all $f, g, h\in \mathscr{C}^{2}(\Omega)$ we have \begin{multline*} \frac{\mathrm{d}^{2}}{\mathrm{d} x^{2}}(f\cdot g\cdot h) - f\frac{\mathrm{d}^{2}}{\mathrm{d} x^{2}}(g\cdot h)-g\frac{\mathrm{d}^{2}}{\mathrm{d} x^{2}}(f\cdot h)-h\frac{\mathrm{d}^{2}}{\mathrm{d} x^{2}}(f\cdot g) + f\cdot g\frac{\mathrm{d}^{2}}{\mathrm{d} x^{2}} h+f\cdot h\frac{\mathrm{d}^{2}}{\mathrm{d} x^{2}} g+g\cdot h \frac{\mathrm{d}^{2}}{\mathrm{d} x^{2}}f=0 \end{multline*} The aim of this paper is to consider the corresponding operator equation \[D(f\cdot g \cdot h) - fD(g\cdot h) - gD(f\cdot h) - hD(f \cdot g) + f\cdot g D(h) + f\cdot h D(g) +g\cdot h D(f) = 0\] for operators $D\colon \mathscr{C}^{k}(\Omega)\to \mathscr{C}(\Omega)$, where $k$ is a given nonnegative integer and the above identity is supposed to hold for all $f, g, h \in \mathscr{C}^{k}(\Omega)$. We show that besides the operators of first and second derivative, there are more solutions to this equation. Some special cases characterizing differential operators are also studied.</description>

      <title>On a degenerate second order traffic model: existence of discrete evolutions, deterministic many-particle limit and first order approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09834v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose and analyse a new microscopic second order Follow-the-Leader type scheme to describe traffic flows. The main novelty of this model consists in multiplying the second order term by a nonlinear function of the global density, with the intent of considering the attentiveness of the drivers in dependence on the amount of congestion. Such term makes the system highly degenerate; indeed, coherently with the modellistic viewpoint, we allow for the nonlinearity to vanish as soon as consecutive vehicles are very close to each other. We first show existence of solutions to the degenerate discrete system. We then perform a rigorous discrete-to-continuum limit, as the number of vehicles grows larger and larger, by making use of suitable piece-wise constant approximations of the relevant macroscopic variables. The resulting continuum system turns out to be described by a degenerate pressure-less Euler-type equation, and we discuss how this could be considered an alternative to the groundbreaking Aw-Rascle-Zhang traffic model. Finally, we study the singular limit to first order dynamics in the spirit of a vanishing-inertia argument. This eventually validates the use of first order macroscopic models with nonlinear mobility to describe a congested traffic stream.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we provide a detailed study on effective versions of the celebrated Bilu's equidistribution theorem for Galois orbits of sequences of points of small height in the $N$-dimensional algebraic torus, identifying the qualitative dependence of the convergence in terms of the regularity of the test functions considered. We develop a general Fourier analysis framework that extends previous results obtained by Petsche (2005), and by D'Andrea, Narv\'aez-Clauss and Sombra (2017).</description>

      <title>Stability of axial free-boundary hyperplanes in circular cones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21205v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given an axially-symmetric, $(n+1)$-dimensional convex cone $\Omega\subset \mathbb{R}^{n+1}$, we study the stability of the free-boundary minimal surface $\Sigma$ obtained by intersecting $\Omega$ with a $n$-plane that contains the axis of $\Omega$. In the case $n=2$, $\Sigma$ is always unstable, as a special case of the vertex-skipping property recently proved in a paper by the same authors. Conversely, as soon as $n \ge 3$ and $\Omega$ has a sufficiently large aperture (depending on the dimension $n$), we show that $\Sigma$ is strictly stable. For our stability analysis, we introduce a Lipschitz flow $\Sigma_{t}[f]$ of deformations of $\Sigma$ associated with a compactly-supported, scalar deformation field $f$, which satisfies the key property $\partial \Sigma_{t}[f] \subset \partial \Omega$ for all $t\in \mathbb{R}$. Then, we compute the lower-right second variation of the area of $\Sigma$ along the flow, and ultimately show that it is positive by exploiting its connection with a functional inequality studied in the context of reaction-diffusion problems.</description>
