      <title>Cytoplasmic Viscosity is a Potential Biomarker for Metastatic Breast Cancer Cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cellular microrheology has shown that cancer cells with high metastatic potential are softer compared to non-tumorigenic normal cells. These findings rely on measuring the apparent Young modulus of whole cells using primarily atomic force microscopy. This study aims to explore whether alternative mechanical parameters have discriminating features with regard to metastatic potential. Magnetic rotational spectroscopy (MRS) is employed in the examination of mammary epithelial cell lines: MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231, representing low and high meta-static potential, alongside normal-like MCF-10A cells. MRS utilizes active micron-sized magnetic wires in a rotating magnetic field to measure the viscosity and elastic modulus of the cy-toplasm. All three cell lines display viscoelastic behavior, with cytoplasmic viscosities ranging from 10-70 Pa s and elastic moduli from 30-80 Pa. It is found that the tumorigenic MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells are softer than the MCF-10A cells, with a twofold decrease in elastic modulus. To differentiate cells with low and high malignancy however, viscosity emerges as the more discriminating parameter, as MCF-7 exhibits a 5 times higher viscosity as compared to MDA-MB-231. These findings highlight the sensitivity of cytoplasmic viscosity to metastatic potential, suggesting its potential utility as a mechanical marker for malignant cancer cells.</description>

      <title>An efficient biosensor based on magnetoelastic waves for detection of antibodies in human plasma for COVID-19 serodiagnosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study proposes a new efficient wireless biosensor based on magnetoelastic waves for the detection of antibodies in human plasma, aiming at the serological diagnosis of COVID-19. The biosensor was functionalized with the N antigen - nucleocapsid phosphoprotein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Validation analyses, by sodium dodecyl-sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), Western blotting, atomic force microscopy (AFM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), micro-Raman spectroscopy, confirmed the selectivity and effective surface functionalization of the biosensor. The research successfully obtained, expressed and purified the recombinant antigen, while plasma samples from COVID-19 positive and negative patients were used to test the performance of the biosensor. A comparison of performance with the ELISA method revealed equivalent diagnostic power. These results indicate the robustness of the biosensor in reliably differentiating between positive and negative samples, highlighting its potential as an efficient and low-cost tool for the serological diagnosis of COVID-19. In addition to being fast to execute and having the potential for automation in large-scale diagnostic studies, the biosensor fills a significant gap in existing SARS-CoV-2 detection approaches.</description>

      <title>Magnetic properties of an individual Magnetospirillum gryphiswaldense cell</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many bacteria share the fascinating ability to sense Earth's magnetic field -- a process known as magnetotaxis. These bacteria synthesize magnetic nanoparticles, called magnetosomes, within their own cell body and arrange them to form a linear magnetic chain. The chain, which behaves like a compass needle, aligns the microorganisms with the geomagnetic field. Here, we measure the magnetic hysteresis of an individual bacterium of the species Magnetospirillum gryphiswaldense via ultrasensitive torque magnetometry. These measurements, in combination with transmission electron microscopy and micromagnetic simulations, reveal the magnetic configurations of the magnetosomes, their progression as a function of applied field, as well as the total remanent magnetic moment and effective magnetic anisotropy of a chain within a single bacterium. Knowledge of magnetic properties is crucial both for understanding the mechanisms behind magnetotaxis and for the design of systems exploiting magnetotactic bacteria in biomedical applications.</description>

      <title>Mechanisms enabling efficient fountain-flow supracellular migration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a prototypical mode of single-cell migration, retrograde cytoskeletal flow is mechanically coupled to the environment, propels the cell, and is sustained by an anterograde cytosolic flow of disassembled cytoskeletal components. Supracellular collectives also develop fountain-flows to migrate, but the opposing cellular streams interact with the environment producing conflicting forces. To understand the biophysical constraints of fountain-flow supracellular migration, we develop an active gel model of a cell cluster driven by a polarized peripheral contractile cable. While the model develops fountain-flows and directed migration, efficiency and cluster velocity are extremely small compared to observations. We find that patterned friction or cluster-polarized single-cell directed migration, both suggested by contact inhibition of locomotion, rescue robust and efficient supracellular migration.</description>

      <title>Good rates from bad coordinates: the exponential average time-dependent rate approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10668v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Our ability to calculate rates of biochemical processes using molecular dynamics simulations is severely limited by the fact that the time scales for reactions, or changes in conformational state, scale exponentially with the relevant free-energy barriers. In this work, we improve upon a recently proposed rate estimator that allows us to predict transition times with molecular dynamics simulations biased to rapidly explore one or several collective variables. This approach relies on the idea that not all bias goes into promoting transitions, and along with the rate, it estimates a concomitant scale factor for the bias termed the collective variable biasing efficiency $\gamma$. First, we demonstrate mathematically that our new formulation allows us to derive the commonly used Infrequent Metadynamics (iMetaD) estimator when using a perfect collective variable, $\gamma=1$. After testing it on a model potential, we then study the unfolding behavior of a previously well characterized coarse-grained protein, which is sufficiently complex that we can choose many different collective variables to bias, but which is sufficiently simple that we are able to compute the unbiased rate dire ctly. For this system, we demonstrate that our new Exponential Average Time-Dependent Rate (EATR) estimator converges to the true rate more rapidly as a function of bias deposition time than does the previous iMetaD approach, even for bias deposition times that are short. We also show that the $\gamma$ parameter can serve as a good metric for assessing the quality of the biasing coordinate. Finally, we demonstrate that the approach works when combining multiple less-than-optimal bias coordinates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10715v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multiphase field models have emerged as an important computational tool for understanding biological tissue while resolving single-cell properties. While they have successfully reproduced many experimentally observed behaviors of living tissue, the theoretical underpinnings have not been fully explored. We show that a two-dimensional version of the model, which is commonly employed to study tissue monolayers, can be derived from a three-dimensional version in the presence of a substrate. We also show how viscous forces, which arise from friction between different cells, can be included in the model. Finally, we numerically simulate a tissue monolayer, and find that intercellular friction tends to solidify the tissue.</description>

      <title>Information Geometry and Universal Bounds on Non-stationary Responsiveness of Markov Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10952v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Markov dynamics can effectively describe a wide range of thermodynamic and biological processes. Understanding how such systems respond to changes in environmental variables or external inputs is crucial for predicting and controlling their behaviors. This work presents a set of universal thermodynamic bounds on the responsiveness of any Markov system toward environmental changes. The systems of interest can be arbitrarily far from stationary state. The central element of this work is the introduction of information geometry on the manifold of probability distributions of stochastic trajectories. This work lays the foundation for understanding biological processes, engineering artificial systems, and exploring the fundamental principles governing complex systems far from equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Tangential diffusion and motility-induced mixing transition in exponentially growing multicellular spheroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Growth is a known driver of cellular dynamics in a range of dense aggregates from bacterial colonies to developing tissues to tumors. Hence, universal physical principles underlying these dynamics are of great interdisciplinary interest. Here, we study the emergent dynamics arising from the interplay of growth, steric repulsion and motility in a minimal agent-based model of exponentially growing three-dimensional spheroids. Our results show that, without cell motility, deterministic motion caused by overall volume expansion dominates the dynamics of individual cells in the radial direction, while growth and division lead to cellular-scale diffusive motion in the tangential direction, whose magnitude is largely independent of expansion velocity. Despite this small-scale diffusion, we show that cell lineages are subject to confinement in their local environment, quenching weak cell motility. At higher motility, we find a transient regime of tangential superdiffusivity, which is accompanied by global mixing of cells. A quantitative analysis reveals a diverging mixing time scale at the transition, reminiscent of glassy dynamics. Our study highlights the complex interaction of local cell division and motility with global expansion, mediated exclusively by mechanics. The observations may serve as a baseline for the identification of phenomena caused by additional biological mechanisms in experiments on tissue spheroids, which have become a popular model system in biophysics and other fields. The mixing dynamics might also be relevant for competition or tumor progression.</description>

      <title>Recovering the activity parameters of an active fluid confined in a sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The properties of an active fluid, for example, a bacterial bath or a collection of microtubules and molecular motors, can be accessed through the dynamics of passive particle probes. Here, in the perspective of analyzing experimental situations of confinement in droplets, we consider the kinematics of a negatively buoyant probe particle in an active fluid, both confined within a spherical domain. The active bath generates a fluctuating flow that pushes the particle with a velocity that is modeled as a colored stochastic noise, characterized by two parameters, the intensity and memory time of the active flow. When the particle departs a little from the bottom of the spherical domain, the configuration is well approximated by a particle in a two-dimensional harmonic trap subjected to the colored noise, in which case an analytical solution exists, which is the base for quantitative analysis. We numerically simulate the dynamics of the particle and use the planar, two-dimensional mean square displacement to recover the activity parameters of the bath. This approach yields satisfactory results as long as the particle remains relatively confined, that is, as long as the intensity of the colored noise remains low.</description>

      <title>Enlightening the blind spot of the Michaelis-Menten rate law: The role of relaxation dynamics in molecular complex formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11979v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The century-long Michaelis-Menten rate law and its modifications in the modeling of biochemical rate processes stand on the assumption that the concentration of the complex of interacting molecules, at each moment, rapidly approaches an equilibrium (quasi-steady state) compared to the pace of molecular concentration changes. Yet, in the case of actively time-varying molecular concentrations with transient or oscillatory dynamics, the deviation of the complex profile from the quasi-steady state becomes relevant. A recent theoretical approach, known as the effective time-delay scheme (ETS), suggests that the delay by the relaxation time of molecular complex formation contributes to the substantial breakdown of the quasi-steady state assumption. Here, we systematically expand this ETS and inquire into the comprehensive roles of relaxation dynamics in complex formation. Through the modeling of rhythmic protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions and the mammalian circadian clock, our analysis reveals the effect of the relaxation dynamics beyond the time delay, which extends to the dampening of changes in the complex concentration with a reduction in the oscillation amplitude against the quasi-steady state. Interestingly, the combined effect of the time delay and amplitude reduction shapes both qualitative and quantitative oscillatory patterns such as the emergence and variability of the mammalian circadian rhythms. These findings highlight the drawback of the routine assumption of quasi-steady states and enhance the mechanistic understanding of rich time-varying biomolecular activities.</description>

      <title>Long-Range Repulsion Between Chromosomes in Mammalian Oocyte Spindles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.00883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.00883v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To prepare gametes with the appropriate number of chromosomes, mammalian oocytes undergo two sequential cell divisions. During each division, a large, long-lived, microtubule-based organelle called the meiotic spindle assembles around condensed chromosomes. Although meiotic spindles have been intensively studied for several decades, as force-generating mechanical objects, they remain very poorly understood. In materials physics, coarse-grained theories have been essential in understanding the large-scale behavior of systems composed of many interacting particles. It is unclear, however, if this approach can succeed in capturing the properties of active, biochemically complex, living materials like the spindle. Here, we show that a class of models based on nematic liquid crystal theory can describe important aspects of the organelle-scale structure and dynamics of spindles in living mouse oocytes. Using our models to interpret quantitative polarization microscopy data, we measure for the first time material properties relating to stress propagation in living oocytes, including the nematic diffusivities corresponding to splay and bend deformations. Unlike the reconstituted amphibian spindles that were previously studied in vitro, nematic elastic stress is exponentially screened in the microtubule network of living mammalian oocytes, with a screening length of order one micron. This observation can be explained by the relatively high volume fraction of embedded chromosomes in mammalian meiotic spindles, which cause long voids in the microtubule network and so disrupt orientational stress propagation.</description>

      <title>Strain stiffening universality in composite hydrogels and soft tissues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.11687v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Soft biological tissues exhibit a remarkable resilience to large mechanical loads, a property which is associated with the strain stiffening capability of the biopolymer networks that structurally support the tissues. Yet, recent studies have shown that composite systems such as tissues and blood clots exhibit mechanical properties that contradict those of the polymer matrix - demonstrating stiffening in compression, but softening in shear and tension. The microscopic basis of this apparent paradox remains poorly understood. We show that composite hydrogels and tissues do indeed exhibit non-linear elastic stiffening in shear - which is governed by the stretching of the polymer chains in the matrix - and that it is driven by the same mechanism that drives compression stiffening. However, we show that the non-linear elastic stiffening in composite hydrogels and tissues is masked by mechanical dissipation arising from filler-polymer interactions known as the Mullins effect, and we introduce a method to characterize the non-linear elasticity of the composites in isolation from this overall strain softening response through large-amplitude oscillatory shear experiments. We present a comprehensive characterization of the non-linear elastic strain stiffening of composite hydrogels and soft tissues, and show that the strain stiffening in shear and compression are both governed by universal strain amplification factors that depend on essential properties of the composite system, such as the filler concentration and the filler-polymer interaction strength. These results elucidate the microscopic mechanisms governing the non-linear mechanics of tissues, which provides design principles for engineering tissue-mimetic soft materials, and have broad implications for cell-matrix mechanotransduction in living tissues under strain.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.05462v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While bacterial swarms can exhibit active turbulence in vacant spaces, they naturally inhabit crowded environments. We numerically show that driving disorderly active fluids through porous media enhances Darcy's law. While purely active flows average to zero flux, hybrid active/driven flows display greater drift than pure-driven fluids. This enhancement is non-monotonic with activity, leading to an optimal activity to maximize flow rate. We incorporate the active contribution into an active Darcy's law, which may serve to help understand anomalous transport of swarming in porous media.</description>
