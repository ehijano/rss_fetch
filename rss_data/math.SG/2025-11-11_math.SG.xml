      <title>Infinite-dimensional Lagrange-Dirac systems with boundary energy flow II: Field theories with bundle-valued forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Part I of this paper introduced the infinite dimensional Lagrange--Dirac theory for physical systems on the space of differential forms over a smooth manifold with boundary. This approach is particularly well-suited for systems involving energy exchange through the boundary, as it is built upon a restricted dual space -a vector subspace of the topological dual of the configuration space- that captures information about both the interior dynamics and boundary interactions. Consequently, the resulting dynamical equations naturally incorporate boundary energy flow. In this second part, the theory is extended to encompass vector-bundle-valued differential forms and non-Abelian gauge theories. To account for two commonly used forms of energy flux and boundary power densities, we introduce two distinct but equivalent formulations of the restricted dual. The results are derived from both geometric and variational viewpoints and are illustrated through applications to matter and gauge field theories. The interaction between gauge and matter fields is also addressed, along with the associated boundary conditions, applied to the case of the Yang-Mills-Higgs equations.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian flow between standard module Lagrangians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Aganagic's Fukaya category of the Coulomb branch of quiver gauge theory, the $T_\theta$-brane algebra gives a symplectic realization of the Khovanov-Lauda-Rouquier-Webster (KLRW) algebra, where each standard module is known to admit two Lagrangian realizations: the 'U'-shaped $T$-brane and the step $I$-brane. We show that the latter arises as the infinite-time limit of the Hamiltonian evolution of the former, thus serving as a generalized thimble. This provides a geometric realization of the categorical isomorphism previously established through holomorphic disc counting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.06436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the higher-dimensional Heegaard Floer homology between tuples of cotangent fibers and the conormal bundle of a homotopically nontrivial simple closed curve on $T^2$ recovers the polynomial representation of double affine Hecke algebra of type A. We also give a topological interpretation of Cherednik's inner product on the polynomial representation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.06699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For all punctured Riemann surfaces arising as mirror curves of toric Calabi--Yau threefolds, we show that their symplectic cohomology is isomorphic to the compactly supported Hochschild cohomology of the noncommutative Landau--Ginzburg model defined on the NCCR of the associated toric Gorenstein singularities. This mirror correspondence is established by analyzing the closed-open map with boundaries on certain combinatorially defined immersed Lagrangians in the Riemann surface, yielding a ring isomorphism. We give a detailed examination of the properties of this isomorphism, emphasizing its relationship to the singularity structure.</description>

Abstract: Kontsevich's graphs from deformation quantisation allow encoding multi-vectors whose coefficients are differential-polynomial in components of Poisson brackets on finite-dimensional affine manifolds. The calculus of Kontsevich graphs can be made dimension-specific for the class of Nambu--Poisson brackets given by Jacobian determinants. Using the Kontsevich--Nambu micro-graphs in dimensions $d\geqslant 2$, we explore the open problem of (non)triviality for Kontsevich's tetrahedral graph cocycle action on the space of Nambu--Poisson brackets. We detect a conjecturally infinite new set of differential-polynomial identities for Jacobian determinants of arbitrary sizes $d\times d$.</description>

      <title>Reduction of Cosymplectic groupoids by cosymplectic moment maps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03178v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Marsden-Weinstein-Meyer symplectic reduction has an analogous version for cosymplectic manifolds. In this paper we extend this cosymplectic reduction to the context of groupoids. Moreover, we prove how in the case of an algebroid associated to a cosymplectic groupoid, the integration commutes with the reduction (analogously to what happens in Poisson geometry). On the other hand, we show how the cosymplectic reduction of a groupoid induces a symplectic reduction on a canonical symplectic subgroupoid. Finally, we study what happens to the multiplicative Chern class associated with the $S^1$-central extensions of the reduced groupoid.</description>

      <title>Algebraic Lagrangian cobordisms, flux and the Lagrangian Ceresa cycle</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12850v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce an equivalence relation for Lagrangians in a symplectic manifold known as \textit{algebraic Lagrangian cobordism}, which is meant to mirror algebraic equivalence of cycles. From this we prove a symplectic, mirror-symmetric analogue of the statement \enquote{the Ceresa cycle is non-torsion in the Griffiths group of the Jacobian of a generic genus $3$ curve}. Namely, we show that for a family of tropical curves, the \textit{Lagrangian Ceresa cycle}, which is the Lagrangian lift of their tropical Ceresa cycle to the corresponding Lagrangian torus fibration, is non-torsion in its oriented algebraic Lagrangian cobordism group. We proceed by developing the notions of tropical (resp. symplectic) flux, which are morphisms from the tropical Griffiths (resp. algebraic Lagrangian cobordism) groups.</description>

      <title>Systolic $S^1$-index and characterization of non-smooth Zoll convex bodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13856v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define the systolic $S^1$-index of a convex body as the Fadell-Rabinowitz index of the space of generalized systoles associated with its boundary. We show that this index is a symplectic invariant. Using the systolic $S^1$-index, we introduce the notion of generalized Zoll convex bodies and prove that this definition coincides with the classical one when the convex body satisfies the uniqueness of systoles property, that is, when through every point passes at most one systole. Moreover, we show that generalized Zoll convex bodies can be characterized in terms of their Gutt-Hutchings capacities, and we prove that the space of generalized Zoll convex bodies is closed in the space of all convex bodies. As a corollary, we establish that if the interior of a convex body is symplectomorphic to the interior of a ball, then the convex body is generalized Zoll, and in particular Zoll if it satisfies the uniqueness of systoles property. Finally, we discuss several examples.</description>

      <title>Infinite-dimensional Lagrange-Dirac systems with boundary energy flow I: Foundations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17551v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A new geometric approach to systems with boundary energy flow is developed using infinite-dimensional Dirac structures within the Lagrangian formalism. This framework satisfies a list of consistency criteria with the geometric setting of finite-dimensional mechanics. In particular, the infinite-dimensional Dirac structure can be constructed from the canonical symplectic form on the system's phase space; the system's evolution equations can be derived equivalently from either a variational perspective or a Dirac structure perspective; the variational principle employed is a direct extension of Hamilton's principle in classical mechanics; and the approach allows for a process of system interconnection within its formulation. This is achieved by developing an appropriate infinite dimensional version of the previously developed Lagrange-Dirac dynamical systems. A key step in this construction is the careful choice of a suitable dual space to the configuration space, specifically, a subspace of the topological dual that captures the system's behavior in both the interior and the boundary, while allowing for a natural extension of the canonical geometric structures of mechanics. This paper focuses on systems where the configuration space consists of differential forms on a smooth manifold with a boundary. To illustrate our theory, several examples, including nonlinear wave equations, the telegraph equation, and the Maxwell equations are presented.</description>

      <title>The Simplicity of the Group of Weakly Hamiltonian Diffeomorphisms on Cosymplectic Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10224v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish a cosymplectic counterpart of Banyaga's theorem by proving that the group of weakly Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms, $\Ham_{\eta,\omega}(M)$, is simple on any closed cosymplectic manifold. A key structural result, derived from Lie group theory, provides the foundation for our argument: the Reeb flow on any closed cosymplectic manifold is always periodic. This property, in turn, forces the associated flux group to be discrete. Building on this discrete invariant, we develop the essential fragmentation and transitivity principles needed to prove perfectness and simplicity. Beyond this algebraic framework, we recover Li's result realizing closed cosymplectic manifolds as symplectic mapping tori, and we establish a Liouville-type integrability theorem for Hamiltonian systems invariant under the Reeb flow, producing $(n+1)$-dimensional invariant tori. Finally, we characterize the commutator subgroup of the full cosymplectomorphism group as $\Ham_{\eta,\omega}(M)$.</description>

      <title>Regular semisimple Hessenberg varieties with cohomology rings generated in degree two</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.03762v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A regular semisimple Hessenberg variety $\mathrm{Hess}(S,h)$ is a smooth subvariety of the flag variety determined by a square matrix $S$ with distinct eigenvalues and a Hessenberg function $h$. The cohomology ring $H^*(\mathrm{Hess}(S,h))$ is independent of the choice of $S$ and is not explicitly described except for a few cases. In this paper, we characterize the Hessenberg function $h$ such that $H^*(\mathrm{Hess}(S,h))$ is generated in degree two as a ring. It turns out that such $h$ is what is called a (double) lollipop.</description>

Abstract: We present a link between billiards in convex plane domains and Hofer's geometry, an area of symplectic topology. For smooth strictly convex billiard tables, we prove that the Hofer distance between the corresponding billiard ball maps admits an upper bound in terms of a simple geometric distance between the tables. We use this result to show that the billiard ball map of a convex polygon lies in the completion, with respect to Hofer's metric, of the group of smooth area-preserving maps of the annulus. Finally, we discuss related connections to dynamics and pose several open problems.</description>

      <title>Geometric, topological and dynamical properties of conformally symplectic systems, normally hyperbolic invariant manifolds, and scattering maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14794v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conformally symplectic diffeomorphisms $f:M \rightarrow M$ transform a symplectic form $\omega$ on a manifold M into a multiple of itself, $f^* \omega = \eta \omega$. We assume $\omega$ is bounded, as some of the results may fail otherwise. We show that there are deep interactions between the topological properties of the manifold, the dynamical properties of the map, and the geometry of invariant manifolds. We show that, when the symplectic form is not exact, the possible conformal factors $\eta$ are related to topological properties of the manifold. For some manifolds the conformal factors are restricted to be algebraic numbers. We also find relations between dynamical properties (relations between growth rate of vectors and $\eta$) and symplectic properties. Normally hyperbolic invariant manifolds (NHIM) and their (un)stable manifolds are important landmarks that organize long-term dynamical behaviour. We prove that a NHIM is symplectic if and only if the rates satisfy certain pairing rules and if and only if the rates and the conformal factor satisfy certain (natural) inequalities. Homoclinic excursions to NHIMs are quantitatively described by scattering maps. These maps give the trajectory asymptotic in the future as a function of the trajectory asymptotic in the past. We prove that the scattering maps are symplectic even if the dynamics is dissipative. We also show that if the symplectic form is exact, then the scattering maps are exact, even if the dynamics is not exact. We give a variational interpretation of scattering maps in the conformally symplectic setting. We also show that similar properties of NHIMs and scattering maps hold in the case when $\omega$ is presymplectic. In dynamical systems with many rates (e.g., quasi-integrable systems near multiple resonances), pre-symplectic geometries appear naturally.</description>
