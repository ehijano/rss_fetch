      <title>Dual Reinforcement Learning Synergy in Resource Allocation: Emergence of Self-Organized Momentum Strategy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In natural ecosystems and human societies, self-organized resource allocation and policy synergy are ubiquitous and significant. This work focuses on the synergy between Dual Reinforcement Learning Policies in the Minority Game (DRLP-MG) to optimize resource allocation. Our study examines a mixed-structured population with two sub-populations: a Q-subpopulation using Q-learning policy and a C-subpopulation adopting the classical policy. We first identify a synergy effect between these subpopulations. A first-order phase transition occurs as the mixing ratio of the subpopulations changes. Further analysis reveals that the Q-subpopulation consists of two internal synergy clusters (IS-clusters) and a single external synergy cluster (ES-cluster). The former contribute to the internal synergy within the Q-subpopulation through synchronization and anti-synchronization, whereas the latter engages in the inter-subpopulation synergy. Within the ES-cluster, the classical momentum strategy in the financial market manifests and assumes a crucial role in the inter-subpopulation synergy. This particular strategy serves to prevent long-term under-utilization of resources. However, it also triggers trend reversals and leads to a decrease in rewards for those who adopt it. Our research reveals that the frozen effect, in either the C- or Q-subpopulation, is a crucial prerequisite for synergy, consistent with previous studies. We also conduct mathematical analyses on subpopulation synergy effects and the synchronization and anti-synchronization forms of IS-clusters in the Q-subpopulation. Overall, our work comprehensively explores the complex resource-allocation dynamics in DRLP-MG, uncovers multiple synergy mechanisms and their conditions, enriching the theoretical understanding of reinforcement-learning-based resource allocation and offering valuable practical insights</description>

      <title>Emergent order from mixed chaos at low temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores a novel connection between a thermodynamic and a dynamical systems perspective on emergent dynamical order. We provide evidence for a conjecture that Hamiltonian systems with mixed chaos spontaneously find regular behavior when minimally coupled to a thermal bath at sufficiently low temperature. Numerical evidence across a diverse set of five dynamical systems supports this conjecture, and allows us to quantify corollaries about the organization timescales and disruption of order at higher temperatures. Balancing the damping-induced phase-space contraction against thermal exploration, we are able to predict the transition temperatures in terms of the relaxation timescales, indicating a novel nonequilibrium fluctuation-dissipation relation, and formally connecting the thermodynamic and dynamical systems views. Our findings suggest that for a wide range of real-world systems, coupling to a cold thermal bath leads to emergence of robust, non-trivial dynamical order, rather than a mere reduction of motion as in equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Predator-Prey Model: Driven Hunt for Accelerated Grokking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10562v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A machine learning method is proposed using two agents that simulate the biological behavior of a predator and a prey. In this method, the predator and the prey interact with each other - the predator chases the prey while the prey runs away from the predator - to perform an optimization on the landscape. This method allows, for the case of a ravine landscape (i.e., a landscape with narrow ravines and with gentle slopes along the ravines) to avoid getting optimization stuck in the ravine. For this, in the optimization over a ravine landscape the predator drives the prey along the ravine. Thus we also call this approach, for the case of ravine landscapes, the driven hunt method. For some examples of grokking (i.e., delayed generalization) problems we show that this method allows for achieving up to a hundred times faster learning compared to the standard learning procedure.</description>

      <title>Deterministic coherence and anti-coherence resonances in two coupled Lorenz oscillators: numerical study versus experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate the deterministic coherence and anti-coherence resonance phenomena in two coupled identical chaotic Lorenz oscillators. Both effects are found to occur simultaneously when varying the coupling strength. In particular, the occurrence of deterministic coherence resonance is revealed by analysing time realizations $x(t)$ and $y(t)$ of both oscillators, whereas the anti-coherence resonance is identified when considering oscillations $z(t)$ at the same parameter values. Both resonances are observed when the coupling strength does not exceed a threshold value corresponding to complete synchronization of the interacting chaotic oscillators. In such a case, the coupled oscillators exhibit the hyperchaotic dynamics associated with the on-off intermittency. The highlighted effects are studied in numerical simulations and confirmed in physical experiments, showing an excellent correspondence and disclosing thereby the robustness of the observed phenomena.</description>

      <title>Updating the Complex Systems Keyword Diagram Using Collective Feedback and Latest Literature Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11997v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The complex systems keyword diagram generated by the author in 2010 has been used widely in a variety of educational and outreach purposes, but it definitely needs a major update and reorganization. This short paper reports our recent attempt to update the keyword diagram using information collected from the following multiple sources: (a) collective feedback posted on social media, (b) recent reference books on complex systems and network science, (c) online resources on complex systems, and (d) keyword search hits obtained using OpenAlex, an open-access bibliographic catalogue of scientific publications. The data (a), (b) and (c) were used to incorporate the research community's internal perceptions of the relevant topics, whereas the data (d) was used to obtain more objective measurements of the keywords' relevance and associations from publications made in complex systems science. Results revealed differences and overlaps between public perception and actual usage of keywords in publications on complex systems. Four topical communities were obtained from the keyword association network, although they were highly intertwined with each other. We hope that the resulting network visualization of complex systems keywords provides a more up-to-date, accurate topic map of the field of complex systems as of today.</description>

      <title>Adversarial control of synchronization in complex oscillator networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02403v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates perturbation strategies inspired by adversarial attack principles from deep learning, designed to control synchronization dynamics through strategically crafted weak perturbations. We propose a gradient-based optimization method that identifies small phase perturbations to dramatically enhance or suppress collective synchronization in Kuramoto oscillator networks. Our approach formulates synchronization control as an optimization problem, computing gradients of the order parameter with respect to oscillator phases to determine optimal perturbation directions. Results demonstrate that extremely small phase perturbations applied to network oscillators can achieve significant synchronization control across diverse network architectures. Our analysis reveals that synchronization enhancement is achievable across various network sizes, while synchronization suppression becomes particularly effective in larger networks, with effectiveness scaling favorably with network size. The method is systematically validated on canonical model networks including scale-free and small-world topologies, and real-world networks representing power grids and brain connectivity patterns. This adversarial framework represents a novel paradigm for synchronization management by introducing deep learning concepts to networked dynamical systems.</description>
