      <title>The Lasso Distribution: Properties, Sampling Methods, and Applications in Bayesian Lasso Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07394v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a new probability distribution, the Lasso distribution. We derive several fundamental properties of the distribution, including closed-form expressions for its moments and moment-generating function. Additionally, we present an efficient and numerically stable algorithm for generating random samples from the distribution, facilitating its use in both theoretical and applied settings. We establish that the Lasso distribution belongs to the exponential family. A direct application of the Lasso distribution arises in the context of an existing Gibbs sampler, where the full conditional distribution of each regression coefficient follows this distribution. This leads to a more computationally efficient and theoretically grounded sampling scheme. To facilitate the adoption of our methodology, we provide an R package implementing the proposed methods. Our findings offer new insights into the probabilistic structure underlying the Lasso penalty and provide practical improvements in Bayesian inference for high-dimensional regression problems.</description>

      <title>Nonparametric Smoothing of Directional and Axial Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17463v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss generalized linear models for directional data where the conditional distribution of the response is a von Mises-Fisher distribution in arbitrary dimension or a Bingham distribution on the unit circle. To do this properly, we parametrize von Mises-Fisher distributions by Euclidean parameters and investigate computational aspects of this parametrization. Then we modify this approach for local polynomial regression as a means of nonparametric smoothing of distributional data. The methods are illustrated with simulated data and a data set from planetary sciences involving covariate vectors on a sphere with axial response.</description>

      <title>Aesthetics Without Semantics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05331v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While it is easy for human observers to judge an image as beautiful or ugly, aesthetic decisions result from a combination of entangled perceptual and cognitive (semantic) factors, making the understanding of aesthetic judgements particularly challenging from a scientific point of view. Furthermore, our research shows a prevailing bias in current databases, which include mostly beautiful images, further complicating the study and prediction of aesthetic responses. We address these limitations by creating a database of images with minimal semantic content and devising, and next exploiting, a method to generate images on the ugly side of aesthetic valuations. The resulting Minimum Semantic Content (MSC) database consists of a large and balanced collection of 10,426 images, each evaluated by 100 observers. We next use established image metrics to demonstrate how augmenting an image set biased towards beautiful images with ugly images can modify, or even invert, an observed relationship between image features and aesthetics valuation. Taken together, our study reveals that works in empirical aesthetics attempting to link image content and aesthetic judgements may magnify, underestimate, or simply miss interesting effects due to a limitation of the range of aesthetic values they consider.</description>
