      <title>A General Theory of Piping Transportation: Unifying System Dynamics for Resilience and Sustainable Development</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The science of pipeline transport is currently governed by a collection of fragmented, discipline-specific theories that are inadequate for addressing the systemic challenges of 21st-century infrastructure. This paper introduces and formalizes a new, unified theory: the General Theory of Piping Transportation (GTPT), formulated by Darwisman. The GTPT posits that a pipeline system is a complex socio-technical entity whose state and long-term viability are determined by the fully coupled interaction of three interdependent domains: Physical Dynamics ({\Phi}), Life-Cycle Dynamics ({\Lambda}), and Socio-Economic Dynamics ({\Sigma}). This paper presents the core postulates of the GTPT, which are derived from a systematic synthesis of the fragmented existing literature. The prescriptive power of the theory is illustrated by contrasting the strategic outcomes derived from the GTPT against those from classical theories. By defining resilience as the primary design objective and operationalizing the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the GTPT provides a new theoretical foundation for the design, management, and governance of infrastructure across all critical sectors.</description>

      <title>Replacement and Reputation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Does electoral replacement ensure that officeholders eventually act in voters' interests? We study a reputational model of accountability. Voters observe incumbents' performance and decide whether to replace them. Politicians may be "good" types who always exert effort or opportunists who may shirk. We find that good long-run outcomes are always attainable, though the mechanism and its robustness depend on economic conditions. In environments conducive to incentive provision, some equilibria feature sustained effort, yet others exhibit some long-run shirking. In the complementary case, opportunists are never fully disciplined, but selection dominates: every equilibrium eventually settles on a good politician, yielding permanent effort.</description>

      <title>Historical claims problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the resolution of claims problems with history. At a given period of time, a group of agents holds claims over an insufficient endowment, as they did in previous periods. The solution to the present-period problem might be influenced by the solutions at previous-periods problems (history). We introduce a natural historical operator, which extends standard rules (solving one-shot claims problems) to construct rules that solve claims problems with history. We study the preservation of properties by this operator and also obtain a characterization result for it.</description>

      <title>Continuous Treatment Effects with Spatial and Network Spillovers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12653v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper develops a continuous functional framework for treatment effects that propagate through geographic space and economic networks. We derive a master equation governing propagation from three economic foundations -- heterogeneous agent aggregation, market equilibrium, and cost minimization -- establishing that the framework rests on fundamental principles rather than ad hoc specifications. A key result shows that the spatial-network interaction coefficient equals the mutual information between geographic and market coordinates. The Feynman-Kac representation decomposes effects into inherited and accumulated components along stochastic paths representing economic linkages. The framework nests the no-spillover case as a testable restriction. Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that conventional estimators -- two-way fixed effects, difference-in-differences, and generalized propensity score -- exhibit 25-38% bias and severe undercoverage when spillovers exist, while our estimator maintains correct inference regardless of whether spillovers are present. Applying the framework to U.S. minimum wage policy, we reject the no-spillover null and find total effects at state borders four times larger than direct effects -- conventional methods capture only one-quarter of policy impact. Structural estimates reveal spatial diffusion consistent with commuting-distance labor mobility, network diffusion consistent with quarterly supply chain adjustment, and significant spatial-network interaction reflecting geographic clustering of industries. Entropy-based fragility diagnostics outperform standard centrality measures by 56-76% in predicting labor market disruptions, identifying all high-risk state-industry pairs during 2020-2021 with six-month advance warning.</description>

      <title>Fair Coordination in Strategic Scheduling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13244v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a scheduling problem of strategic agents representing jobs of different weights. Each agent has to decide on one of a finite set of identical machines to get their job processed. In contrast to the common and exclusive focus on makespan minimization, we want the outcome to be fair under strategic considerations of the agents. Two natural properties are credibility, which ensures that the assignment is a Nash equilibrium and equality, requiring that agents with equal-weight jobs are assigned to machines of equal load. We combine these two with a hierarchy of fairness properties based on envy-freeness together with several relaxations based on the idea that envy seems more justified towards agents with a higher weight. We present a complete complexity landscape for satisfiability and decision versions of these properties, alone or in combination, and study them as structural constraints under makespan optimization. For our positive results, we develop a unified algorithmic approach, where we achieve different properties by fine-tuning key subroutines.</description>

      <title>Markovian Persuasion with Stochastic Revelations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.08659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.08659v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the classical Bayesian persuasion model an informed player and an uninformed one engage in a static interaction. The informed player, the sender, knows the state of nature, while the uninformed one, the receiver, does not. The informed player partially shares his private information with the receiver and the latter then, based on her belief about the state, takes an action. This action, together with the state of nature, determines the utility of both players. This paper analyzes a dynamic Bayesian persuasion model where the state of nature evolves according to a Markovian law. Here, the sender always knows the realized state, while the receiver randomly gets to know it. We discuss the value of the sender when he becomes more and more patient and its relation to the revelation rate, namely the probability at which the true state is revealed to the receiver at any stage.</description>

      <title>No Screening is More Efficient with Multiple Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10077v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study efficient mechanism design for allocating multiple heterogeneous objects. The aim is to maximize the residual surplus, the total value generated from an allocation minus the costs of screening. We discover a robust trend indicating that no-screening mechanisms, such as serial dictatorship with exogenous priority order, tend to perform better as the variety of goods increases. We analyze the underlying reasons by characterizing asymptotically efficient mechanisms in a stylized environment. We also apply an automated mechanism design approach to numerically derive efficient mechanisms and validate the trend in general environments. Building on these implications, we propose the \emph{register-invite-book system} (RIB) as an efficient system for scheduling vaccination against pandemic diseases.</description>

      <title>Manipulation of social choice correspondences under incomplete information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23141v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the manipulability of social choice correspondences in situations where individuals have incomplete information about others' preferences. We propose a general concept of manipulability that depends on the extension rule used to derive preferences over sets of alternatives from preferences over alternatives, as well as on individuals' level of information. We then focus on the manipulability of social choice correspondences when the Kelly extension rule is used, and individuals are assumed to have the capability to anticipate the outcome of the collective decision. Under these assumptions, we introduce some monotonicity and sensitivity properties for social choice correspondences that combined imply manipulability. Then we prove a result of manipulability for unanimous positional social choice correspondences, and present a detailed analysis of the manipulability properties for the Borda, the plurality, the negative plurality and the Copeland social choice correspondences.</description>

      <title>Self-Equivalent Voting Rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15310v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, I introduce a novel stability axiom for stochastic voting rules, called self-equivalence, by which a society considering whether to replace its voting rule using itself will choose not to do so. I then show that under the unrestricted strict preference domain, the unique voting rule satisfying the democratic principles of anonymity, optimality, monotonicity, and neutrality as well as the stability principle of self-equivalence must assign to every voter equal probability of being a dictator (i.e., uniform random dictatorship). Thus, any society that desires stability and adheres to the aforementioned democratic principles is bound to either employ the uniform random dictatorship or decide whether to change its voting rule using a voting rule other than itself.</description>

      <title>Equal Treatment of Equals and Efficiency in Probabilistic Assignments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14522v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies general multi-unit probabilistic assignment problems involving indivisible objects, with a particular focus on achieving the fundamental fairness notion known as equal treatment of equals (ETE) and ensuring various notions of efficiency. We extend the definition of ETE so that it accommodates a variety of constraints and applications. We analyze the ETE reassignment procedure, which transforms any assignment into one satisfying ETE, and examine its compatibility with three efficiency concepts: ex-post efficiency, ordinal efficiency, and rank-minimizing efficiency. We show that while the ETE reassignment of an ex-post efficient assignment remains ex-post efficient, it may fail to preserve ordinal efficiency in general settings. However, since the ETE reassignment of a rank-minimizing assignment preserves rank-minimizing efficiency, the existence of assignments satisfying both ETE and ordinal efficiency can be established. Furthermore, we propose a computationally efficient method for constructing assignments that satisfy both ETE and ordinal efficiency under general upper bound constraints, by combining the serial dictatorship rule with appropriately specified priority lists and the ETE reassignment.</description>

      <title>Algorithmic Collusion is Algorithm Orchestration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14766v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a fresh `meta-game' perspective on the problem of algorithmic collusion in pricing games a la Bertrand. Economists have interpreted the fact that algorithms can learn to price collusively as tacit collusion. We argue instead that the co-parametrization of algorithms, in ways as are necessary to obtain algorithmic collusion, typically requires algorithm designers to engage in some form of explicit collusion or `algorithm orchestration.' In our model, the algorithm designers play a meta-game of parametrizing their algorithms, which then play repeated Bertrand competition. The strategic analysis at the meta-level reveals new equilibrium and collusion phenomena. (JEL: C62, C63, D43, L13)</description>
