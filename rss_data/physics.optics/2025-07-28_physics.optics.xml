      <title>Non-volatile photorefractive tuning and green light generation in a diamond cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-crystal diamond nanocavities have tremendous potential for use in quantum and nonlinear optical technologies. The ability to precisely control their resonant frequencies is essential for many applications, and $\textit{in situ}$ tuning is particularly desirable. In this work, we demonstrate deterministic and non-volatile resonance tuning of a diamond nanocavity. We observed a photorefractive effect in concert with the generation of third-harmonic light within the device. This effect blue-shifted the cavity resonance frequency by $20.9\,\text{GHz}$, exceeding the cavity linewidth. The shift corresponded to a fractional change in refractive index of $-10^{-4}$, and its relaxation occurred over several tens of hours. Although photorefraction is a second-order nonlinear effect and has previously not been observed in diamond owing to its vanishing $\chi^{(2)}$, the observed behaviour is consistent with the generation of non-zero $\chi^{(2)}$ by electric fields from charged crystal defects. This observation could enable the realisation of diamond frequency converters and electro-optical modulators that rely on second-order nonlinearity.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic Hyper-Lift: optical nano-tweezers with hyperbolic materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical tweezers, formed by tightly focused propagating laser beams, offer the unique capability to trap and control microscopic particles over a broad size range. However, the diffraction inherent to propagating optical fields, limits the resulting resolution and the accuracy of particle manipulation. Here we show that the phenomenon of ``auto-focusing'' inherent to hyperbolic materials in cylinder geometry, can be used for spatial control with nanometer accuracy. Furthermore, due to highly efficient light focusing in hyperbolic media that is not restricted by diffraction, the resulting electromagnetically induced forces exceed those of conventional optical tweezers by several orders of magnitude, which allows more efficient particle manipulation at reduced illumination intensity.</description>

      <title>Optical communications through highly scattering channels using the coherence-rank</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In optical communications, logical bits are encoded in physical degrees-of-freedom (DoFs) of the electromagnetic field. Consequently, optical scattering in a communications channel compromises the information transfer. In the worst-case-scenario, bit-to-bit stochastically varying scattering that couples the DoFs to each other -including even unused DoFs -can decouple the transmitter and receiver when relying on conventional physical encoding schemes, and preclude the utilization of adaptive techniques as a counter-measure. Here we show that partially coherent optical fields help circumvent the worst-case-scenario of rapidly varying, strong optical scattering, even when the channel is rendered informationally opaque for conventional approaches. Using a channel in which the spatial and polarization DoFs are relevant, we encode the logical bits in the unitarily invariant coherence rank (the number of non-zero eigenvalues of the field coherence matrix) and prepare our partially coherent fields with maximal entropies of 0, 1, 1.585, and 2 bits for rank-1, rank-2, rank-3, and rank-4 coherence matrices, respectively. This scheme demonstrates scattering-immune optical communications with 100 % fidelity. These results unveil an unexpected utility for partially coherent light in optical communications through challenging environments.</description>

      <title>Dielectric environment engineering via 2D material heterostructure formation on hybrid photonic crystal nanocavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hybrid integration of two-dimensional (2D) materials with nanophotonic platforms has enabled compact optoelectronic devices by leveraging the unique optical and electronic properties of atomically thin layers. While most efforts have focused on coupling 2D materials to pre-defined photonic structures, the broader potential of 2D heterostructures for actively engineering the photonic environment remains largely unexplored. In our previous work, we employed single types of 2D material and showed that even monolayer flakes can locally induce high-$Q$ nanocavities in photonic crystal (PhC) waveguides through effective refractive index modulation. Here, we extend this concept by demonstrating that further transferring of 2D material flakes onto the induced hybrid nanocavity to form heterostructures enable more flexibility for post-fabrication dielectric environment engineering of the cavity. We show that the high-$Q$ hybrid nanocavities remain robust under sequential flake stacking. Coupling optically active MoTe$_{2}$ flake to these cavities yields enhanced photoluminescence and reduced emission lifetimes, consistent with Purcell-enhanced light-matter interactions. Additionally, encapsulation with a top hBN layer leads to a significant increase in the cavity $Q$ factor, in agreement with numerical simulations. Our results show that these heterostructure stacks not only preserve the cavity quality but also introduce an additional degrees of control -- via flake thickness, refractive indices, size and interface design -- offering a richer dielectric environment modulation landscape than what is achievable with monolayers alone, providing a versatile method toward scalable and reconfigurable hybrid nanophotonic systems.</description>

      <title>Water Heterostructure Photodetector for Calculation of Semiconductor Minority Carrier Lifetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The minority carrier lifetime of semiconductor materials is a crucial performance parameter for optoelectronic devices. However, the existing minority carrier lifetime measurement techniques necessitate delicate optical measurement systems and harmful treatment of the samples, which will definitely cause great constraints on the further development of the semiconductor industry. Here, an off-junction graphene/water/silicon photodetector is realized based on the charming dynamic polarization process of water molecules at the water/silicon and water/graphene interface, which shows a typical responsivity and detectivity of 36.55 mA W-1 and 1.62*1012 Jones respectively under 890 nm illumination with a distance of 0.2 cm away from the junction. This pulse-like photo-response arises from the diffusion and drift current toward the water/silicon interface generated by the illumination on an off-junction spot. Furthermore, by measuring the photo-current at a different distance from the junction combined with an exponential fitting method, the minority carrier lifetime calculation of silicon can be performed with the maximum accuracy rate reaches 98.8%, where water plays the key role of deducing the carrier lifetime. This study provides a straightforward method that paves the way for future minority carrier lifetime tests of semiconductor materials, which hold great potential for developing the nondestructive tests(NDT) in semiconductor industry.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous emission and lasing in photonic time crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the first direct mapping of the local density of states (LDOS) in a photonic time crystal (PTC), capturing its evolution from the analogues of spontaneous emission enhancement to thresholded lasing. The PTC is implemented with an array of time-periodically modulated LC resonators at microwave frequencies. Broadband white noise probes the system and reveals an LDOS lineshape that decomposes into absorptive and dispersive Lorentzian components near the momentum gap frequency. The finite peak amplitude, which grows with modulation strength, shows that the spontaneous emission rate is maximized at the gap frequency. All observed features agree with classical non-Hermitian Floquet theory. When modulation-induced gain exceeds losses, the PTC transitions to a narrow-band lasing oscillation state. These findings open a route to nonequilibrium photonics and bring time-periodic LDOS engineering closer to practical realization.</description>

      <title>Noise-Limited Sensitivity in Cavity Optomechanical Molecular Sensing Enabled by Quantum Zero-Point Displacement Coupling and Strong Photon-Phonon Interaction for Chiral Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a quantum-limited optomechanical sensing platform for real-time detection and discrimination of chiral molecules, based on a multilayer hybrid plasmonic-mechanical resonator. Leveraging quantum zero-point motion and engineered photon-phonon interactions, the system achieves ultrahigh displacement sensitivity that approaches the fundamental quantum limit. The multilayer architecture, composed of alternating dielectric and metallic films, supports mechanical resonances with quality factors reaching approximately ten thousand in the megahertz frequency range. These resonances coherently modulate the optical field through radiation pressure and dynamical backaction. Power spectral density measurements reveal distinct mechanical peaks at 0.68, 2.9, 4.3, 5.5, and 6.8 MHz, with optomechanical coupling strengths exceeding twice the intrinsic baseline, enabling highly efficient signal transduction. Lorentzian fitting confirms the presence of sharp mechanical linewidths, while the total force noise, including thermal, shot, and technical contributions, remains below the threshold required for detecting sub-piconewton forces. Time-resolved Raman spectroscopy, which is typically insensitive to chirality, here reveals enantioselective dynamics arising from asymmetric optomechanical interactions, enabling clear spectral distinction between d- and l-enantiomers. Finite-element simulations validate the strong spatial overlap between optical confinement and mechanical displacement modes. This platform offers a scalable and tunable approach to quantum-limited, high-sensitivity chiral molecule detection, with applications in coherent control, precision spectroscopy, and chemical sensing.</description>

      <title>On-chip Single-crystal Plasmonic Optoelectronics for Efficient Hot Carrier Collection and Photovoltage Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-area chemically synthesized single-crystal metals with nanometer-scale thickness have emerged as promising materials for on-chip nanophotonic applications, owing to their superior plasmonic properties compared to nanofabricated polycrystalline counterparts. While much recent attention has focused on their optical properties, the combined optimal electrical and optical characteristics, which hold great potential for high-performance optoelectronic functionalities, remain largely unexplored. Here, we present a single-crystal plasmonic optoelectronic platform based on nanowires fabricated from synthesized gold flakes and demonstrate its capabilities for highly enhanced hot carrier collection, electroluminescence, and photovoltage detection. Notably, single-crystal gold nanogap devices exhibit an order of magnitude higher open-circuit photovoltage compared to polycrystalline devices, representing one of the highest reported photovoltage sensing performances in terms of on-chip device density and responsivity per area. Our analysis revealed that this enhancement is attributed mostly to the suppression of electron-phonon scattering and improved hot carrier tunneling efficiency in single-crystal devices. These results highlight the potential of large-scale single-crystal nanostructures for both fundamental studies of nanoscale hot carrier transport and scalable electrically driven nanophotonic applications.</description>

      <title>Generalized Guided Mode Expansion for Non-Hermitian Resonances in Photonic Crystal Slabs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present a generalized guided mode expansion method to model complex resonances in photonic crystal slabs within a non-Hermitian framework. By expanding the electromagnetic fields over the complete mode basis of an unpatterned slab and systematically integrating out radiative Fabry-Perot modes, we derive an effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian that treats guided mode coupling and radiation losses on equal footing. As a case study highlighting the power of our effective theory, we apply it to hexagonal lattices with both preserved and broken $C_6$ symmetry. The method accurately predicts complex band structures, near-field profiles, and far-field radiation patterns, in excellent agreement with full-wave finite element simulations. In particular, it reproduces both symmetry-protected BICs at the $\Gamma$ point, accidental off-$\Gamma$ BICs in the vicinity of the $\Gamma$ point, and emergence of chiral exceptional points. It also captures the tunable behavior of eigenmodes near the $K$ point, including the shift of Dirac points and the emergence of quasi-BICs or bandgap opening, depending on the nature of $C_6$ symmetry breaking. Our work paves the way for predictive and efficient modeling of complex photonic resonances, revealing their topological and symmetry-protected characteristics in non-Hermitian systems.</description>

      <title>Chiral Spontaneous Photon-Pair Generation with Plasmonic Bound States in the Continuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spontaneous parametric down conversion (SPDC) has proven to be a robust and prominent method for creating non-classical light sources of entangled single-photon pairs. However, such sources suffer from low efficiency due to the inherent weakness of the SPDC process. Moreover, there is no control of polarization in the generated photons. Circular polarized SPDC-based sources with efficient chiral response are currently missing, which severely precludes the realization of a wide range of practical applications in quantum computing and communications. The current work solves these inherent problems by demonstrating a novel chiral plasmonic metasurface that leverages a strong quasi-bound state in the continuum (qBIC) resonance which significantly increases the SPDC photon generation efficiency and realizes circular polarized (chiral) single-photon pairs. The presented metasurface design is ultrathin, supports efficient free space outcoupling of chiral classical and quantum radiation, and operates at room temperature. Hence, it offers the potential to realize a compact and integrable quantum source of circularly polarized entangled single-photon pairs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid progress of nanophotonics demands theoretical frameworks capable of predicting the resonant behavior of complex systems comprising constituents of varying nature, operating beyond the weak-coupling, high-Q regime where classical temporal coupled-mode theory (CMT) is applicable. This work presents a coupled-quasinormal-mode (cQNM) framework for analyzing dissipative coupling with photonic and plasmonic resonators. The framework provides rigorous closed-form expressions for dissipative coupling coefficients and introduces novel features, such as a new coupling scheme via time derivatives of excitation coefficients. It delivers transparent and accurate predictions of exotic phenomena-such as zero-coupling between very close cavities and level-attraction effects that are only vaguely captured by traditional CMT models. Efficient and user-friendly, this framework facilitates rapid parameter space exploration for device design and offers potential for extension to nonlinear and quantum systems in future applications.</description>

      <title>L-Cysteine Polymorph Coatings for THz Sensing Metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electromagnetic response of metasurfaces can be intentionally engineered by carefully designing their unit cells. Narrowband metasurfaces, characterized by high quality factors, can serve as an efficient platform for biosensing in optical to THz regimes, to explore new structural forms of biomolecules, further elevating the capabilities of THz sensing technologies. In this study, an all-metallic metasurface featuring structural asymmetry is proposed to analyze L-Cysteine with orthorhombic and monoclinic crystallographic structures. The influence of the concentration of L-Cysteine in the monoclinic phase on the THz response of the metasurface was performed using a drop-casting method. Our findings reveal a noticeable frequency shift as analyte concentration raises, underscoring the potential for high sensitivity in detecting biomolecules. Thus, this research demonstrates that asymmetric THz metasurfaces offer rather promising detection capabilities at lower THz frequencies between two crystallographic structures of L Cysteine, with a Q-factor of 37, and a sensitivity of 1.430 THz ml/g. We believe that our results can be of great value to the development of biosensors for improved material characterization at low frequencies.</description>

      <title>Integrated Spectropolarimeter by Metasurface-Based Diffractive Optical Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional spectrometer and polarimeter systems rely on bulky optics, fundamentally limiting compact integration and hindering multi-dimensional optical sensing capabilities. Here, we propose a spectropolarimeter enabled by metasurface-based diffractive optical networks that simultaneously performs spectrometric and polarimetric measurements in a compact device. By leveraging the wavelength- and polarization-dependent phase modulation of metasurfaces, our system encodes the spectral and polarization information of incident light into spatially resolved intensity distributions, which are subsequently decoded by a trained deep neural network, enabling simultaneous high-accuracy reconstruction of both spectral compositions and Stokes parameters through a single-shot measurement. Experiments validate the proposed network's accurate reconstruction of the spectral and polarization information across a broad wavelength range, and further confirm its imaging capability. Notably, we demonstrate a chip-integrated sensor prototype combing both measurement functionalities into a commercial CMOS image sensor. This integrated platform provides a compact solution for on-chip multi-dimensional optical sensing, holding significant potential for versatile sensing, biomedical diagnosis, and industrial metrology.</description>

      <title>Emission enhanced exciton-polariton condensates with optical feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical feedback is a well-known method of controlling laser dynamics, which has been widely studied in photonic systems to induce complex behaviors such as chaos or enhanced coherence. However, its application to systems in the strong light-matter coupling regime remains unexplored. In this work, we introduce a delayed optical feedback loop into a nonresonantly pumped polariton condensate. By feeding part of the emission back into the cavity to seed the next condensate, we observe a strong increase in the output intensity, up to 110%. We explain this effect using a classical rate equation model for the condensate coupled to excitonic reservoirs. Our results evidence that polariton condensates can respond strongly to optical feedback, congruent with well known polariton amplification techniques using resonant pump-probe setups. Our method opens new possibilities for using polariton feedback to connect multiple condensates and can be an essential step toward neuromorphic computing based on recurrent signaling in photonic systems.</description>

      <title>Inverse scattering transform via affine map: applications to high-speed nonlinear optical communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work present an affine map approximation for solving the inverse scattering problem related to the nonlinear Schr\"odinger model of signal propagation in high-speed coherent optical communication. Numerical simulations indicate that accurate recovery of the transmitted bit sequence can be achieved using only the continuous part of the Lax spectrum at the fiber output, thereby allowing the discrete (soliton) spectrum to be disregarded. We observed that the numerically evaluated rank of the resulting affine map matrix equals the number of bits per transmitted sequence, and we utilize this to derive a reduced order affine map.</description>

      <title>Monolithically Integrated Optical Convolutional Processors on Thin Film Lithium Niobate</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photonic neural networks (PNNs) of sufficiently large physical dimensions and high operation accuracies are envisaged as an ideal candidate for breaking the major bottlenecks in the current artificial intelligence architectures in terms of latency, energy efficiency and computational power. To achieve this vision, it is of vital importance to scale up the PNNs and in the meantime reduce the high demand on the dimensions required by the PNNs. The underlying cause of this strategy is the enormous gap between the scales of photonic and electronic integrated circuits. Here, we demonstrate monolithically integrated optical convolutional processors on thin film lithium niobate (TFLN) to enable large-scale programmable convolution kernels and in turn greatly reduce the dimensions required by the subsequent fully connected layers. Experimental validation achieves high classification accuracies of 96%/86% on the MNIST/Fashion-MNIST datasets and 84.6% on the AG News dataset, while dramatically reducing the required subsequent fully connected layer dimensions to 196x10 (from 784x10) and 175x4 (from 800x4), respectively. Furthermore, our devices can be driven by commercial field-programmable gate array (FPGA) systems, a unique advantage in addition to their scalable channel number and kernel size, our architecture provides a solution to build practical machine learning photonic devices.</description>

      <title>Terahertz frequency conversion at plasma-induced time boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the frequency conversions of terahertz (THz) waves at ultrafast time boundaries created via femtosecond laser-induced air-to-plasma phase transitions. Our combined experimental and theoretical approach reveals that the abrupt change in refractive index at the ultrafast time boundaries drives both the red and blue shifts over the broadband THz spectrum due to the dispersive plasma, with distinctive amplitude variations. The present study contrasts these effects with those from spatial boundaries, highlighting the superior efficacy of temporal manipulations for spectral engineering. These findings not only deepen the understanding of light-matter interactions in time-varying media but also pave the way for innovative applications in THz technology and lay the groundwork for the observation of temporal reflection effects, photonic time crystals, and spatio-temporally modulated matter.</description>

      <title>Assessment of Intra-channel Fiber Nonlinearity Compensation in 200 GBaud and Beyond Coherent Optical Transmission Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate and assess the performance of intra-channel nonlinearity compensation (IC-NLC) in long-haul coherent optical transmission systems with a symbol rate of 200 GBaud and beyond. We first evaluate the potential gain of ideal IC-NLC in 4 THz systems by estimating the proportion of self-channel interference (SCI) using the split-step Fourier method (SSFM) based simulation with either lumped amplification or distributed amplification. As the symbol rate increases to 300 GBaud, the SCI proportion exceeds 65%. On the other hand, the non-deterministic polarization mode dispersion (PMD) will impact the effectiveness of IC-NLC, especially for ultra-high symbol rate systems. Therefore, we investigate the power spectral density of the residual nonlinear noise after ideal IC-NLC in the presence of PMD. The results indicate that the gain of ideal digital backpropagation (IDBP) decreases by 3.85 dB in 300 GBaud erbium-doped fiber amplifier (EDFA)-amplified links with a PMD parameter of 0.05 ps/km1/2, and 5.09 dB in distributed Raman amplifier (DRA)-amplified links. Finally, we evaluate the potential gains of practical IC-NLC in C-band wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) systems by employing the low-pass-filter assisted digital backpropagation (LDBP). As the symbol rate increases from 100 GBaud to 300 GBaud, the gain of 20-step-per-span (20-stps) LDBP increases from 0.53 dB to 0.87 dB for EDFA-amplified links, and from 0.89 dB to 1.30 dB for DRA-amplified links. Our quantitative results show that for 200 GBaud and beyond systems, there is a sizable gain to achieve by compensating for intra-channel nonlinearity even with a large non-deterministic PMD.</description>

      <title>Curved Apertures for Customized Wave Trajectories: Beyond Flat Aperture Limitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Beam shaping techniques enable tailored beam trajectories, offering unprecedented connectivity opportunities in wireless communications. Current approaches rely on flat apertures, which limit trajectory flexibility due to inherent geometric constraints. To overcome such restrictions, we propose adopting curved apertures as a more versatile alternative for beam shaping. We introduce a novel formulation for wave trajectory engineering compatible with arbitrarily shaped apertures. Theoretical and numerical analyses demonstrate that curved apertures offer improved control over wave propagation, are more resilient to phase control constraints, and achieve higher power density across a wider portion of the desired beam trajectory than flat apertures.</description>

      <title>Refractometry with filled antiresonant capillary fibers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate the realization of refractometric measurements relying on the study of the transmission spectrum of filled capillary fibers. In this method, the fiber is filled with a material with a lower refractive index than that of the capillary and, due to antiresonant guidance mechanism, a characteristic transmission spectrum alternating high and low attenuation regions is obtained. The refractive index data is hence extracted by analyzing the spectral positions of the fiber transmission bands. While this method holds broad applicability for diverse materials, we specifically applied this technique to characterize agarose gels, due to their interest as a promising optical material. By analyzing the transmission spectra across the 600-900 nm wavelength range, we determined the dispersion trend for agar gels prepared with varying water and glycerol concentrations and estimated their first-order Sellmeier coefficients. The reported refractometric method provides a simple and promising means for characterizing the dispersion properties of a wide range of materials, including gels, solids, and liquids, also opening new possibilities for the development of new refractive index sensing platforms.</description>

      <title>Subwavelength Phase Engineering Deep Inside Silicon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in three-dimensional laser writing have enabled direct nanostructuring deep within silicon, unlocking a volumetric design space previously inaccessible to surface-bound nanophotonic devices. Here, we introduce subwavelength phase engineering inside crystalline silicon, offering a novel strategy for integrated photonics. We design and numerically demonstrate a volumetric metaoptic monolithically embedded within the bulk, achieving full 2$\pi$ phase control at telecommunication wavelengths, with simulated transmission efficiencies reaching 90 %. The architecture is guided by a semi-analytical Fabry-Perot model and validated through full-wave simulations. Arrays of 250-nm-wide metaatoms spaced at 300-410 nm pitch yield a focusing efficiency of 70 %. With the wafer surface left pristine, this platform can potentially enable co-integration with electronics, MEMS/NEMS, and conventional metasurfaces. Moreover, the method is directly transferable to other transparent dielectrics compatible with ultrafast laser writing. These results establish a CMOS-compatible blueprint for three-dimensional nanophotonics and multi-level integration within the wafer.</description>

      <title>Blob Detection for Photonic Metasurface Designing: Angular and Spectral Control of Scattered Light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metasurfaces with precise spectral and angular control of light scattering are of growing interest for photonic applications requiring advanced photon management. Correlated disorder emerged as a promising route for angular control of light scattering, but most design approaches are computationally expensive or do not allow spectral tunability. Here, we introduce a reverse-engineering design approach for correlated-disordered metasurfaces based on tailoring the Fourier space and blob detection to create point distributions that are later "decorated" with individually designed nano-resonators or meta-atoms to tune the optical response for the desired functionality. We validate the control of the angular scattering by fabricating ensembles of Au nanopillars following our design and characterizing their angular scattering with Fourier microscopy. Using finite-difference time-domain simulations, we demonstrate how the choice of decorative unit tunes the spectral response, showcasing individual and independent control over light scattering in angular and spectral terms. Lastly, we expand the limits of our versatile approach by combining multiple metasurfaces in one, effectively adding their individual scattering characteristics. As such, we can address spectral and angular ranges independently, yielding a high degree of control of the scattering response.</description>

      <title>Towards direct nonlinear compression of energetic sub-nanosecond pulses to the ultrafast regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Applications of terawatt-class lasers can enormously benefit from pulse trains with kHz repetition rates. The associated unprecedented combinations of peak and average powers require the development of new concepts for scalable ultrashort pulse generation. We propose using multi-mirror multi-pass cells as a compact and cost-efficient solution for the direct post-compression of sub-nanosecond pulses into the femtosecond regime. We simulate spectral broadening of 100-mJ, 300-ps pulses to a sub-ps Fourier transform-limit in a 1-m diameter multi-pass cell. Furthermore, an 11-mirror cell for about 300 passes was set-up for proof-of-concept. To reach a spectral broadening factor of 15 in air, only 260 MW of peak power were required. The proposed scheme can efficiently transform industrially mature high-power, high-energy lasers into unique ultrafast sources.</description>

      <title>Spectral tuning of hyperbolic shear polaritons in monoclinic gallium oxide via isotopic substitution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hyperbolic phonon polaritons - hybridized modes arising from the ultrastrong coupling of infrared light to strongly anisotropic lattice vibrations in uniaxial or biaxial polar crystals - enable to confine light to the nanoscale with low losses and high directionality. In even lower symmetry materials, such as monoclinic $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ (bGO), hyperbolic shear polaritons (HShPs) further enhance the directionality. Yet, HShPs are intrinsically supported only within narrow frequency ranges defined by the phonon frequencies of the host material. Here, we report spectral tuning of HShPs in bGO by isotopic substitution. Employing near-field optical microscopy to image HShPs in $^{18}$O bGO films homo-epitaxially grown on a $^{16}$O bGO substrate, we demonstrate a spectral redshift of $\sim~40~$cm$^{-1}$ for the $^{18}$O bGO, compared to $^{16}$O bGO. The technique allows for direct observation and a model-free estimation of the spectral shift driven by isotopic substitution without the need for knowledge of the dielectric tensor. Complementary far-field measurements and ab initio calculations - in good agreement with the near-field data - confirm the effectiveness of this estimation. This multifaceted study demonstrates a significant isotopic substitution induced spectral tuning of HShPs into a previously inaccessible frequency range, creating new avenues for technological applications of such highly directional polaritons.</description>

      <title>Color and Transparency from Quantum Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The optical properties of solids are governed not only by their energy band dispersions but also by the quantum geometry of Bloch states. While the role of energy bands in determining the perceived optical appearance of materials, such as color and transparency, is well established, the influence of quantum geometry remains elusive. Here, we demonstrate that the color and transparency of materials can be direct manifestations of their underlying quantum geometry. To illustrate this principle, we employ quadratic band-touching models that allow us to tune only the geometric properties of Bloch states, while keeping the energy dispersion fixed. This decoupling reveals that modifying the wavefunction texture alone can lead to dramatic changes in the optical conductivity and, consequently, in the reflectance spectrum of the material. This results in distinct and controllable changes in perceived color. Similarly, we show that quantum geometry can govern the transparency of two-dimensional materials. Our findings demonstrate how quantum geometry shapes the visual appearance of materials, opening new avenues for tailoring color and transparency beyond traditional band structure design. This establishes quantum geometric engineering as a novel approach for manipulating materials with customized optical functionalities.</description>

Abstract: In many applications of spectrometry, a very high spectral resolution is of paramount importance for technologies such as wavelength division multiplexing, femtosecond laser pulse shaping, chemical analysis of gases, or astrophysics observations. A few techniques achieving such goal already exist as listed in the introducing paragraphs. In this article is described a long cavity spectral disperser that is likely to be integrated into a spectrometer and having the potential to attaining unsurpassed spectral resolving power equal to ten millions or more. The basic relations of its angular dispersion, free spectral range, resolving power, transmission and contrast are established and a preliminary optimized design is presented</description>

      <title>Information in 4D-STEM: Where it is, and How to Use it</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contrast transfer mechanisms for electron scattering have been extensively studied in transmission electron microscopy. Here we revisit H. Rose's generalized contrast formalism from scattering theory to understand where information is encoded in four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) data, and consequently identify new imaging modes that can also serve as crude but fast approximations to ptychography. We show that tilt correction and summation of the symmetric and antisymmetric scattering components within the bright-field disk -- corresponding to tilt-corrected bright field (tcBF) and tilt-corrected differential phase contrast (tcDPC) respectively -- enables aberration-corrected, bright-field phase contrast imaging (acBF) that makes maximal use of the 4D-STEM information under the weak phase object approximation (WPOA). Beyond the WPOA, we identify the contrast transfer from the interference between inelastic/plural scattering electrons, which show up as quadratic terms, and show that under overfocus conditions, contrast can be further enhanced at selected frequencies, similar to phase-contrast TEM imaging. There is also usable information encoded in the dark field region which we demonstrate by constructing a tilt-corrected dark-field image (tcDF) that sums up the incoherent scattering components and holds promise for depth sectioning of strong scatterers. This framework generalizes phase contrast theory in conventional/scanning transmission electron microscopy to 4D-STEM and provides analytical models and insights into full-field iterative ptychography, which blindly exploits all above contrast mechanisms.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate a monolithic coplanar stripline platform for on-chip terahertz (THz) generation, transmission, and detection, addressing key challenges of mode purity, bandwidth, and referencing. Capacitive coupling of the photoconductive generator switch enforces pure odd-mode propagation, increases THz field strength, and extends the operational frequency range, achieving 0.05-1.4 THz. Our architecture enables fully monolithic fabrication with amorphous silicon switches, in situ field referencing, and galvanic isolation between generation and detection. Finite-element simulations and experiments confirm that suppressing parasitic modes improves signal integrity, providing a robust platform for high-fidelity THz spectroscopy, ultrafast electronics, and nanoscale quantum materials research.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the time dependent Maxwell system in the sense of distributions in the context of temporal interfaces. Just as with spatial interfaces, electromagnetic waves at temporal interfaces scatter and create a transmitted and reflected wave. We provide a rigorous derivation of boundary conditions for the electric and magnetic fields at temporal interfaces with precise assumptions on the material parameters. In turn, we use this to obtain a general Snell's Law at such interfaces. From this, we obtain explicit formulas for the reflection and transmission coefficients. Unlike previous works, we do not make any simplifying ansatz on the solution to the Maxwell system, nor do we assume that the fields are smooth. We also consider material parameters which are not necessarily constant on either side of the temporal interface.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive characterization of nonlinear viscoelastic properties of arterial tissues using guided-wave optical coherence elastography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The mechanical properties of arterial walls are critical for maintaining vascular function under pulsatile pressure and are closely linked to the development of cardiovascular diseases. Despite advances in imaging and elastography, comprehensive characterization of the complex mechanical behavior of arterial tissues remains challenging. Here, we present a broadband guided-wave optical coherence elastography (OCE) technique, grounded in viscoelasto-acoustic theory, for quantifying the nonlinear viscoelastic, anisotropic, and layer-specific properties of arterial walls with high spatial and temporal resolution. Our results reveal a strong stretch dependence of arterial viscoelasticity, with increasing prestress leading to a reduction in tissue viscosity. Under mechanical loading, the adventitia becomes significantly stiffer than the media, attributable to engagement of collagen fibers. Chemical degradation of collagen fibers highlighted their role in nonlinear viscoelasticity. This study demonstrates the potential of OCE as a powerful tool for detailed profiling of vascular biomechanics, with applications in basic research and future clinical diagnosis.</description>

      <title>Poliazed Houston State Framework for Nonequilibrium Driven Open Quanum Sysmtes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new theoretical framework --the polarized Houston basis-- to model nonequilibrium dynamics in driven open quantum systems, formulated for use within the quantum master equation. This basis extends conventional Houston states by incorporating field-induced polarization effects, enabling a more accurate description of excitation dynamics under external driving. Using a one-dimensional dimer-chain model, we examine band population dynamics through projections onto polarized Houston states, original Houston states, and naive Bloch states. We find that the polarized Houston basis significantly suppresses spurious Bloch-state excitations and virtual transitions present in standard Houston approaches, allowing for a cleaner extraction of real excitations. When implemented in the relaxation time approximation of the quantum master equation, this formalism also yields a substantial reduction of unphysical DC currents in insulating systems. Our results highlight the polarized Houston basis as a powerful tool for simulating nonequilibrium phenomena in light-driven open quantum materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The theory of radiation of twisted photons in elliptical multifrequency undulators is developed. It is shown that helical multifrequency undulators can be employed as a bright and versatile source of photons in the states that are superpositions of the modes with definite projection of total angular momentum (TAM), amplitude, and relative phase. All these parameters of the state are readily controlled by the undulator design. The explicit expression for the amplitude of radiation of a twisted photon from a charged particle in the multifrequency undulator is derived. The energy spectrum of radiation and the selection rules for the TAM projection of radiated photons are described. The symmetry properties of the spectrum with respect to the TAM projection are established. The interpretation to the energy spectrum and to the selection rules is given in terms of virtual photons mediating between the charged particle and the undulator. The results obtained are also applicable to radiation of twisted photons produced by ultrarelativistic charged particles moving in plane multifrequency electromagnetic waves.</description>

Abstract: Single photons source (SPS) is a key component required by quantum communication devices. We report the finding of bright diamond-based SPS created by nature millions of years ago. It is shown that narrow ($\leq$ 2 nm) lines observed within the 500-800 nm range in photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the surface layer of untreated Yakut diamonds rich in nitrogen and hydrogen belong to SPS. Moreover, unknown narrow-line PL observed earlier in nitrogen- and hydrogen-rich diamonds from various deposits around the world are thought to be associated with SPS. Thus, the diamond rim, which until now was sent to the dumps or, at best, used as an abrasive powder, turned out to be a valuable material suitable for use in quantum technologies.</description>

Abstract: We present a theoretical polarization tomography scheme within the QIUP framework that directly extracts key sample parameters from measured interference visibilities and phase shifts. This approach establishes constant bindings for transmission amplitudes and coherence terms, thereby reducing the number of unknowns required to reconstruct the sample's Jones matrix. Our method is resource-efficient and well-suited for quantum imaging where probing and detection occur at different wavelengths, enabling robust, non-invasive characterization of complex samples.</description>

      <title>Superconducting flux concentrator coils for levitation of particles in the Meissner state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20795v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic levitation of superconductors is a promising platform to study quantum mechanics in the large-mass limit. One major limitation is the weak trapping potential, which results in low vibrational eigenfrequencies and increased susceptibility to low-frequency noise. While generating strong magnetic fields is relatively straightforward, creating a tightly confined harmonic potential - essentially achieving a large magnetic field gradient - remains a significant challenge. In this work, we demonstrate a potential solution using superconducting cores that concentrate magnetic flux into arbitrarily small volumes. We show the ability to trap superconducting particles using an anti-Helmholtz coil configuration incorporating these cores. However, we observe rapid damping of the levitated particle motion due to flux trapping within the cores, occurring once the lower critical field is exceeded locally. To investigate this mechanism, we employ diamond NV center magnetometry and detect substantial remanent fields persisting after high-current operation of the coils. Finally, we discuss possible strategies to mitigate this effect and improve the levitation properties.</description>

      <title>Phase structure of below-threshold harmonics in aligned molecules: a few-level model system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We utilize few-level model systems to analyze the polarization and phase properties of below-threshold harmonics (BTH) in aligned molecules. In a two-level system (TLS), we find that the phase of emitted harmonics undergoes a distinct change. For harmonics with photon energies below the transition between the dominant field-dressed states, the phase alternates by $\pi$ between successive odd harmonic orders but remains constant above. Exploiting this behavior, we construct a four-level model composed of two uncoupled TLS subsystems aligned along orthogonal directions. We demonstrate that with selected transition frequencies lower-order harmonics follow the polarization of the linearly polarized driving field while higher-order harmonics exhibit a mirrored polarization. The model predicts that aligned systems with orthogonal transition dipoles may show analogous phase and polarization features in the BTH regime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low Earth Orbit (LEO) optical satellite communication systems face performance challenges due to atmospheric effects such as scintillation, turbulence, wavefront distortion, beam spread, and jitter. This paper presents a comprehensive mathematical model to characterize these effects and their impact on signal propagation. We develop a methodology for dynamically calculating link budgets at any location and time by integrating these models into a probabilistic framework. The approach accounts for spatial and temporal variations in atmospheric conditions, enabling accurate estimation of link loss probabilities. Simulations validate the model's accuracy and applicability to real-world LEO satellite systems. This work offers a robust tool for optimizing link performance and enhancing the reliability of satellite networks, providing valuable insights for system designers and operators.</description>

Abstract: Snell's law dictates the phenomenon of light refraction at the interface between two media. Here, we demonstrate arbitrary programming of light refraction through an engineered material where the direction of the output wave can be set independently for different directions of the input wave, covering arbitrarily selected permutations of light refraction between the input and output apertures. Formed by a set of cascaded transmissive layers with optimized phase profiles, this refractive function generator (RFG) spans only a few tens of wavelengths in the axial direction. In addition to monochrome RFG designs, we also report wavelength-multiplexed refractive functions, where a distinct refractive function is implemented at each wavelength through the same engineered material volume, i.e., the permutation of light refraction is switched from one desired function to another function by changing the illumination wavelength. As experimental proofs of concept, we demonstrate permutation and negative refractive functions at the terahertz part of the spectrum using 3D-printed materials. Arbitrary programming of refractive functions enables new design capabilities for optical materials, devices and systems.</description>

Abstract: Solid-state spin-based quantum systems have emerged as popular platforms for quantum networking applications due to their optical interfaces, their long-lived quantum memories, and their natural compatibility with semiconductor manufacturing. Photonic crystal cavities are often used to enhance radiative emission; however, fabrication of the necessary subwavelength cavities is typically limited to small batch electron beam lithography. In this work, we demonstrate high quality factor, small mode volume nanobeam cavities fabricated on a scalable silicon photonic foundry platform. The foundry fabricated cavities are then interfaced with single erbium ions through backend deposition of TiO2 thin films lightly doped with erbium. Single ion lifetime measurements indicate Purcell enhancement up to about 500, thereby demonstrating a route toward manufacturable deterministic single photon sources in the telecom C-band.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22270v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The momentum of light in dielectric media has been a century-long controversy that continues to attract significant interest. In a linear dielectric medium with refractive index n, the momentum is predicted to be smaller by a factor of n according to Max Abraham, and larger by the same factor according to Hermann Minkowski. By studying the coupled dynamics of electromagnetic waves and dipoles in a dielectric medium, we show that the change in momentum of the dipole, expressed by the Lorentz force, corresponds to the Abraham momentum. On the other hand, the Minkowski momentum arises as the eigenvalue of the Hamiltonian and determines the direction of refraction in accordance with Snell's law. Our model also predicts a zitterbewegung-like oscillation due to helicity mixing between left- and right-handed wave components, mediated by dipole oscillation. These internal wave dynamics may be observable via wavepacket motion or polarization-sensitive measurements.</description>

Abstract: Photonic device development (PDD) has achieved remarkable success in designing and implementing new devices for controlling light across various wavelengths, scales, and applications, including telecommunications, imaging, sensing, and quantum information processing. PDD is an iterative, five-step process that consists of: i) deriving device behavior from design parameters, ii) simulating device performance, iii) finding the optimal candidate designs from simulations, iv) fabricating the optimal device, and v) measuring device performance. Classically, all these steps involve Bayesian optimization, material science, control theory, and direct physics-driven numerical methods. However, many of these techniques are computationally intractable, monetarily costly, or difficult to implement at scale. In addition, PDD suffers from large optimization landscapes, uncertainties in structural or optical characterization, and difficulties in implementing robust fabrication processes. However, the advent of machine learning over the past decade has provided novel, data-driven strategies for tackling these challenges, including surrogate estimators for speeding up computations, generative modeling for noisy measurement modeling and data augmentation, reinforcement learning for fabrication, and active learning for experimental physical discovery. In this review, we present a comprehensive perspective on these methods to enable machine-learning-assisted PDD (ML-PDD) for efficient design optimization with powerful generative models, fast simulation and characterization modeling under noisy measurements, and reinforcement learning for fabrication. This review will provide researchers from diverse backgrounds with valuable insights into this emerging topic, fostering interdisciplinary efforts to accelerate the development of complex photonic devices and systems.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic Insight Drives Multimodal Light_Field Dynamics via Streamline Engineering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07928v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Since the 1970s, analogies between laser dynamics and fluid systems have provided insight into phenomena such as chaos, multistability, and turbulence. Building on this perspective, we model the optical field as an energy fluid and interpret Poynting-vector trajectories as energy streamlines, yielding a unified, three_dimensional map of light's free-space dynamics. By sculpting these streamlines, we develop an approach to talior vortex-beam propagation dynamics that suppresses both diffraction- and OAM-induced broadening. Extending this method to general structured modes, we enable a single field to exhibit customizable multimodal dynamics that integrate features from primary structured light families: the diffraction-free, self-healing behavior of Bessel beams; the tunable self-similarity of Laguerre-Gaussian beams and adjustable self-acceleration of Airy beams. Additionally, it allows for adjustable propagating energy-density profiles to counteract losses. Optical-tweezer experiments,analogous to particle-tracking velocimetry in fluid dynamics, show that trapped microspheres closely follow the designed streamlines, validating the streamline geometries and indicating a potential route toward precision 3D optomechanical control. In a proof-of-principle free-space communication experiment, vortex beams with customized multimodal dynamics demonstrate several improvements, including more independent channels, reduced turbulence-induced mode scattering, and robust non-line-of-sight transmission. Together, the streamline-engineering approach offers a unified and adaptable strategy for tailoring light's propagation dynamics, with potential applications in precision optomechanics, optofluidics, and advanced optical networking.</description>

Abstract: Barium titanate (BTO) has been experiencing a surge of interest for integrated photonics technologies because of its large nonlinear optical coefficients, especially the Pockels coefficient, and in part due to newly available thin-film substrates. In this work, we report on the development of a redeposition-free dry etching technique for monolithic BTO-on-insulator photonics, that produces very low-roughness and high-verticality waveguides. Using this, we experimentally demonstrate the first BTO microresonators with intrinsic Q-factor $&gt; 1$ million, and waveguide propagation loss as small as 0.32 dB/cm, representing the lowest losses reported in any BTO-based integrated platform to date. We additionally demonstrate Mach-Zehnder amplitude modulators with $V_{\pi}L = 0.54$ V$\cdot$cm and effective electro-optic coefficient $r_\text{eff} = 162$ pm/V.</description>

      <title>Synthetic-lattice Bloch wave dynamics in a single-mode microwave resonator</title>

Abstract: Frequency-based synthetic dimensions are a promising avenue for expanding the dimensionality of photonic systems. In this work, we show how a tilted synthetic lattice is naturally realised by periodically modulating a single-mode resonator under a coherent monochromatic drive. We theoretically study the Bloch wave dynamics in the tilted synthetic lattice, which gives rise to peculiar features in the spectral distribution of the cavity field. Our predictions are experimentally confirmed using a planar tunable superconducting microwave resonator.</description>

      <title>Signatures of cubic gravity in the strong regime</title>

Abstract: We investigate the effects of Einsteinian cubic gravity in the strong gravitational regime. In the first part, we explore analytical solutions for a static, spherically symmetric metric, establishing the existence of maximally symmetric de Sitter solutions, as well as asymptotically de Sitter solutions, with an effective cosmological constant. We also study, analytically and numerically, how the horizon properties are affected by cubic gravity. Our results reveal that a positive coupling constant reduces the horizon size, while a negative one increases it. In the second part, we analyze potential observational signatures of cubic terms, focusing on their effects on the bending of light. Specifically, we investigate the angular difference, related to the deflection angle but valid near the source, along with the behavior of the photon sphere. Our findings show that the strongest effects of the cubic terms occur in the strong gravity regime, and there exists a direct relationship between the value of the coupling constant and the photon sphere position, opening up the possibility to constrain cubic gravity with black hole shadows.</description>

      <title>Probing plexciton dynamics with higher-order spectroscopy</title>

Abstract: Coupling molecular transition dipole moments to surface-plasmon polaritons (SPPs) results in the formation of new optical quasiparticles, i.e., plexcitons. Mixing the specific properties of matter excitations and light modes has proven to be an efficient strategy to alter a variety of molecular processes ranging from chemical reactions to exciton transport. Here, we investigate energy transfer in a plexcitonic system of zinc phthalocyanine (ZnPc) molecules aggregated in the crystalline {\alpha}-phase and an SPP on a planar gold surface. By tuning the angle of incidence, we vary the degree of mixing between excitonic and SPP character of the excited state. We apply our recently developed higher-order pump-probe spectroscopy to separate the system's fifth-order signal describing the dynamics of two-particle interactions. The time it takes for two quasiparticles to meet and annihilate is a measure of their movement and thus the transport of excitation energy in the system. We find that the transport extracted from the fifth-order signal is surprisingly unaffected by the mixing ratio of exciton and SPP contributions of the plexciton. Using a rate equation model, we explain this behavior by fast transition from the plexcitonic states to many localized excitonic dark states that do not have an SPP contribution. Our results give an indication of how hybrid exciton-plasmon systems should be designed to exploit the delocalization of the involved plasmon modes for improved transport.</description>

      <title>Accurate Prediction of Tensorial Spectra Using Equivariant Graph Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04862v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optical spectroscopies provide a powerful tool for harnessing light-matter interactions for unraveling complex electronic features such as the flat bands and nontrivial topologies of materials. These insights are crucial for the development and optimization of optoelectronic devices, including solar cells, light-emitting diodes, and photodetectors, where device performance is closely connected with the nature of the underlying electronic spectrum. Realistic modeling of tensor optical responses in materials, which are computationally quite demanding, however, remains challenging. Here we introduce the Tensorial Spectra Equivariant Neural Network (TSENN), which is a equivariant graph neural network architecture that maps crystal structures directly to their full photon-frequency-dependent optical tensors. By encoding the isotropic sequential scalar components along with the anisotropic sequential tensor components into l = 0 and l = 2 spherical tensor components, TSENN ensures symmetry-aware predictions that are consistent with the constraints of crystalline symmetries of materials. Trained on a dataset of frequency-dependent permittivity tensors of 1,432 bulk semiconductors computed using first-principles methods, our model achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of 21.181 millifarads per meter (mF/m), demonstrating its potential for efficient modeling of other related properties such as the optical conductivities. Our framework opens new avenues for rational data-driven design of anisotropic optical responses for accelerating materials discovery for advancing optoelectronic applications.</description>

      <title>Enhanced energy gain through higher-order resonances during direct laser acceleration with superluminal phase velocity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10669v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ultra-high intensity laser-plasma interactions can produce ultra-relativistic electrons via direct laser acceleration, assisted by quasi-static plasma magnetic and electric fields. These fields transversely confine electron motion and induce betatron oscillations. The net energy gain is strongly influenced by the interplay between two frequencies: the betatron frequency and the frequency of laser field oscillations experienced by the electron. Prior work has shown that energy gain is enabled by a resonance between the betatron oscillations and the oscillations of the laser field. In particular, higher-order resonances occur when the laser field completes multiple cycles during one betatron oscillation, allowing additional regimes of energy transfer beyond the fundamental (betatron) resonance. In this work, we demonstrate that such resonances become particularly effective when the laser's phase velocity is superluminal. Although the two frequencies generally evolve differently with increasing electron energy, which leads to detuning, a superluminal phase velocity introduces a non-monotonic frequency ratio with a global minimum. This minimum allows sustained frequency matching over a broad energy range, thereby enabling enhanced energy gain. As the phase velocity increases, the betatron resonance becomes ineffective due to premature frequency detuning. At the same time, higher-order resonances become increasingly effective, emerging as the dominant mechanisms for enhanced energy gain in this regime of direct laser acceleration.</description>

      <title>Permutationally-Invariant N-body gates via Tavis-Cummings Hamiltonian</title>

Abstract: Widely used in atomic and superconducting qubit systems, the Jaynes-Cummings (JC) Hamiltonian is a simple, yet powerful model for a two-level system interacting with a quantum harmonic oscillator. In this paper, we focus on a system of n qubits, identically coupled to a single oscillator via JC interaction, also known as the Tavis-Cummings (TC) Hamiltonian. We show that all permutationally-invariant unitaries on an arbitrary number of qubits can be realized using this permutationally-invariant Hamiltonian, which couples the qubits to an oscillator initialized in its vacuum state, together with global uniform x and z fields on all qubits. This includes useful gates, such as controlled-Z gate with an arbitrary number of control qubits. As a corollary, we find that all permutationally invariant states -- including useful entangled states such as GHZ and Dicke states -- can be prepared using this interaction and global fields. We also characterize unitaries that can be realized on the joint Hilbert space of the qubits and oscillator with the TC interaction and global z field, and develop new methods for preparing the state of the oscillator in an arbitrary initial state. We present various examples of explicit circuits for the case of n=2 qubits. In particular, we develop new methods for implementing controlled-Z, SWAP, iSWAP, and $\sqrt{i\text{SWAP}}$ gates using only the TC interaction and a global z field. Our work also reveals an accidental symmetry in the TC Hamiltonian and shows that it can be explained using Schwinger's oscillator model of angular momentum.</description>

      <title>Fluctuation-induced Hall-like lateral forces in a chiral-gain environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14754v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Here, we demonstrate that vacuum fluctuations can induce lateral forces on a small particle positioned near a translation-invariant uniform non-Hermitian substrate with chiral gain. This type of non-Hermitian response can be engineered by biasing a low-symmetry conductor with a static electric field and is rooted in the quantum geometry of the material through the Berry curvature dipole. The chiral-gain material acts as an active medium for a particular circular polarisation handedness, while serving as a passive, dissipative medium for the other polarisation handedness. Owing to the nonreciprocity and gain characteristics, momentum is continuously exchanged in a preferred direction parallel to the surface between the test particle and the surrounding electromagnetic field, giving rise to lateral forces. Interestingly, the force can be viewed as a fluctuation-induced drag linked to the nonlinear Hall current. Indeed, although the gain is driven by an electric current, the resulting force acts perpendicular to the bias -- unlike conventional current-drag effects. This effect stems from the skewed propagation characteristics of surface modes and gain-momentum locking. Our theory reveals a Hall-like asymmetry in the field correlations and establishes a novel link between quantum geometry and fluctuation-induced phenomena, offering new possibilities for nanoscale control via tailored electromagnetic environments.</description>
