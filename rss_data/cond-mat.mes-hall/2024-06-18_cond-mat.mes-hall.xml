      <title>Excitonic topology and quantum geometry in organic semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Excitons drive the optoelectronic properties of organic semiconductors which underpin devices including solar cells and light-emitting diodes. We demonstrate that excitons can exhibit topologically non-trivial states and identify a family of organic semiconductors exhibiting the predicted excitonic topological phases. We also show that the topological phase can be controlled through chemical functionalisation and through the dielectric environment of the material. Appealing to quantum Riemannian geometry, we predict that topologically non-trivial excitons have a lower bound on their centre-of-mass spatial spread, which can significantly exceed the size of a unit cell. The discovery of excitonic topology and excitonic Riemannian geometry in organic materials brings together two mature fields and suggests many new possibilities for a range of future optoelectronic applications.</description>

      <title>Elf autoencoder: unsupervised exploration of flat-band materials using electronic band structure fingerprints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional materials with flat electronic bands are promising for realizing exotic quantum phenomena such as unconventional superconductivity and nontrivial topology, but exploring their vast chemical space remains challenging. Here, we introduce an unsupervised convolutional autoencoder agent (elf) that operates on electronic band structure images and is capable of mapping band features and extracting the latent space representation as a fingerprint, enabling autonomous clustering of materials with common electronic properties beyond traditional chemical paradigms. Unsupervised visualisation of the latent space then helps to uncover hidden chemical trends and identify promising candidates based on similarities to well-studied exemplars. Our framework paves the way for the accelerated discovery of novel flat-band materials with desirable electronic characteristics. It complements high-throughput ab initio methods by rapidly screening candidates and guides further investigations into the mechanisms governing the emergence of flat-band physics. We believe the elf autoencoder will be a valuable tool for the autonomous discovery of previously unexplored flat-band materials, aiding in the unbiased identification of compounds with desirable electronic properties in vast 2D chemical space.</description>

      <title>Inevitable First Order Phase Transitions in 3D Quantum Hall Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent experiments suggest that low carrier density three-dimensional (3D) metals ZrTe$_5$ and HfTe$_5$ exhibit the 3D quantum Hall (QH) effect with Hall resistivity plateaus and a metal-insulator transition in strong magnetic fields. The conventional 3D QH theory requires a fixed period charge density wave (CDW), which is however not observed experimentally. We investigate alternative non-CDW mechanisms by considering a 3D metal in strong magnetic fields with electrons coupled to a boson (e.g., phonon) field. We show that the model exhibits inevitable first order phase transitions at jumps of the number of occupied Landau level bands, which do not involve CDW. These transitions may drive the system into a phase separation state with percolation transitions. We further show this can lead to Hall resistivity quasi-plateaus similar to that observed experimentally, and can provide a natural explanation for the metal-insulator transition.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear photocurrent in quantum materials for broadband photodetection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unlocking the vast potential of optical sensing technology has long been hindered by the challenges of achieving fast, sensitive, and broadband photodetection at ambient temperatures. In this review, we summarize recent progress in the study of nonlinear photocurrent in topological quantum materials, and its application in broadband photodetection without the use of p-n junction based semiconductor diodes. The intrinsic quadratic transverse current-input voltage relation is used to rectify the alternating electric field from incident radio, terahertz or infrared waves into a direct current, without a bias voltage and at zero magnetic field. We review novel photocurrents in several material systems, including topological Weyl semimetals, chiral crystals, ferroelectric materials, and low dimensional topological insulators. These quantum materials hold tremendous promise for broadband high-frequency rectification and photodetection, featuring substantial responsivity and detectivity.</description>

      <title>Identifying trivial and Majorana zero-energy modes using the Majorana polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we consider superconductor-semiconductor hybrids containing both trivial and Majorana zero modes and explore their signatures in the Majorana polarization. In particular, we consider trivial zero energy states due to confinement and disorder, which seem to be very likely experimental scenarios. We show that the Majorana polarization is able to characterize the topological phase transition as well as the emergence of Majorana zero modes even when trivial zero-energy states proliferate. Notably, the Majorana polarization inherits direct information about spatial correlations which are then the key for distinguishing Majorana and trivial zero-modes. We demonstrate the utility of the Majorana polarization in normal-superconductor junctions and superconductor-normal-superconductor Josephson junctions. Our results support the interpretation of the Majorana polarization as a real space topological indicator.</description>

      <title>Many-Body Quantum Geometric Dipole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collective excitations of many-body electron systems can carry internal structure, tied to the quantum geometry of the Hilbert space in which they are embedded. This has been shown explicitly for particle-hole-like excitations, which carry a ``quantum geometric dipole'' (QGD) that is essentially an electric dipole moment associated with the state. We demonstrate in this work that this property can be formulated in a generic way, which does not require wavefunctions expressed in terms of single particle-hole states. Our formulation exploits the density matrix associated with a branch of excitations that evolves continuously with its momentum ${\bf K}$, from which one may extract single-particle states allowing a construction of the QGD. We demonstrate the formulation using the single-mode approximation for excited states of two quantum Hall systems: the first for an integrally filled Landau level, and the second for a fractional quantum Hall state at filling factor $\nu=1/m$, with $m$ an odd integer. In both cases we obtain the same result for the QGD, which can be attributed to the translational invariance assumed of the system. Our study demonstrates that the QGD is an intrinsic property of collective modes which is valid beyond approximations one might make for their wavefunctions.</description>

      <title>Observation of Temperature Independent Anomalous Hall Effect in Thin Bismuth from Near Absolute Zero to 300 K Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report our discovery of a temperature independent anomalous Hall effect (AHE) from 15 mK to 300 K temperature occurring in a 68 nm thick transport device made out of pure bismuth. This surprising behaviour is accompanied with an expected temperature dependent longitudinal resistance consistent with semi-metallic bismuth, however it surprisingly showed no hint of a magnetoresistance for magnetic fields between $\pm30$ T. Even though bismuth is a diamagnetic material which {\it a priori} does not break time-reversal symmetry (TRS), our analysis of the reconstructed conductivities points towards the AHE to be of the intrinsic type, which does not emanate from magnetic impurities. Finally, as pure bismuth has been shown numerically to host a Berry curvature at its surface which breaks inversion symmetry, we propose it as a possible explanation for the temperature independent AHE observed here.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The unveiling of 2D van der Waals magnetism in 2017 ignited a surge of interest in low-dimensional magnetism. With dimensions reduced, research has delved into facile electric control of 2D magnetism, high-quality heterostructure design, and new device functionality. These atomically thin magnetic materials have spawned a burgeoning field known as 2D spintronics, holding immense promise for future quantum technologies. In this review, we comprehensively survey the current advancements in 2D magnet-based quantum devices, accentuating their role in manifesting exotic properties and enabling novel functionalities. Topological states, spin torques, voltage control of magnetic anisotropy, strain engineering, twistronics and designer interface will be discussed. Furthermore, we offer an outlook to guide their development in future CMOS and quantum hardware paradigms.</description>

      <title>Moir\'e flat bands and antiferroelectric domains in lattice relaxed twisted bilayer hexagonal boron nitride under perpendicular electric fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Local interlayer charge polarization of twisted bilayer hexagonal boron nitride (t2BN) is calculated and parametrized as a function of twist angle and perpendicular electric fields through tight-binding calculations on lattice relaxed geometries Lattice relaxations tend to increase the bandwidth of the nearly flat bands, where widths smaller than 1 meV are expected for angle less than 1.08 degree for parallel BN/BN alignment, and for angle less than 1.5 degree for the antiparallel BN/NB alignment. Local interlayer charge polarization maxima of 2.6 pC/m corresponding are expected at the AB and BA stacking sites of BN/BN aligned t2BN in the long moire period limit for angle less than 1 degree, and evolves non-monotonically with a maximum of 3.5 pC/m at angle equal to 1.6 degree before reaching 2 pC/m for angle equal to 6 degree. The electrostatic potential maxima due to the t2BN are overall enhanced by 20 percentage with respect to the rigid system assuming potential modulation depths of up to 300 mV near its surface. In BN/BN aligned bilayers the relative areas of the AB or BA local stacking regions can be expanded or reduced through a vertical electric field depending on its sign.</description>

      <title>Observation of stacking engineered magnetic phase transitions within moir\'e supercells of twisted van der Waals magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Twist engineering of magnetic van der Waals (vdW) moir\'e superlattices provides an attractive way to achieve precise nanoscale control over the spin degree of freedom on two-dimensional flatland. Despite the very recent demonstrations of moir\'e magnetism featuring exotic phases with noncollinear spin order in twisted vdW magnet chromium triiodide CrI3, the local magnetic interactions, spin dynamics, and magnetic phase transitions within and across individual moir\'e supercells remain elusive. Taking advantage of a scanning single-spin magnetometry platform, here we report observation of two distinct magnetic phase transitions with separate critical temperatures within a moir\'e supercell of small-angle twisted double trilayer CrI3. By measuring temperature dependent spin fluctuations at the coexisting ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic regions in twisted CrI3, we explicitly show that the Curie temperature of the ferromagnetic state is higher than the N\'eel temperature of the antiferromagnetic one by ~10 K. Our mean-field calculations attribute such a spatial and thermodynamic phase separation to the stacking order modulated interlayer exchange coupling at the twisted interface of the moir\'e superlattices. The presented results highlight twist engineering as a promising tuning knob to realize on-demand control of not only the nanoscale spin order of moir\'e quantum matter but also its dynamic magnetic responses, which may find relevant applications in developing transformative vdW electronic and magnetic devices.</description>

Abstract: Systems of atoms or molecules can possess nonzero total spins that can be employed in spintronics, for instance for creating memory devices, which requires to be able to efficiently regulate spin directions. This article presents some methods of regulating spin dynamics, developed by the authors. These methods can be applied for different physical systems, described by different Hamiltonians including the interactions of spins with magnetic fields. The principal feature of the methods is the use of the feedback fields formed by moving spins.</description>

      <title>Composite Topological Weyl Nodal lines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nodal lines are one-dimensional topological features of semi-metal band structures along which two bands are degenerate as a result of non-accidental symmetry-protected crossings, and behave topologically as $k$-space vortices in the Berry connection. Here, we present a new class of tilted nodal lines, protected by mirror symmetry, formed from the intersection of three band crossings at a set of critical points. One crossing is gapped out, fusing the remaining two crossings at the shifted critical points to form composite nodal lines. We demonstrate these composite nodal lines are capable of supporting fundamentally different Berry curvature textures than the typical two-band case, despite having a simple ring topology. In addition, we present a realistic model based on cubic, forced-ferromagnetic, EuTiO$_3$, where the spin and orbital degrees of freedom are plentiful enough to allow the material realization of such composite nodal lines. In this system, the composite nature of the nodal line results in a spin Hall conductivity with a non-monotonic dependence on carrier concentration.</description>

      <title>Phase-controlled heat modulation with Aharonov-Bohm interferometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A heat modulator is proposed based on a voltage-biased Aharonov-Bohm interferometer. Once an electrical bias is applied, Peltier effects give rise to a flow of heat that can be modulated by a magnetic flux. We determine the corresponding temperature changes using a simple thermal model. Our calculations demonstrate that the modulated temperature difference can be as large as 80 mK at base temperature about 600 mK with relative temperature variations reaching 10\%. Our model also predicts, quite generally, the emergence of spin-polarized heat flows without any ferromagnetic contacts, if Rashba spin-orbit interaction is combined with the applied magnetic flux, which potentially paves the way towards caloritronic information processing.</description>

      <title>Plasmons in two-dimensional electron systems with infinite and semi-infinite metal gratings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analytically investigate the plasmons propagating in a homogeneous two-dimensional (2D) electron system, along the metal grating in the form of a periodic array of strip-shaped electrodes (gates) in the vicinity of the 2D system. We show that in the case of semi-infinite grating, the Tamm plasmon modes localized near and propagating along the grating edge can exist in the gaps of the plasmonic band structure provided that the last gate differs in width from the other gates. When the last gate is wider, the spectrum of the fundamental Tamm plasmon mode lies in the lowest frequency gap, below the first plasmonic band. Importantly, we find the mode to exist in this case only for finite values of the wave vector along the grating. Otherwise, if the width of the last gate is smaller, the Tamm plasmon modes occupy higher frequency gaps, and delocalized plasmons from the first frequency band become the lowest frequency excitations.</description>

      <title>Spectral analysis of the magnetooptical response in valley polarized Pb$_{1-x}$Sn$_x$Se</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the last century, considerable efforts have been devoted to the study of valley-degenerate narrow gap semiconductors, such as the Pb$_{1-x}$Sn$_x$Se alloy. This material possesses band minima at the $L$-points of their Brillouin zone, yielding a valley degeneracy of four. However, in (111)-oriented films, it is still not fully understood how differences between the longitudinal valley, oriented along the growth axis, and the oblique valleys, oriented at an angle with respect to that axis, appear in magneto-optical infrared spectroscopy. In this work, we report a magnetooptical study on this family of alloys, focusing on an anomaly in the interband transition of the peak intensity ratio of longitudinal and oblique valleys under a magnetic field applied along the [111] direction. Based on the Mitchell-Wallis model, we provide a theoretical fit for the experimental transmission data, which quantitatively explains the spectral shape of the data at magnetic fields as high as 35T. In particular, we attribute this anomalous peak intensity variation to the carrier density difference between the two types of valleys as well as the field-dependent thin-film interference. Our analysis also allows for the extraction of the real and imaginary parts of the dielectric function.</description>

      <title>Mechanism to transfer linear momentum from a Surface Acoustic Wave to a Magnetic Domain Wall</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surface Acoustic Waves (SAW) have been used frequently in spintronic applications, mostly to decrease the magnetic field or the electric current required to move magnetic domain walls (DW). Because the SAW cannot achieve magnetic switching without the assistance of a magnetic field or a current, for a marginal improvement in the energy required for the magnetic switching, the device gains in complexity, making it impractical. In this work, we report a mechanism that allows a transfer of linear momentum from the acoustic wave to the magnetic domain wall. Experimentally we show that, using the appropriate dimensions of the magnetic strip, the SAW can move the DW in the same direction as the traveling SAW. With the help of micromagnetic simulations, we reveal a complex yet direct mechanism that allows the SAW to push the DW in the same direction of its travel, even without any external field or currents. The DW can reach velocities in the range of 100 m/s and at a very small energetic cost, equivalent to using a current density of $\sim 5 \cdot 10^4 A/cm^2$ if the movement was triggered by spin transfer. This new mechanism opens the door to designing innovative spintronic devices where the magnetization can be controlled exclusively by an acoustic wave.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10159v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We simulate quench dynamics of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) chain on the IBM quantum computers, calculating the R\'enyi entanglement entropy, the twist order parameter and the Berry phase. The latter two quantities can be deduced from a slow-twist operator defined in the Lieb-Schultz-Mattis theorem. The R\'enyi entropy is obtained using a recently developed randomized measurement scheme. The twist order parameter and the Berry phase are measured without the need for additional gates or ancilla qubits. We consider quench protocols in which a trivial initial state evolves dynamically in time under the topological SSH Hamiltonian in the fully dimerized limit (the flat-band limit). During these quenches, there are persistent and periodic oscillations in the time evolution of both entanglement entropy and twist order parameter. Through the implementation of error mitigation techniques using a global depolarizing ansatz and postselection, our simulations on the IBM devices yield results that closely match exact solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11953v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The negatively charged boron vacancy ($\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{B}}^-$) in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) has garnered significant attention among defects in two-dimensional materials. This owes, in part, to its deterministic generation, well-characterized atomic structure, and optical polarizability at room temperature. We investigate the latter through extensive measurements probing both the ground and excited state polarization dynamics. We develop a semiclassical model based on these measurements that predicts a near-unity degree of spin polarization, surpassing other solid-state spin defects under ambient conditions. Building upon our model, we include the presence of nuclear spin degrees of freedom adjacent to the $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{B}}^-$ and perform a comprehensive set of Lindbladian numerics to investigate the hyperfine-induced polarization of the nuclear spins. Our simulations predict a number of important features that emerge as a function of magnetic field which are borne out by experiment.</description>

      <title>Controlled Erasure as a Building Block for Universal Thermodynamically-Robust Superconducting Computing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12153v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reducing the energy inefficiency of conventional CMOS-based computing devices -- which rely on logically irreversible gates to process information -- remains both a fundamental engineering challenge and a practical social challenge of increasing importance. In this work, we extend an alternative computing paradigm which utilizes distributions of microstates to store information in the metastable minima determined by an effective potential energy landscape. These minima serve as mesoscopic memory states which are manipulated by a dynamic landscape to perform information processing. Central to our results is the control erase (CE) protocol, which manipulates the landscape's metastable minima to control whether information is preserved or erased. Importantly, successive executions of this protocol can implement a NAND gate -- a logically-irreversible universal logic gate. We show how to practically implement this in a device created by two inductively coupled superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs). We identify circuit parameter ranges that give rise to effective CEs and characterize the protocol's robustness by comparing relevant protocol timescales. Due to their superconducting operational temperatures, performing optimized CEs with SQUIDs can serve as a platform for highly energy-efficient universal computation.</description>

Abstract: We report a study of disorder-dependent quantum geometry in topological systems. Thanks to the development of an efficient linear-scaling numerical methodology based on the kernel polynomial method, we can explore the nontrivial behavior of the quantum geometry metrics (quantum metric and Chern number) in large-scale inhomogeneous systems, accounting for the presence of disorder. We illustrate this approach in the disordered Haldane model, examining the impact of Anderson and vacancy-type of disorders on the trivial and topological phases captured by this model.</description>

Abstract: The epitaxial growth of complex oxides enables the production of high-quality films, yet substrate choice is restricted to certain symmetry and lattice parameters, thereby limiting the technological applications of epitaxial oxides. In comparison, the development of free-standing oxide membranes gives opportunities to create novel heterostructures by non-epitaxial stacking of membranes, opening new possibilities for materials design. Here, we introduce a method for writing, with atomic precision, ionically bonded crystalline material across the gap between an oxide membrane and a carrier substrate. The process involves a thermal pre-treatment, followed by localized exposure to the raster scan of a scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) beam. STEM imaging and electron energy-loss spectroscopy show that we achieve atomically sharp interface reconstructions between a 30 nm-thick SrTiO${_3}$ membrane and a niobium-doped SrTiO${_3}$(001)-oriented carrier substrate. These findings indicate new strategies for fabricating synthetic heterostructures with novel structural and electronic properties.</description>

      <title>Realizing string-net condensation: Fibonacci anyon braiding for universal gates and sampling chromatic polynomials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fibonacci string-net condensate, a complex topological state that supports non-Abelian anyon excitations, holds promise for fault-tolerant universal quantum computation. However, its realization by a static-lattice Hamiltonian has remained elusive due to the inherent high-order interactions demanded. Here, we introduce a scalable dynamical string-net preparation (DSNP) approach, suitable even for near-term quantum processors, that can dynamically prepare the state through reconfigurable graphs. DSNP enables the creation and manipulation of the Fibonacci string-net condensate (Fib-SNC). Using a superconducting quantum processor, we couple the DSNP approach with a composite error-mitigation strategy on deep circuits to successfully create, measure, and braid Fibonacci anyons in two spatial dimensions (2D) demonstrating their potential for universal quantum computation. To this end, we measure anyon charges for two species of anyons associated with the doubled topological quantum field theory underlying Fid-SNC, with an average experimental accuracy of 94%. We validate that a scalable 2D braiding operation on a logical qubit encoded on three anyons yields the golden ratio $\phi$ with 98% average accuracy and 8% measurement uncertainty. We further sample the Fib-SNC wavefunction to estimate the chromatic polynomial at $\phi+2$ for various graphs. Given the established computational hardness of the chromatic polynomial, the wavefunction amplitude is classically hard to evaluate. Our results establish the first proof of principle that scalable DSNP can open doors to fault-tolerant universal quantum computation and to classically-hard problems.</description>

      <title>Theory of Coulomb driven nematicity in a multi-valley two-dimensional electron gas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12825v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The properties of a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) in a semiconductor host with two valleys related by an underlying $C_4$ rotational symmetry are studied using Hartree-Fock (HF) and various other many-body approaches. A familiar artifact of the HF approach is a degeneracy between the valley polarized - ``Ising nematic'' - and spin polarized - ferromagnetic - phases, which is inconsistent with recent variational Monte Carlo (VMC) results. Correlation effects, computed either within the random phase approximation (RPA) or the T-matrix approximation, enhance the valley susceptibility relative to the spin susceptibility. Extrapolating the results to finite interaction strength, we find a direct first-order transition from a symmetry-unbroken state to a spin unpolarized Ising nematic fluid with full valley polarization, in qualitative agreement with VMC. The RPA results are also reminiscent of experiments on the corresponding 2DEG in AlAs heterostructures.</description>

Abstract: Identification of a non-trivial $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ index in a spinful two dimensional insulator indicates the presence of an odd, quantized (pseudo)spin-resolved Chern number, $C_{s}=(C_{\uparrow}-C_{\downarrow})/2$. However, the statement is not biconditional. An odd spin-Chern number can survive when the familiar $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ index vanishes. Identification of solid-state systems hosting an odd, quantized $C_{s}$ and trivial $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ index is a pressing issue due to the potential for such insulators to admit band gaps optimal for experiments and quantum devices. Nevertheless, they have proven elusive due to the computational expense associated with their discovery. In this work, a neural network capable of identifying the spin-Chern number is developed and used to identify the first solid-state systems hosting a trivial $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ index and odd $C_{s}$. We demonstrate the potential of one such system, Ti$_{2}$CO$_{2}$, to support Majorana corner modes via the superconducting proximity effect.</description>

Abstract: Magnetotransport phenomena in high-quality quantum wells often shed a light on the nature of microscopic states of two-dimensional electrons in these systems. In particular, the independence of photoresistance on the polarization helicity of incident radiation have been treated an important puzzling result, which had no well-established explanation up to now. Here we propose a theoretical model of dynamics of a strongly non-ideal two-dimensional electron liquid in moderate magnetic fields. In this system, in particular, successive collisions of electrons joined in pairs are as important as single collisions of statistically independent electrons. The resulting fluid photoresistance exhibits an irregular shape of magnetooscillations, the absence of the dependence on the helicity of the circular polarization of incident radiation, and a large peak near the doubled cyclotron frequency. All these effects were observed in experiments on best-quality GaAs quantum wells. We conclude that 2D electrons in such nanostructures in moderate magnetic fields form a novel type of highly correlated fluids.</description>

Abstract: The complexity of electronic band structures in quantum materials offers new charge-neutral degrees of freedom stable for transport, a promising example being the valley (axial) degree of freedom in Weyl semimetals (WSMs). A noninvasive probe of their transport properties is possible by exploiting the frequency dependence of the magnetic noise generated in the vicinity of the material. In this work, we investigate the magnetic noise generically associated with diffusive transport using a systematic Langevin approach. Taking a minimal model of magnetic WSMs for demonstration, we show that thermal fluctuations of the charge current, the valley current, and the magnetic order can give rise to magnetic noise with distinctively different spectral characters, which provide a theoretical guidance to separate their contributions. Our approach is extendable to the study of magnetic noise and its spectral features arising from other transport degrees of freedom in quantum materials.</description>

Abstract: The Kitaev model on a honeycomb lattice may provide a robust topological quantum memory platform, but finding a material that realizes the unique spin liquid phase remains a considerable challenge. We demonstrate that an effective Kitaev Hamiltonian can arise from a half-filled Fermi-Hubbard Hamiltonian where each site can experience a magnetic field in a different direction. As such, we provide a method for realizing the Kitaev spin liquid on a single hexagonal plaquette made up of twelve quantum dots. Despite the small system size, there are clear signatures of the Kitaev spin-liquid ground state, and there is a range of parameters where these signatures are predicted, allowing a potential platform where Kitaev spin-liquid physics can be explored experimentally in quantum dot plaquettes.</description>

Abstract: Strain represents an ubiquitous feature in semiconductor heterostructures, and can be engineered by different means in order to improve the properties of various devices, including advanced MOSFETs and spin-based qubits. However, its treatment within the envelope function framework is well established only for the homogeneous case, thanks to the theory of Bir and Pikus. Here, we generalize such theory to the case of inhomogeneous strain. By fully accounting for the relativistic effects and metric aspects of the problem, we derive a complete envelope-function Hamiltonian, including the terms that depend on first and second spatial derivatives of the strain tensor.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.01929v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the effect of ferromagnetic metals (FM) on the circularly polarized modes of an electromagnetic cavity and show that broken time-reversal symmetry leads to a dichroic response of the cavity modes. With one spin-split band, the Zeeman coupling between the FM electrons and cavity modes leads to an anticrossing for mode frequencies comparable to the spin splitting. However, this is only the case for one of the circularly polarized modes, while the other is unaffected by the FM, allowing for the determination of the spin-splitting of the FM using polarization-dependent transmission experiments. Moreover, we show that for two spin-split bands, also the lifetimes of the cavity modes display a polarization-dependent response. The change in photon lifetimes can be understood as a suppression due to level attraction with a continuum of Stoner modes with the same wavevector. The reduced lifetime of modes of only one polarization could potentially be used to engineer and control circularly polarized cavities.</description>

Abstract: We study charge pumping in generic non-Hermitian settings and show that quantized charge pumping is only guaranteed under a biorthogonal formalism therein, where the charge transport is evaluated using the left and right eigenvectors of the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. Specifically, for biorthogonal charge pumping in generic one-dimensional non-Hermitian models, we demonstrate how quantized transport is related to the Chern number in the parameter space. When the non-Hermitian model possesses the non-Hermitian skin effect, under which Bloch states in the bulk are deformed and localize toward boundaries, we propose a scenario where the pumped charge is related to the non-Bloch Chern number defined in the parameter space involving the generalized Brillouin zone. We illustrate the validity of our analytic results using concrete examples and, in the context of the biorthogonal charge pumping, discuss in detail a recent experiment where quantized charge pumping was observed in a lossy environment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04427v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many estimates for the magnetic relaxation time of magnetic nanoparticle systems neglect the effect of the applied field strength. This is despite many applications of magnetic nanoparticles involving relaxation dynamics under the influence of applied fields. Here, an analytic approximation for the field-dependent Brownian relaxation time of single-domain, spherical magnetic nanoparticles in an external applied field is developed mathematically. This expression is validated by comparison with existing empirically-derived expressions and by comparison to particle-level simulations that allow particle rotations. Our approximation works particularly well for larger particles. We then use the developed expression to analytically calculate the total magnetic relaxation time when both Brownian and N\'eel relaxation mechanisms are at play. Again, we show that the results match those found using particle-level simulations, this time with both particle rotations and internal magnetization dynamics allowed. However, for some particle parameters and for large field strengths, our simulations reveal that the Brownian and N\'eel relaxation mechanisms are decoupled and it is not appropriate to combine these to calculate a total relaxation time.</description>

Abstract: When subjected to quasiperiodic driving protocols, superconducting systems have been found to harbor robust time-quasiperiodic Majorana modes, extending the concept beyond static and Floquet systems. However, the presence of incommensurate driving frequencies results in dense energy spectra, rendering conventional methods of defining topological invariants based on band structure inadequate. In this work, we introduce a real-space topological invariant capable of identifying time-quasiperiodic Majoranas by leveraging the system's spectral localizer, which integrates information from both Hamiltonian and position operators. Drawing insights from non-Hermitian physics, we establish criteria for constructing the localizer and elucidate the robustness of this invariant in the presence of dense spectra.

Abstract: In the recent years, the thermal Hall transport has risen as an important diagnosis of the physical properties of the elementary excitations in various quantum materials, especially among the Mott insulating systems where the electronic transports are often featureless. Here we review the recent development of thermal Hall effects in quantum magnets where all the relevant excitations are charge-neutral. In addition to summarizing the existing experiments, we pay a special attention to the underlying mechanisms of the thermal Hall effects in various magnetic systems, and clarify the connection between the microscopic physical variables and the emergent degrees of freedom in different quantum phases. The external magnetic field is shown to modify the intrinsic Berry curvature properties of various emergent and/or exotic quasiparticle excitations in distinct fashions for different quantum systems and quantum phases, contributing to the thermal Hall transports. These include, for example, the conventional ones like the magnons in ordered magnets, the triplons in dimerized magnets, the exotic and fractionalized quasiparticles such as the spinons and the magnetic monopoles in quantum spin liquids. We review their contribution and discuss their presence in the thermal Hall conductivity in different physical contexts. We expect this review to provide a useful guidance for the physical mechanism of the thermal Hall transports in quantum magnets.</description>

      <title>What can we learn from the experiment of electrostatic conveyor belt for excitons?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.08016v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the experiment of electrostatic conveyor belt for indirect excitons [A. G. Winbow, \textit{et al.}, Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{106}, 196806 (2011)], we study the exciton patterns for understanding the exciton dynamics. By analyzing the exciton diffusion, we find that the patterns mainly come from the photoluminescence of two kinds of excitons. The patterns near the laser spot come from the hot excitons which can be regarded as the classical particles. However, the patterns far from the laser spot come from the cooled excitons or coherent excitons. Taking into account of the finite lifetime of Bosonic excitons and of the interactions between them, we build a time-dependent nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation including the non-Hermitian dissipation to describe the coherent exciton dynamics. The real-time and imaginary-time evolutions are used alternately to solve the Schr\"{o}dinger equation in order to simulate the exciton diffusion accompanied with the exciton cooling in the moving lattices. By calculating the escape probability, we obtain the transport distances of the coherent excitons in the conveyor which are consistent with the experimental data. The cooling speed of excitons is found to be important in the coherent exciton transport. Moreover, the plateau in the average transport distance cannot be explained by the dynamical localization-delocalization transition induced by the disorders.</description>

      <title>On dualities of paired quantum Hall bilayer states at $\nu_T = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14088v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Density-balanced, widely separated quantum Hall bilayers at $\nu_T = 1$ can be described as two copies of composite Fermi liquids (CFLs). The two CFLs have interlayer weak-coupling BCS instabilities mediated by gauge fluctuations, the resulting pairing symmetry of which depends on the CFL hypothesis used. If both layers are described by the conventional Halperin-Lee-Read (HLR) theory-based composite electron liquid (CEL), the dominant pairing instability is in the $p+ip$ channel; whereas if one layer is described by CEL and the other by a composite hole liquid (CHL, in the sense of anti-HLR), the dominant pairing instability occurs in the $s$-wave channel. Using the Dirac composite fermion (CF) picture, we show that these two pairing channels can be mapped onto each other by particle-hole (PH) transformation. Furthermore, we derive the CHL theory as the non-relativistic limit of the PH-transformed massive Dirac CF theory. Finally, we prove that an effective topological field theory for the paired CEL-CHL in the weak-coupling limit is equivalent to the exciton condensate phase in the strong-coupling limit.</description>

      <title>Narrow-linewidth exciton-polariton laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18354v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Exciton-polariton laser is a promising source of coherent light for low-energy applications due to its low-threshold operation. However, a detailed experimental study of its spectral purity, which directly affects its coherence properties is still missing. Here}, we present a high-resolution spectroscopic investigation of the energy and linewidth of an exciton-polariton laser in the single-mode regime, which derives its coherent emission from an optically pumped and confined exciton-polariton condensate. We report an ultra-narrow linewidth of 56~MHz or 0.24~$\mu$eV, corresponding to a coherence time of 5.7~ns. The narrow linewidth is consistently achieved by using an exciton-polariton condensate with a high photonic content confined in an optically induced trap. Contrary to previous studies, we show that the excitonic reservoir created by the pump and responsible for creating the trap does not strongly affect the emission linewidth as long as the condensate is trapped and the pump power is well above the condensation (lasing) threshold. \red{The long coherence time of the exciton-polariton system uncovered here opens up opportunities for manipulating its macroscopic quantum state, which is essential for applications in classical and quantum computing.</description>
