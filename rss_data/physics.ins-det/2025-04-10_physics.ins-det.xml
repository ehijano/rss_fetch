      <title>Data-driven performance optimization of gamma spectrometers with many channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In gamma spectrometers with variable spectroscopic performance across many channels (e.g., many pixels or voxels), a tradeoff exists between including data from successively worse-performing readout channels and increasing efficiency. Brute-force calculation of the optimal set of included channels is exponentially infeasible as the number of channels grows, and approximate methods are required. In this work, we present a data-driven framework for attempting to find near-optimal sets of included detector channels. The framework leverages non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) to learn the behavior of gamma spectra across the detector, and clusters similarly-performing detector channels together. Performance comparisons are then made between spectra with channel clusters removed, which is more feasible than brute force. The framework is general and can be applied to arbitrary, user-defined performance metrics depending on the application. We apply this framework to optimizing gamma spectra measured by H3D M400 CdZnTe spectrometers, which exhibit variable performance across their crystal volumes. In particular, we show several examples optimizing various performance metrics for uranium and plutonium gamma spectra in nondestructive assay for nuclear safeguards, and explore trends in performance vs.\ parameters such as clustering algorithm type. We also compare the NMF+clustering pipeline to several non-machine-learning algorithms, including several greedy algorithms. Overall, we find that the NMF+clustering pipeline tends to find the best-performing set of detector voxels, significantly improving over the un-optimized spectra, but that a greedy accumulation of spectra segmented by detector depth can in some cases give similar performance improvements in much less computation time.</description>

      <title>Assembly, testing, and installation of mPMT photosensor for the Water Cherenkov Test Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The multi-Photomultiplier Tube (mPMT) photosensors will be used in the Water Cherenkov Test Experiment (WCTE) to efficiently detect the photons produced in the whole detector. One of the aims behind the development of WCTE is to test the technology and implement it in future water Cherenkov experiments such as the Hyper-Kamiokande experiment and its Intermediate Water Cherenkov Detector. Each mPMT is built using nineteen 3-inch PMTs arranged on a semi-spherical support matrix. In this paper, we describe the design and manufacture of the mechanical components, the procedures for casting an optical gel between PMTs and acrylic cover, and the overall assembly procedure of the mPMTs. We also report on the R&amp;D performed on the selection of the optical gel ratio along with transmittance measurements and the reflectance measurements performed on the aluminium reflector. We also present the optical tests performed on the mPMT module using a 405 nm LED and the resulting increase in the effective photosensitive area by surrounding the PMTs with a reflector. A summary of the production and installation of the mPMTs for the WCTE is also presented in this paper.</description>

      <title>Characterization of the Electronic Noise in the Readout of Resistive Micromegas in the High-Angle Time Projection Chambers of the T2K Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The two high-angle Time Projection Chambers of the T2K experiment are equipped with a new readout system based on resistive Micromegas detector technology, and utilize custom-made electronics based on AFTER chips for signal processing. This study analyzes and characterizes the electronic noise of the detector readout chain to develop a comprehensive noise model. The model enables the generation of Monte Carlo simulations to investigate systematic effects in signal processing. The analysis is based on data collected from 32 resistive Micromegas detectors, recorded without zero suppression. All detectors exhibit a quasi-identical and time-stable noise level. The developed analytical model accurately describes the observed noise, and derived Monte Carlo simulations show excellent agreement with experimental data.</description>

      <title>Experiment demonstration of tilt-to-length coupling suppression by beam-alignment-mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15796v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tilt-to-length (TTL) noise, caused by angular jitter and misalignment, is a major noise source in the inter-satellite interferometer for gravitational wave detection. However, the required level of axis alignment of the optical components is beyond the current state of the art. A set of optical parallel plates, called beam alignment mechanism (BAM), is proposed by LISA to compensate for the alignment error. In this paper, we show a prototype design of the BAM and demonstrate its performance in a ground-based optical system. We derive the BAM theoretical model, which agrees well with the numerical simulation. Experimental results reveal that the BAM can achieve lateral displacement compensation of the optical axis with a resolution of \SI{1}{\micro\meter} across a \D{dynamic} range of about \SI{0.5}{\milli\meter}. Furthermore, the TTL coefficient is reduced from about \SI{0.3}{\milli\meter/\radian} to about \SI{5}{\micro\meter/\radian}, satisfying the preliminary requirements for LISA and TianQin. These findings confirm the efficacy of the BAM in suppressing TTL noise, offering a promising solution for space-based gravitational wave detection.</description>

      <title>Transforming a rare event search into a not-so-rare event search in real-time with deep learning-based object detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07538v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep learning-based object detection algorithms enable the simultaneous classification and localization of any number of objects in image data. Many of these algorithms are capable of operating in real-time on high resolution images, attributing to their widespread usage across many fields. We present an end-to-end object detection pipeline designed for real-time rare event searches for the Migdal effect, using high-resolution image data from a state-of-the-art scientific CMOS camera in the MIGDAL experiment. The Migdal effect in nuclear scattering, crucial for sub-GeV dark matter searches, has yet to be experimentally confirmed, making its detection a primary goal of the MIGDAL experiment. Our pipeline employs the YOLOv8 object detection algorithm and is trained on real data to enhance the detection efficiency of nuclear and electronic recoils, particularly those exhibiting overlapping tracks that are indicative of the Migdal effect. When deployed online on the MIGDAL readout PC, we demonstrate our pipeline to process and perform the rare event search on 2D image data faster than the peak 120 frame per second acquisition rate of the CMOS camera. Applying these same steps offline, we demonstrate that we can reduce a sample of 20 million camera frames to around 1000 frames while maintaining nearly all signal that YOLOv8 is able to detect, thereby transforming a rare search into a much more manageable search. Our studies highlight the potential of pipelines similar to ours significantly improving the detection capabilities of experiments requiring rapid and precise object identification in high-throughput data environments.</description>

      <title>Magnon spectroscopy in the electron microscope</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02908v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The miniaturisation of transistors is approaching its limits due to challenges in heat management and information transfer speed. To overcome these obstacles, emerging technologies such as spintronics are being developed, which leverage the electron's spin in addition to its charge. Local phenomena at interfaces or structural defects will greatly influence the efficiency of spin-based devices, making the ability to study and control spin wave propagation at the nano- and atomic scales a key challenge. The development of high-spatial-resolution tools to probe spin waves, also called magnons, at relevant lengthscales is thus essential to understand how their properties are affected by such local features. Here, we show the first experimental detection of bulk magnons at the nanoscale using scanning transmission electron microscopy. By employing high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy with hybrid-pixel direct electron detectors optimized for low acceleration voltages, we successfully overcome the challenges posed by weak signals and identify magnon excitations in a thin NiO nanocrystal. Advanced inelastic electron scattering simulations corroborate our findings. These results open new avenues for detecting magnons, exploring their dispersions and their modifications arising from nanoscale structural or chemical defects. This marks an important milestone in magnonics and presents exciting opportunities for the future development of spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Charge-coupled Device Readout Enabled by the Floating-Gate Amplifier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07930v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multiple-Amplifier Sensing (MAS) charge-coupled devices (CCDs) have recently been shown to be promising silicon detectors that meet noise sensitivity requirements for next generation Stage-5 spectroscopic surveys and potentially, future space-based imaging of extremely faint objects on missions such as the Habitable Worlds Observatory. Building upon the capability of the Skipper CCD to achieve deeply sub-electron noise floors, MAS CCDs utilize multiple floating-gate amplifiers along the serial register to increase the readout speed by a factor of the number of output nodes compared to a Skipper CCD. We introduce and experimentally demonstrate on a 16-channel prototype device new readout techniques that exploit the MAS CCD's floating-gate amplifiers to optimize the correlated double sampling (CDS) by resetting once per line instead of once per pixel. With this new mode, we find an optimal filter to subtract the noise from the signal during read out. We also take advantage of the MAS CCD's structure to tune the read time by independently changing integration times for the signal and reference level. Together with optimal weighted averaging of the 16 outputs, these approaches enable us to reach a sub-electron noise of 0.9 e$^-$ rms pix$^{-1}$ at 19 $\mu$s pix$^{-1}$ for a single charge measurement per pixel - simultaneously giving a 30% faster readout time and 10% lower read noise compared to performance previously evaluated without these techniques.</description>
