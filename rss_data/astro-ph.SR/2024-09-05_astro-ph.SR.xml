      <title>Precise and Accurate Mass and Radius Measurements of Fifteen Galactic Red Giants in Detached Eclipsing Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise and accurate mass and radius measurements of evolved stars are crucial to calibrating stellar models. Stars in detached eclipsing binaries (EBs) are excellent potential calibrators because their stellar parameters can be measured with fractional uncertainties of a few percent, independent of stellar models. The All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae (ASAS-SN) has identified tens of thousands of EBs, &gt;35,000 of which were included in the ASAS-SN eclipsing binaries catalog. Here, we select eight EBs from this sample that contain giants based on their Gaia colors and absolute magnitudes. We use LBT/PEPSI, APF, and CHIRON to obtain multi-epoch spectra of these binaries and measure their radial velocities using two-dimensional cross-correlation methods. We simultaneously fit the ASAS-SN light curves and the radial velocities with PHOEBE to derive accurate and precise masses and radii with fractional uncertainties of $\lesssim 3\%$. For four systems, we also include Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) light curves in our PHOEBE models, which significantly improves the radius determinations. In seven of our systems, both components have evolved off of the main sequence, and one system has a giant star component with a main sequence, Sun-like companion. Finally, we compare our mass and radius measurements to single-star evolutionary tracks and distinguish between systems that are first ascent red giant branch stars and those that are likely core helium-burning stars.</description>

      <title>A New IW And-Type Star: Karachurin 12 with Tilted Disks and Diverse cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The IW And phenomenon in cataclysmic variables presents a significant challenge to the accretion disk instability model. Using photometric data from the All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae, the Zwicky Transient Facility, and the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, we identify Karachurin 12 as a new IW And-type object with a cycle period of 35.69(3) days. We also report for the first time that Karachurin 12 is a negative superhump (NSH) system featuring a precessing tilted disk, with precession, orbital, and NSH periods of 4.9588(2) days, 0.3168895(13) days, and 0.2979861(8) days, respectively. Our analysis, using dips as indexes and NSHs as probes, reveals diverse cycle patterns in Karachurin 12, with NSH amplitude varying throughout the cycle. Analyses of NSH behaviour using multiple methods shows that the amplitude decreases with increasing outbursts and increases with weakening outbursts, which we suggest is related to changes in the radius of the accretion disk. The mass transfer outburst model fails to explain the observed NSH amplitude variations, whereas the tilted thermally unstable disk model accounts for most of the observed cycles and dip patterns, particularly the disappearance of the IW And phenomenon when NSHs become undetectable. However, no significant changes in the NSH period were observed. These findings suggest a potential link between the IW And phenomenon and a tilted disk. Further improvements in simulations are needed to better understand the detailed dynamics of these cycles.</description>

      <title>Resolving Twin Jets and Twin Disks with JWST and ALMA: The Young WL 20 Multiple System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the discovery of jets emanating from pre-main-sequence objects exclusively at mid-infrared wavelengths, enabled by the superb sensitivity of JWST's Mid-InfraRed Medium-Resolution Spectrometer (MIRI MRS) instrument. These jets are observed only in lines of [NiII], [FeII], [ArII], and [NeII]. The H$_2$ emission, imaged in eight distinct transitions, has a completely different morphology, exhibiting a wide-angled, biconical shape, symmetrically distributed about the jet axes. Synergistic high-resolution Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations resolve a pair of side-by-side edge-on accretion disks lying at the origin of the twin mid-infrared jets. Assuming coevality of the components of the young multiple system under investigation, the system age is at least (2 $-$ 2.5) $\times$ 10$^6$ yr, despite the discrepantly younger age inferred from the spectral energy distribution of the combined edge-on disk sources. The later system evolutionary stage is corroborated by ALMA observations of CO(2$-$1), $^{13}$CO(2$-1$), and C$^{18}$O(2$-$1), which show no traces of molecular outflows or remnant cavity walls. Consequently, the observed H$_2$ structures must have their origins in wide-angled disk winds, in the absence of any ambient, swept-up gas. In the context of recent studies of protostars, we propose an outflow evolutionary scenario in which the molecular gas component dominates in the youngest sources, whereas the fast, ionized jets dominate in the oldest sources, as is the case for the twin jets discovered in the WL 20 system.</description>

      <title>Relative evolution of eclipsing binaries: A tool to measure globular cluster ages and He abundances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Globular clusters (GCs) are among the oldest objects in the Universe for which an age can be directly measured, thus playing an important cosmological role. This age, on the other hand, depends sensitively on the He abundance, which cannot be reliably measured from spectroscopy in GC stars. Detached eclipsing binaries (DEBs) near the turnoff (TO) point may play an important role in this regard. The aim of this study is to explore the possibility that, by working with differential measurements of stars that comprise a TO binary system, and assuming both stars have the same age and He abundance, one can achieve tighter, more robust, and less model-dependent constraints on the latter two quantities than otherwise possible by working with the absolute parameters of the stars. We compare both absolute and differential parameters of the stars in V69, a TO DEB pair in the GC 47 Tuc, with two different sets of stellar evolutionary tracks, making use of a Monte Carlo technique to estimate its He abundance and age, along with their uncertainties. We find that the relative approach can produce age and He abundance estimates that are in good agreement with those from the literature. We show that our estimates are also less model-dependent, less sensitive to [Fe/H], and more robust to inherent model systematics than those obtained with an absolute approach. On the other hand, the relative analysis finds larger statistical uncertainties than does its absolute counterpart, at least in the case of V69, where both stars have very similar properties. For binary pairs in which one of the components is less evolved than the other, the statistical uncertainty can be reduced. Our study suggests that the method proposed in this work may be useful to robustly constrain the He abundance and ages of GCs.</description>

      <title>Cosmic ray north-south anisotropy: rigidity spectrum and solar cycle variations observed by ground-based muon detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The north-south (NS) anisotropy of galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) is dominated by a diamagnetic drift flow of GCRs in the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF), allowing us to derive key parameters of cosmic-ray propagation, such as the density gradient and diffusion coefficient. We propose a new method to analyze the rigidity spectrum of GCR anisotropy and reveal a solar cycle variation of the NS anisotropy's spectrum using ground-based muon detectors in Nagoya, Japan, and Hobart, Australia. The physics-based correction method for the atmospheric temperature effect on muons is used to combine the different-site detectors free from local atmospheric effects. NS channel pairs in the multi-directional muon detectors are formed to enhance sensitivity to the NS anisotropy, and in this process, general graph matching in graph theory is introduced to survey optimized pairs. Moreover, Bayesian estimation with the Gaussian process allows us to unfold the rigidity spectrum without supposing any analytical function for the spectral shape. Thanks to these novel approaches, it has been discovered that the rigidity spectrum of the NS anisotropy is dynamically varying with solar activity every year. It is attributed to a rigidity-dependent variation of the radial density gradient of GCRs based on the nature of the diamagnetic drift in the IMF. The diffusion coefficient and mean-free-path length of GCRs as functions of the rigidity are also derived from the diffusion-convection flow balance. This analysis expands the estimation limit of the mean-free-path length into $\le200$ GV rigidity region from $&lt;10$ GV region achieved by solar energetic particle observations.</description>

      <title>The YMDB catalog: Young massive detached binaries for the determination of high-precision absolute stellar parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Massive stars play a crucial role in the cosmic dynamics and chemical evolution of galaxies, however our understanding of their evolution and properties remains limited. An accurate determination of stellar parameters is essential for advancing our knowledge. Detached eclipsing binaries (DEBs) are particularly valuable for these determinations due to the minimal interaction between their stellar components, allowing for precise measurements. This study introduces the Young Massive Detached Binary (YMDB) catalog, designed to address the gap in the high-precision absolute parameter determination for young massive stars. By focusing on DEBs within the spectral range O9-B1, this catalog seeks to provide a reliable database for future studies and improve our understanding of massive star evolution. We conducted a photometric analysis of 87 young massive stars in DEBs using TESS light curves (LCs) that were processed through a custom pipeline. This analysis involved determining the amplitude of magnitude variations, orbital periods, times of minima, eccentricities, and the presence of apsidal motion and heartbeat phenomena. A thorough literature review was performed to obtain MK spectral classifications. We performed our own spectral classification of 19 systems to support the sample where a new classification was lacking or inconclusive. The analysis identified 20 previously unreported binary systems, with 13 newly recognized as variables. Among the 87 stars examined, 30 are confirmed as YMDB members, and 25 are candidates pending spectral classification. The remaining 32 stars belong to unsuitable spectral types or nondetached binary nature. Notable findings include the identification of new LC classifications, eccentricities in 13 systems, and heartbeat phenomena in several targets. The YMDB catalog offers a resource of high-quality LCs and reliable stellar classifications.</description>

      <title>Extended Drag-Based Model for better predicting the evolution of Coronal Mass Ejections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The solar wind drag-based model is a widely used framework for predicting the propagation of Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) through interplanetary space. This model primarily considers the aerodynamic drag exerted by the solar wind on CMEs. However, factors like magnetic forces, pressure gradients, and the internal dynamics within CMEs justify the need of introducing an additional small-scale acceleration term in the game. Indeed, by accounting for this extra acceleration, the extended drag-based model is shown to offer improved accuracy in describing the evolution of CMEs through the heliosphere and, in turn, in forecasting CME trajectories and arrival times at Earth. This enhancement is crucial for better predicting Space Weather events and mitigating their potential impacts on space-based and terrestrial technologies.</description>

      <title>A multi-kiloGauss magnetic field driving the magnetospheric accretion process in EX Lupi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: EX Lupi is the prototype of EX Lup-type stars, meaning classical T Tauri stars (cTTSs) showing luminosity bursts and outbursts of 1 to 5 magnitudes lasting for a few months to a few years. These events are ascribed to an episodic accretion that can occur repeatedly but whose physical mechanism is still debated. In this work, we aim to investigate the magnetically-driven accretion of EX Lup in quiescence, including for the first time a study of the small and large-scale magnetic field. This allows us to provide a complete characterisation of the magnetospheric accretion process of the system. We use spectropolarimetric times series acquired in 2016 and 2019 with the Echelle SpectroPolarimetric Device for the Observation of Stars and in 2019 with the SpectroPolarim\`etre InfraRouge at the Canada-France-Hawaii telescope, during a quiescence phase of EX Lup. We were thus able to perform a variability analysis of the radial velocity, the emission lines and surface averaged longitudinal magnetic field along different epochs and wavelength domains. We also provide a small-scale magnetic field analysis using Zeeman intensification of photospheric lines and large-scale magnetic topology reconstruction using Zeeman-Doppler Imaging. Our study reveals a typical magnetospheric accretion ongoing on EX Lup, with a main accretion funnel flow connecting the inner disc to the star in a stable fashion and producing an accretion shock on the stellar surface close to the pole of the magnetic dipole component. We also measure one of the strongest fields ever observed on cTTSs. Such a strong field indicates that the disc is truncated by the magnetic field close but beyond the corotation radius, where the angular velocity of the disc equals the angular velocity of the star. Such a configuration is suitable for a magnetically-induced disc instability yielding episodic accretion onto the star.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stars play a decisive role in our Universe, from its beginning throughout its complete evolution. For a thorough understanding of their properties, evolution, and physics of their outer envelopes, stellar spectra need to be analyzed by comparison with numerical models of their atmospheres. We discuss the foundations of how to calculate such models (in particular, density and temperature stratification, affected by convective energy transport in low-mass stars), which requires a parallel treatment of hydrodynamics, thermodynamics and radiative transfer. We stress the impact of emissivities, opacities, and particularly their ratio (source function), and summarize how these quantities are calculated, either adopting or relaxing the assumption of LTE (local thermodynamic equilibrium). Subsequently, we discuss the influence and physics of stellar winds (and their various driving mechanisms as a function of stellar type), rotation, magnetic fields, inhomogeneities, and multiplicity. Finally, we outline the basics of quantitative spectroscopy, namely how to analyze observed spectra in practice.</description>

      <title>Gaia/GSP-spec spectroscopic properties of gamma Doradus pulsators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gaia/DR3 has provided a large sample of new g-mode pulsators, among which~11,600 are Gam Dor stars. This work present the spectroscopic parameters of these Gam Dor pulsators estimated by the GSP-spec module that analysed millions of Gaia spectra. The Galactic positions, kinematics, and orbital properties of these new Gaia pulsators were examined in order to define a sub-sample belonging to the Milky Way thin disc, in which these young stars should preferentially be found. The stellar luminosities, radii, and astrometric surface gravities were estimated without adopting any priors from uncertain stellar evolution models. These parameters, combined with the GSP-spec effective temperatures, spectroscopic gravities, and metallicities were then validated by comparison with recent literature studies. Most stars are found to belong to the Galactic thin disc, as expected. It is also found that the derived luminosities, radii, and astrometric surface gravities are of high quality and have values typical of genuine Gam Dor pulsators. Moreover, we have shown that Teff and [M/H] of pulsators with high enough SNR spectra or slow to moderate rotation rates are robust. This allowed to define a sub-sample of genuine slow-rotating Gaia Gam Dor pulsators. Their Teff are found between ~6500 and ~7800K, log(g) around 4.2 and luminosities and stellar radii peak at ~5Lsun and ~1.7Rsun. [M/H] is close to the Solar value, although 0.5dex more metal-poor and metal-rich Gam Dor are identified. The [alpha/Fe] content is fully consistent with the chemical properties of the Galactic disc. Gaia/DR3 spectroscopic properties of Gam Dor stars therefore confirm the nature of these pulsators and allow to chemo-physically parametrise a new large sample of such stars. Moreover, future Gaia DR should drastically increase the number of Gam Dor stars with good-precision spectroscopically derived parameters.</description>

Abstract: In this chapter, we will cover how stars form from the stellar nurseries that are giant molecular clouds. We will first review the physical processes that compete to regulate star formation. We then review star formation in turbulent, magnetized molecular clouds and the associated statistics giving rise to the star formation rate and the initial mass function of stars. We then present the protostellar stages in detail from an observational perspective. We will primarily discuss low-mass ($&lt;1.5\msun$) stars. Finally, we examine how multiplicity complicates the single-star formation picture. This chapter will focus on star formation at redshift~0</description>

      <title>The Completeness of Accreting Neutron Star Binary Candidates from the Chinese Space Station Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutron star (NS) has many extreme physical conditions, and one may obtain some important informations about NS via accreting neutron star binary (ANSB) systems. The upcoming Chinese Space Station Telescope (CSST) provides an opportunity to search for a large sample of ANSB candidates. Our goal is to check the completeness of the potential ANSB samples from CSST data. In this paper, we generate some ANSBs and normal binaries under CSST photometric system by binary evolution and binary population synthesis method and use a machine learning method to train a classification model. Although the Precision ($94.56~ \%$) of our machine learning model is as high as before study, the Recall is only about $63.29~ \%$. The Precision/Recall is mainly determined by the mass transfer rate between the NSs and their companions. In addition, we also find that the completeness of ANSB samples from CSST photometric data by the machine learning method also depends on the companion mass and the age of the system. ANSB candidates with low initial mass companion star ($0.1~ {\rm M}_\odot$ to $1~ {\rm M}_\odot$) have a relatively high Precision ($94.94~ \%$) and high Recall ($86.32~ \%$), whereas ANSB candidates with higher initial mass companion star ($1.1~ {\rm M}_\odot$ to $3~ {\rm M}_\odot$) have similar Precision ($93.88~ \%$) and quite low Recall ($42.67~ \%$). Our results indicate that although the machine learning method may obtain a relative pure sample of ANSBs, a completeness correction is necessary for one to obtain a complete sample.</description>

      <title>Retrieving stellar parameters and dynamics of AGB stars with Gaia parallax measurements and CO5BOLD RHD simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. The complex dynamics of asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars and the resulting stellar winds have a significant impact on the measurements of stellar parameters and amplify their uncertainties. Three-dimensional (3D) radiative hydrodynamic (RHD) simulations of convection suggest that convection-related structures at the surface of AGB star affect the photocentre displacement and the parallax uncertainty measured by Gaia. Aims. We explore the impact of the convection on the photocentre variability and aim to establish analytical laws between the photocentre displacement and stellar parameters to retrieve such parameters from the parallax uncertainty. Methods. We used a selection of 31 RHD simulations with CO5BOLD and the post-processing radiative transfer code Optim3D to compute intensity maps in the Gaia G band [320-1050 nm]. From these maps, we calculated the photocentre position and temporal fluctuations. We then compared the synthetic standard deviation to the parallax uncertainty of a sample of 53 Mira stars observed with Gaia. Results. The simulations show a displacement of the photocentre across the surface ranging from 4 to 13 % of the corresponding stellar radius, in agreement with previous studies. We provide an analytical law relating the pulsation period of the simulations and the photocentre displacement as well as the pulsation period and stellar parameters. By combining these laws, we retrieve the surface gravity, the effective temperature, and the radius for the stars in our sample. Conclusions. Our analysis highlights an original procedure to retrieve stellar parameters by using both state-of-the-art 3D numerical simulations of AGB stellar convection and parallax observations of AGB stars. This will help us refine our understanding of these giants.</description>

      <title>Exploring the magnetic and thermal evolution of a coronal jet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coronal jets are the captivating eruptions which are often found in the solar atmosphere, and primarily formed due to magnetic reconnection. Despite their short-lived nature and lower energy compared to many other eruptive events, e.g. flares and coronal mass ejections, they play an important role in heating the corona and accelerating charged particles. However, their generation in the ambience of non-standard flare regime is not fully understood, and warrant a deeper investigation, in terms of their onset, growth, eruption processes, and thermodynamic evolution. Toward this goal, this paper reports the results of a data-constrained three-dimensional (3D) magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) simulation of an eruptive jet; initialized with a Non-Force-Free-Field (NFFF) extrapolation and carried out in the spirit of Implicit Large Eddy Simulation (ILES). The simulation focuses on the magnetic and dynamical properties of the jet during its onset, and eruption phases, that occurred on February 5, 2015 in an active region NOAA AR12280, associated with a seemingly three-ribbon structure. In order to correlate its thermal evolution with computed energetics, the simulation results are compared with differential emission measurement (DEM) analysis in the vicinity of the jet. Importantly, this combined approach provides an insight to the onset of reconnection in transients in terms of emission and the corresponding electric current profiles from MHD evolutions. The presented study captures the intricate topological dynamics, finds a close correspondence between the magnetic and thermal evolution in and around the jet location. Overall, it enriches the understanding of the thermal evolution due to MHD processes, which is one of the broader aspects to reveal the coronal heating problem.</description>

      <title>Latitudinal dependence of variations in the frequencies of solar oscillations above the acoustic cut-off</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At high frequencies beyond the acoustic cut-off, a peak-like structure is visible in the solar power spectrum. Known as the pseudo-modes, their frequencies have been shown to vary in anti-phase with solar magnetic activity. In this work, we determined temporal variations in these frequencies across the solar disc, with the aim of identifying any potential latitudinal dependence of pseudo-mode frequency shifts. We utilised nearly 22 years of spatially resolved GONG data for all azimuthal orders, $\textit{m}$, for harmonic degrees 0 $\leq$ $\textit{l}$ $\leq$ 200, and determined shifts using the resampled periodogram method. Periodogram realisations were created from overlapping, successive 216d-long segments in time, and cropped to 5600-6800$\mu$Hz. Cross-correlation functions were then repeatedly generated between these realisations to identify any variation in frequency and the uncertainty. We categorised each mode by its latitudinal sensitivity and used this categorisation to produce average frequency shifts for different latitude bands (15$^\circ$ and 5$^\circ$ in size) which were compared to magnetic proxies, the $F_{\mathrm{10.7}}$ index and GONG synoptic maps. Morphological differences in the pseudo-mode shifts between different latitudes were found, which were most pronounced during the rise to solar maximum where shifts reach their minimum values. At all latitudes, shift behaviour was strongly in anti-correlation with the activity proxy. Additionally, periodicities shorter than the 11-year cycle were observed. Wavelet analysis was used to identify a periodicity of four years at all latitudes.</description>

      <title>Exploring the dynamic rotational profile of the hotter solar atmosphere: A multi-wavelength approach using SDO/AIA data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the global rotational profile of the solar atmosphere and its variation is fundamental to uncovering a comprehensive understanding of the dynamics of the solar magnetic field and the extent of coupling between different layers of the Sun. In this study, we employ the method of image correlation to analyze the extensive dataset provided by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly of the Solar Dynamic Observatory in different wavelength channels. We find a significant increase in the equatorial rotational rate ($A$) and a decrease in absolute latitudinal gradient ($|B|$) at all temperatures representative of the solar atmosphere, implying an equatorial rotation up to $4.18\%$ and $1.92\%$ faster and less differential when compared to the rotation rates for the underlying photosphere derived from Doppler measurement and sunspots respectively. In addition, we also find a significant increase in equatorial rotation rate ($A$) and a decrease in differential nature ($|B|$ decreases) at different layers of the solar atmosphere. We also explore a possible connection from the solar interior to the atmosphere and interestingly found that $A$ at $r=0.94\,\mathrm{R}_{\odot}, 0.965\,\mathrm{R}_{\odot}$ show an excellent match with 171 Angstrom, 304 Angstrom and 1600 Angstrom, respectively. Furthermore, we observe a positive correlation between the rotational parameters measured from 1600 Angstrom, 131 Angstrom, 193 Angstrom and 211 Angstrom with the yearly averaged sunspot number, suggesting a potential dependence of the solar rotation on the appearance of magnetic structures related to the solar cycle or the presence of cycle dependence of solar rotation in the solar atmosphere.</description>

      <title>Mixed Source Region Signatures Inside Magnetic Switchback Patches Inferred by Heavy Ion Diagnostics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since Parker Solar Probe's (Parker's) first perihelion pass at the Sun, large amplitude Alfv\'en waves grouped in patches have been observed near the Sun throughout the mission. Several formation processes for these magnetic switchback patches have been suggested with no definitive consensus. To provide insight to their formation, we examine the heavy ion properties of several adjacent magnetic switchback patches around Parker's 11th perihelion pass capitalizing on a spacecraft lineup with Solar Orbiter where each samples the same solar wind streams over a large range of longitudes. Heavy ion properties (Fe/O, C$^{6+}$/C$^{5+}$, O$^{7+}$/O$^{6+}$) related to the wind's coronal origin, measured with Solar Orbiter can be linked to switchback patch structures identified near the Sun with Parker. We find that switchback patches do not contain distinctive ion and elemental compositional signatures different than the surrounding non-switchback solar wind. Both the patches and ambient wind exhibit a range of fast and slow wind qualities, indicating coronal sources with open and closed field lines in close proximity. These observations and modeling indicate switchback patches form in coronal hole boundary wind and with a range of source region magnetic and thermal properties. Furthermore, the heavy ion signatures suggest interchange reconnection and/or shear driven processes may play a role in their creation.</description>

      <title>Evidence for Dust Depletion in a Misaligned Protoplanetary Disk with JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here we report the detection of dust depletion in a misaligned inner disk around UX Tau A using JWST MIRI spectra. Mid-infrared (MIR) continuum "seesaw" variability was detected in this disk by Spitzer and attributed to variable shadows cast on the outer disk by the inner disk. The JWST MIRI spectrum of UX Tau A also shows seesaw variability, but with a significant decrease of emission shortwards of 10 micron to nearly photospheric levels. We argue that UX Tau A's MIR continuum variability is due to depletion of dust in a misaligned inner disk. We speculate that this dust depletion occurs because the inner disk is misaligned from the outer disk, which can disrupt the replenishment of the inner disk from the outer disk. Using contemporaneous measurements of the mass accretion rate of UX Tau A and estimating the amount of dust necessary to produce the MIR excess in the Spitzer observations, we estimate a minimum dust depletion timescale of ~0.1 yr. These observations show that we can indirectly detect the signatures of misaligned inner disks through MIR continuum variability and that in some cases the inner disk may be significantly depleted of dust and become optically thin.</description>

      <title>The Gaia Ultracool Dwarf Sample -- IV. GTC/OSIRIS optical spectra of Gaia late-M and L dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As part of our comprehensive, ongoing characterisation of the low-mass end of the main sequence in the Solar neighbourhood, we used the OSIRIS instrument at the 10.4 m Gran Telescopio Canarias to acquire low- and mid-resolution (R$\approx$300 and R$\approx$2500) optical spectroscopy of 53 late-M and L ultracool dwarfs. Most of these objects are known but poorly investigated and lacking complete kinematics. We measured spectral indices, determined spectral types (six of which are new) and inferred effective temperature and surface gravity from BT-Settl synthetic spectra fits for all objects. We were able to measure radial velocities via line centre fitting and cross correlation for 46 objects, 29 of which lacked previous radial velocity measurements. Using these radial velocities in combination with the latest Gaia DR3 data, we also calculated Galactocentric space velocities. From their kinematics, we identified two candidates outside of the thin disc and four in young stellar kinematic groups. Two further ultracool dwarfs are apparently young field objects: 2MASSW J1246467$+$402715 (L4$\beta$), which has a potential, weak lithium absorption line, and G 196$-$3B (L3$\beta$), which was already known as young due to its well-studied primary companion.</description>

      <title>A Semi-Analytical Model for Stellar Evolution in AGN Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02981v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Disks of gas accreting onto supermassive black holes may host numerous stellar-mass objects, formed within the disk or captured from a nuclear star cluster. We present a simplified model of stellar evolution applicable to these dense environments; our model exhibits exquisite agreement with full stellar evolution calculations at a minuscule fraction of the cost. Although the model presented here is limited to stars burning hydrogen in their cores, it is sufficient to determine the evolutionary fate of disk-embedded stars: whether they proceed to later stages of nuclear burning and leave behind a compact remnant, reach a quasi-steady state where mass loss and accretion balance one another, or whether accretion proceeds faster than stellar structure can adjust, causing a runaway. We provide numerous examples, highlighting how various disk parameters, and effects such as gap opening, affect stellar evolution outcomes. We also highlight how our model can accommodate time-varying conditions, such as those experienced by a star on an eccentric orbit, and can couple to N-body integrations. This model will enable more detailed studies of stellar populations and their interaction with accretion disks than have previously been possible.</description>

      <title>The K2-24 planetary system revisited by CHEOPS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02995v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: K2-24 is a planetary system composed of two transiting low-density Neptunians locked in an almost perfect 2:1 resonance and showing large TTVs, i.e., an excellent laboratory to search for signatures of planetary migration. Previous studies performed with K2, Spitzer and RV data tentatively claimed a significant non-zero eccentricity for one or both planets, possibly high enough to challenge the scenario of pure disk migration through resonant capture. With 13 new CHEOPS light curves (seven of planet -b, six of planet -c), we carried out a global photometric and dynamical (RV+TTV) re-analysis by including all the available literature data as well. We got the most accurate set of planetary parameters to date for the K2-24 system, including radii and masses at 1% and 5% precision (now essentially limited by the uncertainty on stellar parameters) and non-zero eccentricities $e_b=0.0498_{-0.0018}^{+0.0011}$, $e_c=0.0282_{-0.0007}^{+0.0003}$ detected at very high significance for both planets. Such relatively large values imply the need for an additional physical mechanism of eccentricity excitation during or after the migration stage. Also, while the accuracy of the previous TTV model had drifted by up to 0.5 days at the current time, we constrained the orbital solution firmly enough to predict the forthcoming transits for the next ~15 years, thus enabling an efficient follow-up with top-level facilities such as JWST or ESPRESSO.</description>

      <title>Disruption of exo-asteroids around white dwarfs and the release of dust particles in debris rings in co-orbital motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Close to the Roche radius of a white dwarf (WD), an asteroid on a circular orbit sheds material that then adopts a very similar orbit. Observations of the resulting debris show a periodic behavior and changes in flux on short timescales, implying ongoing dynamical activity. Additional encounters from other minor planets may then yield co-orbital rings of debris at different inclinations. The structure, dynamics, and lifetime of these debris discs remains highly uncertain, but is important for understanding WD planetary systems. We aim to identify and quantify the locations of co-orbitals in WD-asteroid-dust particle 3-body systems by exploring the influence of 1:1 resonant periodic orbits. We begin this exploration with co-planar and inclined orbits in the circular restricted 3-body problem (CRTBP) and model the dynamical evolution of these exosystems over observable timescales. The mass ratio parameter for this class of systems ($~2\times 10^{-11}$) is one of the lowest ever explored in this dynamical configuration. We computed the periodic orbits, deduced their linear stability, and suitably seeded the dynamical stability maps. We carried out a limited suite of N-body simulations to provide direct comparisons with the maps. We derive novel results for this extreme mass ratio in the CRTBP, including new unstable 3D families. We illustrate through the maps and N-body simulations where dust can exist in a stable configuration over observable timescales across a wide expanse of parameter space in the absence of strong external forces. Over a timescale of 10 yr, the maximum orbital period deviations of stable debris due to the co-orbital perturbations of the asteroid is about a few seconds. Unstable debris in a close encounter with the asteroid typically deviates from the co-orbital configuration by more than about 20 km and is on a near-circular orbit with an eccentricity lower than ~0.01.</description>

      <title>Emergence of two inertial sub-ranges in solar wind turbulence: dependence on heliospheric distance and solar activity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03090v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The solar wind is highly turbulent, and intermittency effects are observed for fluctuations within the inertial range. By analyzing magnetic field spectra and fourth-order moments, we perform a comparative study of intermittency in different types of solar wind measured during periods of solar minima and a maximum. Using eight fast solar wind intervals measured during solar minima between 0.3 au and 3.16 au, we found a clear signature of two inertial sub-ranges with $f^{-3/2}$ and $f^{-5/3}$ power laws in the magnetic power spectra. The intermittency, measured through the scaling law of the kurtosis of magnetic field fluctuations, further confirms the existence of two different power laws separated by a clear break. A systematic study on the evolution of the said sub-ranges as a function of heliospheric distance shows correlation of the break scale with both the turbulence outer scale and the typical ion scales. During solar maximum, we analyzed five intervals for each of Alfv\'enic fast, Alfv\'enic slow and non-Alfv\'enic slow solar wind. Unlike the case during the solar minima, the two sub-ranges are no longer prominent and the Alfv\'enic slow wind is found to be in an intermediate state of turbulence compared to that of the fast wind and the usual non-Alfv\'enic slow wind.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03133v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In physics, accurately modeling large-scale phenomena such as core-collapse supernovae, (CCSN), and neutron star mergers are computationally challenging and require solving large sets of partial and ordinary differential equations. Traditional methods used widely in the scientific community are predominantly implicit, which are approximations that often require drastic simplifications and can be computationally inefficient. This thesis presents results on a new software suite titled "Fast Explicit Neutrino Networks" or "FENN", that introduces a suite of algebraically stabilized explicit methods known as explicit asymptotic for modeling Neutrino Electron Scattering, (NES), presenting a novel approach that combines the stability of traditional methods with enhanced computational efficiency. Initial results show that FENN can deliver accurate solutions for neutrino networks at improved computational speeds. This thesis further covers new results for scaled networks beyond the constraints of standard energy groupings, as well as the dynamics of neutrino interactions such as the scattering of various neutrino flavors -- electron neutrinos ($\nu_e$), electron anti-neutrinos ($\bar{\nu}_e$), and muon/tau neutrinos ($\nu_{\mu,\tau}$) as well as their anti-particles ($\bar{\nu}_{\mu,\tau}$) -- off electrons.</description>

      <title>Electron shock drift acceleration at a low-Mach-number, low-plasma-beta quasi-perpendicular shock</title>

Abstract: Shock drift acceleration plays an important role in generating high-energy electrons at quasi-perpendicular shocks, but its efficiency in low beta plasmas is questionable. In this article, we perform a two-dimensional particle-in-cell simulation of a low-Mach-number low-plasma-beta quasi-perpendicular shock, and find that the electron cyclotron drift instability is unstable at the leading edge of the shock foot, which is excited by the relative drift between the shock-reflected ions and the incident electrons. The electrostatic waves triggered by the electron cyclotron drift instability can scatter and heat the incident electrons, which facilitates them to escape from the shock's loss cone. These electrons are then reflected by the shock and energized by shock drift acceleration. In this way, the acceleration efficiency of shock drift acceleration at low-plasma-beta quasi-perpendicular shocks is highly enhanced.</description>

      <title>Theory of Turbulent Equilibrium Spheres with Power-Law Linewidth-Size Relation</title>

Abstract: Dense cores inherit turbulent motions from the interstellar medium in which they form. As a tool for comparison to both simulations and observations, it is valuable to construct theoretical core models that can relate their internal density and velocity structure while predicting their stability to gravitational collapse. To this end, we solve the angle-averaged equations of hydrodynamics under two assumptions: 1) the system is in a quasi-steady equilibrium; 2) the velocity field consists of radial bulk motion plus isotropic turbulence, with turbulent dispersion increasing as a power-law in the radius. The resulting turbulent equilibrium sphere (TES) solutions form a two-parameter family, characterized by the sonic radius $r_s$ and the power-law index $p$. The TES is equivalent to the Bonnor-Ebert (BE) sphere when $r_s\to \infty$. The density profile in outer regions of the TES is slightly shallower than the BE sphere, but is steeper than the logotropic model. Stability analysis shows that the TESs with size exceeding a certain critical radius are unstable to radial perturbations. The center-to-edge density contrast, mass, and radius of the marginally stable TES all increase with increasing average velocity dispersion. The FWHM of the column density profile is always smaller than the critical radius, by a larger factor at higher velocity dispersion, suggesting that observations need to probe beyond the FWHM to capture the full extent of turbulent cores. When applied to the highly turbulent regime typical of cluster-forming clumps, the critical mass and radius of the TES intriguingly resembles the typical mass and radius of observed star clusters.</description>

      <title>The star formation histories, star formation efficiencies and ionizing sources of ATLASGAL clumps with HII regions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 1226 ATLASGAL clumps with HII regions were matched with radio sources in the CORNISH-North/South surveys, and 392 of them have corresponding radio sources. We determined the stellar luminosity according to the Lyman continuum flux. When the bolometric luminosity of HII-clumps is less than $\approx$ 10$^{3.7}$ L$_{\odot}$, corresponding to a clump mass $\approx$ 10$^{2.55}$ M$_{\odot}$, the stellar luminosities derived from the Lyman continuum flux overestimate the actual stellar luminosities, because the accretion onto the protostars contributes significantly to the radio emission. After subtracting the accretion luminosity, we obtained reasonable estimates of the stellar luminosity. Using the 0.5 Myr isochrone, we calculated the stellar masses according to the stellar luminosities, and found that they roughly follow the $m_{\rm max}-M_{\rm ecl}$ relation of embedded clusters, consistent with the ionizing sources representing the most massive stars in the embedded clusters of HII-clumps. We also studied the contribution of the possible flaring activity to the observed stellar luminosity and found that they can be neglected. We further studied the change of SFE with the clump mass. According to the derived mass of the most massive star in each HII-clump, using the theoretical $m_{\rm max}-M_{\rm ecl}$ relation, we calculated the mass of the corresponding embedded cluster and then the SFE of the clump. The SFE decreases with increasing clump mass, with a median value of $\approx$0.3. We also independently derived the SFE for each HII-clump based on the model developed in our previous work. The SFEs of HII-clumps derived from the observation and the model are in good agreement. Concerning the star formation histories of the ATLASGAL clumps, low-mass clumps may reach the peak of star formation earlier than high-mass clumps, consistent with the shorter free-fall time of low-mass clumps.</description>

      <title>Trajectory of the stellar flyby that shaped the outer solar system</title>

Abstract: Unlike the Solar System planets, thousands of smaller bodies beyond Neptune orbit the Sun on eccentric ($e &gt;$ 0.1) and ($i&gt;$ 3$^\circ$) orbits. While migration of the giant planets during the early stages of Solar System evolution can induce substantial scattering of trans-Neptunian objects (TNO), this process cannot account for the small number of distant TNOs ($r_p &gt;$ 60 au) outside the planets' reach. The alternative scenario of the close flyby of another star can instead produce all these TNO features simultaneously, but the possible parameter space for such an encounter is vast. Here, we compare observed TNO properties with thousands of flyby simulations to determine the specific properties of a flyby that reproduces all the different dynamical TNO populations, their location and their relative abundance and find that a 0.8$^{+0.1}_{-0.1}$ $M_{\odot}$ star passing at a distance of $ r_p =$ 110 $\mathbf{\pm}$ 10 au, inclined by $i$ = 70$^\circ$ $^{+5}_{-10}$ gives a near-perfect match. This flyby also replicates the retrograde TNO population, which has proved difficult to explain. Such a flyby is reasonably frequent; at least 140 million solar-type stars in the Milky Way are likely to have experienced a similar one. In light of these results, we predict that the upcoming Vera Rubin telescope will reveal that distant and retrograde TNOs are relatively common.</description>

      <title>Irregular moons possibly injected from the outer solar system by a stellar flyby</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03529v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The irregular moons orbit the giant planets on distant, inclined, and eccentric trajectories, in sharp contrast with the coplanar and quasicircular orbits of the regular moons. The origin of these irregular moons is still an open question, but these moons have a lot in common with the objects beyond Neptune (trans-Neptunian objects -- TNOs), suggestive of a common origin. Here, we show that the close flyby of a star may be the connecting element. A stellar flyby can simultaneously reproduce the complex TNO dynamics quantitatively while explaining the origin of the irregular moons and the colour distributions of both populations. This flyby would have catapulted 7.2% of the original TNO population into the region of the planets, many on retrograde orbits. Most injected TNOs would have been subsequently ejected from the solar system (85%). However, a considerable fraction would have had the potential to be captured by the planets. The exclusively distant origin of the injected TNOs may also explain the lack of very red irregular moons.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Field Alignment Relative to Multiple Tracers in the High-mass Star-forming Region RCW 36</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use polarization data from SOFIA HAWC+ to investigate the interplay between magnetic fields and stellar feedback in altering gas dynamics within the high-mass star-forming region RCW 36, located in Vela C. This region is of particular interest as it has a bipolar HII region powered by a massive star cluster which may be impacting the surrounding magnetic field. To determine if this is the case, we apply the Histogram of Relative Orientations (HRO) method to quantify the relative alignment between the inferred magnetic field and elongated structures observed in several datasets such as dust emission, column density, temperature, and spectral line intensity maps. The HRO results indicate a bimodal alignment trend, where structures observed with dense gas tracers show a statistically significant preference for perpendicular alignment relative to the magnetic field, while structures probed by photo-dissociation region (PDR) tracers tend to align preferentially parallel relative to the magnetic field. Moreover, the dense gas and PDR associated structures are found to be kinematically distinct such that a bimodal alignment trend is also observed as a function of line-of-sight velocity. This suggests that the magnetic field may have been dynamically important and set a preferred direction of gas flow at the time that RCW 36 formed, resulting in a dense ridge developing perpendicular to the magnetic field. However on filament-scales near the PDR region, feedback may be energetically dominating the magnetic field, warping its geometry and the associated flux-frozen gas structures, causing the observed the preference for parallel relative alignment.</description>

      <title>TOI-3568 b: a super-Neptune in the sub-Jovian desert</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The sub-Jovian desert is a region in the mass-period and radius-period parameter space, typically encompassing short-period ranges between super-Earths and hot Jupiters, that exhibits an intrinsic dearth of planets. This scarcity is likely shaped by photoevaporation caused by the stellar irradiation received by giant planets that have migrated inward. We report the detection and characterization of TOI-3568 b, a transiting super-Neptune with a mass of $26.4\pm1.0$ M$_\oplus$, a radius of $5.30\pm0.27$ R$_\oplus$, a bulk density of $0.98\pm0.15$ g cm$^{-3}$, and an orbital period of 4.417965(5) d situated in the vicinity of the sub-Jovian desert. This planet orbiting a K dwarf star with solar metallicity, was identified photometrically by TESS. It was characterized as a planet by our high-precision radial velocity monitoring program using MAROON-X at Gemini North, supplemented by additional observations from the SPICE large program with SPIRou at CFHT. We performed a Bayesian MCMC joint analysis of the TESS and ground-based photometry, MAROON-X and SPIRou radial velocities, to measure the orbit, radius, and mass of the planet, as well as a detailed analysis of the high-resolution flux and polarimetric spectra to determine the physical parameters and elemental abundances of the host star. Our results reveal TOI-3568 b as a hot super-Neptune, rich in hydrogen and helium with a core of heavier elements with a mass between 10 and 25 M$_\oplus$. We analyzed the photoevaporation status of TOI-3568 b and found that it experiences one of the highest EUV luminosities among planets with a mass M$_{\rm p}$ $&lt;2$ M$_{\rm Nep}$, yet it has an evaporation lifetime exceeding 5 Gyr. Positioned in the transition between two significant populations of exoplanets on the mass-period and energy diagrams, this planet presents an opportunity to test theories concerning the origin of the sub-Jovian desert.</description>

      <title>Strong constraints on the gravitational law from $Gaia$ DR3 wide binaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.03436v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We test Milgromian dynamics (MOND) using wide binary stars (WBs) with separations of $2-30$ kAU. Locally, the WB orbital velocity in MOND should exceed the Newtonian prediction by $\approx 20\%$ at asymptotically large separations given the Galactic external field effect (EFE). We investigate this with a detailed statistical analysis of $Gaia$ DR3 data on 8611 WBs within 250 pc of the Sun. Orbits are integrated in a rigorously calculated gravitational field that directly includes the EFE. We also allow line of sight contamination and undetected close binary companions to the stars in each WB. We interpolate between the Newtonian and Milgromian predictions using the parameter $\alpha_{\rm{grav}}$, with 0 indicating Newtonian gravity and 1 indicating MOND. Directly comparing the best Newtonian and Milgromian models reveals that Newtonian dynamics is preferred at $19\sigma$ confidence. Using a complementary Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis, we find that $\alpha_{\rm{grav}} = -0.021^{+0.065}_{-0.045}$, which is fully consistent with Newtonian gravity but excludes MOND at $16\sigma$ confidence. This is in line with the similar result of Pittordis and Sutherland using a somewhat different sample selection and less thoroughly explored population model. We show that although our best-fitting model does not fully reproduce the observations, an overwhelmingly strong preference for Newtonian gravity remains in a considerable range of variations to our analysis. Adapting the MOND interpolating function to explain this result would cause tension with rotation curve constraints. We discuss the broader implications of our results in light of other works, concluding that MOND must be substantially modified on small scales to account for local WBs.</description>

      <title>Tayler Instability Revisited</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19103v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tayler instability of toroidal magnetic fields $B_\phi$ is broadly invoked as a trigger for turbulence and angular momentum transport in stars. This paper presents a systematic revision of the linear stability analysis for a rotating, magnetized, and stably stratified star. For plausible configurations of $B_\phi$, instability requires diffusive processes: viscosity, magnetic diffusivity, or thermal/compositional diffusion. Our results reveal a new physical picture, demonstrating how different diffusive effects independently trigger instability of two types of waves in the rotating star: magnetostrophic waves and inertial waves. It develops via overstability of the waves, whose growth rate sharply peaks at some characteristic wavenumbers. We determine instability conditions for each wave branch and find the characteristic wavenumbers. The results are qualitatively different for stars with magnetic Prandtl number $Pm\ll 1$ (e.g. the Sun) and $Pm\gg 1$ (e.g. protoneutron stars). The parameter dependence of unstable modes suggests a non-universal scaling of the possible Tayler-Spruit dynamo.</description>

Abstract: After leaving the Sun's corona, the solar wind continues to accelerate and cools, but more slowly than expected for a freely expanding adiabatic gas. We use in situ measurements from the Parker Solar Probe and Solar Orbiter spacecrafts to investigate a stream of solar wind as it traverses the inner heliosphere. The observations show heating and acceleration of the the plasma between the outer edge of the corona and near the orbit of Venus, in connection to the presence of large amplitude Alfv\'en waves. Alfv\'en waves are perturbations in the interplanetary magnetic field that transport energy. Our calculations show the damping and mechanical work performed by the Alfv\'en waves is sufficient to power the heating and acceleration of the fast solar wind in the inner heliosphere.</description>

      <title>Magnetic helicity and energy budgets of jet events from an emerging solar active region</title>

Abstract: Using photospheric vector magnetograms obtained by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory and a magnetic connectivity-based method, we compute the magnetic helicity and free magnetic energy budgets of a simple bipolar solar active region (AR) during its magnetic flux emergence phase which lasted $\sim$47 hrs. The AR did not produce any coronal mass ejections (CMEs) or flares with an X-ray class above C1.0 but it was the site of 60 jet events during its flux emergence phase. The helicity and free energy budgets of the AR were below established eruption-related thresholds throughout the interval we studied. However, in addition to their slowly-varying evolution, each of the time profiles of the helicity and free energy budgets showed discrete localized peaks, with eight pairs of them occurring at times of jets emanating from the AR. These jets featured larger base areas and longer durations than the other jets of the AR. We estimated, for the first time, the helicity and free magnetic energy changes associated with these eight jets which were in the ranges of $0.5-7.1 \times 10^{40}$ Mx$^2$ and $1.1-6.9 \times 10^{29}$ erg, respectively. Although these values are one to two orders of magnitude smaller than those usually associated with CMEs, the relevant percentage changes were significant and ranged from 13% to 76% for the normalized helicity and from 9% to 57% for the normalized free magnetic energy. Our study indicates that occasionally jets may have a significant imprint in the evolution of helicity and free magnetic energy budgets of emerging active regions.</description>

Abstract: Spectral line observations encode a wealth of information. A key challenge, therefore, lies in the interpretation of these observations in terms of models to derive the physical and chemical properties of the astronomical environments from which they arise. In this paper, we present pomme: an open-source Python package that allows users to retrieve 1D or 3D models of physical properties, such as chemical abundance, velocity, and temperature distributions of (optically thin) astrophysical media, based on spectral line observations. We discuss how prior knowledge, for instance, in the form of a steady-state hydrodynamics model, can be used to guide the retrieval process, and demonstrate our methods both on synthetic and real observations of cool stellar winds.</description>

Abstract: Crustal quakes of highly magnetized neutron stars can disrupt their magnetospheres, triggering energetic phenomena like X-ray and fast radio bursts (FRBs). Understanding plasma wave dynamics in these extreme environments is vital for predicting energy transport across scales to the radiation length. This study models relativistic plasma wave interaction in magnetar magnetospheres with force-free electrodynamics simulations. For propagation along curved magnetic field lines, we observe the continuous conversion of Alfv\'en waves to fast magnetosonic (FMS) waves. The conversion efficiency can be up to three times higher when counter-propagating Alfv\'en waves interact in the equatorial region. Alfv\'en waves generate FMS waves of twice their frequency during their first crossing of the magnetosphere. After the initial transient burst of FMS waves, Alfv\'en waves convert to FMS waves periodically, generating variations on timescales of the magnetospheric Alfv\'en wave crossing time. This decaying FMS wave tail carries a significant portion (half) of the total energy emitted. Plastic damping of 'bouncing' Alfv\'en waves by the magnetar crust has minimal impact on the FMS efficiency. We discuss the implications of the identified wave phenomena for magnetar observations. Outgoing FMS waves can develop electric zones, potential sources of coherent radiation. Long-wavelength FMS waves could generate FRBs through reconnection beyond the light cylinder.</description>

      <title>Superfluid Spin-up: 3D Simulations of Post-Glitch Dynamics in Neutron Star Cores</title>

Abstract: The dynamics of a neutron star after a glitch involve the transfer of angular momentum from the crust (where the glitch is presumed to originate) to the liquid core, causing the core to spin up. The crust-core coupling, which determines how quickly this spin-up proceeds, can be achieved through various physical processes, including Ekman pumping, superfluid vortex-mediated mutual friction, and magnetic fields. Although the complex nature of these mechanisms has made it difficult to study their combined effects, analytical estimations for individual processes reveal that spin-up timescales vary according to the relative strength of Coriolis, viscous, and mutual friction forces, as well as the magnetic field. However, experimental and numerical validations of those analytical predictions are limited. In this paper, we focus on viscous effects and mutual friction. We conduct non-linear hydrodynamical simulations of the spin-up problem in a two-component fluid by solving the incompressible Hall-Vinen-Bekarevich-Khalatnikov (HVBK) equations in the full sphere (i.e., including $r=0$) for the first time. We find that the viscous (normal) component accelerates due to Ekman pumping, although the mutual friction coupling to the superfluid component alters the spin-up dynamics compared to the single-fluid scenario. Close to the sphere's surface, the response of the superfluid is accurately described by the mutual friction timescale irrespective of its coupling strength with the normal component. However, as we move deeper into the sphere, the superfluid accelerates on different timescales due to the slow viscous spin-up of the internal normal fluid layers. We discuss potential implications for neutron stars and requirements for future work to build more realistic models.</description>
