      <title>Robust high-order low-rank BUG integrators based on explicit Runge-Kutta methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we propose high-order basis-update &amp; Galerkin (BUG) integrators based on explicit Runge-Kutta methods for large-scale matrix differential equations. These dynamical low-rank integrators are high-order extensions of the BUG integrator and are constructed by performing one time-step of the first-order BUG integrator at each stage of the Runge-Kutta method. In this way, the resulting Runge-Kutta BUG integrator is robust to the presence of small singular values and does not involve backward time-integration steps. We provide an error bound, which shows that the Runge-Kutta BUG integrator retains the order of convergence of the associated Runge-Kutta method until the error reaches a plateau corresponding to the low-rank truncation and which vanishes as the rank increases. This error bound is finally validated numerically on three different test cases. The results demonstrate the high-order convergence of the Runge-Kutta BUG integrator and its superior accuracy compared to other low-rank integrators proposed in the literature.</description>

      <title>A Closed-Form Transition Density Expansion for Elliptic and Hypo-Elliptic SDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a closed-form expansion for the transition density of elliptic and hypo-elliptic multivariate Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs), over a period $\Delta\in (0,1)$, in terms of powers of $\Delta^{j/2}$, $j\ge 0$. Our methodology provides approximations of the transition density, easily evaluated via any software that performs symbolic calculations. A major part of the paper is devoted to an analytical control of the remainder in our expansion for fixed $\Delta\in(0,1)$. The obtained error bounds validate theoretically the methodology, by characterising the size of the distance from the true value. It is the first time that such a closed-form expansion becomes available for the important class of hypo-elliptic SDEs, to the best of our knowledge. For elliptic SDEs, closed-form expansions are available, with some works identifying the size of the error for fixed $\Delta$, as per our contribution. Our methodology allows for a uniform treatment of elliptic and hypo-elliptic SDEs, when earlier works are intrinsically restricted to an elliptic setting. We show numerical applications highlighting the effectiveness of our method, by carrying out parameter inference for hypo-elliptic SDEs that do not satisfy stated conditions. The latter are sufficient for controlling the remainder terms, but the closed-form expansion itself is applicable in general settings.</description>

      <title>Stable Spectral-Volume Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel approach for the stabilization of the Spectral-Volume (SV) method based on Dafermos' entropy rate criterion is presented. The method is an adaption of an already existing approach for the stabilization of the Discontinuous-Galerkin (DG) method. It employs the same estimates for the maximal possible entropy dissipation rate as the DG version. However, a new way to compute the discrete conservative filter had to be derived due to the differences of the underlying schemes. The resulting modified SV scheme even satisfies the entropy inequality. Tests are carried out for Burgers' equation and for the Euler equations of gas dynamics.</description>

      <title>Neural network-motivated regularity analysis of inverse problems and application to inverse scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive Lipschitz regularity estimates for an approximate inverse of a general compact operator that depends non-linearly on a vector parameter. The regularity estimates are motivated by the desire to develop neural networks (NN) that compute that approximate inverse and the convergence of the NNs follows from the Lipschitz regularity estimates. Such compact operators arise in inverse wave scattering applications with unbounded domains, and we illustrate our theory by showing that the particular assumptions of our regularity analysis hold for the problem of identifying cracks from far field data. Numerical results using a NN for parameter recovery demonstrate the accuracy, efficiency and robustness of our approach.</description>

      <title>Nonequispaced fast Fourier transforms for bandlimited functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we consider the problem of approximating function evaluations $f(\boldsymbol x_j)$ at given nonequispaced points $\boldsymbol x_j$, $j=1,\dots N$, of a bandlimited function from given values $\hat{f}(\boldsymbol k)$, $\boldsymbol k\in \mathcal I_{\boldsymbol M}$, of its Fourier transform. Note that if a trigonometric polynomial is given, it is already known that this problem can be solved by means of the nonequispaced fast Fourier transform (NFFT). In other words, we introduce a new NFFT-like procedure for bandlimited functions, which is based on regularized Shannon sampling formulas.</description>

      <title>Operator splitting algorithm for structured population models on metric spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a numerical scheme for structured population models defined on a separable and complete metric space. In particular, we consider a generalized version of a transport equation with additional growth and non-local interaction terms in the space of nonnegative Radon measures equipped with the flat metric. The solutions, given by families of Radon measures, are approximated by linear combinations of Dirac measures. For this purpose, we introduce a finite-range approximation of the measure-valued model functions, provided that they are linear. By applying an operator splitting technique, we are able to separate the effects of the transport from those of growth and the non-local interaction. We derive the order of convergence of the numerical scheme, which is linear in the spatial discretization parameters and polynomial of order $\alpha$ in the time step size, assuming that the model functions are $\alpha$ H\"older regular in time. In a second step, we show that our proposed algorithm can approximate the posterior measure of Bayesian inverse models, which will allow us to link model parameters to measured data in the future.</description>

      <title>Compact Runge-Kutta Flux Reconstruction for Hyperbolic Conservation Laws with admissibility preservation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compact Runge-Kutta (cRK) Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods, recently introduced in [Q. Chen, Z. Sun, and Y. Xing, SIAM J. Sci. Comput. SIAM J. Sci. Comput., 46: A1327-A1351, 2024], are a variant of RKDG methods for solving hyperbolic conservation laws and are characterized by their compact stencil including only immediate neighboring finite elements. This article proposes a cRK Flux Reconstruction (FR) method by interpreting cRK as a procedure to approximate time-averaged fluxes, which requires computing only a single numerical flux for each time step and further reduces data communication. The numerical flux is carefully constructed to maintain the same Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) numbers as cRKDG methods and achieve optimal accuracy uniformly across all polynomial degrees, even for problems with sonic points. A subcell-based blending limiter is then applied for problems with nonsmooth solutions, which uses Gauss-Legendre solution points and performs MUSCL-Hancock reconstruction on subcells to mitigate the additional dissipation errors. Additionally, to achieve a fully admissibility-preserving cRKFR scheme, a flux limiter is applied to the time-averaged numerical flux to ensure admissibility preservation in the means, combined with a positivity-preserving scaling limiter. The method is further extended to handle source terms by incorporating their contributions as additional time averages. Numerical experiments including Euler equations and the ten-moment problem are provided to validate the claims regarding the method's accuracy, robustness, and admissibility preservation.</description>

      <title>A conservative semi-Lagrangian scheme for the ellipsoidal BGK model of the Boltzmann equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a high order conservative semi-Lagrangian scheme (SL) for the ellipsoidal BGK model of the Boltzmann transport equation. To avoid the time step restriction induced by the convection term, we adopt the semi-Lagrangian approach. For treating the nonlinear stiff relaxation operator with small Knudsen number, we employ high order $L$-stable diagonally implicit Runge-Kutta time discretization or backward difference formula. The proposed implicit schemes are designed to update solutions explicitly without resorting to any Newton solver. We present several numerical tests to demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed methods. These methods allow us to obtain accurate approximations of the solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations or the Boltzmann equation for moderate or relatively large Knudsen numbers, respectively.</description>

      <title>Efficient finite element methods for semiclassical nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations with random potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose two time-splitting finite element methods to solve the semiclassical nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation (NLSE) with random potentials. We then introduce the multiscale finite element method (MsFEM) to reduce the degrees of freedom in the physical space. We construct multiscale basis functions by solving optimization problems and rigorously analyze two time-splitting MsFEMs for the semiclassical NLSE with random potentials. We provide the $L^2$ error estimate of the proposed methods and show that they achieve second-order accuracy in both spatial and temporal spaces and an almost first-order convergence rate in the random space. Additionally, we present a multiscale reduced basis method to reduce the computational cost of constructing basis functions for solving random NLSEs. Finally, we carry out several 1D and 2D numerical examples to validate the convergence of our methods and investigate wave propagation behaviors in the NLSE with random potentials.</description>

      <title>A model reduction method for solving the eigenvalue problem of semiclassical random Schr\"odinger operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we compute the eigenvalue problem (EVP) for the semiclassical random Schr\"odinger operators, where the random potentials are parameterized by an infinite series of random variables. After truncating the series, we introduce the multiscale finite element method (MsFEM) to approximate the resulting parametric EVP. We then use the quasi-Monte Carlo (qMC) method to calculate empirical statistics within a finite-dimensional random space. Furthermore, using a set of low-dimensional proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) basis functions, the referred degrees of freedoms for constructing multiscale basis are independent of the spatial mesh. Given the bounded assumption on the random potentials, we then derive and prove an error estimate for the proposed method. Finally, we conduct numerical experiments to validate the error estimate. In addition, we investigate the localization of eigenfunctions for the Schr\"odinger operator with spatially random potentials. The results show that our method provides a practical and efficient solution for simulating complex quantum systems governed by semiclassical random Schr\"odinger operators.</description>

      <title>On the relation between Galerkin approximations and canonical best-approximations of solutions to some non-linear Schr\"odinger equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish a superconvergence property of Galerkin approximations to some non-linear Schr\"odinger equations of Gross-Pitaevskii type. More precisely, denoting by $u^*\in X \subseteq H^1(\Omega)$ the exact solution to such an equation, by $\{X_{\delta}\}_{\delta &gt;0}$, a sequence of conforming subspaces of $X$ satisfying the approximation property, by $u_\delta^*\in X_{\delta}$ the Galerkin solution to the equation, and by $\Pi^X_{\delta} u^*$, the $(\cdot, \cdot)_{X}$-best approximation in $X_\delta$ of $u^*$, we show -- under some assumptions -- that $u_\delta^*$ converges at a higher rate to $\Pi^X_{\delta} u^*$ than to $u^*$ in both the $L^2$ norm and the canonical $H^1$ norm. Our results apply to conforming finite element discretisations as well as spectral Galerkin methods based on polynomials or Fourier (plane-wave) expansions.</description>

      <title>A BDDC Preconditioner for the Cardiac EMI Model in three Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze a Balancing Domain Decomposition by Constraints (BDDC) preconditioner for the solution of three dimensional composite Discontinuous Galerkin discretizations of reaction-diffusion systems of ordinary and partial differential equations arising in cardiac cell-by-cell models like the Extracellular space, Membrane and Intracellular space (EMI) Model. These microscopic models are essential for the understanding of events in aging and structurally diseased hearts which macroscopic models relying on homogenized descriptions of the cardiac tissue, like Monodomain and Bidomain models, fail to adequately represent. The modeling of each individual cardiac cell results in discontinuous global solutions across cell boundaries, requiring the careful construction of dual and primal spaces for the BDDC preconditioner. We provide a scalable condition number bound for the precondition operator and validate the theoretical results with extensive numerical experiments.</description>

Abstract: We study the minimal denominator problem in function fields. In particular, we compute the probability distribution function of the the random variable which returns the degree of the smallest denominator $Q$, for which the ball of a fixed radius around a point contains a rational function of the form $\frac{P}{Q}$. Moreover, we discuss the distribution of the random variable which returns the denominator of minimal degree, as well as higher dimensional and $P$-adic generalizations. This can be viewed as a function field generalization of a paper by Chen and Haynes.</description>

      <title>Online Covariance Matrix Estimation in Sketched Newton Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given the ubiquity of streaming data, online algorithms have been widely used for parameter estimation, with second-order methods particularly standing out for their efficiency and robustness. In this paper, we study an online sketched Newton method that leverages a randomized sketching technique to perform an approximate Newton step in each iteration, thereby eliminating the computational bottleneck of second-order methods. While existing studies have established the asymptotic normality of sketched Newton methods, a consistent estimator of the limiting covariance matrix remains an open problem. We propose a fully online covariance matrix estimator that is constructed entirely from the Newton iterates and requires no matrix factorization. Compared to covariance estimators for first-order online methods, our estimator for second-order methods is batch-free. We establish the consistency and convergence rate of our estimator, and coupled with asymptotic normality results, we can then perform online statistical inference for the model parameters based on sketched Newton methods. We also discuss the extension of our estimator to constrained problems, and demonstrate its superior performance on regression problems as well as benchmark problems in the CUTEst set.</description>

      <title>A nested MLMC framework for efficient simulations on FPGAs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07123v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) reduces the total computational cost of financial option pricing by combining SDE approximations with multiple resolutions. This paper explores a further avenue for reducing cost and improving power efficiency through the use of low precision calculations on configurable hardware devices such as Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). We propose a new framework that exploits approximate random variables and fixed-point operations with optimised precision to generate most SDE paths with a lower cost and reduce the overall cost of the MLMC framework. We first discuss several methods for the cheap generation of approximate random Normal increments. To set the bit-width of variables in the path generation we then propose a rounding error model and optimise the precision of all variables on each MLMC level. With these key improvements, our proposed framework offers higher computational savings than the existing mixed-precision MLMC frameworks.</description>

Abstract: This paper proposes a Curriculum-Transfer-Learning based physics-informed neural network (CTL-PINN) for long-term simulation of physical and mechanical behaviors. The main innovation of CTL-PINN lies in decomposing long-term problems into a sequence of short-term subproblems. Initially, the standard PINN is employed to solve the first sub-problem. As the simulation progresses, subsequent time-domain problems are addressed using a curriculum learning approach that integrates information from previous steps. Furthermore, transfer learning techniques are incorporated, allowing the model to effectively utilize prior training data and solve sequential time domain transfer problems. CTL-PINN combines the strengths of curriculum learning and transfer learning, overcoming the limitations of standard PINNs, such as local optimization issues, and addressing the inaccuracies over extended time domains encountered in CL-PINN and the low computational efficiency of TL-PINN. The efficacy and robustness of CTL-PINN are demonstrated through applications to nonlinear wave propagation, Kirchhoff plate dynamic response, and the hydrodynamic model of the Three Gorges Reservoir Area, showcasing its superior capability in addressing long-term computational challenges.</description>

      <title>Efficient Sparsification of Simplicial Complexes via Local Densities of States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simplicial complexes (SCs), a generalization of graph models for relational data that account for higher-order relations between data items, have become a popular abstraction for analyzing complex data using tools from topological data analysis or topological signal processing. However, the analysis of many real-world datasets leads to dense SCs with a large number of higher-order interactions. Unfortunately, analyzing such large SCs often has a prohibitive cost in terms of computation time and memory consumption. The sparsification of such complexes, i.e., the approximation of an original SC with a sparser simplicial complex with only a log-linear number of high-order simplices while maintaining a spectrum close to the original SC, is of broad interest.
  In this work, we develop a novel method for a probabilistic sparsifaction of SCs. At its core lies the efficient computation of sparsifying sampling probability through local densities of states as functional descriptors of the spectral information. To avoid pathological structures in the spectrum of the corresponding Hodge Laplacian operators, we suggest a "kernel-ignoring" decomposition for approximating the sampling probability; additionally, we exploit error estimates to show asymptotically prevailing algorithmic complexity of the developed method. The performance of the framework is demonstrated on the family of Vietoris--Rips filtered simplicial complexes.</description>

      <title>Method of moments for Gaussian mixtures: Implementation and benchmarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07648v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gaussian mixture models are universal approximators in the sense that any smooth density can be approximated arbitrarily well with a Gaussian mixture model with enough components. Due to their broad expressive power, Gaussian mixture models appear in many applications. As a result, algebraic parameter recovery for Gaussian mixture models from data is a valuable contribution to multiple fields. Our work documents performance of the method of moments for high dimensional Gaussian mixtures. We outline the method of moments, and selections of moments and their corresponding polynomials that work well for parameter recovery in practice. Our main contribution puts these ideas into practice with an implementation as a julia package, GMMParameterEstimation, as well as computational benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Private Low-Rank Approximation for Covariance Matrices, Dyson Brownian Motion, and Eigenvalue-Gap Bounds for Gaussian Perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of approximating a $d \times d$ covariance matrix $M$ with a rank-$k$ matrix under $(\varepsilon,\delta)$-differential privacy. We present and analyze a complex variant of the Gaussian mechanism and obtain upper bounds on the Frobenius norm of the difference between the matrix output by this mechanism and the best rank-$k$ approximation to $M$. Our analysis provides improvements over previous bounds, particularly when the spectrum of $M$ satisfies natural structural assumptions. The novel insight is to view the addition of Gaussian noise to a matrix as a continuous-time matrix Brownian motion. This viewpoint allows us to track the evolution of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the matrix, which are governed by stochastic differential equations discovered by Dyson. These equations enable us to upper bound the Frobenius distance between the best rank-$k$ approximation of $M$ and that of a Gaussian perturbation of $M$ as an integral that involves inverse eigenvalue gaps of the stochastically evolving matrix, as opposed to a sum of perturbation bounds obtained via Davis-Kahan-type theorems. Subsequently, again using the Dyson Brownian motion viewpoint, we show that the eigenvalues of the matrix $M$ perturbed by Gaussian noise have large gaps with high probability. These results also contribute to the analysis of low-rank approximations under average-case perturbations, and to an understanding of eigenvalue gaps for random matrices, both of which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Estimating and using information in inverse problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.09095v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In inverse problems, one attempts to infer spatially variable functions from indirect measurements of a system. To practitioners of inverse problems, the concept of "information" is familiar when discussing key questions such as which parts of the function can be inferred accurately and which cannot. For example, it is generally understood that we can identify system parameters accurately only close to detectors, or along ray paths between sources and detectors, because we have "the most information" for these places. Although referenced in many publications, the "information" that is invoked in such contexts is not a well understood and clearly defined quantity.
  Herein, we present a definition of information density that is based on the variance of coefficients as derived from a Bayesian reformulation of the inverse problem. We then discuss three areas in which this information density can be useful in practical algorithms for the solution of inverse problems, and illustrate the usefulness in one of these areas -- how to choose the discretization mesh for the function to be reconstructed -- using numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Derivative based global sensitivity analysis and its entropic link</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.00551v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Variance-based Sobol' sensitivity is one of the most well-known measures in global sensitivity analysis (GSA). However, uncertainties with certain distributions, such as highly skewed distributions or those with a heavy tail, cannot be adequately characterised using the second central moment only. Entropy-based GSA can consider the entire probability density function, but its application has been limited because it is difficult to estimate. Here we present a novel derivative-based upper bound for conditional entropies, to efficiently rank uncertain variables and to work as a proxy for entropy-based total effect indices. To overcome the non-desirable issue of negativity for differential entropies as sensitivity indices, we discuss an exponentiation of the total effect entropy and its proxy. Numerical verifications demonstrate that the upper bound is tight for monotonic functions and it provides the same input variable ranking as the entropy-based indices for about three-quarters of the 1000 random functions tested. We found that the new entropy proxy performs similarly to the variance-based proxies for a river flood physics model with 8 inputs of different distributions, and these two proxies are equivalent in the special case of linear functions with Gaussian inputs. We expect the new entropy proxy to increase the variable screening power of derivative-based GSA and to complement Sobol'-indices proxy for a more diverse type of distributions.</description>

Abstract: We study two fully discrete evolving surface finite element schemes for the Cahn-Hilliard equation on an evolving surface, given a smooth potential with polynomial growth. In particular we establish optimal order error bounds for a (fully implicit) backward Euler time-discretisation, and an implicit-explicit time-discretisation, with isoparametric surface finite elements discretising space.</description>

      <title>A priori error estimates for optimal control problems governed by the transient Stokes equations and subject to state constraints pointwise in time</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20702v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a state constrained optimal control problem governed by the transient Stokes equations. The state constraint is given by an L2 functional in space, which is required to fulfill a pointwise bound in time. The discretization scheme for the Stokes equations consists of inf-sup stable finite elements in space and a discontinuous Galerkin method in time, for which we have recently established best approximation type error estimates. Using these error estimates, for the discrete control problem we establish error estimates and as a by-product we show an improved regularity for the optimal control. We complement our theoretical analysis with numerical results.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid Iterative Neural Solver Based on Spectral Analysis for Parametric PDEs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08540v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, deep learning-based hybrid iterative methods (DL-HIM) have emerged as a promising approach for designing fast neural solvers to tackle large-scale sparse linear systems. DL-HIM combine the smoothing effect of simple iterative methods with the spectral bias of neural networks, which allows them to effectively eliminate both high-frequency and low-frequency error components. However, their efficiency may decrease if simple iterative methods can not provide effective smoothing, making it difficult for the neural network to learn mid-frequency and high-frequency components. This paper first conducts a convergence analysis for general DL-HIM from a spectral viewpoint, concluding that under reasonable assumptions, DL-HIM exhibit a convergence rate independent of grid size $h$ and physical parameters $\boldsymbol{\mu}$. To meet these assumptions, we design a neural network from an eigen perspective, focusing on learning the eigenvalues and eigenvectors corresponding to error components that simple iterative methods struggle to eliminate. Specifically, the eigenvalues are learned by a meta subnet, while the eigenvectors are approximated using Fourier modes with a transition matrix provided by another meta subnet. The resulting DL-HIM, termed the Fourier Neural Solver (FNS), can be trained to achieve a convergence rate independent of grid size and PDE parameters by designing a loss function that ensures the neural network complements the smoothing effect of Jacobi iterative methods. We verify the performance of FNS on six types of linear parametric PDEs.</description>

      <title>Shifted CholeskyQR for sparse matrices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06525v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we focus on CholeskyQR-type algorithms for sparse matrices. We introduce a new model for sparse matrices and categorize them into two types: $T_{1}$ matrices and $T_{2}$ matrices, based on the presence of dense columns. We provide alternative choices for the shifted parameter $s$ in Shifted CholeskyQR3 \cite{Shifted}, specifically tailored for sparse matrices, and conduct a rounding error analysis for the algorithm using this $s$. The alternative $s$ can enhance the applicability of Shifted CholeskyQR3 for $T_{1}$ matrices under appropriate element-norm conditions (ENCs). Our analytical approach utilizes the properties of the $g$-norm of the matrix, as outlined in \cite{New}. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our alternative $s$ significantly improves the applicability of Shifted CholeskyQR3 for $T_{1}$ matrices compared to the $s$ from \cite{New} under suitable ENCs. Shifted CholeskyQR3 with our alternative $s$ is also applicable to $T_{2}$ matrices, which are more ill-conditioned than the dense cases. Furthermore, Shifted CholeskyQR3 with our alternative $s$ shows good efficiency in these sparse cases.</description>

      <title>Deterministic and randomized LU-Householder CholeskyQR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06551v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we focus on improving LU-CholeskyQR2 \cite{LUChol}. Compared to other deterministic and randomized CholeskyQR-type algorithms, it does not require a sufficient condition on $\kappa_{2}(X)$ for the input tall-skinny matrix $X$, which ensures the algorithm's safety in most real-world applications. However, the Cholesky factorization step may break down when the $L$-factor after the LU factorization of $X$ is ill-conditioned. To address this, we construct a new algorithm, LU-Householder CholeskyQR2 (LHC2), which uses HouseholderQR to generate the upper-triangular factor, thereby avoiding numerical breakdown. Moreover, we utilize the latest sketching techniques to develop randomized versions of LHC: SLHC and SSLHC. We provide a rounding error analysis for these new algorithms. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our three new algorithms have better applicability and can handle a wider range of matrices compared to LU-CholeskyQR2. With the sketching technique, our randomized algorithms, SLHC2 and SSLHC3, show significant acceleration over LHC2. Additionally, SSLHC3, which employs multi-sketching, is more efficient than SLHC2 and exhibits better numerical stability. It is also robust as a deterministic algorithm.</description>

      <title>Multicriteria Optimization and Decision Making: Principles, Algorithms and Case Studies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00359v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Real-world decision and optimization problems, often involve constraints and conflicting criteria. For example, choosing a travel method must balance speed, cost, environmental footprint, and convenience. Similarly, designing an industrial process must consider safety, environmental impact, and cost efficiency. Ideal solutions where all objectives are optimally met are rare; instead, we seek good compromises and aim to avoid lose-lose scenarios. Multicriteria optimization offers computational techniques to compute Pareto optimal solutions, aiding decision analysis and decision making. This reader offers an introduction to this topic and has been developed on the basis of the revised edition of the reader for the MSc computer science course "Multicriteria Optimization and Decision Analysis" at the Leiden Institute of Advanced Computer Science, Leiden University, The Netherlands. This course was taught annually by the first author from 2007 to 2023 as a single semester course with lectures and practicals. Our aim was to make the material accessible to MSc students who do not study mathematics as their core discipline by introducing basic numerical analysis concepts when necessary and providing numerical examples for interesting cases. The introduction is organized in a unique didactic manner developed by the authors, starting from more simple concepts such as linear programming and single-point methods, and advancing from these to more difficult concepts such as optimality conditions for nonlinear optimization and set-oriented solution algorithms. Besides, we focus on the mathematical modeling and foundations rather than on specific algorithms, though not excluding the discussion of some representative examples of solution algorithms.</description>
