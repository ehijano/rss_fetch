      <title>Growth of associated monomial algebras with application to Manturov groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well-known that an associative algebra shares the same growth and Gelfand-Kirillov dimension (GK-dimension) as its associated monomial algebra with respect to a degree-lexicographic order. This article mainly investigates the relationship between the GK-dimension of an algebra and that of its associated monomial algebra with respect to a monomial order. We obtain sufficient conditions on a monomial order such that these two algebras have the same GK-dimension. Our result generalizes the well-known result and has several applications. In particular, as an application, we study the growth of Manturov $(k,n)$-groups for positive integers $n&gt;k$. It is shown that the Manturov $(1,n)$-group has growth equal to $0$ for all $n&gt;1$; the Manturov $(2,3)$-group has growth equal to $2$; and, for all $n&gt;k\geq3$, the Manturov $(k,n)$-group contains a free subgroup of rank $2$ and thus has exponential growth.</description>

      <title>Efficient Compression in Semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Straight-line programs are a central tool in several areas of computer science, including data compression, algebraic complexity theory, and the algorithmic solution of algebraic equations. In the algebraic setting, where straight-line programs can be interpreted as circuits over algebraic structures such as semigroups or groups, they have led to deep insights in computational complexity.
  A key result by Babai and Szemer\'edi (1984) showed that finite groups afford efficient compression via straight-line programs, enabling the design of a black-box computation model for groups. Building on their result, Fleischer (2019) placed the Cayley table membership problem for certain classes (pseudovarieties) of finite semigroups in NPOLYLOGTIME, and in some cases even in FOLL. He also provided a complete classification of pseudovarieties of finite monoids affording efficient compression.
  In this work, we complete this classification program initiated by Fleischer, characterizing precisely those pseudovarieties of finite semigroups that afford efficient compression via straight-line programs. Along the way, we also improve several known bounds on the length and width of straight-line programs over semigroups, monoids, and groups. These results lead to new upper bounds for the membership problem in the Cayley table model: for all pseudovarieties that afford efficient compression and do not contain any nonsolvable group, we obtain FOLL algorithms. In particular, we resolve a conjecture of Barrington, Kadau, Lange, and McKenzie (2001), showing that the membership problem for all solvable groups is in FOLL.</description>

      <title>Primeness property for regular gradings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $K$ be an algebraically closed field of characteristic $0$ and $G$ a finite abelian group. For a $G$-graded $K$-algebra $A$, we define the primeness property for graded central polynomials: for any graded polynomials $f$ and $g$ in disjoint sets of variables, if $fg$ is graded central, then both $f$ and $g$ are graded central. Let $A=\bigoplus_{g\in G} A_g$ be its decomposition into homogeneous components. Assume that for every $n$-tuple $(g_1,\dots,g_n)$ in $G$, there exist $a_{i}\in A_{g_{i}}$ with $a_1\cdots a_n\neq 0$, and that for each $g$,$h\in G$ there exists a scalar $\beta(g,h)\in K^{\ast}$ such that $a_ga_h=\beta(g,h)a_ha_g$. Then the grading is regular, and minimal if no distinct $g$, $h\in G$ satisfy $\beta(g,x)=\beta(h,x)$ for all $x\in G$.
  We prove that $G$-graded regular algebras, including $M_n(K)$ with the Pauli grading, fail the primeness property. For matrices of orders $2$ and $3$, no nontrivial gradings satisfy primeness. Finally, for $\mathbb{Z}_2$-graded regular algebras, we use the known fact that minimal regular gradings satisfy the graded identities of the infinite-dimensional Grassmann algebra $E$ and contain a copy of $E$ to show that such algebras satisfy the primeness property in the ordinary sense. As a consequence, we show that minimality is not required for the regularity of the grading.</description>

      <title>Automorphisms of free metabelian Lie algebras, I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12884v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that all Chein automorphisms (or one-row transformations) of lower degree $\geq 4$ of a free metabelian Lie algebra $M_n$ of rank $n\geq 4$ over an arbitrary field $K$ of characteristic $\neq 3$ are tame. We then show that all exponential automorphisms of $M_n$ of lower degree $\geq 5$ are also tame under the same conditions. The same results hold for fields of any characteristic when $n\geq 5$. These results contradict some long-standing results in the area.
  We also prove that a large class of automorphisms of $M_n$ of rank $n\geq 4$ that move only two variables are almost tame, that is, they can be expressed as a product of Chein automorphisms.</description>

      <title>On the non-zero divisor graph of the Hamilton quaternions over $\mathbb Z_{2^n}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16795v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $R$ be a ring with unity. The non-zero divisor graph of $R$, $\Phi(R)$, is the graph with vertex set $R\backslash \{0,1,-1\}$, and two vertices $x$ and $y$ are adjacent if and only if either $xy$ or $yx$ is non-zero. In this article we associate $\Phi(R)$ to the ring of Hamilton quaternions over $\mathbb Z_{2^n}$, $\mathbb H(\mathbb Z_{2^n})$. The detailed structure of the elements in $\mathbb H(\mathbb Z_{2^n})$ is presented, based on which various structural properties of the graph $\Phi(\mathbb H(\mathbb Z_{2^n}))$, such as connectedness, adjacency of vertices, traversability, and planarity, are studied. Furthermore, we derive bounds for clique number and chromatic number.</description>
