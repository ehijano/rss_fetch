      <title>Effects of degumming conditions on the structure of the regenerated silk fibroin and the properties of its film</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The traditional degumming method using sodium carbonate solution severely damages the structure of silk fibroin and results in low molecular weight, which limits the properties and applications of silk materials. In this study, we report a modified degumming method and compared it with the traditional one. The results indicate that compared with the traditional degumming method, the modified degumming method produces silk fibroin with higher \b{eta}-sheet content (53.43% vs 46.68%), higher crystallinity (44.92% vs 42.72%), and more concentrated molecular weight (100 ~ 300 kDa vs 72 ~ 300 kDa), while allowing for the same full removal of sericin. Correspondingly, the film of the silk fibroin prepared with the modified degumming method exhibits higher \b{eta}-sheet content (35.22% vs 32.82%), higher crystallinity (26.96% vs 25.53%), and higher tensile strength (87.91 MPa vs 72.62 MPa). This work provides a degumming method superior to the traditional one and lays a foundation for the development of high-performance silk materials.</description>

      <title>Emergence of a dynamical state of coherent bursting with power-law distributed avalanches from collective stochastic dynamics of adaptive neurons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spontaneous brain activity in the absence of external stimuli is not random but contains complex dynamical structures such as neuronal avalanches with power-law duration and size distributions. These experimental observations have been interpreted as supporting evidence for the hypothesis that the brain is operating at criticality and attracted much attention. Here, we show that an entire state of coherent bursting, with power-law distributed avalanches and features as observed in experiments, emerges in networks of adaptive neurons with stochastic input when excitation is sufficiently strong and balanced by adaptation. We demonstrate that these power-law distributed avalanches are direct consequences of stochasticity and the oscillatory population firing rate arising from coherent bursting, which in turn is the result of the balance between excitation and adaptation, and criticality does not play a role.</description>

      <title>A transportable hyperspectral imaging setup based on fast, high-density spectral scanning for in situ quantitative biochemical mapping of fresh tissue biopsies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Histopathological examination of surgical biopsies, such as in glioma and glioblastoma resection, is hindered in current clinical practice by the long times required for the laboratory analysis and pathological screening, typically taking several days or even weeks to be completed. We propose here a transportable, high-density, spectral-scanning based hyperspectral imaging setup, named HyperProbe1, that can provide in situ, fast biochemical analysis and mapping of fresh surgical tissue samples, right after excision, and without the need of fixing or staining. HyperProbe1 is based on spectral scanning via supercontinuum laser illumination filtered with acousto-optic tuneable filters. Such methodology allows the user to select any number and type of wavelength bands in the visible and near-infrared range between 510 and 900 nm (up to 79), and to reconstruct 3D hypercubes composed of high-resolution, widefield images of the surgical samples, where each pixel is associated with a complete spectrum. The system is applied on 11 fresh surgical biopsies of glioma from routine patients, including different grades of tumour classification. Quantitative analysis of the composition of the tissue is performed via fast spectral unmixing to reconstruct mapping of major biomarkers. We also provided a preliminary attempt to infer tumour classification based on differences of composition in the samples, suggesting the possibility to use lipid content and differential cytochrome-c-oxidase concentrations to distinguish between lower and higher grade gliomas. A proof-of-concept of the performances of HyperProbe1 for quantitative, biochemical mapping of surgical biopsies is demonstrated, paving the way for improving current post-surgical, histopathological practice via non-destructive, in situ streamlined screening of fresh tissue samples in a matter of minutes after excision.</description>
