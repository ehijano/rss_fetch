      <title>Complex Valued Deep Operator Network (DeepONet) $[\mathcal{G}]$ for Three Dimensional Maxwell's Equations: $\mathcal{G} \in \mathbb{C}^{m \times n}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Maxwell's equations, a system of linear partial differential equations (PDEs), describe the behavior of electric and magnetic fields in time and space and is essential for many important electromagnetic applications. Although numerical methods have been applied successfully in the past, the primary challenge in solving these equations arises from the frequency of electromagnetic fields, which depends on the shape and size of the objects to be resolved. The frequency dictates the grid size used for the spatial discretization of the PDEs. Since the domain of influence for these equations is compactly supported, even a small perturbation in frequency necessitates a new discretization of Maxwell's equations, resulting in substantial computational costs. In this work, we investigate the potential of neural operators, particularly the Deep Operator Network (DeepONet) and its variants, as a surrogate model for Maxwell's equations. Existing DeepONet implementations are restricted to real-valued data in $\mathbb{R}^n$, but since the time-harmonic Maxwell's equations yield solutions in the complex domain $\mathbb{C}^n$, a specialized architecture is required to handle complex algebra. We propose a formulation of DeepONet for complex data, define the forward pass in the complex domain, and adopt a reparametrized version of DeepONet for more efficient training. We also propose a unified framework to combine a plurality of DeepONets, trained for multiple electromagnetic field components, to incorporate the boundary condition. As shown by computational experiments, our method significantly enhances the efficiency of predicting scattered fields from a spherical object at arbitrary high frequencies.</description>

      <title>Diffuse interface treatment in generalized curvilinear coordinates with grid-adapting interface thickness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A general approach for transforming phase field equations into generalized curvilinear coordinates is proposed in this work. The proposed transformation can be applied to isotropic, non-isotropic, and curvilinear grids without adding any ambiguity in determining the phase field parameters. Moreover, it accurately adapts the interface thickness to the local grid-size for a general curvilinear grid without creating oscillations. Three canonical verification tests are presented on four grids with varying skewness levels. The classic advection and drop in shear tests are extended to curvilinear grids and show that the original phase field on Cartesian grids and the proposed curvilinear form have an identical order of convergence. Additionally, the proposed method is shown to provide grid-independent convergence on a two-way coupled compressible Rayleigh-Taylor instability. These simulations illustrate the robustness and accuracy of the proposed method for handling complex interfacial structures on generalized curvilinear grids.</description>

      <title>On analytical integration of interaction potentials between cylindrical and rectangular bodies with a focus on van der Waals attraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper deals with the analytical integration of interaction potentials between specific geometries such as disks, cylinders, rectangles, and rectangular prisms. Interaction potentials are modeled as inverse-power laws with respect to the point-pair distance, and the complete body-body potential is obtained by pairwise summation (integration). Several exact new interaction laws are obtained, such as disk-plate and (in-plane) rectangle-rectangle for an arbitrary exponent, and disk-disk and rectangle-rectangle for van der Waals attraction. To balance efficiency and accuracy, additional approximate laws are proposed for disk-disk, point-cylinder, and disk-cylinder interactions. A brief numerical example illustrates the application of the pre-integrated Lennard-Jones disk-disk interaction potential for the interaction between elastic fibers.</description>

      <title>Continuous Approximation of the Fully Connected Ising Hamiltonian: Exact Ground State Solutions for a Novel Class of Ising Models with Applications to Fidelity Assessment in Ising Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we present a novel analytical approach to solving large-scale Ising problems by reformulating the discrete Ising Hamiltonian into a continuous framework. This transformation enables us to derive exact solutions for a non-trivial class of fully connected Ising models. To validate our method, we conducted numerical experiments comparing our analytical solutions with those obtained from a quantum-inspired Ising algorithm and a quantum Ising machine. The results demonstrate that the quantum-inspired algorithm and brute-force method successfully align with our solutions, while the quantum Ising machine exhibits notable deviations. Our method offers promising avenues for analytically solving diverse Ising problem instances, while the class of Ising problems addressed here provides a robust framework for assessing the fidelity of Ising machines.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid Immersed-Boundary/Front-Tracking Method for Interface-Resolved Simulation of Droplet Evaporation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18753v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A hybrid sharp-interface immersed-boundary/front-tracking (IB/FT) method is developed for interface-resolved simulation of evaporating droplets in incompressible multiphase flows. A one-field formulation is used to solve the flow, species mass fraction and energy equations in the entire computational domain with appropriate jump conditions at the interface. An image point and ghost cell methodology is coupled with a front-tracking method to achieve an overall second order spatial accuracy for the mass fraction boundary condition on the droplet surface. The immersed-boundary method is also extended to simulate mass transfer from a solid sphere in a convective environment. The numerical method is first validated for the standard benchmark cases and the results are found to be in good agreement with analytical solutions. The method is shown to be overall second order accurate in space. Employing a moving reference frame methodology, the method is then applied to simulate evaporation of a deformable droplet in a convective environment and the results are compared with the existing evaporation models widely used in spray combustion simulations.</description>

      <title>Short-Range Order Based Ultra Fast Large-Scale Modeling of High-Entropy Alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-Entropy Alloys (HEAs) exhibit complex atomic interactions, with short-range order (SRO) playing a critical role in determining their properties. Traditional methods, such as Monte Carlo (MC) and hybrid MC-Molecular Dynamics (MC-MD), are often constrained by system size and computational inefficiency, limiting their applicability for large-scale modeling. We introduce PyHEA, a high-performance Python package with a C++ core, designed to efficiently model HEAs through a combination of global and local search algorithms, incremental SRO calculations, and GPU acceleration. PyHEA delivers an impressive speedup of more than 110,000x over state-of-the-art tools like SCRAPs and ATAT, ensuring accurate SRO calculations with unprecedented efficiency. In practical applications, PyHEA successfully modeled a 256,000-atom Fe-Mn-Cr-Co alloy, replicating literature results and reducing computational time by over tenfold compared to hybrid MC-MD approaches. By eliminating the need for MC-MD hybridization, PyHEA reduces SRO simulation times from hours to minutes, offering a scalable and efficient tool for HEA research. This advancement enables unprecedented scale and efficiency in modeling atomic structures and SRO, accelerating HEA research and development.</description>

      <title>Shallow Quantum Scalar Products with Phase Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19072v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The measurement of scalar products between two vectors is a common task in scientific computing and, by extension, in quantum computing. In this work, we introduce two alternative quantum circuits for computing scalar products with phase information, combining the structure of the swap test, the vacuum test, and the Hadamard test. These novel frameworks, called the zero-control and one-control tests, present different trade-offs between circuit depth and qubit count for accessing the scalar product between two quantum states. We demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces the gate count for large numbers of qubits and decreases the scaling of quantum requirements compared to the Hadamard test.</description>

      <title>Crank-Nicolson BGK Integrator for Multi-Scale Particle-Based Kinetic Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solving the Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook (BGK) equation with a stochastic particle approach enables efficient and flexible simulations of flows in the transition regime, between continuum and free molecular flow. However, the usual first-order operator splitting between particle movement and relaxation imposes restrictions on the time step, causing the computational cost to increase with the gas density. The Crank-Nicolson stochastic particle BGK (CN-SPBGK) method is introduced here as an advanced particle-based kinetic solver designed for multi-scale gas flow simulations. This method integrates the BGK equation with second-order accuracy across all Knudsen number regimes without requiring additional parameters, while asymptotically preserving the Navier-Stokes flux in the continuum regime. Comparisons with pre-existing particle BGK methods are conducted on several test cases, with CN-SPBGK demonstrating more consistent convergence and accuracy.</description>

      <title>Inverse-design topology optimization of magnonic devices using level-set method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The inverse design approach in magnonics exploits the wave nature of magnons and machine learning to develop novel logical devices with unique functionalities that exceed the capabilities of analytical methods. Despite its potential in analog, Boolean, and neuromorphic computing, existing implementations are limited by memory usage, restricting computational depth and the design of complex devices. This study introduces a level-set parameterization approach for topology optimization, coupled with an adjoint-state method for memory-efficient solution of magnetization dynamics equations. The simulation platform employed is $\texttt{neuralmag}$, a GPU-accelerated micromagnetic software that features a unique nodal finite-difference discretization scheme integrated with automatic differentiation tools. To validate the proposed inverse design method, we first addressed a magnetic nanoparticle shape optimization task, demonstrating how additional constraints on the objective function can control the design solution space and govern the optimization process. Subsequently, the functionality of a magnonic demultiplexer was realized using a 300-nm-wide yttrium iron garnet conduit. This device achieves spatial frequency-selective separation of spin waves into distinct outputs. This task demonstrates the algorithm's efficiency in identifying local minima of the objective function across various initial topologies, establishing its effectiveness as a versatile inverse design tool for creating magnonic logic device designs.</description>

      <title>An unstructured adaptive mesh refinement for steady flows based on physics-informed neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mesh generation is essential for accurate and efficient computational fluid dynamics simulations. To resolve critical features in the flow, adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) is routinely employed in certain regions of the computational domain, where gradients or error estimates of the solution are often considered as the refining criteria. In many scenarios, however, these indicators can lead to unnecessary refinement over a large region, making the process a matter of trial and error and resulting in slow convergence of the computation. To this end, we propose a heuristic strategy that employs the residuals of the governing partial differential equations (PDEs) as a novel criterion to adaptively guide the mesh refining process. In particular, we leverage on the physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to integrate imprecise data obtained on a coarse mesh and the governing PDEs. Once trained, PINNs are capable of identifying regions of highest residuals of the Navier-Stokes/Euler equations and suggesting new potential vertices for the coarse mesh cells. Moreover, we put forth two schemes to maintain the quality of the refined mesh through the strategic insertion of vertices and the implementation of Delaunay triangulation. By applying the residuals-guided AMR to address a multitude of typical incompressible/compressible flow problems and comparing the outcomes with those of gradient-based methods, we illustrate that the former effectively attains a favorable balance between the computational accuracy and cost.</description>

      <title>Signal-based online acceleration and strain data fusion using B-splines and Kalman filter for full-field dynamic displacement estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Displacement plays a crucial role in structural health monitoring (SHM) and damage detection of structural systems subjected to dynamic loads. However, due to the inconvenience associated with the direct measurement of displacement during dynamic loading and the high cost of displacement sensors, the use of displacement measurements often gets restricted. In recent years, indirect estimation of displacement from acceleration and strain data has gained popularity. Several researchers have developed data fusion techniques to estimate displacement from acceleration and strain data. However, existing data fusion techniques mostly rely on system properties like mode shapes or finite element models and require accurate knowledge about the system for successful implementation. Hence, they have the inherent limitation of their applicability being restricted to relatively simple structures where such information is easily available. In this article, B-spline basis functions have been used to formulate a Kalman filter-based algorithm for acceleration and strain data fusion using only elementary information about the system, such as the geometry and boundary conditions, which is the major advantage of this method. Also, the proposed algorithm enables us to monitor the full-field displacement of the system online with only a limited number of sensors. The method has been validated on a numerically generated dataset from the finite element model of a tapered beam subjected to dynamic excitation. Later, the proposed data fusion technique was applied to an experimental benchmark test of a wind turbine blade under dynamic load to estimate the displacement time history. In both cases, the reconstructed displacement from strain and acceleration was found to match well with the response from the FE model.</description>

      <title>PACMANN: Point Adaptive Collocation Method for Artificial Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19632v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are an emerging tool for approximating the solution of Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) in both forward and inverse problems. PINNs minimize a loss function which includes the PDE residual determined for a set of collocation points. Previous work has shown that the number and distribution of these collocation points have a significant influence on the accuracy of the PINN solution. Therefore, the effective placement of these collocation points is an active area of research. Specifically, adaptive collocation point sampling methods have been proposed, which have been reported to scale poorly to higher dimensions. In this work, we address this issue and present the Point Adaptive Collocation Method for Artificial Neural Networks (PACMANN). Inspired by classic optimization problems, this approach incrementally moves collocation points toward regions of higher residuals using gradient-based optimization algorithms guided by the gradient of the squared residual. We apply PACMANN for forward and inverse problems, and demonstrate that this method matches the performance of state-of-the-art methods in terms of the accuracy/efficiency tradeoff for the low-dimensional problems, while outperforming available approaches for high-dimensional problems; the best performance is observed for the Adam optimizer. Key features of the method include its low computational cost and simplicity of integration in existing physics-informed neural network pipelines.</description>

      <title>Chirality-Dependent Kinetics of Single-Walled Carbon Nanotubes from Machine-Learning Force Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The origin of the chirality of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) has been a long-standing dispute. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations driven by machine-learning force fields (MLFF), which can study the interface dynamics under near ab-initio accuracy, provides a powerful technique to reveal the formation mechanism of SWCNTs. Here, we develop a cobalt-carbon MLFF and perform growth simulations on a cobalt catalyst to investigate the chirality preference of the growth of SWCNTs under the vapor-liquid-solid (VLS) regime. Through microkinetic modeling, we reproduce the observed growth and defect kinetics, demonstrating their dependence on the chirality. It is observed that while the initial chirality assignment is likely related to the configurational degeneracy of the nanotube caps, pentagon defects immediately form and resolve after nucleation. Such processes, which we name as diameter control mechanisms, not only control the diameter toward an optimum but also shift the chirality distribution drastically. Our work therefore offers a microkinetic modeling workflow for the chirality-dependent kinetics of the SWCNTs, highlighting the important contribution of the defect kinetics to the chirality origination.</description>

      <title>Probing quantum critical phase from neural network wavefunction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One-dimensional (1D) systems and models provide a versatile platform for emergent phenomena induced by strong electron correlation. In this work, we extend the newly developed real space neural network quantum Monte Carlo methods to study the quantum phase transition of electronic and magnetic properties. Hydrogen chains of different interatomic distances are explored systematically with both open and periodic boundary conditions, and fully correlated ground state many-body wavefunction is achieved via unsupervised training of neural networks. We demonstrate for the first time that neural networks are capable of capturing the quantum critical behavior of Tomonaga- Luttinger liquid (TLL), which is known to dominate 1D quantum systems. Moreover, we reveal the breakdown of TLL phase and the emergence of a Fermi liquid behavior, evidenced by abrupt changes in the spin structure and the momentum distribution. Such behavior is absent in commonly studied 1D lattice models and is likely due to the involvement of high-energy orbitals of hydrogen atoms. Our work highlights the powerfulness of neural networks for representing complex quantum phases.</description>

      <title>Deep potential for interaction between hydrated Cs+ and graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15797v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The influence of hydrated cation-{\pi} interaction forces on the adsorption and filtration capabilities of graphene-based membrane materials is significant. However, the lack of interaction potential between hydrated Cs+ and graphene limits the scope of adsorption studies. Here, it is developed that a deep neural network potential function model to predict the interaction force between hydrated Cs+ and graphene. The deep potential has DFT-level accuracy, enabling accurate property prediction. This deep potential is employed to investigate the properties of the graphene surface solution, including the density distribution, mean square displacement, and vibrational power spectrum of water. Furthermore, calculations of the molecular orbital electron distributions indicate the presence of electron migration in the molecular orbitals of graphene and hydrated Cs+, resulting in a strong electrostatic interaction force. The method provides a powerful tool to study the adsorption behavior of hydrated cations on graphene surfaces and offers a new solution for handling radionuclides.</description>

      <title>Critical analysis of multiple reentrant localization in an antiferromagnetic helix with transverse electric field: Hopping dimerization-free scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.02778v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reentrant localization (RL), a recently prominent phenomenon, traditionally links to the interplay of staggered correlated disorder and hopping dimerization, as indicated by prior research. Contrary to this paradigm, our present study demonstrates that hopping dimerization is not a pivotal factor in realizing RL. Considering a helical magnetic system with antiferromagnetic ordering, we uncover spin-dependent RL at multiple energy regions, in the {\em absence} of hopping dimerization. This phenomenon persists even in the thermodynamic limit. The correlated disorder in the form of Aubry-Andr\'{e}-Harper model is introduced by applying a transverse electric field to the helical system, circumventing the use of traditional substitutional disorder. We conduct a finite-size scaling analysis on the observed reentrant phases to identify critical points, determine associated critical exponents, and examine the scaling behavior linked to localization transitions. Additionally, we explore the parameter space to identify the conditions under which the reentrant phases occur. Described within a tight-binding framework, present work provides a novel outlook on RL, highlighting the crucial role of electric field, antiferromagnetic ordering, and the helicity of the geometry. Potential applications and experimental realizations of RL phenomena are also explored.</description>

      <title>Integrated ab initio modelling of atomic order and magnetic anisotropy for rare-earth-free magnet design: effects of alloying additions in $\mathrm{L}1_0$ FeNi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.02809v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe an integrated modelling approach to accelerate the search for novel, single-phase, multicomponent materials with high magnetocrystalline anisotropy (MCA). For a given system we predict the nature of atomic ordering, its dependence on the magnetic state, and then proceed to describe the consequent MCA, magnetisation, and magnetic critical temperature (Curie temperature). Crucially, within our modelling framework, the same ab initio description of the material's electronic structure determines all aspects. We demonstrate this holistic method by studying the effects of alloying additions in FeNi, examining systems with the general stoichiometries Fe$_4$Ni$_3X$ and Fe$_3$Ni$_4X$, for additives including X= Pt, Pd, Al, and Co. The atomic ordering behaviour predicted on adding these elements, fundamental for determining a material's MCA, is rich and varied. Equiatomic FeNi has been reported to require ferromagnetic order to establish the tetragonal L10 order suited for significant MCA. Our results show that when alloying additions are included in this material, annealing in an applied magnetic field and/or below a material's Curie temperature may also promote tetragonal order, along with an appreciable effect on the predicted hard magnetic properties.</description>

      <title>Structure, short-range order, and phase stability of the Al$_x$CrFeCoNi high-entropy alloy: Insights from a perturbative, DFT-based analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13173v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the phase behaviour of the Al$_x$CrFeCoNi high-entropy alloy. Our approach is based on a perturbative analysis of the internal energy of the paramagnetic solid solution as evaluated within the Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker formulation of density functional theory, using the coherent potential approximation to average over disorder. Via application of a Landau-type linear response theory, we infer preferential chemical orderings directly. In addition, we recover a pairwise form of the alloy internal energy suitable for study via atomistic simulations, which in this work are performed using the nested sampling algorithm, which is well-suited for studying complex potential energy surfaces. When the underlying lattice is fcc, at low concentrations of Al, depending on the value of $x$, we predict either an $\mathrm{L}1_2$ or $\mathrm{D}0_{22}$ ordering emerging below approximately 1000 K. On the other hand, when the underlying lattice is bcc, consistent with experimental observations, we predict $\mathrm{B}2$ ordering temperatures higher than the melting temperature of the alloy, confirming that this ordered phase forms directly from the melt. For both fcc and bcc systems, chemical orderings are dominated by Al moving to one sublattice, Ni and Co the other, while Cr and Fe remain comparatively disordered. On the bcc lattice, our atomistic modelling suggests eventual decomposition into $\mathrm{B}2$ NiAl and Cr-rich phases. These results shed light on the fundamental physical origins of atomic ordering tendencies in these intriguing materials.</description>

      <title>How to define temperature in active systems?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19281v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We are used to measure temperature with a thermometer and we know from everyday life that different types of thermometers measure the same temperature. This experience can be based on equilibrium thermodynamics, which explains the equivalence of different possibilities to define temperature. In contrast, for systems out of equilibrium such as active matter, measurements performed with different thermometers can generally lead to different temperature values. In the present work, we systematically compare different possibilities to define temperature for active systems. Based on simulations and theory for inertial active Brownian particles, we find that different temperatures generally lead to different temperature values, as expected. Remarkably, however, we find that different temperatures not only lead to the same values near equilibrium (low P\'eclet number or high particle mass), but even far from equilibrium, several different temperatures approximately coincide. In particular, we find that the kinetic temperature, the configurational temperature, and temperatures based on higher moments of the velocity distribution constitute a class of temperatures that all assume very similar values over a wide parameter range. Notably, the effective temperature and temperatures exploiting the virial theorem, the Stokes-Einstein relation, or a harmonic confinement form a second class of temperatures whose values approximately coincide with each other but which strongly differ from those of the first class. Finally, we identify advantages and disadvantages of the different possibilities to define temperature and discuss their relevance for measuring the temperature of active systems.</description>

      <title>Digital twin of a large-aspect-ratio Rayleigh-B\'enard experiment: Role of thermal boundary conditions, measurement errors and uncertainties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08263v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Albeit laboratory experiments and numerical simulations have proven themselves successful in enhancing our understanding of long-living large-scale flow structures in horizontally extended Rayleigh-B\'enard convection, some discrepancies with respect to their size and induced heat transfer remain. This study traces these discrepancies back to their origins. We start by generating a digital twin of one standard experimental set-up. This twin is subsequently simplified in steps to understand the effect of non-ideal thermal boundary conditions, and the experimental measurement procedure is mimicked using numerical data. Although this allows explaining the increased observed size of the flow structures in the experiment relative to past numerical simulations, our data suggests that the vertical velocity magnitude has been underestimated in the experiments. A subsequent re-assessment of the latter's original data reveals an incorrect calibration model. The re-processed data show a relative increase in $u_{z}$ of roughly $24 \%$, resolving the previously observed discrepancies. This digital twin of a laboratory experiment for thermal convection at Rayleigh numbers $\Ra = \left\{ 2, 4, 7 \right\} \times 10^{5}$, a Prandtl number $\Pr = 7.1$, and an aspect ratio $\Gamma = 25$ highlights the role of different thermal boundary conditions as well as a reliable calibration and measurement procedure.</description>

      <title>First-passage times to a fractal boundary: local persistence exponent and its log-periodic oscillations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00808v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the statistics of the first-passage time (FPT) to a fractal self-similar boundary of the Koch snowflake. When the starting position is fixed near the absorbing boundary, the FPT distribution exhibits an apparent power-law decay over a broad range of timescales, culminated by an exponential cut-off. By extensive Monte Carlo simulations, we compute the local persistence exponent of the survival probability and reveal its log-periodic oscillations in time due to self-similarity of the boundary. The effect of the starting point onto this behavior is analyzed in depth. Theoretical bounds on the survival probability are derived from the analysis of diffusion in a circular sector. Physical rationales for the refined structure of the survival probability are presented.</description>

Abstract: The determination of mechanical properties such as the Young's modulus provides an important means to compare classical molecular dynamics simulations with materials. In this respect, ultra-thin materials hold several challenges: their volume is ambiguous, and different methods to determine a stress-strain relation deliver different result in particular for disordered systems. Using the example of carbon nanomembranes we discuss three common approaches to the problem and show that stress-strain simulations following experimental setups deliver correct results if adjusted carefully. We provide step-by-step instructions how to perform trustworthy simulations.</description>

      <title>High order ADER-DG method with local DG predictor for solutions of differential-algebraic systems of equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04018v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A numerical method ADER-DG with a local DG predictor for solving a DAE system has been developed, which was based on the formulation of ADER-DG methods using a local DG predictor for solving ODE and PDE systems. The basis functions were chosen in the form of Lagrange interpolation polynomials with nodal points at the roots of the Radau polynomials, which differs from the classical formulations of the ADER-DG method, where it is customary to use the roots of Legendre polynomials. It was shown that the use of this basis leads to A-stability and L1-stability in the case of using the DAE solver as ODE solver. The numerical method ADER-DG allows one to obtain a highly accurate numerical solution even on very coarse grids, with a step greater than the main characteristic scale of solution variation. The local discrete time solution can be used as a numerical solution of the DAE system between grid nodes, thereby providing subgrid resolution even in the case of very coarse grids. The classical test examples were solved by developed numerical method ADER-DG. With increasing index of the DAE system, a decrease in the empirical convergence orders p is observed. An unexpected result was obtained in the numerical solution of the stiff DAE system -- the empirical convergence orders of the numerical solution obtained using the developed method turned out to be significantly higher than the values expected for this method in the case of stiff problems. It turns out that the use of Lagrange interpolation polynomials with nodal points at the roots of the Radau polynomials is much better suited for solving stiff problems. Estimates showed that the computational costs of the ADER-DG method are approximately comparable to the computational costs of implicit Runge-Kutta methods used to solve DAE systems. Methods were proposed to reduce the computational costs of the ADER-DG method.</description>

      <title>Solving eigenvalue problems obtained by the finite element method on a quantum annealer using only a few qubits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13740v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the main obstacles for achieving a practical quantum advantage in quantum computing lies in the relatively small number of qubits currently available in quantum hardware. Here, we show how to circumvent this problem in the context of eigenvalue problems obtained by the finite element method, via the use of an adaptive algorithm for quantum annealers -- the Adaptive Quantum Annealer Eigensolver (AQAE) -- in a way that only a few qubits are required to achieve a high precision. As an example, we apply AQAE to eigenvalue problems that are relevant in a wide range of contexts, such as electromagnetism, acoustics and seismology, and quantify its robustness against different types of experimental errors. Our approach could be applied to other algorithms, and makes it possible to take the most of current Noisy-Intermediate-Scale Quantum devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22115v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Behavioral adoptions are influenced by peers in different ways. While some individuals may change after a single incoming influence, others need multiple cumulated attempts. These two mechanism, known as the simple and the complex contagions, often occur together in social phenomena alongside personal factors determining individual adoptions. Here we aim to identify which of these contagion mechanism dominate a spreading process propagated by time-varying interactions. We consider three types of spreading scenarios: ones pre-dominated by simple or complex contagion, and mixed dynamics where the dominant mechanism changes during the unfolding of the spreading process. We propose different methods to analytically identify the transitions between these three scenarios and compare them with numerical simulations. This work offers new insights into social contagion dynamics on temporal networks, without assuming prior knowledge about individual's contagion mechanism driving their adoption decisions.</description>

      <title>An accurate solar axions ray-tracing response of BabyIAXO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13915v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: BabyIAXO is the intermediate stage of the International Axion Observatory (IAXO) to be hosted at DESY. Its primary goal is the detection of solar axions following the axion helioscope technique. Axions are converted into photons in a large magnet that is pointing to the sun. The resulting X-rays are focused by appropriate X-ray optics and detected by sensitive low-background detectors placed at the focal spot. The aim of this article is to provide an accurate quantitative description of the different components (such as the magnet, optics, and X-ray detectors) involved in the detection of axions. Our efforts have focused on developing robust and integrated software tools to model these helioscope components, enabling future assessments of modifications or upgrades to any part of the IAXO axion helioscope and evaluating the potential impact on the experiment's sensitivity. In this manuscript, we demonstrate the application of these tools by presenting a precise signal calculation and response analysis of BabyIAXO's sensitivity to the axion-photon coupling. Though focusing on the Primakoff solar flux component, our virtual helioscope model can be used to test different production mechanisms, allowing for direct comparisons within a unified framework.</description>

Abstract: Two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy (2DES) is a powerful tool for exploring quantum effects in energy transport within photosynthetic systems and investigating novel material properties. However, simulating the dynamics of these experiments poses significant challenges for classical computers due to the large system sizes, long timescales and numerous experiment repetitions involved. This paper introduces the probe qubit protocol (PQP)-for quantum simulation of 2DES on quantum devices-addressing these challenges. The PQP offers several enhancements over standard methods, notably reducing computational resources, by requiring only a single-qubit measurement per circuit run and achieving Heisenberg scaling in detection frequency resolution, without the need to apply expensive controlled evolution operators in the quantum circuit. The implementation of the PQP protocol requires only one additional ancilla qubit, the probe qubit, with one-to-all connectivity and two-qubit interactions between each system and probe qubits. We evaluate the computational resources necessary for this protocol in detail, demonstrating its function as a dynamic frequency-filtering method through numerical simulations. We find that simulations of the PQP on classical and quantum computers enable a reduction on the number of measurements, i.e. simulation runtime, and memory savings of several orders of magnitude relatively to standard quantum simulation protocols of 2DES. The paper discusses the applicability of the PQP on near-term quantum devices and highlights potential applications where this spectroscopy simulation protocol could provide significant speedups over standard approaches such as the quantum simulation of 2DES applied to the Fenna-Matthews-Olson (FMO) complex in green sulphur bacteria.</description>

      <title>Non-Linear Super-Stencils for Turbulence Model Corrections</title>

Abstract: Accurate simulation of turbulent flows remains a challenge due to the high computational cost of direct numerical simulations (DNS) and the limitations of traditional turbulence models. This paper explores a novel approach to augmenting standard models for Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) simulations using a Non-Linear Super-Stencil (NLSS). The proposed method introduces a fully connected neural network that learns a mapping from the local mean flow field to a corrective force term, which is added to a standard RANS solver in order to align its solution with high-fidelity data. A procedure is devised to extract training data from reference DNS and large eddy simulations (LES). To reduce the complexity of the non-linear mapping, the dimensionless local flow data is aligned with the local mean velocity, and the local support domain is scaled by the turbulent integral length scale. After being trained on a single periodic hill case, the NLSS-corrected RANS solver is shown to generalize to different periodic hill geometries and different Reynolds numbers, producing significantly more accurate solutions than the uncorrected RANS simulations.</description>
