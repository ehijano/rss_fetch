      <title>Pulling order back from the brink of disorder: Observation of a nodal line spin liquid and fluctuation stabilized order in K$_2$IrCl$_6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Competing interactions in frustrated magnets can give rise to highly degenerate ground states from which correlated liquid-like states of matter often emerge. The scaling of this degeneracy influences the ultimate ground state, with extensive degeneracies potentially yielding quantum spin liquids, while sub-extensive or smaller degeneracies yield static orders. A longstanding problem is to understand how ordered states precipitate from this degenerate manifold and what echoes of the degeneracy survive ordering. Here, we use neutron scattering to experimentally demonstrate a new "nodal line" spin liquid, where spins collectively fluctuate within a sub-extensive manifold spanning one-dimensional lines in reciprocal space. Realized in the spin-orbit coupled, face-centered cubic iridate K$_2$IrCl$_6$, we show that the sub-extensive degeneracy is robust, but remains susceptible to fluctuations or longer range interactions which cooperate to select a magnetic order at low temperatures. Proximity to the nodal line spin liquid influences the ordered state, enhancing the effects of quantum fluctuations and stabilizing it through the opening of a large spin-wave gap. Our results demonstrate quantum fluctuations can act counter-intuitively in frustrated materials: instead of destabilizing ordering, at the brink of the nodal spin liquid they can act to stabilize it and dictate its low-energy physics.</description>

      <title>Observation of excitonic Floquet states in a one-dimensional organic Mott insulator using mid-infrared pump near-infrared probe reflection spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When an electric field of light with a frequency of{\hbar}{\Omega}is applied to a solid, Floquet states, consisting of sidebands with an interval of {\hbar}{\Omega} around an electronic state, are expected to be formed. However, only a few studies have experimentally detected such sidebands. Here, we apply mid-infrared pump near-infrared reflection probe spectroscopy to a one-dimensional Mott insulator, bis(ethylendithio)tetrathianfulvalence-difluorotetracyanoquinodimethane (ET-F2TCNQ), to detect the transient change in reflectivity R,{\Delta}R/R, due to the formation of excitonic Floquet states. Analyses, considering both odd- and even-parity excitons, demonstrate that the {\Delta}R/R spectrum reflects the formation of the first-order Floquet sidebands of excitons, and its spectral shape strongly depends on the widths of excitonic states. The experimental and analytical approach reported here is effective in demonstrating excitonic Floquet states in various solids.</description>

      <title>Magnetic properties of AlB$_2$-type holmium silicides and germanides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Discovery of the large magnetocaloric effect in HoB$_2$ has highlighted the practical advantage of heavy rare-earth ions. Other holmium compounds are of interest, and we here report the synthesis and the magnetic properties of HoSi$_{1.67}$ and HoGe$_{1.67}$ which form the same AlB$_2$-type structure but with vacancies. They are found to show the antiferromagnetic order with the Neel temperature 17.6(2)K for HoSi$_{1.67}$ and 9.9(2)K for HoGe$_{1.67}$, and the magnetic entropy changes at the temperature are 0.05(1)J/cm$^3$K for HoSi$_{1.67}$ and 0.08(1)J/cm$^3$K for HoGe$_{1.67}$. Magnetic orders were suppressed by replacing vacancies with nickel, resulting in an increase of magnetic entropy changes. Distance between the in-plane Ho$^{3+}$ ions appears to be an important parameter leading to the transition between the antiferromagnetic (HoSi$_{1.67}$) and the ferromagnetic (HoB$_2$) order. The finding may aid the exploration of other heavy rare-earth compounds for similar applications.</description>

      <title>Magnetic properties of a staggered $S=1$ chain with an alternating single-ion anisotropy direction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Materials composed of spin-1 antiferromagnetic (AFM) chains are known to adopt complex ground states which are sensitive to the single-ion-anisotropy (SIA) energy ($D$), and intrachain ($J_{0}$) and interchain ($J'_{i}$) exchange energy scales. While theoretical and experimental studies have extended this model to include various other energy scales, the effect of the lack of a common SIA axis is not well explored. Here we investigate the magnetic properties of Ni(pyrimidine)(H$_{2}$O)$_{2}$(NO$_{3}$)$_{2}$, a chain compound where the tilting of Ni octahedra leads to a 2-fold alternation of the easy-axis directions along the chain. Muon-spin relaxation measurements indicate a transition to long-range order at $T_{\text{N}}=2.3$\,K and the magnetic structure is initially determined to be antiferromagnetic and collinear using elastic neutron diffraction experiments. Inelastic neutron scattering measurements were used to find $J_{0} = 5.107(7)$\,K, $D = 2.79(1)$\,K, $J'_{2}=0.18(3)$\,K and a rhombic anisotropy energy $E=0.19(9)$\,K. Mean-field modelling reveals that the ground state structure hosts spin canting of $\phi\approx6.5^{\circ}$, which is not detectable above the noise floor of the elastic neutron diffraction data. Monte-Carlo simulation of the powder-averaged magnetization, $M(H)$, is then used to confirm these Hamiltonian parameters, while single-crystal $M(H)$ simulations provide insight into features observed in the data.</description>

      <title>Yukawa-Lorentz symmetry of interacting non-Hermitian birefringent Dirac fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The energy spectra of linearly dispersing gapless spin-3/2 Dirac fermions display birefringence, featuring two effective Fermi velocities, thus breaking the space-time Lorentz symmetry. Here, we consider a non-Hermitian (NH) generalization of this scenario by introducing a masslike anti-Hermitian birefringent Dirac operator to its Hermitian counterpart. The resulting NH operator shows real eigenvalue spectra over an extended NH parameter regime, and a combination of non-spatial and discrete rotational symmetries protects the gapless nature of such quasiparticles. However, at the brink of dynamic mass generation, triggered by Hubbardlike local interactions, the birefringent parameter always vanishes under coarse grain due to Yukawa-type interactions with scalar bosonic order-parameter fluctuations. The resulting quantum critical state is, therefore, described by two decoupled copies of spin-1/2 Dirac fermions with a unique terminal Fermi velocity, which is equal to the bosonic order-parameter velocity, thereby fostering an emergent space-time Lorentz symmetry. Furthermore, depending on the internal algebra between the anti-Hermitian birefringent Dirac operator and the candidate mass order, the system achieves the emergent Yukawa-Lorentz symmetry either by maintaining its non-Hermiticity or by recovering a full Hermiticity. We discuss the resulting quantum critical phenomena and possible microscopic realizations of the proposed scenarios.</description>

      <title>Diagrammatic ab initio methods for infinite nuclear matter with modern chiral interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A comparative study of the equation of state for pure neutron matter and symmetric nuclear matter is presented using three ab initio methods based on diagrammatic expansions: coupled-cluster theory, self-consistent Green's functions, and many-body perturbation theory. We critically evaluate these methods by employing different chiral potentials at next-to-next-to-leading-order -- all of which include both two- and three-nucleon contributions -- and by exploring various many-body truncations. Our investigation yields highly precise results for pure neutron matter and robust predictions for symmetric nuclear matter, particularly with soft interactions. Moreover, the new calculations demonstrate that the $\rm{ NNLO_{sat} }(450)$ and $\Delta \rm{NNLO_{go}}(394)$ potentials are consistent with the empirical constraints on the saturation point of symmetric nuclear matter. Additionally, this benchmark study reveals that diagrammatic expansions with similar architectures lead to consistent many-body correlations, even when applied across different methods. This consistency underscores the robustness of the diagrammatic approach in capturing the essential physics of nucleonic systems.</description>

      <title>Supersolidity and Simplex Phases in Spin-1 Rydberg Atom Arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17554v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutral atoms become strongly interacting when their electrons are excited to loosely bound Rydberg states. We investigate the strongly correlated quantum phases of matter that emerge in two-dimensional atom arrays where three Rydberg levels are used to encode an effective spin-1 degree of freedom. Dipolar exchange between such spin-1 Rydberg atoms naturally yields two distinct models: (i) a two-species hardcore boson model, and (ii) upon tuning near a F\"orster resonance, a dipolar spin-1 XY model. Through extensive, large-scale infinite density matrix renormalization group calculations, we provide a broad roadmap predicting the quantum phases that emerge from these models on a variety of lattice geometries: square, triangular, kagome, and ruby. We identify a wealth of correlated states, including lattice supersolids and simplex phases, all of which can be naturally realized in near-term experiments.</description>

      <title>The index of lattice Dirac operators and $K$-theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We mathematically show an equality between the index of a Dirac operator on a flat continuum torus and the $\eta$ invariant of the Wilson Dirac operator with a negative mass when the lattice spacing is sufficiently small. Unlike the standard approach, our formulation using $K$-theory does not require the Ginsparg-Wilson relation or the modified chiral symmetry on the lattice. We prove that a one-parameter family of continuum massive Dirac operators and the corresponding Wilson Dirac operators belong to the same equivalence class of the $K^1$ group at a finite lattice spacing. Their indices, which are evaluated by the spectral flow or equivalently by the $\eta$ invariant at finite masses, are proved to be equal.</description>

      <title>Entangling power, gate typicality and Measurement-induced Phase Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When subject to a non-local unitary evolution, qubits in a quantum circuit become increasingly entangled. Conversely, measurements applied to individual qubits lead to their disentanglement from the collective system. The extent of entanglement reduction depends on the frequency of local projective measurements. A delicate balance emerges between unitary evolution, which enhances entanglement, and measurements which diminish it. In the thermodynamic limit, there is a phase transition from volume law entanglement to area law entanglement at a critical value of measurement frequency. This phenomenon, occurring in hybrid quantum circuits with both unitary gates and measurements, is termed as measurement-induced phase transition (MIPT). We study the behavior of MIPT in circuits comprising of two qubit unitary gates parameterized by Cartan decomposition. We show that the entangling power and gate typicality of the two-qubit local unitaries employed in the circuit can be used to explain the behavior of global bipartite entanglement the circuit can sustain. When the two qubit gate throughout the circuit is the identity and measurements are the sole driver of the entanglement behavior, we obtain analytical estimate for the entanglement entropy that shows remarkable agreement with numerical simulations. We also find that the entangling power and gate typicality enable the classification of the two-qubit unitaries by different universality classes of phase transitions that can occur in the hybrid circuit. For all unitaries in a particular universality class, the transition from volume to area law of entanglement occurs with same exponent that characterizes the phase transition.</description>

      <title>Mechanism of Type-II Multiferroicity in Pure and Al-Doped CuFeO$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17859v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Type-II multiferroicity, where electric polarization is induced by specific spin patterns, is crucial in fundamental physics and advanced spintronics. However, the spin model and magnetoelectric coupling mechanisms in prototypical type-II multiferroic CuFeO$_2$ and Al-doped CuFeO$_2$ remain unclear. Here, by considering both spin and alloy degrees of freedom, we develop a magnetic cluster expansion method, which considers all symmetry allowed interactions. Applying such method, we not only obtain realistic spin model that can correctly reproduce observations for both CuFeO$_2$ and CuFe$_{1-x}$Al$_x$O$_2$, but also revisit well-known theories of the original spin-current (SC) model and $p$-$d$ hybridization model. Specifically, we find that (i) a previously overlooked biquadratic interaction is critical to reproduce the $\uparrow\uparrow\downarrow\downarrow$ ground state and excited states of CuFeO$_2$; (ii) the combination of absent biquadratic interaction and increased magnetic frustration around Al dopants stabilizes the proper screw state; and (iii) it is the generalized spin-current (GSC) model that can correctly characterize the multiferroicity of CuFeO$_2$. These findings have broader implications for understanding novel magnetoelectric couplings in, e.g., monolayer multiferroic NiI$_2$.</description>

      <title>Dipolar ordering transitions in many-body quantum optics: Analytical diagrammatic approach to equilibrium quantum spins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum spin models with a large number of interactions per spin are frequently encountered in modern many-body quantum optical systems like arrays of Rydberg atoms, atom-cavity systems or trapped ion crystals. For theoretical analysis the mean-field (MF) approximation is routinely applied. However, except in the exotic case of infinite connectivity, its results are not quantitatively reliable. Here we present a systematic correction to MF theory based on diagrammatic perturbation theory for quantum spin correlators in thermal equilibrium. Our analytic results are universally applicable for any lattice geometry and spin-length S. We provide pre-computed and easy-to-use building blocks for Ising, Heisenberg and transverse field Ising models in the the symmetry-unbroken regime. We showcase the methods quality and simplicity by computing magnetic phase boundaries and excitations gaps. We also treat the Dicke-Ising model of ground-state superradiance where we show that corrections to the MF phase boundary vanish.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An exciton is a Coulomb-driven bound state, which normally consists of an electron and a hole. Under the influence of charge fractionalization, an exotic construction of exciton arises from pairing between fractional particle and hole charge. Despite numerous theoretical considerations, experimental realization of fractional excitons remains largely unexplored. In this work, we report hallmark transport signatures of excitonic pairing that coexists with fractional quantum Hall effect states. Such coexistence reveals a new construction for fractional quantum Hall effect, where exciton pairing plays an essential role in defining the underlying wavefunction. By surveying the two-dimensional phase space defined by Landau-level filling and layer imbalance, we describe transitions between ground states with distinct exciton compositions. The hierarchical behavior of the excitonic sequence provides potential evidence for excitons with fractional charge constituents, which obey fermionic and anyonic statistics.</description>

Abstract: We propose a method to parametrically excite low frequency collective modes in an interacting many body system using a Floquet driving at optical frequencies with a modulated amplitude. We demonstrate that it can be used to design plasmonic time-varying media with singular dispersions. Plasmons near resonance with half the modulation frequency exhibit two lines of exceptional points connected by dispersionless states. Above a critical driving strength, resonant plasmon modes become unstable and undergo a continuous transition towards a crystal-like structure stabilized by interactions and nonlinearities. This new state breaks the discrete time translational symmetry of the drive as well as the translational and rotational spatial symmetries of the system and exhibits soft, Goldstone-like phononic excitations. Below the instability threshold, our method can be used to enhance the quality of plasmon resonances.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.02151v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nonequilibrium phases of quantum matter featuring time crystalline eigenstate order have been realized recently on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. While ideal quantum time crystals exhibit collective subharmonic oscillations and spatiotemporal long-range order persisting for infinite times, the decoherence time of current NISQ devices sets a natural limit to the survival of these phases, restricting their observation to a shallow quantum circuit. Here we propose a time-periodic scheme that leverages quantum-classical feedback protocols in subregions of the system to enhance a time crystal signal significantly exceeding the decoherence time of the device. As a case of study, we demonstrate the survival of the many-body localized discrete time crystal phase in the one-dimensional periodically kicked Ising model, accounting for decoherence of the system with an environment. Based on classical simulation of quantum circuit realizations we find that this approach is suitable for implementation on existing quantum hardware and presents a prospective path to simulate complex quantum many-body dynamics that transcend the low depth limit of current digital quantum computers.</description>

Abstract: We present an analytically solvable model for correlated electrons, which is able to capture the major Fermi surface modifications occurring in both hole- and electron-doped cuprates as a function of doping. The proposed Hamiltonian qualitatively reproduces the results of numerically demanding many-body calculations, here obtained using the dynamical vertex approximation. Our analytical theory provides a transparent description of a precise mechanism, capable to drive the formation of disconnected segments along the Fermi surface (the highly debated "Fermi arcs") as well as of the opening of a pseudogap at hole- and electron-doping. This occurs through a specific mechanism: The electronic states on the Fermi arcs remain intact, while the Fermi surface part where the gap opens transforms into a Luttinger arc.</description>

      <title>Electronic instability, layer selectivity and Fermi arcs in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$</title>

Abstract: Using advanced dynamical mean-field theory on a realistic level we study the normal-state correlated electronic structure of the high-pressure superconductor La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and compare the features of the conventional bilayer (2222) Ruddelsden-Popper crystal structure with those of a newly-identified monolayer-trilayer (1313) alternation. Both structural cases display Ni-$d_{z^2}$ flat-band character at low-energy, which drives an electronic instability with a wave vector ${\bf q_{\rm I}}=(0.25,0.25,q_z)$ at ambient pressure, in line with recent experimental findings. The 1313 electronic structure exhibits significant layer selectivity, rendering especially the monolayer part to be Mott-critical. At high pressure, this layer selectivity weakens and the 1313 fermiology displays arcs reminiscent to those of high-$T_c$ cuprates. In contrast to dominant inter-site self-energy effects in the latter systems, here the Fermi arcs are the result of the multiorbital and multilayer interplay within a correlated flat-band scenario.</description>

      <title>Real and Reciprocal Space Characterization of the 3-Dimensional Charge Density Wave in Quasi-1-Dimensional CuTe</title>

Abstract: Low-dimensional materials are susceptible to electronic instabilities such as charge density waves (CDWs), originating from a divergence in the Lindhard electron response function, combined with a finite electron-phonon coupling strength. In this report, we present a detailed characterisation of the CDW in the quasi-one-dimensional material CuTe, including (1) direct visualization of lattice distortion seen with non-contact atomic force microscopy in real space, (2) the out-of-plane momentum dependency of the CDW gap size of the quasi-1-dimensional bands, by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, (3) coherent dynamics of a photoexcited phonon mode seen by time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, with frequency and wavevector q_CDW corresponding to the soft phonon modes predicted by theory. Furthermore, we find that the CDW gap closes through a transient band renormalisation. We thus confirm that, despite the quasi-1D characteristics of CuTe, it hosts inherently 3-dimensional CDWs.</description>

      <title>SO($N$) singlet-projection model on the pyrochlore lattice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02926v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an extensive quantum Monte Carlo study of a nearest-neighbor, singlet-projection model on the pyrochlore lattice that exhibits SO($N$) symmetry and is sign-problem-free. We find that in contrast to the previously studied two-dimensional variations of this model that harbor critical points between their ground state phases, the non-bipartite pyrochlore lattice in three spatial dimensions appears to exhibit a first-order transition between a magnetically-ordered phase and some, as yet uncharacterized, paramagnetic phase. We also observe that the magnetically-ordered phase survives to a relatively large value of $N=8$, and that it is gone for $N=9$.</description>

      <title>Lectures on the quantum phase transitions of metals</title>

Abstract: Quantum phase transitions of metals involve changes in the Fermi surface, and can be divided into three categories. The first two categories involve symmetry breaking, and lead to a distortion or reconstruction of the Fermi surface. The third category involves a change in the volume enclosed by the Fermi surface without any symmetry breaking: one phase is a Fermi liquid (FL) with the conventional Luttinger volume, while the other phase is a `fractionalized Fermi liquid' (FL*), which has a non-Luttinger volume Fermi surface accompanied by a spin liquid with fractionalized excitations. It is a relatively simple matter to obtain a FL*-FL transition in Kondo lattice models. However, the FL*-FL transition can also be present in single-band Hubbard-like models: this is efficiently described by the `ancilla' method, which shows that the transition is a `flipped' Kondo lattice transition. This single-band FL*-FL transition is argued to apply to the metallic states of the hole-doped cuprates. In the clean limit, the critical properties of the quantum transitions in the three categories are distinct, but all lead to perfect metal transport in the quantum-critical regime. Impurity-induced `Harris disorder', with spatial fluctuations in the local position of the quantum critical point, is a relevant perturbation to the clean critical points. In the presence of Harris disorder, all three categories exhibit strange metal behavior, which can be described by a universal two-dimensional Yukawa-Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model.</description>

      <title>Quasiparticle Andreev scattering in the $\nu=1/3$ fractional quantum Hall regime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2206.08068v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The scattering of exotic quasiparticles may follow different rules than electrons. In the fractional quantum Hall regime, a quantum point contact (QPC) provides a source of quasiparticles with field effect selectable charges and statistics, which can be scattered on an 'analyzer' QPC to investigate these rules. Remarkably, for incident quasiparticles dissimilar to those naturally transmitted across the analyzer, electrical conduction conserves neither the nature nor the number of the quasiparticles. In contrast with standard elastic scattering, theory predicts the emergence of a mechanism akin to the Andreev reflection at a normal-superconductor interface. Here, we observe the predicted Andreev-like reflection of an $e/3$ quasiparticle into a $-2e/3$ hole accompanied by the transmission of an $e$ quasielectron. Combining shot noise and cross-correlation measurements, we independently determine the charge of the different particles and ascertain the coincidence of quasielectron and fractional hole. The present work advances our understanding on the unconventional behavior of fractional quasiparticles, with implications toward the generation of novel quasi-particles/holes and non-local entanglements.</description>

Abstract: We show that the hydrodynamic of the perfect fluid admits a deformation that includes a chiral gravitational (or mixed) anomaly alongside the chiral current anomaly. The deformation introduces the gravitational Chern-Simons term and an analog of an axion in fluid mechanics, and features fluid spin-current and anomaly induced spin-orbit interaction.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional electrons at mirror and twistronic twin boundaries in van der Waals ferroelectrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15040v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides (MX$_2$) occur in 2H and rhombohedral (3R) polytypes, respectively distinguished by anti-parallel and parallel orientation of consecutive monolayer lattices. In its bulk form, 3R-MX$_2$ is ferroelectric, hosting an out-of-plane electric polarisation, the direction of which is dictated by stacking. Here, we predict that twin boundaries, separating adjacent polarization domains with reversed built-in electric fields, are able to host two-dimensional electrons and holes with an areal density reaching $\sim 10^{13} {\rm cm}^{-2}$. Our modelling suggests that n-doped twin boundaries have a more promising binding energy than p-doped ones, whereas hole accumulation is stable at external surfaces of a twinned film. We also propose that assembling pairs of mono-twin films with a `magic' twist angle $\theta^*$ that provides commensurability between the moir\'e pattern at the interface and the accumulated carrier density, should promote a regime of strongly correlated states of electrons, such as Wigner crystals, and we specify the values of $\theta^*$ for homo- and heterostructures of various TMDs.</description>

      <title>Geometric additivity of modular commutator for multipartite entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11130v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A recent surge of research in many-body quantum entanglement has uncovered intriguing properties of quantum many-body systems. A prime example is the modular commutator, which can extract a topological invariant from a single wave function. Here, we unveil novel geometric properties of many-body entanglement via a modular commutator of two-dimensional gapped quantum many-body systems. We obtain the geometric additivity of a modular commutator, indicating that modular commutator for a multipartite system may be an integer multiple of the one for tripartite systems. Using our additivity formula, we also derive a curious identity for the modular commutators involving disconnected intervals in a certain class of conformal field theories. We further illustrate this geometric additivity for both bulk and edge subsystems using numerical calculations of the Haldane and $\pi$-flux models.</description>
