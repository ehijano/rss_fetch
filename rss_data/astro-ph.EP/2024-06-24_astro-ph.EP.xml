      <title>Multiple Clues for Dayside Aerosols and Temperature Gradients in WASP-69 b from a Panchromatic JWST Emission Spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: WASP-69 b is a hot, inflated, Saturn-mass planet 0.26 Mjup with a zero-albedo equilibrium temperature of 963 K. Here, we report the JWST 2 to 12 um emission spectrum of the planet consisting of two eclipses observed with NIRCam grism time series and one eclipse observed with MIRI LRS. The emission spectrum shows absorption features of water vapor, carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide, but no strong evidence for methane. WASP-69 b's emission spectrum is poorly fit by cloud-free homogeneous models. We find three possible model scenarios for the planet: 1) a Scattering Model that raises the brightness at short wavelengths with a free Geometric Albedo parameter 2) a Cloud Layer model that includes high altitude silicate aerosols to moderate long wavelength emission and 3) a Two-Region model that includes significant dayside inhomogeneity and cloud opacity with two different temperature-pressure profiles. In all cases, aerosols are needed to fit the spectrum of the planet. The Scattering model requires an unexpectedly high Geometric Albedo of 0.64. Our atmospheric retrievals indicate inefficient redistribution of heat and an inhomogeneous dayside distribution, which is tentatively supported by MIRI LRS broadband eclipse maps that show a central concentration of brightness. Our more plausible models (2 and 3) retrieve chemical abundances enriched in heavy elements relative to solar composition by 6x to 14x solar and a C/O ratio of 0.65 to 0.94, whereas the less plausible highly reflective scenario (1) retrieves a slightly lower metallicity and lower C/O ratio.</description>

      <title>Pade: A code for protoplanetary disk turbulence based on Pade differencing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Pade code has been developed to treat hydrodynamic turbulence in protoplanetary disks. It solves the compressible equations of motion in cylindrical coordinates. Derivatives are computed using non-diffusive and conservative fourth-order Pade differencing, which has higher resolving power compared to both dissipative shock-capturing schemes used in most astrophysics codes, as well as non-diffusive central finite-difference schemes of the same order. The fourth-order Runge-Kutta method is used for time stepping. A previously reported error-corrected Fargo approach is used to reduce the time step constraint imposed by rapid Keplerian advection. Artificial bulk viscosity is used when shock-capturing is required. Tests for correctness and scaling with respect to the number of processors are presented. Finally, efforts to improve efficiency and accuracy are suggested.</description>

      <title>Compaction during fragmentation and bouncing produces realistic dust grain porosities in protoplanetary discs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context: In protoplanetary discs, micron-sized dust grows to form millimetre- to centimetre-sized pebbles but encounters several barriers during its evolution. Collisional fragmentation and radial drift impede further dust growth to planetesimal size. Fluffy grains have been hypothesised to solve these problems. While porosity leads to faster grain growth, the implied porosity values obtained from previous simulations were larger than suggested by observations. Aims: In this paper, we study the influence of porosity on dust evolution taking into account growth, bouncing, fragmentation, compaction, rotational disruption and snow lines, in order to understand their impact on dust evolution. Methods: We develop a module for porosity evolution for the 3D Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) code Phantom that accounts for dust growth and fragmentation. This mono-disperse model is integrated into both a 1D code and the 3D code to capture the overall evolution of dust and gas. Results: We show that porosity helps dust growth and leads to the formation of larger solids than when considering compact grains, as predicted by previous work. Our simulations taking into account compaction during fragmentation show that large millimetre grains are still formed, but are 10 to 100 times more compact. Thus, mm sizes with typical filling factors of ~0.1 match the values measured on comets or via polarimetric observations of protoplanetary discs.</description>

      <title>Refining the WASP-132 multi-planetary system: discovery of a cold giant planet and mass measurement of a hot super-Earth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hot Jupiters generally do not have nearby planet companions, as they may have cleared out other planets during their inward migration from more distant orbits. This gives evidence that hot Jupiters more often migrate inward via high-eccentricity migration due to dynamical interactions between planets rather than more dynamically cool migration mechanisms through the protoplanetary disk. Here we further refine the unique system of WASP-132 by characterizing the mass of the recently validated 1.0-day period super-Earth WASP-132c (TOI-822.02) interior to the 7.1-day period hot Jupiter WASP-132b. Additionally, we announce the discovery of a giant planet at a 5-year period (2.7 AU). We also detect a long-term trend in the radial velocity data indicative of another outer companion. Using over nine years of CORALIE RVs and over two months of highly-sampled HARPS RVs, we determine the masses of the planets from smallest to largest orbital period to be M$_{\rm{c}}$ = $6.26^{+1.84}_{-1.83}$ $M_{\oplus}$, M$_{\rm{b}}$ = $0.428^{+0.015}_{-0.015}$ $M_{\rm{Jup}}$, and M$_{\rm{d}}\sin{i}$ = $5.16^{+0.52}_{-0.52}$ $M_{\rm{Jup}}$, respectively. Using TESS and CHEOPS photometry data we measure the radii of the two inner transiting planets to be $1.841^{+0.094}_{-0.093}$ $R_{\oplus}$ and $0.901^{+0.038}_{-0.038}$ $R_{\rm{Jup}}$. WASP-132 is a unique multi-planetary system in that both an inner rocky planet and an outer giant planet are in a system with a hot Jupiter. This suggests it migrated via a more rare dynamically cool mechanism and helps to further our understanding of how hot Jupiter systems may form and evolve.</description>

      <title>Atmospheric Helium Abundances in the Giant Planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Noble gases are accreted to the giant planets as part of the gas component of the planet-forming disk. While heavier noble gases can separate from the evolution of the hydrogen-rich gas, helium is thought to remain at the protosolar H/He ratio Yproto~0.27-0.28. However, spacecraft observations revealed a depletion in helium in the atmospheres of Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus. For the gas giants, this is commonly seen as indication of H/He phase separation at greater depths. Here, we apply predictions of the H/He phase diagram and three H/He-EOS to compute the atmospheric helium mass abundance Yatm as a result of H/He phase separation. We obtain a strong depletion Yatm&lt;0.1 for the ice giants if they are adiabatic. Introducing a thermal boundary layer at the Z-poor/Z-rich compositional transition with a temperature increase of up to a few 1000 K, we obtain a weak depletion in Uranus as observed. Our results suggest dissimilar internal structures between Uranus and Neptune. An accurate in-situ determination of their atmospheric He/H ratio would help to constrain their internal structures. This is even more true for Saturn, where we find that any considered H/He phase diagram and H/He-EOS would be consistent with any observed value. However, some H/He-EOS and phase diagram combinations applied to both Jupiter and Saturn require an outer stably-stratified layer at least in one of them.</description>

      <title>Mind the Trap: Non-negligible effect of volatile trapping in ice on C/O ratios in protoplanetary disks and exoplanetary atmospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability of bulk ices (H$_{2}$O, CO$_{2}$) to trap volatiles has been well studied in any experimental sense, but largely ignored in protoplanetary disk and planet formation models as well as the interpretation of their observations. We demonstrate the influence of volatile trapping on C/O ratios in planet-forming environments. We created a simple model of CO, CO$_{2}$, and H$_{2}$O snowlines in protoplanetary disks and calculated the C/O ratio at different radii and temperatures. We included a trapping factor, which partially inhibits the release of volatiles (CO, CO$_{2}$) at their snowline and releases them instead, together with the bulk ice species (H$_{2}$O, CO$_{2}$). Our aim has been to assess its influence on trapping solid-state and gas phase C/O ratios throughout planet-forming environments. Volatile trapping significantly affects C/O ratios in protoplanetary disks. Variations in the ratio are reduced and become more homogeneous throughout the disk when compared to models that do not include volatile trapping. Trapping reduces the proportion of volatiles in the gas and, as such, reduces the available carbon- and oxygen-bearing molecules for gaseous accretion to planetary atmospheres. Volatile trapping is expected to also affect the elemental hydrogen and nitrogen budgets. Volatile trapping is an overlooked, but important effect to consider when assessing the C/O ratios in protoplanetary disks and exoplanet atmospheres. Due to volatile trapping, exoplanets with stellar C/O have the possibility to be formed within the CO and CO$_{2}$ snowline.</description>

      <title>Interior convection regime, host star luminosity, and predicted atmospheric CO$_2$ abundance in terrestrial exoplanets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Terrestrial planets in the Habitable Zone of Sun-like stars are priority targets for detection and observation by the next generation of powerful space telescopes. Earth's long-term habitability may have been tied to the geological carbon cycle, a process critically facilitated by plate tectonics. In the modern Earth, plate motion corresponds to a mantle convection regime called mobile-lid. The alternate, stagnant-lid regime is found on Mars and Venus, which may have lacked strong enough weathering feedbacks to sustain surface liquid water over geological timescales if initially present. Constraining observational strategies able to infer the most common regime in terrestrial exoplanets requires quantitative predictions of the atmospheric composition of planets in either regime. We use endmember models of volcanic outgassing and crust weathering for the stagnant- and mobile-lid convection regimes, that we couple to models of atmospheric chemistry and climate, and ocean chemistry to simulate the atmospheric evolution of these worlds in the Habitable Zone. In our simulations under the two alternate regimes, we find that the fraction of planets possessing climates consistent with surface liquid water differ by less than 10%. Despite this unexpectedly small difference, we predict that a mission capable of detecting atmospheric CO$_2$ abundance above 0.01 bar in 25 terrestrial exoplanets is extremely likely ($\geq 95$% of samples) to infer the dominant interior convection regime in that sample with strong evidence (10:1 odds). This offers guidance for the specifications of the Habitable Worlds Observatory NASA concept mission and other future missions capable of probing samples of habitable exoplanets.</description>

      <title>Time transformation between the solar system barycenter and the surfaces of the Earth and Moon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transformation of time between the surface of the Earth, the solar system barycenter, and the surface of the Moon involves relativistic corrections. For solar system Barycentric Dynamical Time (TDB), we also require that there be no rate difference between Terrestrial Time (TT) and TDB. The IAU has addressed these transformations with several resolutions. A series of robotic and crewed landings on the Moon are planned. The analogous transformation between TDB and time on the surface of the Moon (TL) needs a review and discussion. In this paper, we compute the rate terms involved in that transformation. We also present the TDB-compatible spatial scale and Lorentz contraction of Moon-centered positional coordinates. These transformations have been implemented in the JPL programs used to generate ephemerides of the Moon and planets. Finally, we provide expressions that can be used to synchronize TT and TL using either TDB or TT. The relevant transformations contain a small secular drift between the two time scales, along with additional small periodic terms that can be numerically evaluated using the solar system ephemerides.</description>

      <title>On the origin of polar planets around single stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Rossiter-McLaughlin effect measures the misalignment between a planet's orbital plane and its host star's rotation plane. Around 10$\%$ of planets exhibit misalignments in the approximate range $80 - 125^\circ$, with their origin remaining a mystery. On the other hand, large misalignments may be common in eccentric circumbinary systems due to misaligned discs undergoing polar alignment. If the binary subsequently merges, a polar circumbinary disc -- along with any planets that form within it -- may remain inclined near 90$^{\circ}$ to the merged star's rotation. To test this hypothesis, we present $N$-body simulations of the evolution of a polar circumbinary debris disc comprised of test particles around an eccentric binary during a binary merger that is induced by tidal dissipation. After the merger, the disc particles remain on near-polar orbits. Interaction of the binary with the polar-aligned gas disc may be required to bring the binary to the small separations that trigger the merger by tides. Our findings imply that planets forming in discs that are polar-aligned to the orbit of a high-eccentricity binary may, following the merger of the binary, provide a possible origin for the population of near-polar planets around single stars.</description>

      <title>Dynamical structures of misaligned circumbinary planets under hierarchical three-body systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: All circumbinary planets (CBPs) currently detected are located in almost co-planar configurations with respect to the binary orbit, due to the fact that CBPs with higher misalignment are more difficult to detect. However, observations of polar circumbinary gas and debris disks in recent years and long-term orbital stability of inclined planets indicate that it is possible to form misaligned CBPs around eccentricity binaries (even polar CBPs). In this work we focus on the dynamical structures of CBPs in a wide range of parameters in order to provide a guidance for the space where the binary can host planets for a long enough time. To this end, the dynamical model is approximated as a hierarchical three-body problem, and the secular approximation is formulated up to the hexadecapolar order in semimajor axis ratio. Dynamical maps show that there are complex structures in the parameter space. A web of secular resonances is produced in the entire parameter space and it can well explain those numerical structures arising in dynamical maps. Based on perturbative treatments, an adiabatic invariant is introduced and thus dynamical structures can be explored by analysing phase portraits. It is found that (a) the quadrupole-order resonance (nodal resonance) is responsible for the distribution of V-shape region, and high-order and secondary resonances dominate those structures inside or outside V-shape region, and (b) the secondary 1:1 resonance is the culprit causing symmetry breaking of dynamical structures inside polar region.</description>

      <title>Constrained velocity-free control of spacecraft attitude via explicit reference governor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces an explicit reference governor-based control scheme tailored for addressing the velocity-free spacecraft attitude maneuver problem. This problem is subject to specific constraints, namely the pointing constraint, angular velocity constraint, and input saturation. The proposed control scheme operates in two layers, ensuring the asymptotic stability of the spacecraft's attitude while adhering to the aforementioned constraints. The inner layer employs output feedback control utilizing an angular velocity observer based on immersion and invariance technology. This observer facilitates attitude stabilization without the measurement of angular velocity. Through an analysis of the geometry associated with the pointing constraint, determination of the upper bound of angular velocity, and optimization of the control input solution, the reference layer establishes a safety boundary described by the invariant set. Additionally, we introduce the dynamic factor related to the angular velocity estimation error into the invariant set to prevent states from exceeding the constraint set due to unmeasurable angular velocity information. The shortest guidance path is then designed in the reference layer. Finally, we substantiate the efficacy of the proposed constrained attitude control algorithm through numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>PRODIGE -- Planet-forming disks in Taurus with NOEMA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We aim to constrain the gas density and temperature distributions as well as gas masses in several T Tauri protoplanetary disks located in Taurus. We use the 12CO, 13CO, and C18O (2-1) isotopologue emission observed at 0.9 with the IRAM NOrthern Extended Millimeter Array (NOEMA) as part of the MPG-IRAM Observatory Program PRODIGE (PROtostars and DIsks: Global Evolution PIs: P. Caselli &amp; Th. Henning). Our sample consists of Class II disks with no evidence of strong radial substructures. We use thesedata to constrain the thermal and chemical structure of these disks through theoretical models for gas emission. To fit the combined optically thick and thin CO line data in Fourier space, we developed the DiskCheF code, which includes the parameterized disk physical structure, machine-learning (ML) accelerated chemistry, and the RADMC-3D line radiative transfer module. A key novelty of DiskCheF is the fast and feasible ML-based chemistry trained on the extended grid of the disk physical-chemical models precomputed with the ANDES2 code. This ML approach allows complex chemical kinetics models to be included in a time-consuming disk fitting without the need to run a chemical code. We present a novel approach to incorporate chemistry into disk modeling without the need to explicitly calculate a chemical network every time. Using this new disk modeling tool, we successfully fit the 12CO, 13CO, and C18O (2-1) data from the CI, CY, DL, DM, DN, and IQ Tau disks. The combination of optically thin and optically thick CO lines allows us to simultaneously constrain the disk temperature and mass distribution, and derive the CO-based gas masses. These values are in reasonable agreement with the disk dust masses rescaled by a factor of 100 as well as with other indirect gas measurements.</description>

      <title>Rocket Exhaust Blowing Soil in Near Vacuum Conditions is Faster than Predicted by Continuum Scaling Laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15535v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Experiments were performed to study how rocket exhaust blows soil in lunar and Martian conditions. Jets of gas were blown downwardly at various granular materials while a camera recorded the formation of scour holes as the material was removed. The experiments were performed in a series of conditions ranging from ambient 101 kPa pressure down to 0.3 kPa. This includes the range that is relevant for lunar conditions, because it is not hard vacuum inside the rocket exhaust where soil is being eroded. Prior work in ambient conditions showed that erosion rate is proportional to the square of the densimetric Froude number. However, the prior work was not performed at low pressures. In the new work, preliminary results show that as the gas density is so low that gas flow around the sand grains is no longer in the continuum regime, then erosion rate is faster than predicted by the earlier results. The dependency of erosion rate on various parameters is determined, but it turns out to be more complex than expected so additional experimental work will be required to develop complete scaling relationships.</description>

      <title>Detecting and Classifying Flares in High-Resolution Solar Spectra with Supervised Machine Learning</title>

Abstract: Flares are a well-studied aspect of the Sun's magnetic activity. Detecting and classifying solar flares can inform the analysis of contamination caused by stellar flares in exoplanet transmission spectra. In this paper, we present a standardized procedure to classify solar flares with the aid of supervised machine learning. Using flare data from the RHESSI mission and solar spectra from the HARPS-N instrument, we trained several supervised machine learning models, and found that the best performing algorithm is a C-Support Vector Machine (SVC) with non-linear kernels, specifically Radial Basis Functions (RBF). The best-trained model, SVC with RBF kernels, achieves an average aggregate accuracy score of 0.65, and categorical accuracy scores of over 0.70 for the no-flare and weak-flare classes, respectively. In comparison, a blind classification algorithm would have an accuracy score of 0.33. Testing showed that the model is able to detect and classify solar flares in entirely new data with different characteristics and distributions from those of the training set. Future efforts could focus on enhancing classification accuracy, investigating the efficacy of alternative models, particularly deep learning models, and incorporating more datasets to extend the application of this framework to stars that host exoplanets.</description>

      <title>J-PLUS: The fraction of calcium white dwarfs along the cooling sequence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We used the Javalambre Photometric Local Universe Survey (J-PLUS) DR2 photometry in twelve optical bands over 2176 deg2 to estimate the fraction of white dwarfs with presence of CaII H+K absorption along the cooling sequence. We compared the J-PLUS photometry against metal-free theoretical models to estimate the equivalent width in the J0395 passband of 10 nm centered at 395 nm (EW_J0395), a proxy to detect calcium absorption. A total of 4399 white dwarfs within 30000 &gt; Teff &gt; 5500 K and mass M &gt; 0.45 Msun were analyzed. Their EW_J0395 distribution was modeled using two populations, corresponding to polluted and non-polluted systems, to estimate the fraction of calcium white dwarfs (f_Ca) as a function of Teff. The probability for each individual white dwarf of presenting calcium absorption, pca, was also computed. The comparison with both the measured Ca/He abundance and the metal pollution from spectroscopy shows that EW_J0395 correlates with the presence of calcium. The fraction of calcium white dwarfs increases from f_Ca = 0 at Teff = 13500 K to f_Ca = 0.15 at Teff = 5500 K. We compare our results with the fractions derived from the 40 pc spectroscopic sample and from SDSS spectra. The trend found in J-PLUS observations is also present in the 40 pc sample, however SDSS shows a deficit of metal-polluted objects at Teff &lt; 12000 K. Finally, we found 39 white dwarfs with pca &gt; 0.99. Twenty of them have spectra presented in previous studies, whereas we observed six additional targets. These 26 objects were all confirmed as metal-polluted systems. The J-PLUS optical data provide a robust statistical measurement for the presence of CaII H+K absorption in white dwarfs. We find a 15 +- 3 % increase in the fraction of calcium white dwarfs from Teff = 13500 K to 5500 K, which reflects their selection function in the optical from the total population of metal-polluted systems.</description>

      <title>North-PHASE: Studying Periodicity, Hot Spots, Accretion Stability and Early Evolution in young stars in the northern hemisphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the overview and first results from the North-PHASE Legacy Survey, which follows six young clusters for five years, using the 2 deg$^2$ FoV of the JAST80 telescope from the Javalambre Observatory (Spain). North-PHASE investigates stellar variability on timescales from days to years for thousands of young stars distributed over entire clusters. This allows us to find new YSO, characterise accretion and study inner disk evolution within the cluster context. Each region (Tr37, CepOB3, IC5070, IC348, NGC2264, and NGC1333) is observed in six filters (SDSS griz, u band, and J0660, which covers H$\alpha$), detecting cluster members as well as field variable stars. Tr37 is used to prove feasibility and optimise the variability analysis techniques. In Tr37, variability reveals 50 new YSO, most of them proper motion outliers. North-PHASE independently confirms the youth of astrometric members, efficiently distinguishes accreting and non-accreting stars, reveals the extent of the cluster populations along Tr37/IC1396 bright rims, and detects variability resulting from rotation, dips, and irregular bursts. The proper motion outliers unveil a more complex star formation history than inferred from Gaia alone, and variability highlights previously hidden proper motion deviations in the surrounding clouds. We also find that non-YSO variables identified by North-PHASE cover a different variability parameter space and include long-period variables, eclipsing binaries, RR Lyr, and $\delta$ Scuti stars. These early results also emphasize the power of variability to complete the picture of star formation where it is missed by astrometry.</description>

      <title>An Explainable Deep-learning Model of Proton Auroras on Mars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.08195v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Proton auroras are widely observed on the dayside of Mars, identified as a significant intensity enhancement in the hydrogen Lyman alpha (121.6 nm) emission between 110 - 150 km altitudes. Solar wind protons penetrating as energetic neutral atoms into Mars thermosphere are thought to be primarily responsible for these auroras. Recent observations of spatially localized (patchy) proton auroras suggest a possible direct deposition of protons into Mars atmosphere during unstable solar wind conditions. Improving our understanding of proton auroras is therefore important for characterizing the solar wind interaction with Mars atmosphere. Here, we develop a first purely data-driven model of proton auroras using Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN (MAVEN) in-situ observations and limb scans of Ly-alpha emissions between 2014 - 2022. We train an artificial neural network (ANN) that reproduces individual Lyman alpha intensities and relative Lyman alpha peak intensity enhancements with a Pearson correlation of 0.94 and 0.60 respectively for the test data, along with a faithful reconstruction of the shape of the observed Lyman alpha emission altitude profiles. By performing a SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis, we find that solar zenith angle, solar longitude, CO2 atmosphere variability, solar wind speed and temperature are the most important features for the modeled Lyman alpha peak intensity enhancements. Additionally, we find that the modeled peak intensity enhancements are high for early local time hours, particularly near polar latitudes, as well as weaker induced magnetic fields. Through SHAP analysis, we also identify the influence of biases in the training data and interdependecies between the measurements used for the modeling, and an improvement on those aspects can significantly improve the performance and applicability of the ANN model.</description>

      <title>Combining Gaia and GRAVITY: Characterising five new Directly Detected Substellar Companions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13055v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Precise mass constraints are vital for the characterisation of brown dwarfs and exoplanets. Here we present how the combination of data obtained by Gaia and GRAVITY can help enlarge the sample of substellar companions with measured dynamical masses. We show how the Non-Single-Star (NSS) two-body orbit catalogue contained in Gaia DR3 can be used to inform high-angular-resolution follow-up observations with GRAVITY. Applying the method presented in this work to eight Gaia candidate systems, we detect all eight predicted companions, seven of which were previously unknown and five are of a substellar nature. Among the sample is Gaia DR3 2728129004119806464 B, which - detected at an angular separation of (34.01 $\pm$ 0.15) mas from the host - is the closest substellar companion ever imaged. This translates to a semi-major axis of (0.938 $\pm$ 0.023) AU. WT 766 B, detected at a greater angular separation, was confirmed to be on an orbit exhibiting an even smaller semi-major axis of (0.676 $\pm$ 0.008) AU. The GRAVITY data were then used to break the host-companion mass degeneracy inherent to the Gaia NSS orbit solutions as well as to constrain the orbital solutions of the respective target systems. Knowledge of the companion masses enabled us to further characterise them in terms of their ages, effective temperatures, and radii via the application of evolutionary models. The inferred ages exhibit a distinct bias towards values younger than what is to be expected based on the literature. The results serve as an independent validation of the orbital solutions published in the NSS two-body orbit catalogue and show that the combination of astrometric survey missions and high-angular-resolution direct imaging holds great promise for efficiently increasing the sample of directly imaged companions in the future, especially in the light of Gaia's upcoming DR4 and the advent of GRAVITY+.</description>

      <title>Radio Observations as an Extrasolar Planet Discovery and Characterization: Interior Structure and Habitability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12348v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Detection of radio emission from Jupiter was identified quickly as being due to its planetary-scale magnetic field. Subsequent spacecraft investigations have revealed that many of the planets, and even some moons, either have or have had large-scale magnetic fields. In the case of the Earth, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune, the their magnetic fields are generated by dynamo processes within these planets, and an interaction between the solar wind and their magnetic fields generates intense radio emission via the electron cyclotron maser instability. In the case of Jupiter, its magnetic field interacts with the moon Io to result in radio emission as well.
  Extrasolar planets reasonably may be expected to generate large-scale magnetic fields and to sustain an electron cyclotron maser instability. Not only may these radio emissions be a means for discovering extrasolar planets, because magnetic fields are tied to the properties of planetary interiors, radio emissions may be a remote sensing means of constraining extrasolar planetary properties that will be otherwise difficult to access. In the case of terrestrial planets, the presence or absence of a magnetic field may be an indicator for habitability. Since the first edition of the Handbook, there have been a number of advances, albeit there remain no unambigous detection of radio emission from extrasolar planets. New ground-based telescopes and new possibilities for space-based telescopes provide promise for the future.</description>

      <title>TOI-837b is a Young Saturn-sized Exoplanet with a Massive 70 $M_{\oplus}$ Core</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13750v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an exhaustive photometric and spectroscopic analysis of TOI-837, a F9/G0 35 Myr young star, hosting a transiting exoplanet, TOI-837b, with an orbital period of 8.32d. Utilising data from TESS and ground-based observations, we determine a planetary radius of 0.82 R_J for TOI-837b. Through detailed HARPS spectroscopic time series analysis, we derive a Doppler semi-amplitude of 35 m/s, corresponding to a planetary mass of 0.39 M_J. The derived planetary properties suggest a substantial core of approximately 70 M_E, constituting about 60% of the planet's total mass. This finding poses a significant challenge to existing theoretical models of core formation. We propose that future atmospheric observations with JWST could provide insights into resolving ambiguities of TOI-837b, offering new perspectives on its composition, formation, and evolution.</description>

      <title>A new lever on exoplanetary B fields: measuring heavy ion velocities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12512v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetic fields connect an array of planetary processes, from atmospheric escape to interior convection. Despite their importance, exoplanet magnetic fields are largely unconstrained by both theory and observation. In this Letter, we propose a novel method for constraining the B field strength of hot gas giants: comparing the velocities of heavy ions and neutral gas with high-resolution spectroscopy. The core concept of this method is that ions are directly deflected by magnetic fields. While neutrals are also affected by B fields via friction with field-accelerated ions, ionic gas should be more strongly coupled to the underlying magnetic field than bulk neutral flow. Hence, measuring the difference between the two velocities yields rough constraints on the B field, provided an estimate of the stellar UV flux is known. We demonstrate that heavy ions are particularly well suited for this technique, because they are less likely to be entrained in complex hydrodynamic outflows than their lighter counterparts. We perform a proof-of-concept calculation with Ba II, an ion whose velocity has been repeatedly measured at high confidence with high-resolution spectroscopy. Our work shows that a 10G magnetic field would produce ~ km/s ion--neutral velocity differences at a microbar, whereas a 50G magnetic field would produce ~20km/s velocity difference. With new leverage on magnetic fields, we will be able to investigate magnetic field generation in the extreme edge cases of hot gas giants, with wide-ranging consequences for planetary interior structure, dynamo theory, and habitability.</description>

      <title>Velocity Analysis of Moving Objects in Earth Observation Satellite Images Using Multi-Spectral Push Broom Scanning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13710v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we present a method for detecting and analyzing the velocities of moving objects in Earth observation satellite images, specifically using data from Planet Labs' push broom scanning satellites. By exploiting the sequential acquisition of multi-spectral images, we estimate the relative differences in acquisition times between spectral bands. This allows us to determine the velocities of moving objects, such as aircraft, even without precise timestamp information from the image archive. We validate our method by comparing the velocities of aircraft observed in satellite images with those reported by onboard ADS-B transponders. The results demonstrate the potential, despite challenges posed by proprietary data limitations, of a new, useful application of commercial satellite data originally intended as an ongoing, once-daily survey of single images covering the entire land-area of the Earth. Our approach extends the applicability of satellite survey imagery for dynamic object tracking and contributes to the broader use of commercial satellite data in scientific research.</description>
