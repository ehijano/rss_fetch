      <title>GOPHER: Optimization-based Phenotype Randomization for Genome-Wide Association Studies with Differential Privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are an essential tool in biomedical research for identifying genetic factors linked to health and disease. However, publicly releasing GWAS summary statistics poses well-recognized privacy risks, including the potential to infer an individual's participation in the study or to reveal sensitive phenotypic information (e.g., disease status). While differential privacy (DP) offers a rigorous mathematical framework for mitigating these risks, existing DP techniques for GWAS either introduce excessive noise or restrict the release to a limited set of results. In this work, we present practical DP mechanisms for releasing the complete set of genome-wide association statistics with privacy guarantees. We demonstrate the accuracy of the privacy-preserving statistics released by our mechanisms on a range of GWAS datasets from the UK Biobank, utilizing both real and simulated phenotypes. We introduce two key techniques to overcome the limitations of prior approaches: (1) an optimization-based randomization mechanism that directly minimizes the expected error in GWAS results to enhance utility, and (2) the use of personalized priors, derived from predictive models privately trained on a subset of the dataset, to enable sample-specific optimization which further reduces the amount of noise introduced by DP. Overall, our work provides practical tools for accurately releasing comprehensive GWAS results with provable protection of study participants.</description>

      <title>Real-time Cricket Sorting By Sex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The global demand for sustainable protein sources is driving increasing interest in edible insects, with Acheta domesticus (house cricket) identified as one of the most suitable species for industrial production. Current farming practices typically rear crickets in mixed-sex populations without automated sex sorting, despite potential benefits such as selective breeding, optimized reproduction ratios, and nutritional differentiation. This work presents a low-cost, real-time system for automated sex-based sorting of Acheta domesticus, combining computer vision and physical actuation. The device integrates a Raspberry Pi 5 with the official Raspberry AI Camera and a custom YOLOv8 nano object detection model, together with a servo-actuated sorting arm. The model reached a mean Average Precision at IoU 0.5 (mAP@0.5) of 0.977 during testing, and real-world experiments with groups of crickets achieved an overall sorting accuracy of 86.8%. These results demonstrate the feasibility of deploying lightweight deep learning models on resource-constrained devices for insect farming applications, offering a practical solution to improve efficiency and sustainability in cricket production.</description>

      <title>pHapCompass: Probabilistic Assembly and Uncertainty Quantification of Polyploid Haplotype Phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computing haplotypes from sequencing data, i.e. haplotype assembly, is an important component of foundational molecular and population genetics problems, including interpreting the effects of genetic variation on complex traits and reconstructing genealogical relationships. Assembling the haplotypes of polyploid genomes remains a significant challenge due to the exponential search space of haplotype phasings and read assignment ambiguity; the latter challenge is particularly difficult for polyploid haplotype assemblers since the information contained within the observed sequence reads is often insufficient for unambiguous haplotype assignment in polyploid genomes. We present pHapCompass, probabilistic haplotype assembly algorithms for diploid and polyploid genomes that explicitly model and propagate read assignment ambiguity to compute a distribution over polyploid haplotype phasings. We develop graph theoretic algorithms to enable statistical inference and uncertainty quantification despite an exponential space of possible phasings. Since prior work evaluates polyploid haplotype assembly on synthetic genomes that do not reflect the realistic genomic complexity of polyploidy organisms, we develop a computational workflow for simulating genomes and DNA-seq for auto- and allopolyploids. Additionally, we generalize the vector error rate and minimum error correction evaluation criteria for partially phased haplotypes. Benchmarking of pHapCompass and several existing polyploid haplotype assemblers shows that pHapCompass yields competitive performance across varying genomic complexities and polyploid structures while retaining an accurate quantification of phase uncertainty. The source code for pHapCompass, simulation scripts, and datasets are freely available at https://github.com/bayesomicslab/pHapCompass.</description>

      <title>Triangle Multiplication Is All You Need For Biomolecular Structure Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18870v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: AlphaFold has transformed protein structure prediction, but emerging applications such as virtual ligand screening, proteome-wide folding, and de novo binder design demand predictions at a massive scale, where runtime and memory costs become prohibitive. A major bottleneck lies in the Pairformer backbone of AlphaFold3-style models, which relies on computationally expensive triangular primitives-especially triangle attention-for pairwise reasoning. We introduce Pairmixer, a streamlined alternative that eliminates triangle attention while preserving higher-order geometric reasoning capabilities that are critical for structure prediction. Pairmixer substantially improves computational efficiency, matching state-of-the-art structure predictors across folding and docking benchmarks, delivering up to 4x faster inference on long sequences while reducing training cost by 34%. Its efficiency alleviates the computational burden of downstream applications such as modeling large protein complexes, high-throughput ligand and binder screening, and hallucination-based design. Within BoltzDesign, for example, Pairmixer delivers over 2x faster sampling and scales to sequences ~30% longer than the memory limits of Pairformer. Code is available at https://github.com/genesistherapeutics/pairmixer.</description>

      <title>SynCell: Contextualized Drug Synergy Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17695v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivation: Drug synergy is strongly influenced by cellular context. Variations in protein interaction landscapes and pathway activities across cell types can reshape how drugs act in combination. However, most existing models overlook this heterogeneity and rely on static or bulk level protein protein interaction networks that ignore cell specific molecular wiring. With the availability of single cell transcriptomic data, it is now possible to reconstruct cell line specific interactomes, offering a new foundation for contextualized drug synergy modeling.
  Results: We present SynCell, a contextualized drug synergy framework that integrates drug protein, protein protein, and protein cell line relations within a unified graph architecture. SynCell leverages single cell derived, cell line specific PPI networks to embed the molecular context in which drugs act, and employs graph convolutional learning to model how pharmacological effects propagate through cell specific signaling networks. This formulation treats synergy prediction as a cell line contextualized drug drug interaction problem. Across two large scale benchmarks (NCI ALMANAC and ONeil), SynCell consistently outperforms state of the art baselines including DeepDDS, HypergraphSynergy, and HERMES, especially in predicting synergies involving unseen drugs or novel cell lines. Ablation analyses show that contextualizing PPIs with single cell resolution yields substantial gains in generalization and biological interpretability.</description>

      <title>The Basic Reproduction Number for Petri Net Models: A Next-Generation Matrix Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02344v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The basic reproduction number ($R_0$) is an epidemiological metric that represents the average number of new infections caused by a single infectious individual in a completely susceptible population. The methodology for calculating this metric is well-defined for numerous model types, including, most prominently, Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs). The basic reproduction number is used in disease modeling to predict the potential of an outbreak and the transmissibility of a disease, as well as by governments to inform public health interventions and resource allocation for controlling the spread of diseases. A Petri Net (PN) is a directed bipartite graph where places, transitions, arcs, and the firing of the arcs determine the dynamic behavior of the system. Petri Net models have been an increasingly used tool within the epidemiology community. However, no generalized method for calculating $R_0$ directly from PN models has been established. Thus, in this paper, we establish a generalized computational framework for calculating $R_0$ directly from Petri Net models. We adapt the next-generation matrix method to be compatible with multiple Petri Net formalisms, including both deterministic Variable Arc Weight Petri Nets (VAPNs) and stochastic continuous-time Petri Nets (SPNs). We demonstrate the method's versatility on a range of complex epidemiological models, including those with multiple strains, asymptomatic states, and nonlinear dynamics. Crucially, we numerically validate our framework by demonstrating that the analytically derived $R_0$ values are in strong agreement with those estimated from simulation data, thereby confirming the method's accuracy and practical utility.</description>

      <title>Likelihood-free inference of phylogenetic tree posterior distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12976v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Phylogenetic inference, the task of reconstructing how related sequences evolved from common ancestors, is a central objective in evolutionary genomics. The current state-of-the-art methods exploit probabilistic models of sequence evolution along phylogenetic trees, by searching for the tree maximizing the likelihood of observed sequences, or by estimating the posterior of the tree given the sequences in a Bayesian framework. Both approaches typically require to compute likelihoods, which is only feasible under simplifying assumptions such as independence of the evolution at the different positions of the sequence, and even then remains a costly operation. Here we present the first likelihood-free inference method for posterior distributions over phylogenies. It exploits a novel expressive encoding for pairs of sequences, and a parameterized probability distribution factorized over a succession of subtree merges. The resulting network provides accurate estimates of the posterior distribution outperforming both state-of-the-art maximum likelihood methods and a previous likelihood-free method for point estimation. It opens the way to fast and accurate phylogenetic inference under models of sequence evolution beyond those amenable to current likelihood-based inference methods.</description>
