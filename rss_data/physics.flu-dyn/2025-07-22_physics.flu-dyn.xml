      <title>Numerical investigation of wake dynamics and heat transfer in MHD flows around confined triangular prisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study numerically investigates the flow evolution and heat transfer characteristics of an electrically conducting fluid over triangular prisms confined between two parallel plates with a heated bottom plate under the influence of a magnetic field. The research focuses on the three-dimensional behavior of MHD flows at low Hartmann numbers ($Ha$), exploring how obstacle orientation and mixed convection influence flow dynamics and heat transfer. Three-dimensional simulations are performed using an in-house MHD solver in OpenFOAM at a constant channel height based Reynolds number ($Re_{h}=600$). The combined effects of Richardson number ($Ri$) and $Ha$ on wake dynamics and heat transfer are analyzed for three triangular prism orientations. The results reveal that increasing $Ha$ promotes flow two-dimensionality, while higher $Ri$ enhances three-dimensionality. Three wake instability modes (Mode A, B, and C) are identified. Orientation 2 exhibits the lowest mean drag coefficient at $Ha=0$, $Ri=5$, while the highest mean lift coefficient is observed at $Ha=0$, $Ri=0$. Orientation 3 achieves the highest heat transfer rate, with an average Nusselt number of $21.05$ at $Ha=25$, $Ri=5$, and consistently outperforms the other orientations in heat transfer across various $Ha$ and $Ri$ conditions. These findings highlight the strong coupling between wake dynamics and heat transfer, offering insights for optimizing MHD flows in practical applications.</description>

      <title>Wave-Particle Turbulence Simulation of Spatially Developing Round Jets: Turbulent Flow Modeling and Method Validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatially developing round jet flows are fundamental to numerous engineering applications. This letter applies the wave-particle turbulence simulation (WPTS) method, a recently developed multiscale approach, to simulate a spatially developing circular jet at Reynolds number 5000, a canonical configuration for validating turbulence models. The study aims to further establish the effectiveness and accuracy of WPTS for shear-driven turbulent flows. WPTS employs a multiscale framework that couples wave and particle components, where the wave component captures cell-resolved flow structures while the particle component models sub-grid flow information through non-equilibrium transport. Using a computational grid containing only 2% of the cells required for direct numerical simulation (DNS), WPTS successfully predicts both qualitative flow features and quantitative turbulence statistics, including: the characteristic linear decay of centerline velocity, radial profiles of mean velocity, and anisotropic Reynolds stress components. The results demonstrate excellent agreement with DNS data and experimental measurements. These findings establish WPTS as an effective computational tool for turbulence simulation, capable of maintaining high fidelity in capturing essential turbulence characteristics while utilizing significantly coarser grids than traditional methods. The successful application to turbulent jet flow demonstrates the method's potential for extension to more complex engineering flow configurations, offering a computationally efficient alternative for industrial applications.</description>

      <title>Minimizing Fixed-Wing Flight Costs in Turbulence through Passive Stability: Insights from the Avian Wing Aerodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Birds rely on active high-acceleration morphing and flapping to navigate complex airflows, but they can also maintain stable fixed-wing postures under persistent atmospheric disturbances. Here, we show that avian wings exhibit aerodynamic adaptivity to incoming flow variations, characterized by a gentler lift curve slope, a wider operative angle of attack range, and turbulence insensitivity, compared to engineered airfoil wings across varying angles of attack and turbulence intensities. This adaptivity stems from the consistent flow structures around avian wings under different turbulence intensities and their ability to suppress flow separation at high angles of attack. Longitudinal dynamic stability analysis further reveals that avian aerodynamic characteristics enable the corresponding modeled rigid flyers to maintain a broader stability envelope. This stability supports stable fixed-wing flight in real turbulent environments while reducing the need for active control, thereby minimizing flight cost.</description>

      <title>A three-dimensional scanning stereoscopic particle image velocimetry for large-volume liquid flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a Scanning Stereoscopic Particle Image velocimetry~(SSPIV) system which incorporates a thin rotating prism to obtain three-dimensional velocity fields in a large cubical measurement volume. The system makes use of an arrangement where a laser beam is first laterally deflected using an even-faced prism, and then passed through a cylindrical lens rod to obtain light sheets for illumination. This eliminates the need for large rotating mirrors or heavy prisms and facilitates relatively fast rotation speeds of up to 4800 rpm for the prism, yielding three-dimensional, three-component velocity field over a large depth at relatively high particle seeding density. About $10^6$ velocity vectors (3D-3C) are obtained in a single volumetric-scan of $100 \times 100 \times 100$ mm$^3$. The method is demonstrated using two independent experiments, (1) a round jet at Reynolds number Re = 1000, and (2) the flow field around a freely rising sphere at a Reynolds number Re$_p$ $\approx$ 260, and the wake flow is compared with direct numerical simulations of a falling viscous droplet. The scanning gives time-resolved evolution of the large-scale vortical structures of the Re = 1000 jet, with spatial gradients captured fairly well. The three-dimensional flow field surrounding the refractive-index-matched rising sphere is shown to be steady and non-axisymmetric. The flow field and separation bubble are seen to be similar, but slightly shorter than that of the falling droplet case and the uniform flow past a fixed sphere case at a comparable Reynolds number.</description>

      <title>An Objective Measure of Unsteadiness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an objective measure for the unsteady component of a time-dependent velocity field derived from a spatio-temporal variational principle. As an application, we define an objective analogue of the classical $Q$-criterion based on extremizers of unsteadiness minimization. We apply this new criterion to several explicit solutions of the Navier--Stokes equation and compare the results to existing vortex criteria.</description>

      <title>Anisotropy of emergent large-scale dynamics in forced stratified shear flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stably stratified shear flows, where the base velocity shear is quasi-continuously forced externally, can arise in many geophysically relevant circumstances. It is important to determine the emergent dynamics of the ensuing statistically steady stratified turbulence. We investigate this phenomenon in a series of three-dimensional direct numerical simulations using spectral element methods. We force the flow to relax back towards vertical hyperbolic tangent profiles of streamwise velocity and buoyancy, with characteristic half-depth $\dO$, half-velocity jump $\UO$, and half-buoyancy jump $\BO$, with a relaxation time $t_r=100 \tauadv$ where $\tauadv:=\dO/\UO$. We consider computational domains of vertical extent $\Gz=48$ with a range of horizontal extents $16\leq\Gh\leq512$. We simulate a fluid with Prandtl number $\Pr:=\nu/\kappa=1$, and set the initial bulk Reynolds number $\ReO:=\UO\dO/\nu=50$ and Richardson number $\RiO:=\BO\dO/\UO^{2}=1/80$. At these parameters, the flow is initially unstable to a primary Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. We simulate the continuously forced flow over about $5000\tauadv$, and investigate the dynamically emergent length scales and turbulence properties of the statistically stationary flow, in particular the local turbulent flux coefficient. We find that the shear layer half depth converges to $d\approx8$ with markedly increased $\Re\approx400$ and associated convergent vertical mixing properties only for $\Gh\gtrsim\Ghcrit=96$. However, emergent dominant yet large-scale spanwise or streamwise flow structures appear to extend up to $\Lambda_{y}\approx50$ or even $\Lambda_{x}\approx115$, respectively. Our observations demonstrate the marked anisotropy of characteristic emergent length scales, and are consistent with the possibility that an `imprint' of the primary instability continues to survive in such turbulent flows.</description>

      <title>Statistical state dynamics based study of turbulent Eady fronts. Part 2. Finite amplitude equilibria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Streamwise roll circulations commonly observed in frontal regions are primary agents of momentum and tracer transport in the planetary boundary layer (PBL) both in the atmosphere and ocean. Traditionally, the formation of the streamwise roll/streak structure (RSS) has been ascribed to symmetric instability (SI). In part 1, we studied RSS formation in the classical Eady front problem using statistical state dynamics (SSD), which allows incorporating the Reynolds stress (RS) torque instability mechanism together with SI in the dynamics underlying RSS formation. We found using SSD theory that the RS torque mechanism acts synergistically with the SI mechanism in forcing symmetric circulations in fronts when Richardson number Ri &lt; 1, and also that the turbulence-mediated RS torque mechanism supports RSS formation in fronts with Ri &gt; 1 for which the SI mechanism does not operate. Although SI theory provides an explanation for initial roll formation, it leaves open the question of RSS equilibration. An advantage of the SSD formulation of RSS dynamics is that it consistently incorporates the equilibration process. In this paper, we extend perturbation analysis of RSS dynamics in the SSD framework to a nonlinear analysis to understand roll formation, equilibration, and maintenance in the turbulent RSS regime.</description>

      <title>Wall Wettability Control of Cavitation Patterns and Stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the role of wall wettability, characterized by the wall contact angle (WCA), in controlling cavitation dynamics and stability around a Clark Y hydrofoil. High-fidelity Large Eddy Simulations (LES) coupled with a dynamic contact angle model were employed within the OpenFOAM framework to explore WCAs ranging from hydrophilic ($0^\circ$) to superhydrophobic ($160^\circ$) under distinct cavitation numbers ($\sigma = 1.6$, $0.8$, and $0.4$), representing incipient, cloud, and supercavitation regimes, respectively. The results show that increasing WCA consistently promotes earlier cavitation inception, thicker cavity development, and greater flow unsteadiness. For $\sigma = 1.6$, higher WCAs led to smaller, detached vapor bubbles and localized pressure fluctuations. At $\sigma = 0.8$, superhydrophobic surfaces caused more extensive vapor structures, intensified shedding dynamics, and stronger pressure fluctuations. For $\sigma = 0.4$, high WCAs facilitated stable, wall-adhered cavities that suppressed re-entrant jet activity and reduced unsteady loading. These findings demonstrate that surface wettability serves as an effective passive control mechanism for tailoring cavitation behavior and optimizing flow stability in engineering applications.</description>

      <title>A numerical investigation of sweep effects on turbulent flow over iced wings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study employs an improved delayed detached eddy simulation (AMD-IDDES) method to investigate the flow characteristics of an iced swept wing. The AMD-IDDES approach incorporates an anisotropic minimum-dissipation (AMD) model into the traditional IDDES framework to better account for local flow anisotropy and energy dissipation characteristics. The method is validated against the traditional IDDES approach, and the results show that AMD-IDDES more accurately captures the evolution of vortices and separated shear layers. Compared with an iced straight wing, a swept wing exhibits distinct aerodynamic behavior driven mainly by the sweep angle. The sweep angle induces strong spanwise flow, which reshapes the separation region and transforms the flow from two-dimensional to three-dimensional. This spanwise motion significantly alters vortex development and enhances the complexity of the unsteady flow. The shear layer separation, initiated by a Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, dominates the unsteady aerodynamic response. Although wingtip effects remain secondary, their interaction with the leading-edge vortex still contributes to lowering the dominant frequency. Overall, this study highlights that the aerodynamic forces of an iced swept wing are primarily governed by sweep-induced spanwise flow and associated shear layer dynamics, with minimal influence from the root and tip regions.</description>

      <title>Polydisperse collision kernels in droplet-laden turbulence with implications for rain formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the role of turbulence in enhancing the collisions of droplets within the cloud droplet bottleneck range. To this end, we perform direct numerical simulations of polydisperse inertial particles suspended in three-dimensional turbulence at high Reynolds number. Our analysis reveals that polydispersity enhances collisions of light droplets, but attenuates collisions at larger Stokes numbers by reducing the degree of inertial clustering and weakening the sling effect. We present a novel parameterization for the bidisperse collision kernel which blends the mechanisms related to inertial clustering and the sling effect with polydispersity. We then demonstrate that the droplet size distribution of typical cloud droplets is effectively broadened by turbulence and that droplet growth may be accelerated significantly by turbulent intermittency--a condition that the here provided theoretical contemplations in conjunction with recent measurements in clouds suggest is likely.</description>

      <title>Edge-effects in the turbulent flow over flexible aquatic vegetation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Riparian vegetation along riverbanks and seagrass along coastlines interact with water currents, significantly altering their flow. To characterise the turbulent fluid motion along the streamwise-edge of a region covered by submerged vegetation (canopy), we perform direct numerical simulations of a half-channel partially obstructed by flexible stems, vertically clamped to the bottom wall. An intense streamwise vortex forms along the canopy edge, drawing high-momentum fluid into the side of the canopy and ejecting low-momentum fluid from the canopy tip, in an upwelling close to the canopy edge. This mechanism has a profound impact on the mean flow and on the exchange of momentum between the fluid and the structure, which we thoroughly characterise. The signature of the canopy-edge vortex is also found in the dynamical response of the stems, assessed for two different values of their flexibility. Varying the flexibility of the stems, we observe how different turbulent structures over the canopy are affected, while the canopy-edge vortex does not exhibit major modifications. Our results provide a better understanding of the flow in fluvial and coastal environments, informing engineering solutions aimed at containing the water flow and protecting banks and coasts from erosion.</description>

      <title>Reduced Subgid Scale Terms in Three-Dimensional Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large eddy simulation (LES) has become a central technique for simulating turbulent flows in engineering and applied sciences, offering a compromise between accuracy and computational cost by resolving large scale motions and modeling the effects of smaller, unresolved scales through a subgrid scale (SGS) model. The fidelity and robustness of LES depends critically on the SGS model, particularly in coarse simulations where much of the turbulence spectrum remains unresolved.
  In this work, we extend the tau-orthogonal (TO) method, a data-driven SGS modeling framework, to three-dimensional turbulent flows. The method reformulates the high-dimensional SGS closure problem as a low-dimensional prediction task focused on scale-aware quantities of interest (QoIs). We extend the model to incorporate QoI-state dependence and temporal correlations by combining regularized least-squares regression with a multivariate Gaussian residual model. This yields a simple yet effective stochastic time-series prediction model (the LRS model), with orders-of-magnitude fewer parameters than typical deep learning approaches which try to directly learn the high-dimensional SGS closure.
  We demonstrate the effectiveness of the TO LRS model in three-dimensional forced isotropic turbulence and turbulent channel flow. The model achieves accurate long-term QoI distributions, robust performance across hyperparameter settings, and good reproduction of key flow features such as kinetic energy spectra and coherent structures, despite being trained solely on QoI trajectories. Comparisons against classical SGS models, including Smagorinsky and WALE formulations, highlight the TO LRS model's balance of accuracy and computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Full-field rheo-optical analysis of wormlike and networked micellar structures under uniaxial extensional flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present study proposes a novel full-field extensional rheo-optical technique to investigate the relationship between the rheological properties and internal structural deformation of complex fluids under uniaxial extensional flow. Macroscopic viscoelasticity from rheological measurements and microscopic birefringence from optical measurements are integrated to evaluate the microstructural deformation and orientation of the fluids under extensional stress. The proposed technique integrates a liquid dripping method with a high-speed polarization camera to measure the extensional stress and flow birefringence simultaneously. In the liquid dripping method, temporal evolution images of the liquid filament diameter for fluids dripping from a nozzle are measured to obtain the extensional stress loading on the filament. These images are acquired using the high-speed polarization camera that captures full-field two-dimensional (2D) birefringence with high spatiotemporal resolution. Wormlike and networked micellar solutions of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) and sodium salicylate (NaSal) with varying concentrations of CTAB and NaSal are employed as the measurement targets. Consequently, we successfully visualized temporally developing images of the flow birefringence field of uniaxially extending micellar solutions induced by the orientation of micelles. Furthermore, the proposed technique supports investigating the conditions for establishing the stress-optical rule, which is the linear relationship between stress and birefringence. The stress-optical coefficient, which is a proportionality constant indicating the sensitivity of birefringence to stress, is analyzed from these measurements. The stress-optical coefficient under uniaxial extensional flow, obtained using the proposed technique, is confirmed to be comparable to that under shear flow.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional numerical study on hydrogen bubble growth at electrode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D direct numerical simulation of electrolysis is applied to investigate the growth and detachment of bubbles at electrodes.
  The moving gas-liquid interface is modeled employing the VOF-based method. To ensure the accuracy of the simulations,
  a mesh-independence study has been performed.
  The simulations include the growth phase of the bubbles followed by their detachment from the electrode surface
  and the results are validated with analytical models and experimental data.
  The bubble growth is diffusion controlled leading to the scaling $R = 2\beta t^{1/2}$, but the growth exponent is overpredicted by our simulation during initial stage.
  Furthermore, it is proved that the nucleation sites of the bubble strongly influence gas transport by measuring the relevant Sherwood number.
  Finally, we investigate the effects of contact angle and nucleation sites on bubble detachment behavior,
  and compare the detachment radius with Fritz's formula, the results show a good agreement,
  confirming that buoyancy is the dominant driving force.
  As the nucleation sites increase, the induced bubble coalescence accelerates the bubble detachment. Taken together,
  these findings give us valuable insights into improving gas bubble removal and enhancing overall electrolysis efficiency.</description>

      <title>Multi-Scale Data Assimilation in Turbulent Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the potential of Data-Assimilation (DA) within the multi-scale framework of a shell model of turbulence, with a focus on the Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF). The central objective is to understand how measuring mesoscales (i.e., inertial-range scales) enhances the prediction of both large-scale and small-scale intermittent variables, by systematically varying observation frequency and the set of measured scales. We demonstrate that measurements conducted at frequencies that exceed those of the observed scales enable full synchronization of larger scales, provided that at least two adjacent mesoscale are measured. In addition, we benchmark the EnKF against two standard DA methods, such as Nudging and Ensemble 4D-Var, showing its overall superior performance. Moreover, our results underscore the need for a tailored, scale-aware inflation technique to stabilize the assimilation process, preventing filter divergence and ensuring robust convergence.</description>

      <title>Wave-induced drift in third-order deep-water theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goal of this work is to investigate particle motions beneath unidirectional, deep-water waves up to the third-order in nonlinearity. A particular focus is on the approximation known as Stokes drift, and how it relates to the particle kinematics as computed directly from the particle trajectory mapping. The reduced Hamiltonian formulation of Zakharov and Krasitskii serves as a convenient tool to separate the effects of weak nonlinearity, in particular the appearance of bound harmonics and the mutual corrections to the wave frequencies. By numerical integration of the particle trajectory mappings we are able to compute motions and resulting drift for sea-states with one, two and several harmonics. Overall, we find the linear theory yields the largest forward drift close to the surface, followed by second and third order. At greater depth this trend reverses, with linear theory yielding the smallest forward drift. Incorporating difference harmonic terms into the classical Stokes drift formulation is found to yield improved agreement with the drift obtained from nonlinear wave theories, particularly at depth.</description>

      <title>Bounds on the Spreading Radius in Droplet Impact: The Two-Dimensional Case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of a cylindrical (quasi-two-dimensional) droplet impacting on a hard surface. Cylindrical droplet impact can be engineered in the laboratory, and a theoretical model of the system can also be used to shed light on various complex experiments involving the impact of liquid sheets. We formulate a rim-lamella model for the droplet-impact problem. Using Gronwall's Inequality, we establish theoretical bounds for the maximum spreading radius $\mathcal{R}_{max}$ in droplet impact, specifically $k_1 \mathrm{Re}^{1/3}-k_2(1-\cos\vartheta_{adv})^{1/2}(\mathrm{Re}/\mathrm{We})^{1/2}\leq \mathcal{R}_{max}/R_0\leq k_1\mathrm{Re}^{1/3}$, where $\mathrm{Re}$ and $\mathrm{We}$ are the Reynolds and Weber number based on the droplet's pre-impact velocity and radius $R_0$, $\vartheta_{adv}$ is the advancing contact angle (assumed constant in our simplified analysis), and $k_1$ and $k_2$ are constants. We perform several campaigns of simulations using the Volume of Fluid Method to model the droplet impact, and we find that the simulation results are consistent with the theoretical bounds.</description>

      <title>Influence of Static and Dynamic Downwash Interactions on Multi-Quadrotor Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09463v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flying multiple quadrotors in close proximity presents a significant challenge due to complex aerodynamic interactions, particularly downwash effects that are known to destabilize vehicles and degrade performance. Traditionally, multi-quadrotor systems rely on conservative strategies, such as collision avoidance zones around the robot volume, to circumvent this effect. This restricts their capabilities by requiring a large volume for the operation of a multi-quadrotor system, limiting their applicability in dense environments. This work provides a comprehensive, data-driven analysis of the downwash effect, with a focus on characterizing, analyzing, and understanding forces, moments, and velocities in both single and multi-quadrotor configurations. We use measurements of forces and torques to characterize vehicle interactions, and particle image velocimetry (PIV) to quantify the spatial features of the downwash wake for a single quadrotor and an interacting pair of quadrotors. This data can be used to inform physics-based strategies for coordination, leverage downwash for optimized formations, expand the envelope of operation, and improve the robustness of multi-quadrotor control.</description>

      <title>Mathematical modeling and simulation of two-phase magnetohydrodynamic flows at low magnetic Reynolds numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14518v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel mathematical framework for simulating the two-phase incompressible magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) problems. Focusing on low magnetic Reynolds number regimes, where induced magnetic fields are negligible compared to applied fields, an intrinsic sharp-interface system is first formulated. Subsequently, we utilize the phase-field approach to characterize the interface and derive a thermodynamically consistent phase-field model through the Onsager's variational principle. The resulting system couples the Abels--Garcke--Gr\"un (AGG) model of two-phase flows with a quasi-static formulation modeling the electromagnetic phenomena. Theoretically, the sharp-interface limit is investigated via asymptotic arguments, deducing that the sharp-interface system can be recovered in the limit of vanishing interface thickness. Consequently, this justifies the reliability of the phase-field approach as an approximated method. In addition, we present some three-dimensional numerical experiments of magnetic damping effects on bubble dynamics, where the observed results demonstrate the validity of the proposed framework in capturing complex MHD phenomena.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic Flow Control in Hypersonic Rarefied Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14628v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Unified Gas-Kinetic Wave-Particle (UGKWP) method, developed for multiscale simulation of partially ionized plasmas, has been extended to unstructured meshes, enabling the modeling of electromagnetic flows around a hemisphere across near-continuum to rarefied regimes. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first application of a multiscale plasma solver to this problem. In our approach, neutrals, ions, and electrons are treated as distinct species, with electrons modeled beyond the conventional fluid approximation. The numerical implementation is validated through comparison with reference solutions for neutral hypersonic flow around a sphere, as well as benchmarking against experimental data for a Mach 4.75 pre-ionized argon flow. In both cases, the UGKWP results show good agreement with the reference and experimental data. The findings reveal that rarefied effects play a significant role in the prediction of electromagnetic flow control, underscoring the necessity of multiscale modeling in plasma flow applications.</description>

      <title>WaterLily.jl: A differentiable and backend-agnostic Julia solver for incompressible viscous flow around dynamic bodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16032v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Integrating computational fluid dynamics (CFD) solvers into optimization and machine-learning frameworks is hampered by the rigidity of classic computational languages and the slow performance of more flexible high-level languages. In this work, we introduce WaterLily.jl: an open-source incompressible viscous flow solver written in the Julia language. An immersed boundary method is used to enforce the effect of solid boundaries on flow past complex geometries with arbitrary motions. The small code base is multidimensional, multiplatform and backend-agnostic, ie. it supports serial and multithreaded CPU execution, and GPUs of different vendors. Additionally, the pure-Julia implementation allows the solver to be fully differentiable using automatic differentiation. The computational cost per time step and grid point remains constant with increasing grid size on CPU backends, and we measure up to two orders of magnitude speed-up on a supercomputer GPU compared to serial CPU execution. This leads to comparable performance with low-level CFD solvers written in C and Fortran on research-scale problems, opening up exciting possible future applications on the cutting edge of machine-learning research.</description>

      <title>Vortex shedding suppression in elliptical cylinder via reinforcement learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00421v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Flow control of bluff bodies plays a critical role in engineering applications. In this study, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is employed to develop flow control strategies for the flow past an elliptical cylinder confined between two walls. The primary objective is to investigate the feasibility of achieving multi-objective flow control for an elliptical cylinder with varying aspect ratios ($Ar$), while maintaining low control energy input. DRL training results demonstrate that for an elliptical cylinder with larger $Ar$, the control strategy effectively reduces drag, minimizes lift fluctuations, and completely suppresses vortex shedding, all while maintaining low external energy consumption. Conversely, decreasing the $Ar$ compromises the effectiveness of multi-objective control, even when greater energy input is applied. Through detailed physical analysis, the coupling effect between the blockage ratio ($\beta$) and $Ar$ is identified as a limiting factor for vortex shedding suppression and wake stabilization. At lower values of $\beta$, the control strategy successfully achieves multi-objective optimization for elliptical cylinders across the entire range of $Ar$. Although balancing energy efficiency and control performance remains challenging for highly slender cylinders, the proposed DRL strategy still achieves effective vortex shedding suppression. This work highlights the potential of DRL-based control strategies to effectively stabilize wake flows around slender bluff bodies, with an explicit emphasis on maintaining energy efficiency.</description>

      <title>Strategies for energy-efficient flow control leveraging deep reinforcement learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00424v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates active flow control in two-dimensional flows at a Reynolds number of 100 using Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). We utilize DRL to develop flow control strategies that enhance energy efficiency and minimize energy consumption, thereby addressing the limitations of traditional methods. We find that the optimal jet placement for both square and circular cylinders is at the main flow separation point, achieving the best balance between energy efficiency and control effectiveness. For the circular cylinder, positioning the jet at approximately 105{\deg} from the stagnation point requires only 1% of the inlet flow rate and achieves an 8% reduction in drag, with energy consumption one-third of that at other positions. For the square cylinder, placing the jet near the rear corner requires only 2% of the inlet flow rate, achieving a maximum drag reduction of 14.4%, whereas energy consumption near the front corner is 27 times higher, resulting in only 12% drag reduction. In multi-action control, the convergence speed and stability are lower compared to single-action control, but activating multiple jets significantly reduces initial energy consumption and improves energy efficiency. Physically, the interaction of the synthetic jet with the flow generates new vortices that modify the local flow structure, significantly enhancing the cylinder's aerodynamic performance. Our control strategy achieves a superior balance between energy efficiency and control performance compared to previous studies, underscoring its significant potential to advance sustainable and effective flow control.</description>

      <title>Self-Propulsion of floating ice blocks caused by melting in water</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16010v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that floating ice blocks with asymmetric shapes can self-propel with significant speeds due to buoyancy driven currents caused by melting. Model right-angle ice wedges are found to move in the direction opposite to the gravity current, which descends along the longest inclined side, in water baths with temperatures between 10 {\deg}C and 30 {\deg}C. We describe the measured speed as a function of the length and angle of the inclined side, and the temperature of the bath in terms of a propulsion model which incorporates the cooling of the surrounding fluid by the melting of ice. The heat pulled from the surrounding liquid by the melting ice block is shown to lead to propulsion which is balanced by drag. We further show that the ice block moves robustly in a saltwater bath with ocean-like salinity and maintains the same direction of motion as in freshwater. A simplified model is further developed to describe the propulsion of asymmetric ice blocks in saltwater, incorporating the effects of rising meltwater and the sinking of the surrounding bath water due to cooling. For sufficiently large temperature, we find that the cooling-induced sinking flow generates a stronger force than the upward flow from the meltwater. Consequently, the net propulsion force is in the same direction and nearly the same magnitude as that observed in freshwater. These findings suggest that melting-driven propulsion may be relevant to the motion of icebergs in sufficiently warm oceanic environments.</description>

      <title>A validated fluid-structure interaction simulation model for vortex-induced vibration of a flexible pipe in steady flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05748v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a validated fluid-structure interaction simulation framework based on strip methods for the vortex-induced vibration of a flexible pipe. The numerical results are compared with the experimental data from three previous steady flow conditions: uniform, linearly sheared, and bidirectionally sheared flow. The Reynolds number ranges from $10^4$ to $10^5$. The flow field is simulated via the RANS model, which is based on the open-source software OpenFOAM. The solid field is modeled based on Euler-Bernoulli beam theory, and fluid-structure coupling is implemented via a weak coupling algorithm developed in MATLAB. The vortex-induced vibration response is assessed in terms of amplitude and frequency, along with the differences in strain. Additionally, wavelet analysis and traveling wave phenomena are investigated. The numerical simulation codes and experimental data in this manuscript are openly available, providing a foundation for more complex vortex-induced vibration simulations in the future.</description>

      <title>Nanodroplet Dynamics: Coalescence and Impact</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13659v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study aims to investigate the coalescence-induced jumping of water nanodroplets in a high Ohnesorge number regime (0.4 &lt; Oh &lt; 1) on a superhydrophobic surface and the dynamics of droplets when a stationary droplet on a solid surface is struck by another droplet of similar size from above, using molecular dynamics simulation. The first part of this study identified the critical droplet size below which coalescence-induced jumping terminates, developed a universal jumping mechanism for droplets of all types, explained a special phenomenon of jumping velocity becoming maximum before it approaches zero, and investigated how jumping terminates due to the size difference between droplets. These findings align well with prior micro-level studies and experimental predictions. The second part of this study investigated the jumping process of the merged droplet after the impact of a moving droplet upon a stationary one. The impact velocity, droplet size, surface textures, and wettability are influential factors on the jumping velocity in this case. Scaling laws for maximum spreading time, spreading factor, and restitution coefficient are formulated based on the Weber (We) number and the Reynolds (Re) number. These laws differ from those established for single-droplet impacts. For superhydrophobic surfaces, the spreading time is approximated by three times the droplet radius and impact velocity, and with the dimensionless spreading time, it exhibits a linear relationship with We 0.31. For both cases, the jumping process is primarily governed by the energy available for conversion into the kinetic energy of the merged droplet following dissipation. For the droplet impact case, the energy conversion efficiency becomes constant at high-impact droplet velocities. About 1% of the energy is dissipated due to surface adhesion, which reduces at higher impact velocity.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the potential of an attention-based neural network architecture, the Senseiver, for sparse sensing in tsunami forecasting. Specifically, we focus on the Tsunami Data Assimilation Method, which generates forecasts from tsunameter networks. Our model is used to reconstruct high-resolution tsunami wavefields from extremely sparse observations, including cases where the tsunami epicenters are not represented in the training set. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms the Linear Interpolation with Huygens-Fresnel Principle in generating dense observation networks, achieving markedly improved accuracy.</description>
