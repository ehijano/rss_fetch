      <title>Scalable Multiterminal Key Agreement via Error-Correcting Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore connections between secret sharing and secret key agreement, which yield a simple and scalable multiterminal key agreement protocol. In our construction, we use error-correcting codes, specifically Reed-Solomon codes with threshold reconstruction, to ensure no information is leaked to an eavesdropper. We then derive novel bounds for both full-rank maximum distance separable codes and our scheme's secret key capacity, using key capacity's duality with multivariate mutual information.</description>

      <title>Implementing Transport Coding in OMNeT++ for Message Delay Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transport coding reduces message delay in packet-switched networks by introducing controlled redundancy at the transport layer: $k$ original packets are encoded into $n\ge k$ coded packets, and the message is reconstructed after the first $k$ successful deliveries, effectively shifting latency from the maximum packet delay to the $k$-th order statistic. We present a concise, reproducible discrete-event implementation of transport coding in OMNeT++, including a multi-hop Kleinrock-type network, FIFO queues, exponential service and link delays, and explicit receiver-side reconstruction that records message delay and deadline violations. Using paired uncoded ($n{=}k$) and coded ($n{&gt;}k$) configurations at the same message generation rate, we compare delay, reliability, and saturation effects across code rates and input loads. Simulation results show consistent reductions of average delay and late-delivery probability for moderate redundancy, while keeping the saturation throughput close to the uncoded baseline. The proposed model provides a transparent bridge between analytical transport-coding formulas and executable simulation for tuning redundancy in low-latency services.</description>

      <title>Downlink Power Allocation for STAR-RIS-Assisted Cell-Free Massive MIMO with Multi-antenna Users</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the downlink power allocation of the simultaneous transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS)-assisted cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system with multi-antenna users. We introduce downlink spectral efficiency (SE) and derive novel closed-form SE expressions using linear minimum mean squared error (MMSE) detectors. We also address the downlink power allocation via a sum SE maximization problem framed within an alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM)-based fractional programming (FP) algorithm. Numerical results demonstrate that systems utilizing multi-antenna users significantly enhance SE, achieving at least a 20% SE increase as the number of antennas increases from one to six. Additionally, our proposed ADMM-based FP algorithm outperforms existing fractional power control approaches, yielding a more than 20% SE increase. These results highlight the necessity for adopting multi-antenna users and efficient power allocation algorithms in STAR-RIS-assisted cell-free massive MIMO systems.</description>

      <title>Age of Information with Age-Dependent Server Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a single-source multi-server generate-at-will discrete-time non-preemptive status update system where update packets are transmitted using {\em only one} of the available servers, according to a server selection policy. In particular, when a transmission is complete, the update system makes a threshold-based decision on whether to wait or transmit, and if latter, which server to use for transmissions, on the basis of the instantaneous value of the age of information (AoI) process. In our setting, servers have general heterogeneous discrete phase-type (DPH) distributed service times, and also heterogeneous transmission costs. The goal is to find an age-dependent multi-threshold policy that minimizes the AoI cost with a constraint on transmission costs, the former cost defined in terms of the time average of an arbitrary function of AoI. For this purpose, we propose a novel tool called \emph{multi-regime absorbing Markov chain} (MR-AMC) in discrete time. Using the MR-AMC framework, we exactly obtain the distribution of AoI, and subsequently the costs associated with AoI and transmissions. With the exact analysis in hand, optimum thresholds can be obtained in the case of a few servers, by exhaustive search. We validate the proposed analytical model, and also demonstrate the benefits of age-dependent server selection, with numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Protecting Human Activity Signatures in Compressed IEEE 802.11 CSI Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Explicit channel state information (CSI) feedback in IEEE~802.11 conveys \emph{transmit beamforming directions} by reporting quantized Givens rotation and phase angles that parametrize the right-singular subspace of the channel matrix. Because these angles encode fine-grained spatial signatures of the propagation environment, recent work have shown that plaintext CSI feedback can inadvertently reveal user activity, identity, and location to passive eavesdroppers. In this work, we introduce a standards-compatible \emph{differentially private (DP) quantization mechanism} that replaces deterministic angular quantization with an $\varepsilon$-DP stochastic quantizer applied directly to the Givens parameters of the transmit beamforming matrix. The mechanism preserves the 802.11 feedback structure, admits closed-form sensitivity bounds for the angular representation, and enables principled privacy calibration. Numerical simulations demonstrate strong privacy guarantees with minimal degradation in beamforming performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.18535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the Integrated Communication and Control (ICAC) problem. Specifically, we investigate how messages can be transmitted from the controller/encoder to the observer/decoder through the control signal in Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) vector-state Linear Quadratic Gaussian (LQG) systems under control constraints. We provide a computable capacity expression using semidefinite programming. We further show that it is possible to transmit data at a nonzero rate over an LQG system while maintaining the same optimal control cost as in the case where no information message are transmitted. Finally, we discuss how this framework generalizes communication over MIMO Gaussian channels with feedback, both with and without InterSymbol Interference (ISI).</description>

      <title>Embracing Beam-Squint Effects for Wideband LEO Satellite Communications: A 3D Rainbow Beamforming Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite communications (SATCOM) offers high-throughput, low-latency global connectivity to a very large number of users. To accommodate this demand with limited hardware resources, beam hopping (BH) has emerged as a prominent approach in LEO SATCOM. However, its time-domain switching mechanism confines coverage to a small fraction of the service area during each time slot, exacerbating uplink throughput bottlenecks and latency issues as the user density increases. Meanwhile, wideband systems experience the beam-squint effect, where analog beamforming (BF) directions vary with subcarrier frequencies, potentially causing misalignment at certain frequencies, thereby hindering the performance of wideband SATCOM. In this paper, we aim to shift the paradigm in wideband LEO SATCOM from beam-squint as an impairment to beam-squint as an asset. Specifically, we put forth 3D rainbow BF employing a joint phase-time array (JPTA) antenna with true time delay (TTD) to intentionally widen the beam-squint angle, steering frequency-dependent beams toward distributed directions. This novel approach enables the satellite to serve its entire coverage area in a single time slot. By doing so, the satellite simultaneously receives uplink signals from a massive number of users, significantly boosting throughput and reducing latency. To realize 3D rainbow BF, we formulate a JPTA beamformer optimization problem and address the non-convex nature of the optimization problem through a novel joint alternating and decomposition-based optimization framework. Through numerical evaluations incorporating realistic 3D LEO SATCOM geometry, our numerical results demonstrate that the proposed rainbow BF-empowered LEO SATCOM achieves up to 2.8-fold increase in uplink throughput compared to conventional BH systems. These results mark a significant breakthrough for 6G wideband LEO SATCOM.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Remote Monitoring of Correlated Markovian Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate real-time tracking of two correlated stochastic processes over a shared wireless channel. The joint evolution of the processes is modeled as a two-dimensional discrete-time Markov chain. Each process is observed by a dedicated sampler and independently reconstructed at a remote monitor according to a task-specific objective. Although both processes originate from a common underlying phenomenon (e.g., distinct features of the same source), each monitor is interested only in its corresponding feature. A reconstruction error is incurred when the true and reconstructed states mismatch at one or both monitors. To address this problem, we propose an error-aware joint sampling and transmission policy, under which each sampler probabilistically generates samples only when the current process state differs from the most recently reconstructed state at its corresponding monitor. We adopt the time-averaged reconstruction error as the primary performance metric and benchmark the proposed policy against state-of-the-art joint sampling and transmission schemes. For each policy, we derive closed-form expressions for the resulting time-averaged reconstruction error. We further formulate and solve an optimization problem that minimizes the time-averaged reconstruction error subject to an average sampling cost constraint. Analytical and numerical results demonstrate that the proposed error-aware policy achieves the minimum time-averaged reconstruction error among the considered schemes while efficiently utilizing the sampling budget. The performance gains are particularly pronounced in regimes with strong inter-process correlation and stringent tracking requirements, where frequent sampling by both samplers is necessary.</description>

      <title>A Quantitative Entropy Power Inequality for Dependent Random Vectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The entropy power inequality for independent random vectors is a foundational result of information theory, with deep connections to probability and geometric functional analysis. Several extensions of the entropy power inequality have been developed for settings with dependence, including by Takano, Johnson, and Rioul. We extend these works by developing a quantitative version of the entropy power inequality for dependent random vectors. A notable consequence is that an entropy power inequality stated using conditional entropies holds for random vectors whose joint density is log-supermodular.</description>

      <title>On Cost-Aware Sequential Hypothesis Testing with Random Costs and Action Cancellation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a variant of cost-aware sequential hypothesis testing in which a single active Decision Maker (DM) selects actions with positive, random costs to identify the true hypothesis under an average error constraint, while minimizing the expected total cost. The DM may abort an in-progress action, yielding no sample, by truncating its realized cost at a smaller, tunable deterministic limit, which we term a per-action deadline. We analyze how this cancellation option can be exploited under two cost-revelation models: ex-post, where the cost is revealed only after the sample is obtained, and ex-ante, where the cost accrues before sample acquisition.
  In the ex-post model, per-action deadlines do not affect the expected total cost, and the cost-error tradeoffs coincide with the baseline obtained by replacing deterministic costs with cost means. In the ex-ante model, we show how per-action deadlines inflate the expected number of times actions are applied, and that the resulting expected total cost can be reduced to the constant-cost setting by introducing an effective per-action cost. We characterize when deadlines are beneficial and study several families in detail.</description>

      <title>Low-Latency and Low-Complexity MLSE for Short-Reach Optical Interconnects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To meet the high-speed, low-latency, and low-complexity demand for optical interconnects, simplified layered 2-step maximum likelihood sequence estimation (L2S-MLSE) is proposed in this paper. Simplified L2S-MLSE combines computational simplification and reduced state in L2S-MLSE. L2S-MLSE with a parallel sliding block architecture reduces latency from linear order to logarithmic order. Computational simplification reduces the number of multipliers from exponential order to linear order. Incorporating the reduced state with computational simplification further decreases the number of adders and comparators. The simplified L2S-MLSE is evaluated in a 112-Gbit/s PAM4 transmission over 2-km standard single-mode fiber. Experimental results show that the simplified L2S-MLSE significantly outperforms the FFE-only case in bit error ratio (BER) performance. Compared with simplified 1-step MLSE, the latency of simplified L2S-MLSE is reduced from 34 delay units in linear order to 7 delay units in logarithmic order. The simplified scheme in L2S-MLSE reduces the number of variable multipliers from 512 in exponential order to 33 in linear order without BER performance deterioration, while reducing the number of adders and comparators to 37.2% and 8.4%, respectively, with nearly identical BER performance.</description>

      <title>On the construction of Cauchy MDS matrices over Galois rings via nilpotent elements and Frobenius maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $s,m$ be the positive integers and $p$ be any prime number. Next, let $GR(p^s,p^{sm})$ be a Galois ring of characteristic $p^s$ and cardinality $p^{sm}$. In the present paper, we explore the construction of Cauchy MDS matrices over Galois rings. Moreover, we introduce a new approach that considers nilpotent elements and Teichm\"uller set of Galois ring $GR(p^s,p^{sm})$ to reduce the number of entries in these matrices. Furthermore, we construct $p^{(s-1)m}(p^m-1)$ distinct functions with the help of Frobenius automorphisms. These functions preserve MDS property of matrices. Finally, we prove some results using automorphisms and isomorphisms of the Galois rings that can be used to generate new Cauchy MDS matrices.</description>

      <title>Orthogonal Approximate Message Passing with Optimal Spectral Initializations for Rectangular Spiked Matrix Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an orthogonal approximate message passing (OAMP) algorithm for signal estimation in the rectangular spiked matrix model with general rotationally invariant (RI) noise. We establish a rigorous state evolution that precisely characterizes the algorithm's high-dimensional dynamics and enables the construction of iteration-wise optimal denoisers. Within this framework, we accommodate spectral initializations under minimal assumptions on the empirical noise spectrum. In the rectangular setting, where a single rank-one component typically generates multiple informative outliers, we further propose a procedure for combining these outliers under mild non-Gaussian signal assumptions. For general RI noise models, the predicted performance of the proposed optimal OAMP algorithm agrees with replica-symmetric predictions for the associated Bayes-optimal estimator, and we conjecture that it is statistically optimal within a broad class of iterative estimation methods.</description>

      <title>Enhancing PLS of Indoor IRS-VLC Systems for Colluding and Non-Colluding Eavesdroppers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-aided indoor visible light communication (VLC) studies ignore the time delays introduced by reflected paths, even though these delays are inherent in practical wideband systems. In this work, we adopt a realistic assumption of IRS-induced time delay for physical layer security (PLS) enhancement. We consider an indoor VLC system where an IRS is used to shape the channel so that the reflected signals add constructively at the legitimate user and create intersymbol interference at eavesdroppers located inside the coverage area. The resulting secrecy capacity maximisation over the IRS element allocation is formulated as a complex combinatorial optimisation problem and is solved using deep reinforcement learning with proximal policy optimisation (PPO). The approach is evaluated for both colluding eavesdroppers, which combine their received signals, and non-colluding eavesdroppers, which act independently. Simulation results are shown for various simulation setups, which demonstrate significant secrecy capacity gains. In a worst-case scenario, where the eavesdroppers have stronger channels than the legitimate user, the proposed PPO-based IRS allocation improves secrecy capacity by 107\% and 235\% in the colluding and non-colluding cases, respectively, compared with allocating all IRS elements to the legitimate user. These results demonstrate that time-delay-based IRS control can provide a strong secrecy advantage in practical indoor VLC scenarios.</description>

Abstract: We examine unsourced random access in a fully asynchronous setup, where active users transmit their data without restriction on the start time over a fading channel. In the proposed scheme, the transmitted signal consists of a pilot sequence and a polar codeword, with the polar codeword distributed across the data part of the packet in an on-off pattern. The receiver uses a double sliding-window decoder, where the inner window employs iterative decoding with joint timing and pilot detection, channel estimation, single-user decoding, and successive interference cancellation to recover the message bits, while the outer window enhances interference cancellation. The numerical results indicate that the proposed scheme exhibits only a slight performance loss compared to the synchronous benchmark while being more applicable in practice.</description>

      <title>Efficient Beamforming Optimization for STAR-RIS-Assisted Communications: A Gradient-Based Meta Learning Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.17928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS) has emerged as a promising technology to realize full-space coverage and boost spectral efficiency in next-generation wireless networks. Yet, the joint design of the base station precoding matrix as well as the STAR-RIS transmission and reflection coefficient matrices leads to a high-dimensional, strongly nonconvex, and NP-hard optimization problem. Conventional alternating optimization (AO) schemes typically involve repeated large-scale matrix inversion operations, resulting in high computational complexity and poor scalability, while existing deep learning approaches often rely on expensive pre-training and large network models. In this paper, we develop a gradient-based meta learning (GML) framework that directly feeds optimization gradients into lightweight neural networks, thereby removing the need for pre-training and enabling fast adaptation. Specifically, we design dedicated GML-based schemes for both independent-phase and coupled-phase STAR-RIS models, effectively handling their respective amplitude and phase constraints while achieving weighted sum-rate performance very close to that of AO-based benchmarks. Extensive simulations demonstrate that, for both phase models, the proposed methods substantially reduce computational overhead, with complexity growing nearly linearly when the number of BS antennas and STAR-RIS elements grows, and yielding up to 10 times runtime speedup over AO, which confirms the scalability and practicality of the proposed GML method for large-scale STAR-RIS-assisted communications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.18168v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This is the monograph on the theory and applications of copula entropy (CE). This book first introduces the theory of CE, including its background, definition, theorems, properties, and estimation methods. The theoretical applications of CE to structure learning, association discovery, variable selection, causal discovery, system identification, time lag estimation, domain adaptation, multivariate normality test, copula hypothesis test, two-sample test, change point detection, and symmetry test are reviewed. The relationships between the theoretical applications and their connections to correlation and causality are discussed. The framework based on CE for measuring statistical independence and conditional independence is compared to the other similar ones. The advantages of CE based methodologies over the other comparable ones are evaluated with simulations. The mathematical generalizations of CE are reviewed. The real applications of CE to every branch of science and engineering are briefly introduced.</description>

      <title>RIS-Enabled Smart Wireless Environments: Fundamentals and Distributed Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18788v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This chapter overviews the concept of Smart Wireless Environments (SWEs) motivated by the emerging technology of Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs). The operating principles and state-of-the-art hardware architectures of programmable metasurfaces are first introduced. Subsequently, key performance objectives and use cases of RIS-enabled SWEs, including spectral and energy efficiency, physical-layer security, integrated sensing and communications, as well as the emerging paradigm of over-the-air computing, are discussed. Focusing on the recent trend of Beyond-Diagonal (BD) RISs, two distributed designs of respective SWEs are presented. The first deals with a multi-user Multiple-Input Single-Output (MISO) system operating within the area of influence of a SWE comprising multiple BD-RISs. A hybrid distributed and fusion machine learning framework based on multi-branch attention-based convolutional Neural Networks (NNs), NN parameter sharing, and neuroevolutionary training is presented, which enables online mapping of channel realizations to the BD-RIS configurations as well as the multi-user transmit precoder. Performance evaluation results showcase that the distributedly optimized RIS-enabled SWE achieves near-optimal sum-rate performance with low online computational complexity. The second design focuses on the wideband interference MISO broadcast channel, where each base station exclusively controls one BD-RIS to serve its assigned group of users. A cooperative optimization framework that jointly designs the base station transmit precoders as well as the tunable capacitances and switch matrices of all metasurfaces is presented. Numerical results demonstrating the superior sum-rate performance of the designed RIS-enabled SWE for multi-cell MISO networks over benchmark schemes, considering non-cooperative configuration and conventional diagonal metasurfaces, are presented.</description>

      <title>The stability of log-supermodularity under convolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19003v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the behavior of log-supermodular functions under convolution. In particular we show that log-concave product densities preserve log-supermodularity, confirming in the special case of the standard Gaussian density, a conjecture of Zartash and Robeva. Additionally, this stability gives a ``conditional'' entropy power inequality for log-supermodular random variables. We also compare the Ahlswede-Daykin four function theorem and a recent four function version of the Prekopa-Leindler inequality due to Cordero-Erausquin and Maurey and giving transport proofs for the two theorems. In the Prekopa-Leindler case, the proof gives a generalization that seems to be new, which interpolates the classical three and the recent four function versions.</description>

      <title>Efficient Personalization of Generative Models via Optimal Experimental Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Preference learning from human feedback has the ability to align generative models with the needs of end-users. Human feedback is costly and time-consuming to obtain, which creates demand for data-efficient query selection methods. This work presents a novel approach that leverages optimal experimental design to ask humans the most informative preference queries, from which we can elucidate the latent reward function modeling user preferences efficiently. We formulate the problem of preference query selection as the one that maximizes the information about the underlying latent preference model. We show that this problem has a convex optimization formulation, and introduce a statistically and computationally efficient algorithm ED-PBRL that is supported by theoretical guarantees and can efficiently construct structured queries such as images or text. We empirically present the proposed framework by personalizing a text-to-image generative model to user-specific styles, showing that it requires less preference queries compared to random query selection.</description>

Abstract: A linear code over $\mathbb{F}_q$ with the Hamming metric is called $\Delta$-divisible if the weights of all codewords are divisible by $\Delta$. They have been introduced by Harold Ward a few decades ago. Applications include subspace codes, partial spreads, vector space partitions, and distance optimal codes. The determination of the possible lengths of projective divisible codes is an interesting and comprehensive challenge.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.09049v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct multiperiodic processes -- a simple example of stationary ergodic (but not mixing) processes over natural numbers that enjoy the vanishing entropy rate under a mild condition. Multiperiodic processes are supported on randomly shifted deterministic sequences called multiperiodic sequences, which can be efficiently generated using an algorithm called the Infinite Clock. Under a suitable parameterization, multiperiodic sequences exhibit relative frequencies of particular numbers given by Zipf's law. Exactly in the same setting, the respective multiperiodic processes satisfy an asymptotic power-law growth of block entropy, called Hilberg's law. Hilberg's law is deemed to hold for statistical language models, in particular.</description>

      <title>Network Oblivious Transfer via Noisy Channels: Limits and Capacities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17021v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the information-theoretic limits of oblivious transfer via noisy channels. We also investigate oblivious transfer over a noisy multiple-access channel with two non-colluding senders and a single receiver. The channel is modeled through correlations among the parties, who may be honest-but-curious or, in the case of the receiver, potentially malicious. We first revisit the information-theoretic limits of two-party oblivious transfer and then extend these results to the multiple-access setting. For honest-but-curious participants, we introduce a multiparty protocol that reduces a general multiple access channel to a suitable correlation model. In scenarios with a malicious receiver, we characterize an achievable oblivious transfer rate region.</description>

      <title>Practical Channel Estimation for Pinching-Antenna Systems: Serial vs. Parallel and Downlink vs. Uplink?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02403v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The practical channel estimation for pinching-antenna networks is investigated, in which an electromagnetic-compliant in-waveguide transmission model is exhibited, incorporating bidirectional power splitting, cumulative power leakage, and waveguide attenuation. Based on this model, the paper investigates two antenna activation protocols for channel estimation: a serial protocol based on one-by-one antenna activation and a parallel protocol utilizing a binary S-Matrix activation. The serial protocol is characterized by its superior numerical stability but a lack of array gain, whereas the parallel protocol theoretically offers array gain but suffers from severe performance degradation due to structural crosstalk from the non-orthogonal S-Matrix and ill-conditioning from cumulative leakage. Furthermore, the paper analyzes the fundamental commonalities and asymmetries between uplink and downlink channel estimation in pinching-antenna systems. Numerical results demonstrate that 1) in an ideal lossless model, the parallel protocol is superior to the serial protocol due to the array gain from simultaneous energy collection in uplink transmission; 2) in a practical model with physical losses, the serial protocol outperforms the parallel protocol, as the performance of the parallel protocol is degraded by the numerical instability from cumulative leakage, which outweighs the benefit of array gain; 3) For downlink channel estimation, the serial protocol is more suitable because its strategy of concentrating the entire power budget on one measurement, while the parallel protocol is more suitable for the uplink as it can make full use of array gain.</description>

      <title>SCA-LLM: Spectral-Attentive LLM-Based Wireless World Modeling for Agentic Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08139v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Future AI-native wireless networks are moving from reactive optimization to agentic decision-making that can sense, predict, and plan under fast-varying channels. This calls for wireless world models that can predict and roll out channel dynamics, for which multi-step channel state information (CSI) prediction offers a practical short-horizon look-ahead. Recent advances in foundation sequence models further motivate large language models (LLMs) as general-purpose dynamics learners when suitably adapted to non-text time-series signals. However, bridging CSI to LLMs is non-trivial because an effective adapter must expose informative spectral and temporal evolution patterns, while prior designs provide limited inductive bias to capture such channel structures. To this end, we propose SCA-LLM, a spectral-attentive LLM-based wireless world modeling framework that bridges CSI to LLMs via a spectral-channel attention (SCA) adapter. Specifically, the SCA adapter performs multi-spectral representation learning to extract informative channel features and align CSI with the LLM's sequence modeling capability, enabling parameter-efficient adaptation while keeping the LLM backbone largely frozen. Extensive simulations show that SCA-LLM achieves state-of-the-art prediction performance and strong zero-shot generalization, yielding up to -2.4 dB normalized mean squared error (NMSE) advantage over the previous LLM based method. Our ablation studies further confirm the effectiveness of the proposed SCA adapter in mitigating domain mismatch.</description>

      <title>ORBGRAND Is Exactly Capacity-achieving via Rank Companding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.00347v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Among guessing random additive noise decoding (GRAND) algorithms, ordered reliability bits GRAND (ORBGRAND) has attracted considerable attention due to its efficient use of soft information and suitability for hardware implementation. It has also been shown that ORBGRAND achieves a rate very close to the capacity of an additive white Gaussian noise channel under antipodal signaling. In this work, it is further established that, for general binary-input memoryless channels under symmetric input distribution, via suitably companding the ranks in ORBGRAND according to the inverse cumulative distribution function (CDF) of channel reliability, the resulting CDF-ORBGRAND algorithm exactly achieves the mutual information, i.e., the symmetric capacity. This result is then applied to bit-interleaved coded modulation (BICM) systems to handle high-order input constellations. Via considering the effects of mismatched decoding due to both BICM and ORBGRAND, it is shown that CDF-ORBGRAND is capable of achieving the BICM capacity, which was initially derived in the literature by treating BICM as a set of independent parallel channels.</description>

      <title>Sphere Decoding Revisited</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.11195v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, the paradigm of sphere decoding (SD) for solving the integer least square problem (ILS) is revisited, where extra degrees of freedom are introduced to exploit the decoding potential. Firstly, the equivalent sphere decoding (ESD) is proposed, which is essentially the same with the classic Fincke-Pohst sphere decoding but characterizes the sphere radius $D&gt;0$ with two new parameters named as initial searching size $K&gt;1$ and deviation factor $\sigma&gt;0$. By fixing $\sigma$ properly, we show that given the sphere radius $D\triangleq\sigma\sqrt{2\ln K}$, the complexity of ESD in terms of the number of visited nodes is upper bounded by $|S|&lt;nK$, thus resulting in an explicit and tractable decoding trade-off solely controlled by $K$. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that the complexity of sphere decoding is exactly specified, where considerable decoding potential can be explored from it. After that, two enhancement mechanisms named as normalized weighting and candidate protection are proposed to further upgrade the ESD algorithm. On one hand, given the same setups of $K$ and $\sigma$, a larger sphere radius is achieved, indicating a better decoding trade-off. On the other hand, the proposed ESD algorithm is generalized, which bridges suboptimal and optimal decoding performance through the flexible choice of $K$. Finally, further performance optimization and complexity reduction with respect to ESD are also derived, and the introduced tractable and flexible decoding trade-off is verified through large-scale MIMO detection.</description>

      <title>From Zipf's Law to Neural Scaling through Heaps' Law and Hilberg's Hypothesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13491v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We inspect the deductive connection between the neural scaling law and Zipf's law -- two statements discussed in machine learning and quantitative linguistics. The neural scaling law describes how the cross entropy rate of a foundation model -- such as a large language model -- changes with respect to the amount of training tokens, parameters, and compute. By contrast, Zipf's law posits that the distribution of tokens exhibits a power law tail. Whereas similar claims have been made in more specific settings, we show that the neural scaling law is a consequence of Zipf's law under certain broad assumptions that we reveal systematically. The derivation steps are as follows: We derive Heaps' law on the vocabulary growth from Zipf's law, Hilberg's hypothesis on the entropy scaling from Heaps' law, and the neural scaling from Hilberg's hypothesis. We illustrate these inference steps by a toy example of the Santa Fe process that satisfies all the four statistical laws.</description>

      <title>Generalized free energy and excess/housekeeping decomposition in nonequilibrium systems: from large deviations to thermodynamic speed limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08432v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In genuine nonequilibrium systems that undergo continuous driving, the thermodynamic forces are nonconservative, meaning they cannot be described by any free energy potential. Nonetheless, we show that the dynamics of such systems are governed by a "generalized free energy" that is derived from a large-deviations variational principle. This variational principle also yields a decomposition of fluxes, forces, and dissipation (entropy production) into a conservative "excess" part and a nonconservative "housekeeping" part. Our decomposition is universally applicable to stochastic master equations, deterministic chemical reaction networks, and open systems. We also show that the excess entropy production obeys a thermodynamic speed limit (TSL), a fundamental thermodynamic constraint on the rate of state evolution and/or external fluxes. We demonstrate our approach on several examples, including real-world metabolic networks, where we derive fundamental dissipation bounds and uncover "futile" metabolic cycles. Our generalized free energy and decomposition are empirically accessible to thermodynamic inference in both stochastic and deterministic systems. We discuss important connections to several theoretical frameworks, including information geometry and Onsager theory, as well as previous excess/housekeeping decompositions.</description>

      <title>Informativity Conditions for Multiple Signals: Properties, Experimental Design, and Applications (extended version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10030v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent studies highlight the importance of persistently exciting condition in single signal sequence for model identification and data-driven control methodologies. However, maintaining prolonged excitation in control signals introduces significant challenges, as continuous excitation can reduce the lifetime of mechanical devices. In this paper, we introduce three informativity conditions for various types of multi-signal data, each augmented by weight factors. We explore the interrelations between these conditions and their rank properties in linear time-invariant systems. Furthermore, we introduce open-loop experimental design methods tailored to each of the three conditions, which can synthesize the required excitation conditions either offline or online, even in the presence of limited information within each signal segment. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these informativity conditions in least-squares identification. Additionally, all three conditions can extend Willems' fundamental lemma and are utilized to assess the properties of the system. Illustrative examples confirm that these conditions yield satisfactory outcomes in both least-squares identification and the construction of data-driven controllers.</description>

      <title>Error bounds for composite quantum hypothesis testing and a new characterization of the weighted Kubo-Ando geometric means</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13379v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The optimal error exponents of binary composite i.i.d. state discrimination are trivially bounded by the worst-case pairwise exponents of discriminating individual elements of the sets representing the two hypotheses, and in the finite-dimensional classical case, these bounds in fact give exact single-copy expressions for the error exponents. In contrast, in the non-commutative case, the optimal exponents are only known to be expressible in terms of regularized divergences, resulting in formulas that, while conceptually relevant, are practically not very useful. In this paper, we develop further an approach initiated in [Mosonyi, Szil\'agyi, Weiner, IEEE Trans. Inf. Th. 68(2):1032--1067, 2022] to give improved single-copy bounds on the error exponents by comparing not only individual states from the two hypotheses, but also various unnormalized positive semi-definite operators associated to them. Here, we show a number of equivalent characterizations of such operators giving valid bounds, and show that in the commutative case, considering weighted geometric means of the states, and in the case of two states per hypothesis, considering weighted Kubo-Ando geometric means, are optimal for this approach. As a result, we give a new characterization of the weighted Kubo-Ando geometric means as the only $2$-variable operator geometric means that are block additive, tensor multiplicative, and satisfy the arithmetic-geometric mean inequality. We also extend our results to composite quantum channel discrimination, and show an analogous optimality property of the weighted Kubo-Ando geometric means of two quantum channels, a notion that seems to be new. We extend this concept to defining the notion of superoperator perspective function and establish some of its basic properties, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>A Tutorial on Beyond-Diagonal Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces: Modeling, Architectures, System Design and Optimization, and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16504v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Written by its inventors, this first tutorial on Beyond-Diagonal Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (BD-RISs) provides the readers with the basics and fundamental tools necessary to appreciate, understand, and contribute to this emerging and disruptive technology. Conventional (Diagonal) RISs (D-RISs) are characterized by a diagonal scattering matrix $\mathbf{\Theta}$ such that the wave manipulation flexibility of D-RIS is extremely limited. In contrast, BD-RIS refers to a novel and general framework for RIS where its scattering matrix is not limited to be diagonal (hence, the ``beyond-diagonal'' terminology) and consequently, all entries of $\mathbf{\Theta}$ can potentially help shaping waves for much higher manipulation flexibility. This physically means that BD-RIS can artificially engineer and reconfigure coupling across elements of the surface thanks to inter-element reconfigurable components which allow waves absorbed by one element to flow through other elements. Consequently, BD-RIS opens the door to more general and versatile intelligent surfaces that subsumes existing RIS architectures as special cases. In this tutorial, we share all the secret sauce to model, design, and optimize BD-RIS and make BD-RIS transformative in many different applications. Topics discussed include physics-consistent and multi-port network-aided modeling; transmitting, reflecting, hybrid, and multi-sector mode analysis; reciprocal and non-reciprocal architecture designs and optimal performance-complexity Pareto frontier of BD-RIS; signal processing, optimization, and channel estimation for BD-RIS; hardware impairments (discrete-value impedance and admittance, lossy interconnections and components, wideband effects, mutual coupling) of BD-RIS; benefits and applications of BD-RIS in communications, sensing, power transfer.</description>

      <title>Wi-Fi: Twenty-Five Years and Counting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09613v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Today, Wi-Fi is over 25 years old. Yet, despite sharing the same branding name, today's Wi-Fi boasts entirely new capabilities that were not even on the roadmap 25 years ago. This article aims to provide a holistic and comprehensive technical and historical tutorial on Wi-Fi, beginning with IEEE 802.11b (Wi-Fi 1) and looking forward to IEEE 802.11bn (Wi-Fi 8). This is the first tutorial article to span these eight generations. Rather than a generation-by-generation exposition, we describe the key mechanisms that have advanced Wi-Fi. We begin by discussing spectrum allocation and coexistence, and detailing the IEEE 802.11 standardization cycle. Second, we provide an overview of the physical layer and describe key elements that have enabled data rates to increase by over 1,000x. Third, we describe how Wi-Fi Medium Access Control has been enhanced from the original Distributed Coordination Function to now include capabilities spanning from frame aggregation to wideband spectrum access. Fourth, we describe how Wi-Fi 5 first broke the one-user-at-a-time paradigm and introduced multi-user access. Fifth, given the increasing use of mobile, battery-powered devices, we describe Wi-Fi's energy-saving mechanisms over the generations. Sixth, we discuss how Wi-Fi was enhanced to seamlessly aggregate spectrum across 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, and 6 GHz bands to improve throughput, reliability, and latency. Finally, we describe how Wi-Fi enables nearby Access Points to coordinate in order to improve performance and efficiency. In the Appendix, we further discuss Wi-Fi developments beyond 802.11bn, including integrated mmWave operations, sensing, security and privacy extensions, and the adoption of AI/ML.</description>

      <title>Network-Optimised Spiking Neural Network (NOS) Scheduling for 6G O-RAN: Spectral Margin and Delay-Tail Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11291v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work presents a Network-Optimised Spiking (NOS) delay-aware scheduler for 6G radio access. The scheme couples a bounded two-state kernel to a clique-feasible proportional-fair (PF) grant head: the excitability state acts as a finite-buffer proxy, the recovery state suppresses repeated grants, and neighbour pressure is injected along the interference graph via delayed spikes. A small-signal analysis yields a delay-dependent threshold $k_\star(\Delta)$ and a spectral margin $\delta = k_\star(\Delta) - gH\rho(W)$ that compress topology, controller gain, and delay into a single design parameter. Under light assumptions on arrivals, we prove geometric ergodicity for $\delta&gt;0$ and derive sub-Gaussian backlog and delay tail bounds with exponents proportional to $\delta$. A numerical study, aligned with the analysis and a DU compute budget, compares NOS with PF and delayed backpressure (BP) across interference topologies over a $5$--$20$\,ms delay sweep. With a single gain fixed at the worst spectral radius, NOS sustains higher utilisation and a smaller 99.9th-percentile delay while remaining clique-feasible on integer PRBs.</description>

      <title>A Single-Loop First-Order Algorithm for Linearly Constrained Bilevel Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24710v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study bilevel optimization problems where the lower-level problems are strongly convex and have coupled linear constraints. To overcome the potential non-smoothness of the hyper-objective and the computational challenges associated with the Hessian matrix, we utilize penalty and augmented Lagrangian methods to reformulate the original problem as a single-level one. Especially, we establish a strong theoretical connection between the reformulated function and the original hyper-objective by characterizing the closeness of their values and derivatives. Based on this reformulation, we propose a single-loop, first-order algorithm for linearly constrained bilevel optimization (SFLCB). We provide rigorous analyses of its non-asymptotic convergence rates, showing an improvement over prior double-loop algorithms -- form $O(\epsilon^{-3}\log(\epsilon^{-1}))$ to $O(\epsilon^{-3})$. The experiments corroborate our theoretical findings and demonstrate the practical efficiency of the proposed SFLCB algorithm.

      <title>Practical hybrid decoding scheme for parity-encoded spin systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26189v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a practical hybrid decoding scheme for the parity-encoding architecture. This architecture was first introduced by N. Sourlas as a computational technique for tackling hard optimization problems, especially those modeled by spin systems such as the Ising model and spin glasses, and reinvented by W. Lechner, P. Hauke, and P. Zoller to develop quantum annealing devices. We study the specific model, called the SLHZ model, aiming to achieve a near-term quantum annealing device implemented solely through geometrically local spin interactions. Taking account of the close connection between the SLHZ model and a classical low-density-parity-check code, two approaches can be chosen for the decoding: (1) finding the ground state of a spin Hamiltonian derived from the SLHZ model, which can be achieved via stochastic decoders such as a quantum annealer or a classical Monte Carlo sampler; (2) using deterministic decoding techniques for the classical LDPC code, such as belief propagation and bit-flip decoder. The proposed hybrid approach combines the two approaches by applying bit-flip decoding to the readout of the stochastic decoder based on the SLHZ model. We present simulations demonstrating that this approach can reveal the latent potential of the SLHZ model, realizing soft-annealing concept proposed by Sourlas.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Diffusion Model Guidance through Calibration and Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05844v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Classifier-guided diffusion models have emerged as a powerful approach for conditional image generation, but they suffer from overconfident predictions during early denoising steps, causing the guidance gradient to vanish. This paper introduces two complementary contributions to address this issue. First, we propose a differentiable calibration objective based on the Smooth Expected Calibration Error (Smooth ECE), which improves classifier calibration with minimal fine-tuning and yields measurable improvements in Frechet Inception Distance (FID). Second, we develop enhanced sampling guidance methods that operate on off-the-shelf classifiers without requiring retraining. These include tilted sampling with batch-level reweighting, adaptive entropy-regularized sampling to preserve diversity, and a novel f-divergence-based sampling strategy that strengthens class-consistent guidance while maintaining mode coverage. Experiments on ImageNet 128x128 demonstrate that our divergence-regularized guidance achieves an FID of 2.13 using a ResNet-101 classifier, improving upon existing classifier-guided diffusion methods while requiring no diffusion model retraining. The results show that principled calibration and divergence-aware sampling provide practical and effective improvements for classifier-guided diffusion.</description>

      <title>Chirp Delay-Doppler Domain Modulation Based Joint Communication and Radar for Autonomous Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14432v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a sensing-centric joint communication and millimeter-wave radar paradigm to facilitate collaboration among intelligent vehicles.
  We first propose a chirp waveform-based delay-Doppler quadrature amplitude modulation (DD-QAM) that modulates data across delay, Doppler, and amplitude dimensions.
  Building upon this modulation scheme, we derive its achievable rate to quantify the communication performance.
  We then introduce an extended Kalman filter-based scheme for four-dimensional (4D) parameter estimation in dynamic environments, enabling the active vehicles to accurately estimate orientation and tangential-velocity beyond traditional 4D radar systems.
  Furthermore, in terms of communication, we propose a dual-compensation-based demodulation and tracking scheme that allows the passive vehicles to effectively demodulate data without compromising their sensing functions.
  Simulation results underscore the feasibility and superior performance of our proposed methods, marking a significant advancement in the field of autonomous vehicles.

      <title>Large Model Enabled Embodied Intelligence for 6G Integrated Perception, Communication, and Computation Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15109v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The advent of sixth-generation (6G) places intelligence at the core of wireless architecture, fusing perception, communication, and computation into a single closed-loop. This paper argues that large artificial intelligence models (LAMs) can endow base stations with perception, reasoning, and acting capabilities, thus transforming them into intelligent base station agents (IBSAs). We first review the historical evolution of BSs from single-functional analog infrastructure to distributed, software-defined, and finally LAM-empowered IBSA, highlighting the accompanying changes in architecture, hardware platforms, and deployment. We then present an IBSA architecture that couples a perception-cognition-execution pipeline with cloud-edge-end collaboration and parameter-efficient adaptation. Subsequently,we study two representative scenarios: (i) cooperative vehicle-road perception for autonomous driving, and (ii) ubiquitous base station support for low-altitude uncrewed aerial vehicle safety monitoring and response against unauthorized drones. On this basis, we analyze key enabling technologies spanning LAM design and training, efficient edge-cloud inference, multi-modal perception and actuation, as well as trustworthy security and governance. We further propose a holistic evaluation framework and benchmark considerations that jointly cover communication performance, perception accuracy, decision-making reliability, safety, and energy efficiency. Finally, we distill open challenges on benchmarks, continual adaptation, trustworthy decision-making, and standardization. Together, this work positions LAM-enabled IBSAs as a practical path toward integrated perception, communication, and computation native, safety-critical 6G systems.</description>

      <title>Solomonoff-Inspired Hypothesis Ranking with LLMs for Prediction Under Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17145v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reasoning under uncertainty is a key challenge in AI, especially for real-world tasks, where problems with sparse data demands systematic generalisation. Existing approaches struggle to balance accuracy and simplicity when evaluating multiple candidate solutions. We propose a Solomonoff-inspired method that weights LLM-generated hypotheses by simplicity and predictive fit. Applied to benchmark (Mini-ARC) tasks, our method produces Solomonoff-weighted mixtures for per-cell predictions, yielding conservative, uncertainty-aware outputs even when hypotheses are noisy or partially incorrect. Compared to Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA), Solomonoff scoring spreads probability more evenly across competing hypotheses, while BMA concentrates weight on the most likely but potentially flawed candidates. Across tasks, this highlights the value of algorithmic information-theoretic priors for interpretable, reliable multi-hypothesis reasoning under uncertainty.</description>
