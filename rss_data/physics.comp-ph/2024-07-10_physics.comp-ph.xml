      <title>Beyond theory driven discovery: hot random search and datum derived structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data driven methods have transformed the prospects of the computational chemical sciences, with machine learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs) speeding up calculations by several orders of magnitude. I reflect on theory driven, as opposed to data driven, discovery based on ab initio random structure searching (AIRSS), and then introduce two methods which exploit machine learning acceleration. I show how long high throughput anneals, between direct structural relaxation, enabled by ephemeral data derived potentials (EDDPs), can be incorporated into AIRSS to bias the sampling of challenging systems towards low energy configurations. Hot AIRSS (hot-AIRSS) preserves the parallel advantage of random search, while allowing much more complex systems to be tackled. This is demonstrated through searches for complex boron structures in large unit cells. I then show how low energy carbon structures can be directly generated from a single, experimentally determined, diamond structure. An extension to the generation of random sensible structures, candidates are stochastically generated and then optimised to minimise the difference between the EDDP environment vector and that of the reference diamond structure. The distance-based cost function is captured in an actively learned EDDP. Graphite, small nanotubes and caged, fullerene-like, structures emerge from searches using this potential, along with a rich variety of tetrahedral framework structures. Using the same approach, the pyrope, Mg$_3$Al$_2$(SiO$_4$)$_3$, garnet structure is recovered from a low energy AIRSS structure generated in a smaller unit cell with a different chemical composition. The relationship of this approach to modern diffusion model based generative methods is discussed.</description>

      <title>Structure Preserving Restarts of the Non-Symmetric Lanczos Algorithm via the Implicitly shifted LR algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The implicitly shifted QR iteration is used as a restart procedure for the Arnoldi method for the calculation of a few dominant eigenvalues of a large matrix. We show that the underlying idea of implicit polynomial filtering can be utilized in much the same manner via the implicitly shifted LR iteration to create a restart procedure for the non-symmetric Lanczos algorithm for eigenvalue computations, which preserves the tri-diagonal structure of the reduced matrix.</description>

      <title>Multiscale simulation of rarefied gas dynamics via direct intermittent GSIS-DSMC coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The general synthetic iterative scheme (GSIS) has proven its efficacy in modeling rarefied gas dynamics, where the steady-state solutions are obtained after dozens of iterations of the Boltzmann equation, with minimal numerical dissipation even using large spatial cells. In this paper, the fast convergence and asymptotic-preserving properties of the GSIS are harnessed to remove the limitations of the direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method. The GSIS, which leverages high-order constitutive relations derived from DSMC, is applied intermittently, which not only rapidly steers the DSMC towards steady state, but also eliminates the requirement that the cell size must be smaller than the molecular mean free path. Several numerical tests have been conducted to validate the accuracy and efficiency of this hybrid GSIS-DSMC approach.</description>

      <title>Tractable A Priori Dimensionality Reduction for Quantum Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06340v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this short letter, I present a powerful application in dimensionality reduction of the lesser-used Jacobi-Davidson algorithm for the generalized eigenvalue decomposition. When combined with matrix-free implementations of relevant operators, this technique allows for the computation of the dynamics of an arbitrary quantum state to be done in $\mathcal{O}(n)$ time, where $n$ is the size of the original Hilbert space.</description>

      <title>On the fractal dimension of non-Newtonian Hele-Shaw flow subject to Saffman-Taylor instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06476v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a discrete numerical method based on the diffusion-limited aggregation (DLA) approach to simulate two-fluid Hele-Shaw flow subject to the Saffman-Taylor interfacial instability, in the case where the displaced fluid is non-Newtonian. Focusing on fluids for which the most relevant non-Newtonian aspect of the thin-gap flow is shear-thinning, we introduce a history-dependent aspect into the algorithm, modeling shear-rate-dependent fluid viscosity. The main finding is that the morphology of the emerging patterns, characterized by the fractal dimension, is modified in a nontrivial manner by the shear-thinning nature of the displaced fluid. In particular, we consistently find that shear-thinning leads to the formation of patterns characterized by a smaller fractal dimension, compared to the corresponding Newtonian fluid.</description>

      <title>Reducing the Sign Problem with simple Contour Deformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06896v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We apply constant imaginary offsets to the path integral for a reduction of the sign problem in the Hubbard model. These simple transformations enhance the quality of results from HMC calcu- lations without compromising the speed of the algorithm. This method enables us to efficiently calculate systems that are otherwise inaccessible due to a severe sign problem. To support this claim, we present observables of the C20 and C60 fullerenes. Furthermore, we demonstrate that at a certain offset, the sign problem is completely lifted in the limit of large chemical potential.</description>

      <title>An asynchronous discontinuous Galerkin method for massively parallel PDE solvers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03399v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method is widely being used to solve hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs) due to its ability to provide high-order accurate solutions in complex geometries, capture discontinuities, and exhibit high arithmetic intensity. However, the scalability of DG-based solvers is impeded by communication bottlenecks arising from the data movement and synchronization requirements at extreme scales. To address these challenges, recent studies have focused on the development of asynchronous computing approaches for PDE solvers. Herein, we introduce the asynchronous DG (ADG) method, which combines the benefits of the DG method with asynchronous computing to overcome communication bottlenecks. The ADG method relaxes the need for data communication and synchronization at a mathematical level, allowing processing elements to operate independently regardless of the communication status, thus potentially improving the scalability of solvers. The proposed ADG method ensures flux conservation and effectively addresses challenges arising from asynchrony. To assess its stability, Fourier-mode analysis is employed to examine the dissipation and dispersion behavior of fully-discrete equations that use the DG and ADG schemes along with the Runge-Kutta (RK) time integration scheme. Furthermore, an error analysis within a statistical framework is presented, which demonstrates that the ADG method with standard numerical fluxes achieves at most first-order accuracy. To recover accuracy, we introduce asynchrony-tolerant (AT) fluxes that utilize data from multiple time levels. Extensive numerical experiments were conducted to validate the performance of the ADG-AT scheme for both linear and nonlinear problems.</description>

      <title>Cauliflower shapes of bacterial clusters in the off-lattice Eden model for bacterial growth in a Petri dish</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.20011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.20011v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We developed the off-lattice Eden model to simulate the growth of bacterial colonies in the three-dimensional geometry of a Petri dish. In contrast to its two-dimensional counterpart, our model takes a three-dimensional set of possible growth directions and employs additional constraints on growth, which are limited by access to the nutrient layer. We rigorously tested the basic off-lattice Eden implementation against literature data for a planar cluster. We then extended it to three-dimensional growth. Our model successfully demonstrated the non-trivial dependency of the cluster morphology, non-monotonous dependency of the cluster density, and power law of the thickness of the boundary layer of clusters as a function of the nutrient layer height. Moreover, we revealed the fractal nature of all the clusters by investigating their fractal dimensions. Our density results allowed us to estimate the basic transport properties, namely the permeability and tortuosity of the bacterial colonies.</description>

      <title>Parametric Matrix Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.11694v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a general class of machine learning algorithms called parametric matrix models. In contrast with most existing machine learning models that imitate the biology of neurons, parametric matrix models use matrix equations that emulate the physics of quantum systems. Similar to how physics problems are usually solved, parametric matrix models learn the governing equations that lead to the desired outputs. Parametric matrix models can be efficiently trained from empirical data, and the equations may use algebraic, differential, or integral relations. While originally designed for scientific computing, we prove that parametric matrix models are universal function approximators that can be applied to general machine learning problems. After introducing the underlying theory, we apply parametric matrix models to a series of different challenges that show their performance for a wide range of problems. For all the challenges tested here, parametric matrix models produce accurate results within an efficient and interpretable computational framework that allows for input feature extrapolation.</description>

      <title>Tensor factorization in ab initio many-body calculations: Triaxially-deformed (B) MBPT calculations in large bases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08532v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Whether for fundamental studies or nuclear data evaluations, first-principle calculations of atomic nuclei constitute the path forward. Today, performing \textit{ab initio} calculations (a) of heavy nuclei, (b) of doubly open-shell nuclei or (c) with a sub-percent accuracy is at the forefront of nuclear structure theory. While combining any two of these features constitutes a major challenge, addressing the three at the same time is currently impossible. From a numerical standpoint, these challenges relate to the necessity to handle (i) very large single bases and (ii) mode-6, \textit{i.e.} three-body, tensors (iii) that must be stored repeatedly. Performing second-order many-body perturbation theory(ies) calculations based on triaxially deformed and superfluid reference states of doubly open-shell nuclei up to mass $A=72$, the present work achieves a significant step forward by addressing challenge (i). To do so, the memory and computational cost associated with the handling of large tensors is scaled down via the use of tensor factorization techniques. The presently used factorization format is based on a randomized singular value decomposition that does not require the computation and storage of the very large initial tensor. The procedure delivers an inexpensive and controllable approximation to the original problem, as presently illustrated for calculations that could not be performed without tensor factorization. With the presently developed technology at hand, one can envision to perform calculations of yet heavier doubly open-shell nuclei at sub-percent accuracy in a foreseeable future.</description>
