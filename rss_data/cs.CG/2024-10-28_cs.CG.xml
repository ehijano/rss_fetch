      <title>On a Geometric Interpretation Of the Subset Sum Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For $S \in \mathbb{N}^n$ and $T \in \mathbb{N}$, the Subset Sum Problem (SSP) $\exists^? x \in \{0,1\}^n $ such that $S^T\cdot x = T$ can be interpreted as the problem of deciding whether the intersection of the positive unit hypercube $Q_n = [0,1]^n$ with the hyperplane $S^T\cdot \left(x - \frac{S}{\|S\|^2 }\cdot T \right) = 0$ contains at least a vertex. In this paper, we give an algorithm of complexity $\mathcal{O}\left( \frac{1}{\epsilon}\cdot n^b \right)$, for some absolute constant $b$, which either proves that there are no vertices in a slab of thickness $\epsilon$ either finds a vertex in the slab of thickness $4\cdot \epsilon$. It is shown that any vertex $P$ in a slab of thickness $\epsilon$ meets $\left| \frac{S^T\cdot P}{T} - 1 \right| \leq \epsilon$, therefore making the proposed algorithm a FPTAS for the SSP.</description>

      <title>Embedded Graph Reconstruction under Hausdorff Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Filamentary structures (topologically embedded graphs with a metric structure) are ubiquitous in science and engineering. A challenging problem in topological data analysis (TDA) is to reconstruct the topology and geometry of such an underlying (usually unknown) metric graph from possibly noisy data sampled around it. Reeb graphs have recently been successfully employed in abstract metric graph reconstruction under Gromov$\unicode{x2013}$Hausdorff noise: the sample is assumed to be metrically close to the ground truth. However, such a strong global density assumption is hardly achieved in applications, making the existing Reeb graph-based methods untractible. We relax the density assumption to give provable geometric reconstruction schemes, even when the sample is metrically close only locally. A very different yet more relevant paradigm focuses on the reconstruction of metric graphs$\unicode{x2014}$embedded in the Euclidean space$\unicode{x2014}$from Euclidean samples that are only Hausdorff-close. We further extend our methodologies to provide novel, provable guarantees for the successful geometric reconstruction of Euclidean graphs under the Hausdorff noise model. Our technique produces promising results in reconstructing earthquake plate tectonic boundaries from the global earthquake catalog.</description>

      <title>Navigable Graphs for High-Dimensional Nearest Neighbor Search: Constructions and Limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18680v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There has been significant recent interest in graph-based nearest neighbor search methods, many of which are centered on the construction of navigable graphs over high-dimensional point sets. A graph is navigable if we can successfully move from any starting node to any target node using a greedy routing strategy where we always move to the neighbor that is closest to the destination according to a given distance function. The complete graph is navigable for any point set, but the important question for applications is if sparser graphs can be constructed. While this question is fairly well understood in low-dimensions, we establish some of the first upper and lower bounds for high-dimensional point sets. First, we give a simple and efficient way to construct a navigable graph with average degree $O(\sqrt{n \log n })$ for any set of $n$ points, in any dimension, for any distance function. We compliment this result with a nearly matching lower bound: even under the Euclidean metric in $O(\log n)$ dimensions, a random point set has no navigable graph with average degree $O(n^{\alpha})$ for any $\alpha &lt; 1/2$. Our lower bound relies on sharp anti-concentration bounds for binomial random variables, which we use to show that the near-neighborhoods of a set of random points do not overlap significantly, forcing any navigable graph to have many edges.</description>

      <title>T\v{r}iVis: Versatile, Reliable, and High-Performance Tool for Computing Visibility in Polygonal Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08752v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Visibility is a fundamental concept in computational geometry, with numerous applications in surveillance, robotics, and games. This software paper presents T\v{r}iVis, a C++ library developed by the authors for computing numerous visibility-related queries in highly complex polygonal environments. Adapting the triangular expansion algorithm, T\v{r}iVis stands out as a versatile, high-performance, more reliable and easy-to-use alternative to current solutions that is also free of heavy dependencies. Through evaluation on a challenging dataset, T\v{r}iVis has been benchmarked against existing visibility libraries. The results demonstrate that T\v{r}iVis outperforms the competing solutions by at least an order of magnitude in query times, while exhibiting more reliable runtime behavior. T\v{r}iVis is freely available for private, research, and institutional use at https://github.com/janmikulacz/trivis.</description>
