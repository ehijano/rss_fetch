      <title>Evaluating the diversity of scientific discourse on twenty-one multilingual Wikipedias using citation analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Wikipedia is a major source of information, particularly for medical and health content, citing over 4 million scholarly publications. However, the representation of research-based knowledge across different languages on Wikipedia has been under explored. This study analyses the largest database of Wikipedia citations collected to date, examining the uniqueness of content and research representation across languages. METHOD: The study included nearly 3.5 million unique research articles and their Wikipedia mentions from 21 languages. These were categorized into three groups: Group A (publications uniquely cited by a single non-English Wikipedia), Group B (co-cited by English and non-English Wikipedias), and Group C (co-cited by multiple non-English Wikipedias). Descriptive and comparative statistics were conducted by Wikipedia language, group, and discipline. RESULTS: Significant differences were found between twenty non-English languages and English Wikipedia (p&lt;0.001). While English Wikipedia is the largest, non-English Wikipedias cite an additional 1.5 million publications. CONCLUSION: English Wikipedia should not be seen as a comprehensive body of information. Non-English Wikipedias cover unique subjects and disciplines, offering a more complete representation of research collectively. The uniqueness of voice in non-English Wikipedias correlates with their size, though other factors may also influence these differences.</description>

      <title>Navigating Gender Disparities in Communication Research Leadership: Academic Recognition, Career Development, and Compensation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08401v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study examines gender disparities in communication research through citation metrics, authorship patterns, team composition, and faculty salaries. Using data from 62,359 papers across 121 communication journals, we find that while female authors are increasingly represented, citation gaps persist, with sole-authored papers by women receiving fewer citations than those by men, especially in smaller teams. Team composition analysis reveals a tendency toward gender homophily, with single-gender teams being more common. In top U.S. communication journals, female authors face underrepresentation and citation disparities favoring male authors. Salary analysis from leading U.S. public universities shows that female faculty earn lower salaries at the Assistant Professor level, though disparities lessen at higher ranks. These findings highlight the need for greater efforts to promote gender equity through inclusive collaboration, equitable citation practices, and fair compensation.</description>
