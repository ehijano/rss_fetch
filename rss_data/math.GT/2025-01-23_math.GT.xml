      <title>The Borel Conjecture for manifolds with boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We undertake a systematic investigation of compact aspherical manifolds with boundary; motivated by the plethora of examples in the bounded case and by the beauty of the theory in the closed case. Our main theorems give a homological criterion for when a closed manifold, together with maps from the fundamental groups of its components to a fixed group, can be realized as the boundary of a compact aspherical manifold. This is done in two steps: we first produce a Poincar\'e pair and then apply surgery theory to obtain a manifold. We illustrate this in the case of abelian fundamental group. The results of this paper will be applied in a sequel where we classify compact aspherical 4-manifolds with elementary amenable fundamental group.</description>

      <title>Aspherical 4-manifolds with elementary amenable fundamental group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We classify the possible elementary amenable fundamental groups of compact aspherical 4-manifolds with boundary and conclude that they are either polycyclic or solvable Baumslag- Solitar. Since these groups are good and satisfy the Farrell-Jones Conjecture, one concludes that such manifolds satisfy topological rigidity: a homotopy equivalence which is a homeomorphism on the boundary is homotopic, relative to the boundary, to a homeomorphism. We classify the closed 3-manifolds which arise as the boundary of an compact aspherical 4-manifold with elementary amenable fundamental group, generalizing results of Freedman and Quinn in the cases of trivial and infinite cyclic fundamental groups. Moreover, two such 4-manifolds are homeomorphic if and only if their "enhanced" peripheral group systems are equivalent, and each such manifold is the boundary connected sum of a compact aspherical 4-manifold with prime boundary and a contractible 4-manifold.</description>

      <title>Double Disk Bundle Decompositions and Curvature Exclusions in Closed Four-Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate closed smooth four-manifolds with a double disk bundle decomposition. We show that such manifolds cannot support a hyperbolic metric, a result which contrasts with the situation in dimension three. Additionally, under a further condition, we prove that these manifolds cannot admit a negatively curved metric. As an application, we derive that the existence of isoparametric functions and a hyperbolic metric on a closed four-manifold are mutually exclusive in a topological sense. This work provides new perspectives on the relationship between topology and geometry in four-manifolds.</description>

      <title>Exotic families of embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a number of topologically trivial but smoothly non-trivial families of embeddings of 3-manifolds in 4-manifolds. These include embeddings of homology spheres in $S^4$ that are not isotopic but have diffeomorphic complements, and families (parameterized by high-dimensional spheres) of embeddings of any 3-manifold that embeds in a blown-up K3 surface. In each case, the families are constructed so as to be topologically trivial in an appropriate sense. We also illustrate a general technique for converting a non-trivial family of embeddings into a non-trivial family of submanifolds.</description>

      <title>Link in $\mathbb{R}\mathbb{P}^3$ and the Topological Vertex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide the first computations of colored unknots and Hopf link in $\mathbb{R}\mathbb{P}^3$ using both the topological vertex and its refinement. Our approach utilizes the toric Calabi-Yau threefold arising from the geometric transition of the cotangent bundle of $\mathbb{R}\mathbb{P}^3$ under the large $N$ duality. We find that the link invariants are series in the Kahler parameters of the toric Calabi-Yau manifold and the $q$-expansions of the rational functions of the series have positivity property. We conjecture that they are Poincare series of an infinite dimensional link homology theory for links in $\mathbb{R}\mathbb{P}^3$. We compare our results with that of the $S^3$ and speculate the consequences of the series nature of the invariants.</description>

      <title>Mutations and (Non-)Euclideaness in oriented matroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We call an oriented matroid Mandel if it has an extension in general position which makes all programs with that extension Euclidean. If $L$ is the minimum number of mutations adjacent to an element of the groundset, we call an oriented matroid Las Vergnas if $L &gt; 0$. If $\frak{O}_{\mathcal{property}}$ is the class of oriented matroids having a certain property, it holds $\frak{O} \supset \frak{O}_{\mathcal{Las Vergnas}} \supset \frak{O}_{\mathcal{Mandel}} \supset \frak{O}_{\mathcal{Euclidean}} \supset \frak{O}_{\mathcal{realizable}}.$ All these inclusions are proper, we give explicit proofs/examples for the parts of this chain that were not known.
  For realizable hyperplane arrangements of rank $r$ we have $L = r$ which was proved by Shannon. Under the assumption that a (modified) intersection property holds we give an analogon to Shannons proof and show that uniform rank $4$ Euclidean oriented matroids with that property have $L = 4$. Using the fact that the lexicographic extension creates and destroys certain mutations, we show that for Euclidean oriented matroids holds $L \ge 3$.
  We give a survey of preservation of Euclideaness and prove that Euclideaness remains after a certain type of mutation-flips. This yields that a path in the mutation graph from a Euclidean oriented matroid to a totally non-Euclidean oriented matroid (which has no Euclidean oriented matroid programs) must have at least three mutation-flips. Finally, a minimal non-Euclidean or rank $4$ uniform oriented matroid is Mandel if it is connected to a Euclidean oriented matroid via one mutation-flip, hence we get many examples for Non-Euclidean but Mandel oriented matroids and have $L \le 3$ for those of rank $4$.</description>

      <title>The $CFK^\infty$ Type of Almost L-space Knots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.07249v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Heegaard Floer homology and knot Floer homology are powerful invariants of 3-manifolds and links respectively. L-space knots are knots which admit Dehn surgeries to 3-manifolds with Heegaard Floer homology of minimal rank. In this paper we study almost L-space knots, which are knots admitting large Dehn surgeries to 3-manifolds with Heegaard Floer homology of next-to-minimal rank. Our main result is a classification of the $CFK^\infty$ type of almost L-space knots. As corollaries we show that almost L-space knots satisfy various topological properties, including some given by Baldwin-Sivek. We also give some new cable link detection results.</description>

      <title>Deformational symmetries of smooth functions on non-orientable surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.00577v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a compact surface $M$, consider the natural right action of the group of diffeomorphisms $\mathcal{D}(M)$ of $M$ on $\mathcal{C}^{\infty}(M,\mathbb{R})$ defined by the rule: $(f,h)\mapsto f\circ h$ for $f\in \mathcal{C}^{\infty}(M,\mathbb{R})$ and $h\in\mathcal{D}(M)$. Denote by $\mathcal{F}(M)$ the subset of $\mathcal{C}^{\infty}(M,\mathbb{R})$ consisting of function $f:M\to\mathbb{R}$ taking constant values on connected components of $\partial{M}$, having no critical points on $\partial{M}$, and such that at each of its critical points $z$ the function $f$ is $\mathcal{C}^{\infty}$ equivalent to some homogenenous polynomial without multiple factors. In particular, $\mathcal{F}(M)$ contains all Morse maps. Let also $\mathcal{O}(f) = \{ f\circ h \mid h\in\mathcal{D}(M) \}$ be the orbit of $f$. Previously it was computed the algebraic structure of $\pi_1\mathcal{O}(f)$ for all $f\in\mathcal{F}(M)$, where $M$ is any orientable compact surface distinct from $2$-sphere.
  In the present paper we compute the group $\pi_0\mathcal{S}(f,\partial\mathbb{M})$, where $\mathbb{M}$ is a M\"obius band, and $\mathcal{S}(f,\partial\mathbb{M}) = \{ h\in\mathcal{D}(\mathbb{M}) \mid f\circ h = f, \ h|_{\partial \mathbb{M}} = \mathrm{id}_{\mathbb{M}}\}$ is the subgroup of the corresponding stabilizer of $f$ consisting of diffeomorphisms fixed on the boundary $\partial \mathbb{M}$. As a consequence we obtain an explicit algebraic description of $\pi_1\mathcal{O}(f)$ for all non-orientable surfaces distinct from Klein bottle and projective plane.</description>

      <title>Quadratic-time computations for pseudo-Anosov mapping classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07596v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a quadratic-time algorithm to compute the stretch factor and the invariant measured foliations for a pseudo-Anosov element of the mapping class group. As input, the algorithm accepts a word (in any given finite generating set for the mapping class group) representing a pseudo-Anosov mapping class, and the length of the word is our measure of complexity for the input. The output is a train track and an integer matrix where the stretch factor is the largest real eigenvalue and the unstable foliation is given by the corresponding eigenvector. This is the first algorithm to compute stretch factors and measured foliations that is known to terminate in sub-exponential time.</description>

      <title>The Gilmer-Masbaum map is not injective on the Kauffman bracket skein module</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23153v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gilmer and Masbaum use Witten-Reshetikhin-Turaev (WRT) invariants to define a map from the Kauffman bracket skein module to a set of complex-valued functions defined on roots of unity in order to provide a lower bound for its dimension. We compute the image of the evaluation map for a family of mapping tori of the 2-torus and find that the restriction of the map to certain homology classes is not injective. This provides an answer to a question posed by Gilmer and Masbaum in the latter paper. Moreover, we give a basis for the Kauffman bracket skein module in the case of the mapping torus of a power of the Dehn twist along the meridian of the 2-torus.</description>

      <title>Profinite rigidity witnessed by Dehn fillings of cusped hyperbolic 3-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05229v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Any profinite isomorphism between two cusped finite-volume hyperbolic 3-manifolds carries profinite isomorphisms between their Dehn fillings. With this observation, we prove that some cusped finite-volume hyperbolic 3-manifolds are profinitely rigid among all compact, orientable 3-manifolds, through detecting their exceptional Dehn fillings. In addition, we improved a criteria for profinite rigidity of a hyperbolic knot complement or a hyperbolic-type satellite knot complement among compact, orientable 3-manifolds, through examining its characterising slopes. We obtain the following profinitely rigid examples: the complement of the Whitehead link, Whitehead sister link, $\frac{3}{10}$ two-bridge link; specific surgeries on one component of these links; the complement of (full) twist knots $\mathcal{K}_n$, Eudave-Mu\~noz knots $K(3,1,n,0)$, Pretzel knots $P(-3,3,2n+1)$, $5_2$ knot; the Berge manifold, and many more.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14417v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a method of constructing a kernel of Lie algebra weight system. A main tool we use in the analysis is Vogel's $\Lambda$ algebra and the surrounding framework. As an example of a developed technique we explicitly provide all Jacobi diagrams lying in the kernel of $\mathfrak{sl}_N$ weight system at low orders. We also discuss consequences of the presence of the kernel in Lie algebra weight systems for detection of correlators in the 3D Chern-Simons topological field theory and for distinguishing of knots by the corresponding quantum knot invariants.</description>
