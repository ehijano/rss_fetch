      <title>Luttinger liquid tensor network: sine versus tangent dispersion of massless Dirac fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To apply the powerful many-body techniques of tensor networks to massless Dirac fermions one wants to discretize the $p\cdot\sigma$ Hamiltonian and construct a matrix-product-operator (MPO) representation. We compare two alternative discretization schemes, one with a sine dispersion, the other with a tangent dispersion, applied to a one-dimensional Luttinger liquid with Hubbard interaction. Both types of lattice fermions allow for an exact MPO representation of low bond dimension, so they are efficiently computable, but only the tangent dispersion gives a power law decay of the propagator in agreement with the continuum limit: The sine dispersion is gapped by the interactions, evidenced by an exponentially decaying propagator. Our construction of a tensor network with an unpaired Dirac cone works around the fermion-doubling obstruction by exploiting the fact that the \textit{nonlocal} Hamiltonian of tangent fermions permits a \textit{local} generalized eigenproblem.</description>

      <title>Probing a quantum spin liquid with equilibrium and non-equilibrium hole dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The properties and experimental identification of quantum spin liquids (QSL) remains an important topic with many fundamental questions. Here, we explore the dynamics of a single charge dopant (hole) in a $t$-$J_{1}$-$J_{2}$ model on a square lattice, which realises a gapless $\mathbb{Z}_2$ QSL at half-filling. Using a field theory approach based on the parton construction, which includes an infinite number of scatterings between the low-energy quasiparticle excitations of the QSL via a self-consistent Born approximation, we calculate both the equilibrium and non-equilibrium properties of the hole for weak and strong interactions. Quasiparticle branches as well as string-like excitations of the hole are identified, and we furthermore explore the time-dependent spreading of a hole throughout the QSL after it has been injected at a given lattice site. The final ballistic expension speed is shown to exhibit a non-monotonic behavior as a quantum phase transition between an antiferromagnetic (AFM) and the QSL phase is crossed, which is caused by a qualitative change in the fundamental kinematics of the interactions between the hole and the surrounding spins. Our results demonstrate how charge dopants can be used as a quantum probe for QSLs and are directly relevant to optical lattice experiments with single site resolution, as well as the rapidly increasingly number of new quanum materials such as transition metal dichacogenides.</description>

      <title>Reducing the Sign Problem with simple Contour Deformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply constant imaginary offsets to the path integral for a reduction of the sign problem in the Hubbard model. These simple transformations enhance the quality of results from HMC calcu- lations without compromising the speed of the algorithm. This method enables us to efficiently calculate systems that are otherwise inaccessible due to a severe sign problem. To support this claim, we present observables of the C20 and C60 fullerenes. Furthermore, we demonstrate that at a certain offset, the sign problem is completely lifted in the limit of large chemical potential.</description>

      <title>Treatment of the strongly correlated topological superconductors through the $su(2|1)$ path-integral technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that topological superconductivity can be produced by strong electron-electron (e-e) interaction in two minimal one (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) models containing only nearest neighbor hopping and suitable superconducting order parameters. The presence of the strong e-e interaction constrains each atomic site to be either empty or singly occupied. One can treat this scenario by fractionalizing the electrons into spin and charge degrees of freedom. We use the coherent state symbols associated with the lowest irreducible representation of the $su(2|1)$ superalgebra spanned by the Hubbard operators to solve the proposed models, as they implicitly take into account both the single particle occupation constraint and the fractionalization of the electrons. Our two example display the emergence of topological superconductivity in an 1D nanowire with extended $s$-wave superconductivity, and in a 2D square lattice with $p$-wave superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Quantum dynamics of frustrated Josephson junction arrays embedded in a transmission line: an effective XX spin chain with long-range interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study theoretically a variety of collective quantum phases occurring in frustrated saw-tooth chains of Josephson junctions embedded in a dissipationless transmission line. The basic element of a system, i.e., the triangular superconducting cell, contains two $0$- and one $\pi$- Josephson junctions characterized by $E_J$ and $\alpha E_J$ Josephson energies, accordingly. In the frustrated regime the low energy quantum dynamics of a single cell is determined by anticlockwise or clockwise flowing persistent currents (vortex/antivortex). The direct embedding of $\pi$-Josephson junctions in a transmission line allows to establish a short/long-range interaction between (anti)vortices of well separated cells. By making use of the variational approach, we map the superconducting circuit Hamiltonian to an effective $XX$ spin model with an exchange spin-spin interaction decaying with the distance $x$ as $x^{-\beta}$, and the local $\hat \sigma_{x,n}$-terms corresponding to the coherent quantum beats between vortex and antivortex in a single cell. We obtain that in long arrays as $N \gg \ell_0 \simeq \sqrt{C/C_0}$, where $C$ and $C_0$ are capacitances of $0$-Josephson junction and transmission line, accordingly, the amplitude of quantum beats is strongly suppressed. By means of exact numerical diagonalization, we study the interplay between the coherent quantum beats and the exchange spin-spin interaction leading to the appearance of various collective quantum phases such as the paramagnetic ($P$), compressible superfluid ($CS$) and weakly compressible superfluid ($w$-$CS$) states.</description>

      <title>Superluminal Propagation of Composite Collective Modes in Superconductor-Ferromagnet Heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05457v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superconductor/ferromagnet/superconductor Josephson junctions are paradigmatic systems for studying the delicate interplay of superconductivity and magnetism via proximity effects as well as their composite excitations. Here, we analyse the collective modes (CM) in such a heterostructure by taking into account the interplay between the de-magnetisation field $H_{dem}$ and the field caused by the anisotropy of the ferromagnet $H_{an}$, which was previously neglected. It turns out that the spectrum of composite collective modes, $\omega(k)$, has a qualitatively different form in the case of $H_{dem}&lt;H_{an}$ and of $H_{dem}&gt;H_{an}$. In the first case, the dependence $\omega(k)$ has the same form as in previous studies, whereas in the second case, the spectrum looks completely different. In particular, for moderate or weak anisotropy in ferromagnet the group velocity of collective modes demonstrates inflection point where the group velocity become infinite and is superluminal. Furthermore, this point separates purely real and complex-conjugate solutions for the collective modes and is also {\it exception point}. We show that the difference of the CMs spectra can be revealed by Fiske experiment, i.\,e.\,by measuring the $I-V$ characteristics in the presence of magnetic field and voltage.</description>

      <title>Many-body Liouvillian dynamics with a non-Hermitian tensor-network kernel polynomial algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the dynamics of open quantum many-body systems is a major problem in quantum matter. Specifically, efficiently solving the spectrum of the Liouvillian superoperator governing such dynamics remains a critical open challenge. Here, we put forward a method for solving the many-body Liouvillian spectrum and dynamics based on the non-Hermitian kernel polynomial method and tensor-network techniques. We demonstrate the faithfulness of our method by computing the dynamics of the dephasing quantum compass model with a gradient magnetic field and comparing it with exact results. In particular, we show that our method allows us to characterize the quantum Zeno crossover and the reduction of relaxation rate due to Stark localization in this model. We further demonstrate the ability of our method to go beyond exact results by exploring nearest-neighbor interaction effects on the Liouvillian dynamics, elucidating the interplay between Stark localization and many-body interactions. Our method provides an efficient solution to many-body Liouvillian spectrum and dynamics, establishing a methodology to explore large open quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Dirac cones and magic angles in the Bistritzer--MacDonald TBG Hamiltonian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate the generic existence of Dirac cones in the full Bistritzer--MacDonald Hamiltonian for twisted bilayer graphene. Its complementary set, when Dirac cones are absent, is the set of magic angles. We show the stability of magic angles obtained in the chiral limit by demonstrating that the perfectly flat bands transform into quadratic band crossings when perturbing away from the chiral limit. Moreover, using the invariance of Euler number, we show that at magic angles there are more band crossings beyond these quadratic band crossings. This is the first result showing the existence of magic angles for the full Bistritzer--MacDonald Hamiltonian and solves Open Problem No.2 proposed in the recent survey arXiv:2310.20642.</description>

      <title>Finite size analysis for interacting bosons at the 2D-1D Dimensional Crossover</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06634v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we extend the analysis of interacting bosons at 2D-1D dimensional crossover for finite size and temperature by using field-theory approach (bosonization) and quantum Monte Carlo simulations. Stemming from the fact that finite size low-dimensional systems are allowed only to have quasi-ordered phase, we consider the self-consistent harmonic approximation to compute the fraction of quasi-condensate and its scaling with the system size. It allows us to understand the important role played by finite size and temperature across the dimensional crossover for deciding the condensate nature. Furthermore, we consider a mean-field approximation to compute the finite size effect on the crossover temperature for both weak and strong interaction. All the physical quantities we discuss here provide essential information for quantum gas at dimensional crossover and are directly detectable in cold atom experiments</description>

      <title>The quantum metric of electrons with spin-momentum locking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum materials are characterized by electromagnetic responses intrinsically linked to the geometry and topology of the electronic wavefunctions. These properties are encoded in the quantum metric and Berry curvature. While Berry curvature-mediated transport effects such as the anomalous and nonlinear Hall effects have been identified in several magnetic and nonmagnetic systems, quantum metric-induced transport phenomena remain limited to topological antiferromagnets. Here we show that spin-momentum locking -- a general characteristic of the electronic states at surfaces and interfaces of spin-orbit coupled materials -- leads to a nontrivial quantum metric. This metric activates a nonlinear in-plane magnetoresistance that we measure and electrically control in 111-oriented LaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ interfaces. These findings demonstrate the existence of quantum metric effects in a vast class of materials and provide new strategies to design functionalities based on the quantum geometry.</description>

      <title>Quasiperiodicity protects quantized transport in disordered systems without gaps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07049v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The robustness of topological properties, such as adiabatic quantized currents, generally depends on the existence of gaps surrounding the relevant energy levels or symmetry-forbidden transitions. We uncover a new mechanism for topological protection via the observation of quantized currents which survive the addition of bounded local disorder large enough to close the relevant instantaneous energy gaps in a driven Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper chain, a prototypical model of quasiperiodic systems. Using a local picture in configuration-space based on Landau-Zener transitions, we show that in this case the topological protection does not depend on the spectral gaps, but rather on the number of states in an occupied band and the position of the band in configuration space. Moreover, we propose a protocol, realizable in cold atoms or photonic experiments, which leverages this stability to prepare topological many-body states with high Chern number and open new experimental avenues for the study of both the integer and fractional quantum Hall effects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.14381v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study two related universal anomalies of the spectral function of cuprates, so called waterfall and high-energy kink features, by a combined cellular dynamical mean-field theory and angle-resolved photoemission study for the oxychloride Na$_x$Ca$_{2-x}$CuO$_2$Cl$_2$ (Na-CCOC). Tracing their origin back to an interplay of spin-polaron and local correlation effects both in undoped and hole-doped (Na-)CCOC, we establish them as a universal crossover between regions differing in the momentum dependence of the coupling and not necessarily in the related quasiparticles' energies. The proposed scenario extends to doping levels coinciding with the cuprate's superconducting dome and motivates further investigations of the fate of spin-polarons in the superconducting phase.</description>

      <title>Signatures of electronic ordering in transport in graphene flat bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18817v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, a wide family of electronic orders was unveiled in graphene flat bands, such as spin- and valley-polarized phases as well as nematic momentum-polarized phases, stabilized by exchange interactions via a generalized Stoner mechanism. Momentum polarization involves orbital degrees of freedom and is therefore expected to impact resistivity in a way that is uniquely sensitive to the ordering type. Under pocket polarization, carrier distribution shifts in $k$ space and samples the band mass in regions defined by the displaced momentum distribution. This makes transport coefficients sensitive to pocket polarization, resulting in the Ohmic resistivity decreasing with temperature. In addition, it leads to current switching and hysteresis under strong $E$ field. Being robust in the presence of electron-phonon scattering, this behavior can serve as a telltale sign of pocket polarization order. The fast timescale and low dissipation of the switching cycle may be advantageous for highly applicable memory-dependent resistors, i.e., memristors.</description>

      <title>Quantized polarization in a generalized Rice-Mele model at arbitrary filling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09262v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss the charge polarization in a generalized Rice-Mele model at arbitrary particle filling per site as a model of charge ordered systems in one dimension. The model possesses neither the conventional bond-centered inversion symmetry nor the one site translation symmetry alone, but has combinations of these symmetries. We show that the charge polarization in the ground state is quantized by the combined symmetry and is characterized solely by the filling. Especially, the polarization can be $1/2$ (mod 1) in the zero filling limit. Under the open boundary condition, there exist excess charges accumulated near edges of the system irrespective of existence or absence of edge modes. Correspondingly, we decompose the polarization into a bulk contribution and an edge contribution, and numerically demonstrate that the polarization is dominated by the former (latter) when the energy gap is large (small). We also discuss a simple generalization of our model and examine absence/existence of a gapless edge mode protected by the inversion symmetry by introducing intra unit cell and inter unit cell contributions of the charge polarization.</description>

Abstract: From the quasisymmetry-group perspective [Phys. Rev. Lett. 126, 120604 (2021)], we show the universal existence of collective, coherent modes of excitations in many-body scar models in the degenerate limit, where the energy spacing in the scar tower vanishes. The number of these modes, as well as the quantum numbers carried by them, are given, not by the symmetry of the Hamiltonian, but by the quasisymmetry of the scar tower: hence the name quasi-Nambu-Goldstone modes. Based on this, we draw a concrete analogy between the paradigm of spontaneous symmetry breaking and the many-body scar physics in the degenerate limit.</description>

      <title>Emergence and evolution of electronic modes with temperature in spin-gapped Mott and Kondo insulators</title>

Abstract: Electronic modes emerge within the band gap at nonzero temperature in strongly correlated insulators such as Mott and Kondo insulators, exhibiting momentum-shifted magnetic dispersion relations from the band edges. As the temperature increases, the emergent modes gain considerable spectral weights and form robust bands that differ from the zero-temperature bands. Here, the origin of the emergent modes, their relation to doping-induced modes, and how their spectral weights increase with temperature are clarified in the ladder and bilayer Hubbard models and one- and two-dimensional Kondo lattice models using effective theory for weak inter-unit-cell hopping and numerical calculations. The results indicate that the temperature-driven change in the band structure reflecting spin excitation, including the change in the number of bands, can be observed in various strongly correlated insulators even with a spin gap, provided that the temperature increases up to about spin-excitation energies. The controlled analyses developed in this study significantly contribute to the fundamental understanding of the band structure of strongly correlated insulators at nonzero temperature.</description>

      <title>Exact Fisher zeros and thermofield dynamics across a quantum critical point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18981v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By setting the inverse temperature $\beta$ loose to occupy the complex plane, Michael E. Fisher showed that the zeros of the complex partition function $Z$, if approaching the real $\beta$ axis, reveal a thermodynamic phase transition. More recently, Fisher zeros have been used to mark the dynamical phase transition in quench dynamics. The success of Fisher zeros however seems limited, and it is unclear how they can be employed to shed light on quantum phase transitions or the non-unitary dynamics of open quantum systems. Here we answer this question by a comprehensive analysis of the (analytically continued) one-dimensional transverse field Ising model. We exhaust all the Fisher zeros to show that in the thermodynamic limit they congregate into a remarkably simple pattern in the form of continuous open or closed lines. These Fisher lines evolve smoothly as the coupling constant is tuned, and a qualitative change identifies the quantum critical point. By exploiting the connection between $Z$ and the thermofield double states, we obtain analytical expressions for the short- and long-time dynamics of the survival amplitude and the scaling of recurrence time at the quantum critical point. We further point out $Z$ can be realized and probed in monitored quantum circuits. The analytical results are corroborated by numerical tensor renormalization group which elevates the approach outlined here to a powerful tool for interacting quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity in pressurized trilayer La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10-{\delta}}$ single crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07353v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The pursuit of discovering new high-temperature superconductors that diverge from the copper-based paradigm1-3 carries profound implications for elucidating mechanisms behind superconductivity and may also enable new applications4-8. Here, our investigation reveals that application of pressure effectively suppresses the spin and charge order in trilayer nickelate La4Ni3O10-{\delta} single crystals, leading to the emergence of superconductivity with a maximum critical temperature (Tc) of around 30 K at 69.0 GPa. The DC susceptibility measurements confirm a substantial diamagnetic response below Tc, indicating the presence of bulk superconductivity with a volume fraction exceeding 80%. In the normal state, we observe a "strange metal" behavior, characterized by a linear temperature-dependent resistance extending up to 300 K. Furthermore, the layer-dependent superconductivity observed hints at a unique interlayer coupling mechanism specific to nickelates, setting them apart from cuprates in this regard. Our findings provide crucial insights into the fundamental mechanisms underpinning superconductivity, while also introducing a new material platform to explore the intricate interplay between the spin/charge order, flat band structures, interlayer coupling, strange metal behavior and high-temperature superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Parent Berry curvature and the ideal anomalous Hall crystal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04196v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a model of electrons moving in a parent band of uniform Berry curvature. At sufficiently high parent Berry curvature, we show that strong repulsive interactions generically lead to the formation of an anomalous Hall crystal: a topological state with spontaneously broken continuous translation symmetry. Our results are established via a mapping to a problem of Wigner crystallization in a regular 2D electron gas. Interestingly, we find that a periodic electrostatic potential induces a competing state with opposite Chern number. Our theory offers a unified perspective for understanding several aspects of the recently observed integer and fractional quantum anomalous Hall effects in rhombohedral multilayer graphene and provides a recipe for engineering new topological states.</description>

      <title>Thermalization and Criticality on an Analog-Digital Quantum Simulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17385v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding how interacting particles approach thermal equilibrium is a major challenge of quantum simulators. Unlocking the full potential of such systems toward this goal requires flexible initial state preparation, precise time evolution, and extensive probes for final state characterization. We present a quantum simulator comprising 69 superconducting qubits which supports both universal quantum gates and high-fidelity analog evolution, with performance beyond the reach of classical simulation in cross-entropy benchmarking experiments. Emulating a two-dimensional (2D) XY quantum magnet, we leverage a wide range of measurement techniques to study quantum states after ramps from an antiferromagnetic initial state. We observe signatures of the classical Kosterlitz-Thouless phase transition, as well as strong deviations from Kibble-Zurek scaling predictions attributed to the interplay between quantum and classical coarsening of the correlated domains. This interpretation is corroborated by injecting variable energy density into the initial state, which enables studying the effects of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) in targeted parts of the eigenspectrum. Finally, we digitally prepare the system in pairwise-entangled dimer states and image the transport of energy and vorticity during thermalization. These results establish the efficacy of superconducting analog-digital quantum processors for preparing states across many-body spectra and unveiling their thermalization dynamics.</description>

      <title>Duality constraints on thermal spectra of 3d CFTs and 4d quasinormal modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19790v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Thermal spectra of correlation functions in holographic 3d large-N CFTs correspond to quasinormal modes of classical gravity and other fields in asymptotically anti-de Sitter black hole spacetimes. Using general properties of such spectra along with constraints imposed by the S-duality (or the particle-vortex duality), we derive a spectral duality relation that all such spectra must obey. Its form is universal in that each such relation (expressed as an infinite product over QNMs) only depends on a single function of a spatial wavevector that corresponds to the bulk algebraically special frequencies. In the process, we also derive a new sum rule constraining products over QNMs. The spectral duality relation, which imposes an infinite set of constraints on the QNMs, is then investigated and a number of well-known holographic examples that demonstrate its validity are examined. Our results also allow us to understand several new aspects of the pole-skipping phenomenon.</description>
