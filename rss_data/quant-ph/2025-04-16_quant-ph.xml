      <title>No-Go Theorems for Universal Quantum State Purification via Classically Simulable Operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum state purification, a process that aims to recover a state closer to a system's principal eigenstate from multiple copies of an unknown noisy quantum state, is crucial for restoring noisy states to a more useful form in quantum information processing. Fault-tolerant quantum computation relies on stabilizer operations, which are classically simulable protocols critical for error correction but inherently limited in computational power. In this work, we investigate the limitations of classically simulable operations for quantum state purification. We demonstrate that while certain classically simulable operations can enhance fidelity for specific noisy state ensembles, they cannot achieve universal purification. We prove that neither deterministic nor probabilistic protocols using only classically simulable operations can achieve universal purification of two-copy noisy states for qubit systems and all odd dimensions. We further extend this no-go result of state purification using three and four copies via numerical computations of semidefinite programs. Our findings highlight the indispensable role of non-stabilizer resources and the inherent limitations of classically simulable operations in quantum state purification, emphasizing the necessity of harnessing the full power of quantum operations for more robust quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Assessing the Elephant in the Room in Scheduling for Current Hybrid HPC-QC Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing resources are among the most promising candidates for extending the computational capabilities of High-Performance Computing (HPC) systems. As a result, HPC-quantum integration has become an increasingly active area of research. While much of the existing literature has focused on software stack integration and quantum circuit compilation, key challenges such as hybrid resource allocation and job scheduling-especially relevant in the current Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum era-have received less attention. In this work, we highlight these critical issues in the context of integrating quantum computers with operational HPC environments, taking into account the current maturity and heterogeneity of quantum technologies. We then propose a set of conceptual strategies aimed at addressing these challenges and paving the way for practical HPC-QC integration in the near future.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Quantum Classifier Based on Hamiltonian Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum machine learning (QML) is a discipline that seeks to transfer the advantages of quantum computing to data-driven tasks. However, many studies rely on toy datasets or heavy feature reduction, raising concerns about their scalability. Progress is further hindered by hardware limitations and the significant costs of encoding dense vector representations on quantum devices. To address these challenges, we propose an efficient approach called Hamiltonian classifier that circumvents the costs associated with data encoding by mapping inputs to a finite set of Pauli strings and computing predictions as their expectation values. In addition, we introduce two classifier variants with different scaling in terms of parameters and sample complexity. We evaluate our approach on text and image classification tasks, against well-established classical and quantum models. The Hamiltonian classifier delivers performance comparable to or better than these methods. Notably, our method achieves logarithmic complexity in both qubits and quantum gates, making it well-suited for large-scale, real-world applications. We make our implementation available on GitHub.</description>

      <title>Entanglement induced by quantum gravity in an infinite square well</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we examine the entanglement dynamics of two massive particles confined within their respective infinite square potential wells induced by gravity. Assuming that each particle is initially in the ground state of its infinite square well, we investigate the formation of entanglement between the particles as a result of their gravitational interaction during their adiabatic movement towards each other. Our results reveal that, under suitable parameters, entanglement swiftly emerges. Compared to previous schemes, our approach significantly reduces the particle mass, greatly lowering the experimental threshold.</description>

      <title>Higher-Form Anomalies Imply Intrinsic Long-Range Entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that generic gapped quantum many-body states which respect an anomalous finite higher-form symmetry have an exponentially small overlap with any short-range entangled (SRE) state. Hence, anomalies of higher-form symmetries enforce $intrinsic$ long-range entanglement, which is in contrast with anomalies of ordinary (0-form) symmetries which are compatible with symmetric SRE states (specifically, symmetric cat states). As an application, we show that the anomalies of strong higher-form symmetries provide a diagnostic for mixed-state topological order in $d \geq 2$ spatial dimensions. We also identify a new (3+1)D intrinsic mixed-state topological order that does not obey remote-detectability by local decoherence of the (3+1)D Toric Code with fermionic loop excitations. This breakdown of remote detectability, as encoded in anomalies of strong higher-form symmetries, provides a partial characterization of intrinsically mixed-state topological order.</description>

      <title>Measuring Casimir Force Across a Superconducting Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Casimir effect and superconductivity are foundational quantum phenomena whose interaction remains an open question in physics. How Casimir forces behave across a superconducting transition remains unresolved, owing to the experimental difficulty of achieving alignment, cryogenic environments, and isolating small changes from competing effects. This question carries implications for electron physics, quantum gravity, and high-temperature superconductivity. Here we demonstrate an on-chip superconducting platform that overcomes these challenges, achieving one of the most parallel Casimir configurations to date. Our microchip-based cavities achieve unprecedented area-to-separation ratio between plates, exceeding previous Casimir experiments by orders of magnitude and generating the strongest Casimir forces yet between compliant surfaces. Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) is used for the first time to directly detect the resonant motion of a suspended membrane, with subatomic precision in both lateral positioning and displacement. Such precision measurements across a superconducting transition allow for the suppression of all van der Waals, electrostatic, and thermal effects. Preliminary measurements suggest superconductivity-dependent shifts in the Casimir force, motivating further investigation and comparison with theories. By uniting extreme parallelism, nanomechanics, and STM readout, our platform opens a new experimental frontier at the intersection of Casimir physics and superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Restoring the second law to classical-quantum dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: All physical theories should obey the second law of thermodynamics. However, existing proposals to describe the dynamics of hybrid classical-quantum systems either violate the second law or lack a proof of its existence. Here we rectify this by studying classical-quantum dynamics that are (1) linear and completely-positive and (2) preserve the thermal state of the classical-quantum system. We first prove that such dynamics necessarily satisfy the second law. We then show how these dynamics may be constructed, proposing dynamics that generalise the standard Langevin and Fokker-Planck equations for classical systems in thermal environments to include back-reaction from a quantum degree of freedom. Deriving necessary and sufficient conditions for completely-positive, linear and continuous classical-quantum dynamics to satisfy detailed balance, we find this property satisfied by our dynamics. To illustrate the formalism and its applications we introduce two models. The first is an analytically solvable model of an overdamped classical system coupled to a quantum two-level system, which we use to study the total entropy production in both quantum system and classical measurement apparatus during a quantum measurement. The second describes an underdamped classical-quantum oscillator system subject to friction, which we numerically demonstrate exhibits thermalisation in the adiabatic basis, showing the relevance of our dynamics for the mixed classical-quantum simulation of molecules.</description>

      <title>Lattice Surgery Compilation Beyond the Surface Code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-scale fault-tolerant quantum computation requires compiling logical circuits into physical operations tailored to a given architecture. Prior work addressing this challenge has mostly focused on the surface code and lattice surgery schemes. In this work, we broaden the scope by considering lattice surgery compilation for topological codes beyond the surface code. We begin by defining a code substrate - a blueprint for implementing topological codes and lattice surgery. We then abstract from the microscopic details and rephrase the compilation task as a mapping and routing problem on a macroscopic routing graph, potentially subject to substrate-specific constraints. We explore specific substrates and codes, including the color code and the folded surface code, providing detailed microscopic constructions. For the color code, we present numerical simulations analyzing how design choices at the microscopic and macroscopic levels affect the depth of compiled logical $\mathrm{CNOT}+\mathrm{T}$ circuits. An open-source code is available on GitHub https://github.com/cda-tum/mqt-qecc.</description>

      <title>Quantum Image Loading: Hierarchical Learning and Block-Amplitude Encoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given the excitement for the potential of quantum computing for machine learning methods, a natural subproblem is how to load classical data into a quantum state. Leveraging insights from [GST24] where certain qubits play an outsized role in the amplitude encoding, we extend the hierarchical learning framework to encode images into quantum states. We successfully load digits from the MNIST dataset as well as road scenes from the Honda Scenes dataset. Additionally, we consider the use of block amplitude encoding, where different parts of the image are encoded in a tensor product of smaller states. The simulations and overall orchestration of workflows was done on the BlueQubit platform. Finally, we deploy our learned circuits on both IBM and Quantinuum hardware and find that these loading circuits are sufficiently shallow to fit within existing noise rates.</description>

      <title>Quantum Image Classification: Experiments on Utility-Scale Quantum Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform image classification on the Honda Scenes Dataset on Quantinuum's H-2 and IBM's Heron chips utilizing up to 72 qubits and thousands of two-qubit gates. For data loading, we extend the hierarchical learning to the task of approximate amplitude encoding and block amplitude encoding for commercially relevant images up to 2 million pixels. Hierarchical learning enables the training of variational circuits with shallow enough resources to fit within the classification pipeline. For comparison, we also study how classifier performance is affected by using piecewise angle encoding. At the end of the VQC, we employ a fully-connected layer between measured qubits and the output classes. Some deployed models are able to achieve above 90\% accuracy even on test images. In comparing with classical models, we find we are able to achieve close to state of the art accuracy with relatively few parameters. These results constitute the largest quantum experiment for image classification to date.</description>

      <title>Simulating near-infrared spectroscopy on a quantum computer for enhanced chemical detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy is a non-invasive, low-cost, reagent-less, and rapid technique to measure chemical concentrations in a wide variety of sample types. However, extracting concentration information from the NIR spectrum requires training a statistical model on a large collection of measurements, which can be impractical, expensive, or dangerous. In this work, we propose a method for simulating NIR spectra on a quantum computer, as part of a larger workflow to improve NIR-based chemical detection. The quantum algorithm is highly optimized, exhibiting a cost reduction of many orders of magnitude relative to prior approaches. The main optimizations include the localization of vibrational modes, an efficient real-space-based representation of the Hamiltonian with a quantum arithmetic-based implementation of the time-evolution, optimal Trotter step size determination, and specific targeting of the NIR region. Overall, our algorithm achieves a O(M^2) scaling, compared with the O(M^12) coming from equivalent high-accuracy classical methods. As a concrete application, we show that simulating the spectrum of azidoacetylene (HC2N3), a highly explosive molecule with strong anharmonicities consisting of M = 12 vibrational modes, requires circuits with a maximum 8.47 x 10^8 T gates and 173 logical qubits. By enhancing the training datasets of detection models, the full potential of vibrational spectroscopy for chemical detection could be unlocked across a range of applications, including pharmaceuticals, agriculture, environmental monitoring, and medical sensing.</description>

      <title>Exact simulation of realistic Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill cluster states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe a method for simulating and characterizing realistic Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) cluster states, rooted in the representation of resource states in terms of sums of Gaussian distributions in phase space. We apply our method to study the generation of single-mode GKP states via cat state breeding, and the formation of multimode GKP cluster states via linear optical circuits and homodyne measurements. We characterize resource states by referring to expectation values of their stabilizers, and witness operators constructed from them. Our method reproduces the results of standard Fock-basis simulations, while being more efficient, and being applicable in a broader parameter space. We also comment on the validity of the heuristic Gaussian random noise (GRN) model, through comparisons with our exact simulations: We find discrepancies in the stabilizer expectation values when homodyne measurement is involved in cluster state preparation, yet we find a close agreement between the two approaches on average.</description>

      <title>Heat operator approach to quantum stochastic thermodynamics in the strong-coupling regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Open quantum systems exchange heat with their environments and the fluctuations of this heat carry crucial signatures of the underlying dynamical processes. Within the well-established two-point measurement scheme and employing thermofield dynamics, we identify a 'heat operator,' whose moments with respect to the vacuum state correspond to the stochastic moments of the heat exchanged with a thermal bath. This recasts the computation of heat statistics as a standard unitary time-evolution problem, allowing us to leverage powerful tensor-network techniques for simulating quantum dynamics. In particular, we exploit the chain mapping of thermodynamic reservoirs to compute heat fluctuations in the Ohmic spin-boson model. The method, however, is general and applies to arbitrary open quantum systems coupled to non-interacting (bosonic or fermionic) thermal environments, offering a powerful, non-perturbative framework for understanding heat transfer in open quantum systems.</description>

      <title>An Adaptive Weighted QITE-VQE Algorithm for Combinatorial Optimization Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) is a promising algorithm for finding the ground states of a given Hamiltonian. Its application to binary-formulated combinatorial optimization (CO) has been intensively studied in recent years. However, typical VQE approaches for CO problems often suffer from local minima or barren plateaus, limiting their ability to achieve optimal solutions. The quantum imaginary time evolution (QITE) offers an alternative approach for effective ground-state preparation but requires large circuits to approximate non-unitary operations. Although compressed QITE (cQITE) reduces circuit depth, accumulated errors eventually cause energy increases. To address these challenges, we propose an Adaptive Weighted QITE-VQE (AWQV) algorithm that integrates the VQE gradients with the cQITE updates through an adaptive weighting scheme during optimization. In numerical experiments of MaxCut on unweighted regular graphs, AWQV achieves near-optimal approximation ratios, while for weighted Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi instances, it outperforms the classical Goemans-Williamson algorithm.</description>

      <title>Quantum Phases Classification Using Quantum Machine Learning with SHAP-Driven Feature Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we present an innovative methodology to classify quantum phases within the ANNNI (Axial Next-Nearest Neighbor Ising) model by combining Quantum Machine Learning (QML) techniques with the Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) algorithm for feature selection and interpretability. Our investigation focuses on two prominent QML algorithms: Quantum Support Vector Machines (QSVM) and Variational Quantum Classifiers (VQC). By leveraging SHAP, we systematically identify the most relevant features within the dataset, ensuring that only the most informative variables are utilized for training and testing. The results reveal that both QSVM and VQC exhibit exceptional predictive accuracy when limited to 5 or 6 key features, thereby enhancing performance and reducing computational overhead. This approach not only demonstrates the effectiveness of feature selection in improving classification outcomes but also offers insights into the interpretability of quantum classification tasks. The proposed framework exemplifies the potential of interdisciplinary solutions for addressing challenges in the classification of quantum systems, contributing to advancements in both machine learning and quantum physics.</description>

      <title>Improved approximation algorithms for the EPR Hamiltonian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The EPR Hamiltonian is a family of 2-local quantum Hamiltonians introduced by King (arXiv:2209.02589). We introduce a polynomial time $\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{4}\approx 0.809$-approximation algorithm for the problem of computing the ground energy of the EPR Hamiltonian, improving upon the previous state of the art of $0.72$ (arXiv:2410.15544). As a special case, this also implies a $\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{4}$-approximation for Quantum Max Cut on bipartite instances, improving upon the approximation ratio of $3/4$ that one can infer in a relatively straightforward manner from the work of Lee and Parekh (arXiv:2401.03616).</description>

      <title>Cross-Problem Parameter Transfer in Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm: A Machine Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is one of the most promising candidates to achieve the quantum advantage in solving combinatorial optimization problems. The process of finding a good set of variational parameters in the QAOA circuit has proven to be challenging due to multiple factors, such as barren plateaus. As a result, there is growing interest in exploiting parameter transferability, where parameter sets optimized for one problem instance are transferred to another that could be more complex either to estimate the solution or to serve as a warm start for further optimization. But can we transfer parameters from one class of problems to another? Leveraging parameter sets learned from a well-studied class of problems could help navigate the less studied one, reducing optimization overhead and mitigating performance pitfalls. In this paper, we study whether pretrained QAOA parameters of MaxCut can be used as is or to warm start the Maximum Independent Set (MIS) circuits. Specifically, we design machine learning models to find good donor candidates optimized on MaxCut and apply their parameters to MIS acceptors. Our experimental results show that such parameter transfer can significantly reduce the number of optimization iterations required while achieving comparable approximation ratios.</description>

      <title>Simon's Period Finding on a Quantum Annealer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dating to 1994, Simon's period-finding algorithm is among the earliest and most fragile of quantum algorithms. The algorithm's fragility arises from the requirement that, to solve an n qubit problem, one must fault-tolerantly sample O(n) linearly independent values from a solution space. In this paper, we study an adiabatic implementation of Simon's algorithm that requires a constant number of successful samples regardless of problem size. We implement this algorithm on D-Wave hardware and solve problems with up to 298 qubits. We compare the runtime of classical algorithms to the D-Wave solution to analyze any potential advantage.</description>

      <title>Neural Network Emulation of the Classical Limit in Quantum Systems via Learned Observable Mappings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classical limit of quantum mechanics, formally investigated through frameworks like strict deformation quantization, remains a profound area of inquiry in the philosophy of physics. This paper explores a computational approach employing a neural network to emulate the emergence of classical behavior from the quantum harmonic oscillator as Planck's constant $\hbar$ approaches zero. We develop and train a neural network architecture to learn the mapping from initial expectation values and $\hbar$ to the time evolution of the expectation value of position. By analyzing the network's predictions across different regimes of hbar, we aim to provide computational insights into the nature of the quantum-classical transition. This work demonstrates the potential of machine learning as a complementary tool for exploring foundational questions in quantum mechanics and its classical limit.</description>

      <title>Q-Cluster: Quantum Error Mitigation Through Noise-Aware Unsupervised Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum error mitigation (QEM) is critical in reducing the impact of noise in the pre-fault-tolerant era, and is expected to complement error correction in fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC). In this paper, we propose a novel QEM approach, Q-Cluster, that uses unsupervised learning (clustering) to reshape the measured bit-string distribution. Our approach starts with a simplified bit-flip noise model. It first performs clustering on noisy measurement results, i.e., bit-strings, based on the Hamming distance. The centroid of each cluster is calculated using a qubit-wise majority vote. Next, the noisy distribution is adjusted with the clustering outcomes and the bit-flip error rates using Bayesian inference. Our simulation results show that Q-Cluster can mitigate high noise rates (up to 40% per qubit) with the simple bit-flip noise model. However, real quantum computers do not fit such a simple noise model. To address the problem, we (a) apply Pauli twirling to tailor the complex noise channels to Pauli errors, and (b) employ a machine learning model, ExtraTrees regressor, to estimate an effective bit-flip error rate using a feature vector consisting of machine calibration data (gate &amp; measurement error rates), circuit features (number of qubits, numbers of different types of gates, etc.) and the shape of the noisy distribution (entropy). Our experimental results show that our proposed Q-Cluster scheme improves the fidelity by a factor of 1.46x, on average, compared to the unmitigated output distribution, for a set of low-entropy benchmarks on five different IBM quantum machines. Our approach outperforms the state-of-art QEM approaches M3 [24], Hammer [35], and QBEEP [33] by 1.29x, 1.47x, and 2.65x, respectively.</description>

      <title>Control-driven critical fluctuations across quantum trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monitored quantum circuits in which entangling unitary dynamics compete with projective local measurements can host measurement-induced phase transitions witnessed by entanglement measures at late times. Adding feedback conditioned on the measurement outcomes gives rise to another type of phase transition witnessed by local order parameters and correlation functions. These transitions, known as control or absorbing-state transitions, generically occur within the area-law entanglement phase and are thought to be governed by classical physics in that their critical exponents match those of the classical limit of the model. In this work, we examine quantum features of these transitions, focusing on a Bernoulli circuit model with a well-defined classical limit. First we demonstrate that, in the local basis defined by the absorbing state, the steady-state quantum coherence undergoes a phase transition at the control transition, where its logarithm changes discontinuously from volume- to area-law scaling. Second, we analyze the control transition from the perspective of fluctuations in observables, which carry two contributions: classical fluctuations over circuit realizations (present in the classical limit), and quantum fluctuations over trajectories and states (both absent in the classical limit). Both contributions can be estimated in experiments without post-selection. The circuit-to-circuit fluctuations, the dominant contribution, carry the critical behavior of the classical limit. However, the subleading quantum fluctuations that represent fluctuations between different quantum "worlds" also go critical at the control transition. These critical quantum fluctuations at the control transition also occur in other models, and we discuss how they can be measured experimentally without post-selection.</description>

      <title>Room-Temperature Hybrid 2D-3D Quantum Spin System for Enhanced Magnetic Sensing and Many-Body Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advances in hybrid quantum systems and their precise control are pivotal for developing advanced quantum technologies. Two-dimensional (2D) materials with optically accessible spin defects have emerged as a promising platform for building integrated quantum spin systems due to their exceptional flexibility and scalability. However, experimentally realizing such systems and demonstrating their superiority remains challenging. Here, we present a hybrid spin system operating under ambient conditions, integrating boron vacancy (VB) spins in 2D hexagonal boron nitride flakes with a single nitrogen vacancy (NV) center in 3D single-crystal diamonds. This combined system achieves full controllability and exhibits enhanced performance for nanoscale magnetic sensing, including an improved dynamic range. Moreover, we investigate the rich many-body spin dynamics within the hybrid system, enabling the first-time quantification of the fluorescence intensity of a single VB defect at 104 counts per second. This result represents a critical step toward the direct optical observation of single VB defects.</description>

      <title>Stable and High-Precision 3D Positioning via Tunable Composite-Dimensional Hong-Ou-Mandel Interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a stable and high-precision three-dimensional (3D) quantum positioning scheme based on Hong-Ou-Mandel interference. While previous studies have explored HOM interference in quantum metrology, they were mostly limited to one-dimensional scenarios, whereas real-world applications require full 3D spatial resolution. Our approach not only generalizes HOM positioning to 3D-achieving ultimate sensitivity as defined by the quantum Cramer-Rao bound-but also stabilizes estimation accuracy through simple polarization tuning, ensuring that the Fisher information remains independent of the estimated parameters. Theoretical analysis and simulations demonstrate that our method achieves ultra-precise and reliable 3D positioning, even with a limited number of detected photons.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the Bell-Mermin-Klyshko inequalities and the one-way information deficit of Dirac fields in noninertial frames, where the quantum correlations are shared between inertial and accelerated observers due to the Unruh effect. We derive partial analytical results for specific quantum states using the one-way information deficit. Additionally, we present numerical results for the Bell-Mermin-Klyshko inequalities. The study reveals the presence of Bell nonlocality and the significance of the one-way information deficit in relativistic quantum information.</description>

      <title>Algorithmic Advances Towards a Realizable Quantum Lattice Boltzmann Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Quantum Lattice Boltzmann Method (QLBM) is one of the most promising approaches for realizing the potential of quantum computing in simulating computational fluid dynamics. Many recent works mostly focus on classical simulation, and rely on full state tomography. Several key algorithmic issues like observable readout, data encoding, and impractical circuit depth remain unsolved. As a result, these are not directly realizable on any quantum hardware. We present a series of novel algorithmic advances which allow us to implement the QLBM algorithm, for the first time, on a quantum computer. Hardware results for the time evolution of a 2D Gaussian initial density distribution subject to a uniform advection-diffusion field are presented. Furthermore, 3D simulation results are presented for particular non-uniform advection fields, devised so as to avoid the problem of diminishing probability of success due to repeated post-selection operations required for multiple timesteps. We demonstrate the evolution of an initial quantum state governed by the advection-diffusion equation, accounting for the iterative nature of the explicit QLBM algorithm. A tensor network encoding scheme is used to represent the initial condition supplied to the advection-diffusion equation, significantly reducing the two-qubit gate count affording a shorter circuit depth. Further reductions are made in the collision and streaming operators. Collectively, these advances give a path to realizing more practical, 2D and 3D QLBM applications with non-trivial velocity fields on quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>A Quantum Advantage in Localizing Transmission Loss Change in Optical Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to localize transmission loss change to a subset of links in optical networks is crucial for maintaining network reliability, performance and security. \emph{Quantum probes}, implemented by sending blocks of $n$ coherent-state pulses augmented with continuous-variable (CV) squeezing ($n=1$) or weak temporal-mode entanglement ($n&gt;1$) over a lossy channel to a receiver with homodyne detection capabilities, are known to be more sensitive than their quasi-classical counterparts in detecting a sudden increase in channel loss. The enhanced sensitivity can be characterized by the increased Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence of the homodyne output, before and after the loss change occurs. When combined with the theory of quickest change detection (QCD), the increase in KL divergence translates into a decrease in detection latency.
  In this work, we first revisit quantum probes over a channel, generalizing previous results on $n=1$ (CV squeezed states) to arbitrary values of $n$. Assuming a subset of nodes in an optical network is capable of sending and receiving such probes through intermediate nodes with all-optical switching capabilities, we present a scheme for quickly detecting the links that have suffered a sudden drop in transmissivity. Since quantum probes lose their sensitivity with increasing loss in the channel, we first propose a probe construction algorithm that makes the set of links suffering transmission loss change identifiable, while minimizing the longest distance a probe traverses. We then introduce new cumulative sum (CUSUM) statistics with a stopping rule, which allows us to run the CUSUM algorithm to quickly localize the lossy links using our constructed probes. Finally, we show that the proposed scheme achieves a quantum advantage in decreasing the detection delay.</description>

      <title>SCOOP: A Scalable Quantum-Computing Framework to Constrained Combinatorial Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While the ultimate goal of solving computationally intractable problems is to find a provably optimal solutions, practical constraints of real-world scenarios often necessitate focusing on efficiently obtaining high-quality, near-optimal solutions. The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is a state-of-the-art hybrid quantum-classical approach for tackling these challenging problems that are encoded using quadratic and higher-order unconstrained binary optimization problems (QUBO and HUBO). We present SCOOP, a novel QAOA-based framework for solving constrained optimization problems. SCOOP transforms a constrained problem into an unconstrained counterpart, forming SCOOP problem twins. The QAOA quantum algorithm operates on the unconstrained twin to identify potential optimal and near-optimal solutions. Effective classical post-processing reduces the solution set to the constrained problem space. Our SCOOP approach is solution-enhanced, objective-function-compatible, and scalable. We demonstrate the framework on three NP-hard problems, Minimum Dominating Set, Minimum Maximal Matching, and Minimum Set Cover appearing in practical application domains such as resource allocation, communication networks, and machine learning. We validate SCOOP's feasibility and effectiveness on Xanadu PennyLane simulators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum optimal control for gate optimization aims to provide accurate, robust, and fast pulse sequences to achieve gate fidelities on quantum systems below the error correction threshold. Many methods have been developed and successfully applied in simulation and on quantum hardware. In this paper, we establish a connection between the iterative linear quadratic regulator and quantum optimal control by adapting it to gate optimization of quantum systems. We include constraints on the controls and their derivatives to enable smoother pulses. We achieve high-fidelity simulation results for X and cross-resonance gates on one- and two-qubit fixed-frequency transmons simulated with two and three levels.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a method to cool a thermal photonic state in a cavity by passing electrons through it. Electrons are coherently split into two paths, with one path traversing the cavity, becoming entangled with its photonic state. A sequence of such entanglement interactions can achieve cooling of the cavity: e.g., a twofold reduction in thermal photon number with a 25% post-selection probability. This ``which-path''-based approach extends to other qubit oscillator systems, such as phonons in crystals or optomechanical resonators, offering a general framework for quantum oscillator cooling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We measured the relaxation and decoherence rates of a superconducting transmon qubit in a resonator-free setting. In our experiments, the qubit is coupled to an open coplanar waveguide such that the transmission of microwaves through this line depends on the qubit's state. To determine the occupation of the first excited qubit energy level, we introduced a two-pulse technique. The first applied pulse, at a frequency close to the eigenfrequency of the qubit, serves to excite the qubit. A second pulse is then used for probing the transition between the first and second excited energy levels. Utilizing this measurement technique allowed for the reconstruction of the relaxation dynamics and Rabi oscillations. Furthermore, we demonstrate the consistency between the extracted parameters and the corresponding estimations from frequency-domain measurements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Instability features associated to topological quantum domains which emerge from the Weyl-Wigner (WW) quantum phase-space description of Gaussian ensembles driven by Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper (AAH) Hamiltonians are investigated. Hyperbolic equilibrium and stability patterns are then identified and classified according to the associated (nonlinear) AAH Hamiltonian parameters. Besides providing the tools for quantifying the information content of AAH systems, the Wigner flow patterns here discussed suggest a systematic procedure for identifying the role of quantum fluctuations over equilibrium and stability, in a framework which can be straightforwardly extended to describe the evolution of similar/modified AAH systems.</description>

      <title>A quantum algorithm for estimating the determinant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a quantum algorithm for estimating the matrix determinant based on quantum spectral sampling. The algorithm estimates the logarithm of the determinant of an $n \times n$ positive sparse matrix to an accuracy $\epsilon$ in time ${\cal O}(\log n/\epsilon^3)$, exponentially faster than previously existing classical or quantum algorithms that scale linearly in $n$. The quantum spectral sampling algorithm generalizes to estimating any quantity $\sum_j f(\lambda_j)$, where $\lambda_j$ are the matrix eigenvalues. For example, the algorithm allows the efficient estimation of the partition function $Z(\beta) =\sum_j e^{-\beta E_j}$ of a Hamiltonian system with energy eigenvalues $E_j$, and of the entropy $ S =-\sum_j p_j \log p_j$ of a density matrix with eigenvalues $p_j$.</description>

      <title>QAMA: Quantum annealing multi-head attention operator with classical deep learning framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As large language models scale up, the conventional attention mechanism faces critical challenges of exponential growth in memory consumption and energy costs. Quantum annealing computing, with its inherent advantages in computational efficiency and low energy consumption, offers an innovative direction for constructing novel deep learning architectures. This study proposes the first Quantum Annealing-based Multi-head Attention (QAMA) mechanism, achieving seamless compatibility with classical attention architectures through quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) modeling of forward propagation and energy-based backpropagation. The method innovatively leverages the quantum bit interaction characteristics of Ising models to optimize the conventional $O(n^2)$ spatiotemporal complexity into linear resource consumption. Integrated with the optical computing advantages of coherent Ising machines (CIM), the system maintains millisecond-level real-time responsiveness while significantly reducing energy consumption. Our key contributions include: Theoretical proofs establish QAMA mathematical equivalence to classical attention mechanisms; Dual optimization of multi-head specificity and long-range information capture via QUBO constraints; Explicit gradient proofs for the Ising energy equation are utilized to implement gradient conduction as the only path in the computational graph as a layer; Proposed soft selection mechanism overcoming traditional binary attention limitations to approximate continuous weights. Experiments on QBoson CPQC quantum computer show QAMA achieves comparable accuracy to classical operators while reducing inference time to millisecond level and improving solution quality. This work pioneers architectural-level integration of quantum computing and deep learning, applicable to any attention-based model, driving paradigm innovation in AI foundational computing.</description>

      <title>Quantum walk on a square lattice with identical particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate quantum superposition effects in two-dimensional quantum walks of identical particles with different statistics under particle exchange, starting from various different initial configurations. To characterize inter-particle correlation dynamics, we focus on joint properties such as two-particle coincidence probabilities and the spread velocity of the inter-particle distance. Regarding spatial modes as an environment for the particles internal degrees of freedom, we study the role played by the particle statistics using standard entanglement witnesses, showing that particles possessing fermionic statistics are more resistant to thermalize with their environment. We analyze the presence of multipartite entanglement in the system's degrees of freedom through the Quantum Fisher Information, revealing that fermionic states generated during the walk are better suited to perform quantum metrology tasks. Finally, we discuss the potential for implementing this model using integrated photonic circuits by exploiting $N$-partite entanglement between individual photons.</description>

      <title>Fine-Tuning Large Language Models on Quantum Optimization Problems for Circuit Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLM) have achieved remarkable outcomes in addressing complex problems, including math, coding, and analyzing large amounts of scientific reports. Yet few works have explored the potential of LLM in quantum computing. The most challenging problem is how to leverage LLMs to automatically generate quantum circuits at a large scale. In this paper, we address such a challenge by fine-tuning LLMs and injecting the domain-specific knowledge of quantum computing. In particular, we investigate the mechanisms to generate training data sets and construct the end-to-end pipeline to fine-tune pre-trained LLMs that produce parameterized quantum circuits for optimization problems. We have prepared 14,000 quantum circuits covering a substantial part of the quantum optimization landscape: 12 optimization problem instances and their optimized QAOA, VQE, and adaptive VQE circuits. The fine-tuned LLMs can construct syntactically correct parametrized quantum circuits in the most recent OpenQASM 3.0. We have evaluated the quality of the parameters by comparing them to the optimized expectation values and distributions. Our evaluation shows that the fine-tuned LLM outperforms state-of-the-art models and that the parameters are better than random. The LLM-generated parametrized circuits and initial parameters can be used as a starting point for further optimization, \emph{e.g.,} templates in quantum machine learning and the benchmark for compilers and hardware.</description>

      <title>Integration of a high-fidelity model of quantum sensors with a map-matching filter for quantum-enhanced navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Harnessing the potential of quantum sensors to assist in navigation requires enabling their operation in complex, dynamic environments and integrating them within existing navigation systems. While cross-couplings from platform dynamics generally degrade quantum measurements in a complex manner, navigation filters would need to be designed to handle such complex quantum sensor data. In this work, we report on the realization of a high-fidelity model of an atom-interferometry-based gravity gradiometer and demonstrate its integration with a map-matching navigation filter. Relying on the ability of our model to simulate the sensor behaviour across various dynamic platform environments, we show that aiding navigation via map matching using quantum gravity gradiometry results in stable trajectories, and highlight the importance of non-Gaussian errors arising from platform dynamics as a key challenge to map-matching navigation. We derive requirements for mitigating these errors, such as maintaining sensor tilt below 3.3 degrees, to inform future sensor development priorities. This work demonstrates the value of an end-to-end approach that could support future optimization of the overall navigation system. Beyond navigation, our atom interferometer modelling framework could be relevant to current research and innovation endeavours with quantum gravimeters, gradiometers and inertial sensors.</description>

      <title>Improved approximation ratios for the Quantum Max-Cut problem on general, triangle-free and bipartite graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study polynomial-time approximation algorithms for the Quantum Max-Cut (QMC) problem. Given an edge-weighted graph $G$ on n vertices, the QMC problem is to determine the largest eigenvalue of a particular $2^n \times 2^n$ matrix that corresponds to $G$. We provide a sharpened analysis of the currently best-known QMC approximation algorithm for general graphs. This algorithm achieves an approximation ratio of $0.599$, which our analysis improves to $0.603$. Additionally, we propose two new approximation algorithms for the QMC problem on triangle-free and bipartite graphs, that achieve approximation ratios of $0.61383$ and $0.8162$, respectively. These are the best-known approximation ratios for their respective graph classes.</description>

      <title>$R$-matrix type parametrization of the Jost function for extracting the resonance parameters from scattering data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new method is proposed for fitting non-relativistic binary-scattering data and for extracting the parameters of possible quantum resonances in the compound system that is formed during the collision. The method combines the well-known $R$-matrix approach with the analysis based on the semi-analytic representation of the Jost functions. It is shown that such a combination has the advantages of both these approaches, namely, the number of the fitting parameters remains relatively small (as for the $R$-matrix approach) and the proper analytic structure of the $S$-matrix is preserved (as for the Jost function method). It is also shown that the new formalism, although closely related to the $R$-matrix method, has the benefit of no dependence on an arbitrary channel radius. The efficiency and accuracy of the proposed method are tested using a model single-channel potential. Artificial ``experimental'' data generated with this potential are fitted, and its known resonances are successfully recovered as zeros of the Jost function on the appropriate sheet of the Riemann surface of the energy.</description>

      <title>Non-stabilizerness in open XXZ spin chains: Universal scaling and dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magic, or non-stabilizerness, is a crucial quantum resource, yet its dynamics in open quantum systems remain largely unexplored. We investigate magic in the open XXZ spin chain under either boundary gain and loss, or bulk dephasing using the stabilizer R\'enyi entropy $M_2$. To enable scalable simulations of large systems, we develop a novel, highly efficient algorithm for computing $M_2$ within the matrix product states formalism while maintaining constant bond dimension--an advancement over existing methods. For boundary driving, we uncover universal scaling laws, $M_2(t) \sim t^{1/z}$, linked to the dynamical exponent $z$ for several distinct universality classes. We also disentangle classical and quantum contributions to magic by introducing a mean-field approximation for magic, thus emphasizing the prominent role of quantum critical fluctuations in non-stabilizerness. For bulk dephasing, dissipation can transiently enhance magic before suppressing it, and drive it to a nontrivial steady-state value. These findings position magic as a powerful diagnostic tool for probing universality and dynamics in open quantum systems.</description>

      <title>A Quantum-Inspired Algorithm for Wave Simulation Using Tensor Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an efficient classical algorithm based on the construction of a unitary quantum circuit for simulating the Isotropic Wave Equation (IWE) in one, two, or three dimensions. Using an analogy with the massless Dirac equation, second order time and space derivatives in the IWE are reduced to first order, resulting in a Schr\"odinger equation of motion. Exact diagonalization of the unitary circuit in combination with Tensor Networks allows simulation of the wave equation with a resolution of $10^{13}$ grid points on a laptop. A method for encoding arbitrary analytical functions into diagonal Matrix Product Operators is employed to prepare and evolve a Matrix Product State (MPS) encoding the solution. Since the method relies on the Quantum Fourier Transform, which has been shown to generate small entanglement when applied to arbitrary MPSs, simulating the evolution of initial conditions with sufficiently low bond dimensions to high accuracy becomes highly efficient, up to the cost of Trotterized propagation and sampling of the wavefunction. We conclude by discussing possible extensions of the approach for carrying out Tensor Network simulations of other partial differential equations such as Maxwell's equations.</description>

      <title>Field-effect detected magnetic resonance of NV centers in diamond based on all-carbon Schottky contacts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nitrogen vacancy (NV) center is a defect in diamond whose spin state can be read optically by exploiting its photoluminescence or electrically by exploiting its charge generation rate under illumination, both of which being spin-dependent. The latter method offers numerous opportunities in terms of integration and performance compared to conventional optical reading. Here, we investigate the physical properties of a graphitic-diamond-graphitic structure under illumination. We show how, for a type IIa diamond material, electron-hole pairs generated by an ensemble of NV centers lead to a p-type material upon illumination, making this all-carbon structure equivalent to two back-to-back Schottky diodes. We analyze how the reverse current flowing upon illumination changes as a function of bias voltage and radiofrequency-induced excitation of the NV ensemble spin resonances. Furthermore, we demonstrate how an additional field effect arising from the illumination scheme affects the reverse current, resulting in a photoelectrical signal that can exceed the optical signal under the same illumination conditions.</description>

Abstract: We present BenchQC, a research project funded by the state of Bavaria, which promotes an application-centric perspective for benchmarking real-world quantum applications. Diverse use cases from industry consortium members are the starting point of a benchmarking workflow, that builds on the open-source platform QUARK, encompassing the full quantum software stack from the hardware provider interface to the application layer. By identifying and evaluating key metrics across the entire pipeline, we aim to uncover meaningful trends, provide systematic guidance on quantum utility, and distinguish promising research directions from less viable approaches. Ultimately, this initiative contributes to the broader effort of establishing reliable benchmarking standards that drive the transition from experimental demonstrations to practical quantum advantage.</description>

      <title>Characterizing High Schmidt Number Witnesses in Arbitrary Dimensions System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A profound comprehension of quantum entanglement is crucial for the progression of quantum technologies. The degree of entanglement can be assessed by enumerating the entangled degrees of freedom, leading to the determination of a parameter known as the Schmidt number. In this paper, we develop an efficient analytical tool for characterizing high Schmidt number witnesses for bipartite quantum states in arbitrary dimensions. Our methods not only offer viable mathematical methods for constructing high-dimensional Schmidt number witnesses in theory but also simplify the quantification of entanglement and dimensionality. Most notably, we develop high-dimensional Schmidt number witnesses within arbitrary-dimensional systems, with our Schmidt witness coefficients relying solely on the operator Schmidt coefficient. Subsequently, we demonstrate our theoretical advancements and computational superiority by constructing Schmidt number witnesses in arbitrary dimensional bipartite quantum systems with Schmidt numbers four and five.</description>

      <title>Probe of Generic Quantum Contextuality and Nonlocality for qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum contextuality, entanglement, and uncertainty relation are remarkable nonclassical phenomena featured by quantum theory. Here we show that the entropic uncertainty relation (EUR) is able to connect intrinsically generic quantum contextuality and nonlocal entanglement. Based on a local scenario, it is proven rigorously that the EUR with optimal measurements can faithfully witness the preparation contextuality addressed in the pioneering work by Spekkens. From a nonlocal viewpoint, we show that the single-party contextuality and two-party entanglement are related by the EUR with quantum memories, which is captured by a trade-off inequality that limits the nonclassicality distribution for a composite quantum system. Moreover, we derive another kind of trade-off inequality between quantum contextuality and Bell nonlocality. It is revealed that both inequalities can be probed experimentally, and two well-designed independent experiments are performed to verify our theoretical predictions in superconducting qubits.</description>

      <title>A deep dive into the interplay of structured quantum peaked circuits and infinite temperature correlation functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Random quantum circuits have been extensively explored for quantum supremacy demonstrations. However, verifying their output distributions remains challenging. Here, we propose the infinite-temperature correlation function (ITCF) as a physically meaningful observable for noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices one that can be extracted using engineered circuits rather than relying on fully random constructions. This is realized by leveraging peaked quantum states whose probability distributions are sharply peaked at specific outcomes due to constructive interference thus offering more efficient verifiability and stronger signal observability. Rather than using Haar-random states, which often yield vanishing signals through destructive interference, we construct purposefully biased quantum states using either Grover-based amplitude amplification or shallow structured circuits. These engineered states amplify contributions from relevant operator subspaces, enabling robust detection of non-zero ITCF values that would otherwise be suppressed under random-state sampling. Our results highlight a problem-specific state preparation framework that mitigates signal loss from random averaging and facilitates the detection of physically meaningful observables in NISQ devices. We also discuss future extensions to multi-qubit observables, scrambling diagnostics, and variational circuit optimization, underscoring the broader potential of Peaked States for quantum simulation and verification.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Universal quantum gates whose operation depends on the manipulation of the geometric phase of atomic systems are promising candidates for implementation of quantum computing. We propose a scheme inducing a non-trivial Aharonov-Anandan geometric phase in pairs of atoms interacting via dipole-dipole potential. Our protocol relies on mobile optical trap technology and consists of steering a single atom along a closed loop. The trajectory of the atom is controlled by a mobile optical trap, and the shape of the path is designed by applying an optimal control procedure. The geometric phase is generated as a residual of the two-atom entanglement induced by the dipole-dipole interaction. The stability of our scheme in the presence of noise or experimental imperfections is discussed.</description>

      <title>Transforming Resonance Fluorescence into Maximally Entangled Photon Pairs Using Minimal Resources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entanglement is a fundamental concept in quantum mechanics, describing two or more quantum systems that exhibit strong correlations beyond the classical limits at the expense of losing their individual properties. More recently, it has become a cornerstone of quantum technologies, promising revolutionary advancements in fields like quantum communication, sensing, and computation. For these reasons, the generation of technologically useful entangled states is key to progress in these fields. Here, we experimentally demonstrate that resonance fluorescence from a weakly coupled two-level emitter can be transformed, using beam splitters, delay lines, and post-selection only, into a stream of pairs of photons that are maximally entangled in the time-bin basis. We verify the entanglement via a CHSH-type Bell inequality test, yielding an S-parameter of 2.80 \pm 0.19, i.e., a clear 4{\sigma} violation of the classical bound. Our results pave the way for realising efficient sources of bandwidth-limited time-bin entangled photon pairs.</description>

      <title>New Key Rate Bound for High-Dimensional BB84 with Multiple Basis Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we derive a new bound on the secret key-rate of the High Dimensional BB84 protocol operating with multiple mutually unbiased bases (MUBs). To our knowledge, our proof is the first for this protocol that is both general (in that it can handle arbitrary, asymmetric channels), and also the first that derives a bound on the quantum min entropy for general attacks, without relying on post selection techniques or the asymptotic equipartition property. Because of this, our new result shows that far more optimistic key-rates are possible for a low number of signals, even in general channels. Furthermore, our proof methods may be broadly applicable to other protocols relying on multiple measurement bases and we prove several technical lemmas that may have independent interest. We evaluate our new bound and compare to prior work, showing that higher key-rates are possible in several operating scenarios. We also show some interesting behavior of the protocol when faced with asymmetric noise.</description>

      <title>The role of non-Markovian dissipation in quantum phase transitions: tricriticality, spin squeezing, and directional symmetry breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how to control phase transitions in quantum systems is at the forefront of research for the development of new quantum materials and technologies. Here, we study how the coupling of a quantum system to a non-Markovian environment, i.e., an environment with a frequency-dependent spectral density inducing memory effects, can be used to generate and reshape phase transitions and squeezing in matter phases. Focusing on a Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model, we demonstrate that non-Markovian dissipation can be leveraged to engineer tricriticality via the fusion of $2^{\mathrm{nd}}$-order and $1^{\mathrm{st}}$-order critical points. We identify phases that arise from different ways of breaking the single weak symmetry of our model, which led us to introduce the concept of \textit{directional spontaneous symmetry breaking} (DSSB) as a general framework to understand this phenomenon. We show that signatures of DSSB can be seen in the emergence of spin squeezing along different directions, and that the latter is controllable via non-Markovian effects, opening up possibilities for applications in quantum metrology. Finally, we propose an experimental implementation of our non-Markovian model in cavity QED. Our work features non-Markovianity as a resource for controlling phase transitions in general systems, and highlights shortcomings of the Markovian limit in this context.</description>

      <title>Mildly-Interacting Fermionic Unitaries are Efficiently Learnable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent work has shown that one can efficiently learn fermionic Gaussian unitaries, also commonly known as nearest-neighbor matchcircuits or non-interacting fermionic unitaries. However, one could ask a similar question about unitaries that are near Gaussian: for example, unitaries prepared with a small number of non-Gaussian circuit elements. These operators find significance in quantum chemistry and many-body physics, yet no algorithm exists to learn them.
  We give the first such result by devising an algorithm which makes queries to a $n$-mode fermionic unitary $U$ prepared by at most $O(t)$ non-Gaussian gates and returns a circuit approximating $U$ to diamond distance $\varepsilon$ in time $\textrm{poly}(n,2^t,1/\varepsilon)$. This resolves a central open question of Mele and Herasymenko under the strongest distance metric. In fact, our algorithm is much more general: we define a property of unitary Gaussianity known as unitary Gaussian dimension and show that our algorithm can learn $n$-mode unitaries of Gaussian dimension at least $2n - O(t)$ in time $\textrm{poly}(n,2^t,1/\varepsilon)$. Indeed, this class subsumes unitaries prepared by at most $O(t)$ non-Gaussian gates but also includes several unitaries that require up to $2^{O(t)}$ non-Gaussian gates to construct.
  In addition, we give a $\textrm{poly}(n,1/\varepsilon)$-time algorithm to distinguish whether an $n$-mode unitary is of Gaussian dimension at least $k$ or $\varepsilon$-far from all such unitaries in Frobenius distance, promised that one is the case. Along the way, we prove structural results about near-Gaussian fermionic unitaries that are likely to be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Casimir effect in superconducting cavities: from photon generation to universal quantum gates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This chapter explores various aspects of the Dynamical Casimir Effect (DCE) and its implications in the context of circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED). We begin by reviewing the origin and fundamental properties of the DCE, including three equivalent mathematical frameworks that offer complementary perspectives on the phenomenon. These formulations will serve as a foundation for the subsequent analyses. We then turn our attention to the practical realization of the DCE in cQED-based architectures, discussing how modern superconducting circuits can be engineered to exhibit this inherently quantum effect. Building on this, we examine how the presence of the DCE influences the performance of a quantum thermal machine operating with a quantum field, shedding light on the interplay between quantum fluctuations and thermodynamic processes. Further, we demonstrate how the DCE can be harnessed to implement a controlled-squeeze gate within a cQED platform, opening a path toward advanced quantum control and quantum information processing. The chapter concludes with a synthesis of the main results and a discussion of potential future directions.</description>

      <title>Assessing Tensor Network Quantum Emulators for Hamiltonian Simulation of Pharmaceutical Molecules: Challenges and Limitations in Drug Discovery Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing holds promise for revolutionizing computational chemistry simulations, particularly in drug discovery. However, current quantum hardware is limited by noise and scale, necessitating bridging technologies. This study provides an initial evaluation of tensor network quantum emulators, narrowed to matrix product state-based emulators, for Hamiltonian simulation of pharmaceutical molecules, with a focus on predicting the reactivity of targeted covalent drugs. We assess runtime scaling, accuracy, and resource requirements across various active space sizes, comparing performance to traditional state vector simulation methods. Our results reveal that, for accurate estimation of the expectation value trajectory of a key measurement operator - used as a quantum-derived feature for reactivity prediction - the required bond dimension in matrix product state tensor networks grows rapidly with system size, effectively negating runtime advantages for larger, chemically relevant molecules. This study highlights the fundamental challenges in classically simulating complex quantum chemistry systems and contributes to the support of the irreplaceability premise of quantum computers to efficiently handle strongly entangled systems. Such robustness of fault-tolerant quantum computers leads to practical advantages in drug discovery applications.</description>

      <title>Fault Tolerant Quantum Simulation via Symplectic Transvections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional approaches to fault-tolerant quantum computing realize logical circuits gate-by-gate, synthesizing each gate independently on one or more code blocks. This incurs excess overhead and doesn't leverage common structures in quantum algorithms. In contrast, we propose a framework that enables the execution of entire logical circuit blocks at once, preserving their global structure. This whole-block approach allows for the direct implementation of logical Trotter circuits - of arbitrary rotation angles - on any stabilizer code, providing a powerful new method for fault tolerant Hamiltonian simulation within a single code block. At the heart of our approach lies a deep structural correspondence between symplectic transvections and Trotter circuits. This connection enables both logical and physical circuits to share the Trotter structure while preserving stabilizer centralization and circuit symmetry even in the presence of non-Clifford rotations. We discuss potential approaches to fault tolerance via biased noise and code concatenation. While we illustrate the key principles using a $[[8,3,3]]$ code, our simulations show that the framework applies to Hamiltonian simulation on even good quantum LDPC codes. These results open the door to new algorithm-tailored, block-level strategies for fault tolerant circuit design, especially in quantum simulation.</description>

      <title>Beyond Poincar\'{e} Stresses: A Modern Quantum Field Theory Take on Hydrogen's Electromagnetic Mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the longstanding electromagnetic mass problem from a modern quantum field theory perspective. Focusing on a system of two widely separated hydrogen atoms, one in an excited $nS$ state and the other in the ground $1S$ state, we isolate the electromagnetic contribution to the electron's total linear momentum by comparing the full energy-momentum tensor with the predictions of a point-like bound state model. Our analysis reveals that the leading perturbative correction introduces a factor $4/3$, which, along with subsequent corrections, indicates that the effective electromagnetic mass deviates from the conventional relation $E/c^2$. This discrepancy is attributed to the intrinsic nonlocality of the electromagnetic field, rather than to additional compensating mechanisms such as Poincar\'e stresses. We further contrast our quantum field theory results with the highly accurate predictions of the Schr\"odinger equation, which, despite neglecting higher-order terms, achieves an average error on the order of $10^{-5}\%$. Attempts to improve this accuracy via perturbative inclusion of the self-interaction of the electron's wave function instead increase the error, prompting a re-examination of the underlying perturbative assumptions. Our findings suggest that a non-perturbative treatment of the tree-level action may be required to fully capture the dynamics of bound states in quantum field theory.</description>

      <title>Cat states carrying long-range correlations in the many-body localized phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite considerable efforts over the last decade, the high-energy phase diagram of the random-field Heisenberg chain still eludes our understanding, in particular the nature of the non-ergodic many-body localized (MBL) regime expected at strong disorder. In this work, we revisit this paradigmatic model by studying the statistics of rare atypical events of strongly correlated spin pairs traversing the entire system. They occur for unexpectedly strong disorder, i.e., in a regime where standard estimates fail to detect any instability. We then identify these very peculiar high-energy eigenstates, which exhibit system-wide ${\cal{O}}(1)$ correlations, as nearly degenerate pairs of resonant cat states of the form $|{\Phi}_{\pm}\rangle\sim {|{\alpha_1}\rangle}\pm {|{\alpha_2}\rangle}$, where ${|{\alpha_1}\rangle}$ and ${|{\alpha_2}\rangle}$ are spin basis states. We propose a simple and generic analytical description of this new class of eigenstates that exhibit system-spanning entanglement. This analytical ansatz guides us in our search for rare hidden cat states in exponentially large many-body spectra. This also enables a systematic numerical inspection of the microscopic anatomy of these unconventional pairs, which appear in a wide range of disorder strengths. In the light of recent studies and ongoing debates on the MBL problem, our results offer new perspectives and stimulating challenges to this very active field.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian Multipole Skin Effects Challenge Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10580v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the effect of quenched disorder on the non-Hermitian skin effect in systems that conserve a U(1) charge and its associated multipole moments. In particular, we generalize the Hatano-Nelson argument for an Anderson transition in a disordered system with non-reciprocal hopping to the interacting case. When only U(1) charge is conserved, we show that there is a transition between a skin effect phase, in which charges are localized at a boundary, and a many-body localized phase, in which the charges are localized at random positions. In periodic boundary conditions, the skin effect gives way to a delocalized phase with a unidirectional current. If additional multipole moments like dipoles are conserved, we show that the non-Hermitian skin effect remains stable for any amount of disorder. As a result, under periodic boundary conditions, the system is always delocalized regardless of disorder strength.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10601v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a recently discovered mathematical correspondence between the spectra of a naively discretized lattice fermion and that of a periodically driven (i.e., Floquet) quantum system and turn it into an infrared equivalence between the two systems. The equivalence can be framed as a duality relation, allowing us to simulate a two-flavor discrete-time fermion theory on the lattice side, where the two flavors arise from time discretization, using a single-flavor fermion theory on the Floquet side. Our demonstration establishes an equivalence between (i) the fermion content, (ii) the correlation functions, and consequently (iii) observables of the two theories in the infrared. We also show how interactions may be incorporated into this equivalence.</description>

      <title>Out-of-equilibrium dynamics across the first-order quantum transitions of one-dimensional quantum Ising models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of one-dimensional quantum Ising models in a transverse field $g$, driven by a time-dependent longitudinal field $h$ across their {\em magnetic} first-order quantum transition at $h=0$, for sufficiently small values of $|g|$. We consider nearest-neighbor Ising chains of size $L$ with periodic boundary conditions. We focus on the out-of-equilibrium behavior arising from Kibble-Zurek protocols, in which $h$ is varied linearly in time with time scale $t_s$, i.e., $h(t)=t/t_s$. The system starts from the ground state at $h_i\equiv h(t_i)&lt;0$, where the longitudinal magnetization $M$ is negative. Then it evolves unitarily up to positive values of $h(t)$, where $M(t)$ becomes eventually positive. We identify several scaling regimes characterized by a nontrivial interplay between the size $L$ and the time scale $t_s$, which can be observed when the system is close to one of the many avoided level crossings that occur for $h\ge 0$. In the $L\to\infty$ limit, all these crossings approach $h=0^+$, making the study of the thermodynamic limit, defined as the limit $L\to\infty$ keeping $t$ and $t_s$ constant, problematic. We study such limit numerically, by first determining the large-$L$ quantum evolution at fixed $t_s$, and then analyzing its behavior with increasing $t_s$. Our analysis shows that the system switches from the initial state with $M&lt;0$ to a positively magnetized state at $h = h_*(t_s)&gt;0$, where $h_*(t_s)$ decreases with increasing $t_s$, apparently as $h_*\sim 1/\ln t_s$. This suggests the existence of a scaling behavior in terms of the rescaled time $\Omega = t \ln t_s/t_s$. The numerical results also show that the system converges to a nontrivial stationary state in the large-$t$ limit, characterized by an energy significantly larger than that of the corresponding homogeneously magnetized ground state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10774v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a method to numerically obtain low-energy effective models based on a unitary transformation of the ground state. The algorithm finds a unitary circuit that transforms the ground state of the original model to a projected wavefunction with only the low-energy degrees of freedom. The effective model can then be derived using the unitary transformation encoded in the circuit. We test our method on the one-dimensional and two-dimensional square-lattice Hubbard model at half-filling, and obtain more accurate effective spin models than the standard perturbative approach.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10802v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Starting from the symplectic potential for the $\gamma$-Palatini--Holst action on a null hypersurface, we identify an auxiliary conformal field theory (CFT), which carries a representation of the constraint algebra of general relativity on a null surface. The radiative data, which is encoded into the shear of each null generator, is mapped into an $SU(1,1)$ current algebra on each light ray. We study the resulting quantum theory for both bosonic and fermionic representations. In the fermionic representation, the central charge on each null ray is positive, for bosons it is negative. A negative central charge implies a non-unitary CFT, which has negative norm states. In the model, there is a natural $SU(1,1)$ Casimir. For the bosonic representations, the $SU(1,1)$ Casimir can have either sign. For the fermionic representations, the $SU(1,1)$ Casimir is always greater or equal to zero. To exclude negative norm states, we restrict ourselves to the fermionic case. To understand the physical implications of this restriction, we express the $SU(1,1)$ Casimir in terms of the geometric data. In this way, the positivity bound on the $SU(1,1)$ Casimir translates into an upper bound for the shear of each null generator. In the model, this bound must be satisfied for all three-dimensional null hypersurfaces. This in turn suggests to apply it to an entire null foliation in an asymptotically flat spacetime. In this way, we obtain a bound on the radiated power of gravitational waves in the model.</description>

      <title>Strain effect on optical properties and quantum weight of 2D magnetic topological insulators MnBi$_2$X$_4$ (X = Te, Se, S)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Manipulating the optical and quantum properties of two-dimensional (2D) materials through strain engineering is not only fundamentally interesting but also provides significant benefits across various applications. In this work, we employ first-principles calculations to investigate the effects of strain on the magnetic and optical properties of 2D topological insulators MnBi$_2$X$_4$ (X = Te, Se, S). Our results indicate that biaxial strain enhances the Mn magnetic moment, while uniaxial strains reduce it. Significantly, the strain-dependent behavior, quantified through the quantum weight, can be leveraged to control the system's quantum geometry and topological features. Particularly, uniaxial strains reduce the quantum weight and introduce anisotropy, thus providing an additional degree of freedom to tailor device functionalities. Finally, by analyzing chemical bonds under various strain directions, we elucidate how the intrinsic ductile or brittle fracture behavior of MnBi$_2$X$_4$ could impact fabrication protocols and structural stability. These insights pave the way for strain-based approaches to optimize the quantum properties in 2D magnetic topological insulators in practical device contexts.</description>

      <title>The path towards measuring the gravitational field of proton bunches at accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10942v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Newtonian law describing the gravitational interaction of non-relativistic (slowly moving) gravitating matter, has been tested in many laboratory experiments with very high precision. In contrast, the post Minkowskian predictions for the gravitational field of ultra-relativistic matter, dominated by momentum instead of rest mass, have not been tested directly yet. The intense ultra-relativistic proton beam in the LHC storage ring offers the potential to test general relativity and alternative gravitational theories in this parameter regime for the first time in controlled lab-scale experiments. If successful, this would open the road to a novel use case of the LHC, where non-trivial gravitational physics could be studied likely in a parasitic mode, without the necessity of dedicated filling patterns. While the technical challenges are formidable, they should also lead to the development of ultra-high-sensitive acceleration sensors with abundant applications in other parts of science and technology. The present document summarizes the status of the theoretical studies in this direction, points out the challenges, and possible ways of addressing them. It was submitted as a contribution to the European Strategy for Particle Physics (ESPP) 2026 Update.</description>

      <title>Statistical complexity as a probe of mass and phase structure in compact objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present a comprehensive and systematic study of the statistical complexity, originally introduced by L\'opez-Ruiz, Mancini, and Calbet [Phys. Lett. A 209, 321-326 (1995)], across a broad range of compact star models. We explore how complexity correlates not only with macroscopic observables such as mass and radius, but also with the microscopic characteristics of the underlying equation of state. By incorporating both realistic equations of state and analytical solutions to Einstein's field equations, we demonstrate that gravitational mass plays a dominant role in determining the behavior of complexity. Furthermore, we show that strong phase transitions within the stellar interior, such as those hypothesized in hybrid stars, can manifest as distinct features in the complexity profile, offering a potential informational signature of such transitions. This work offers new insights into the link between information theory and compact object physics, highlighting complexity's potential as a diagnostic tool in astrophysics.</description>

      <title>Single-site and multi-site solitons of bright matter-waves in optical lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the experimental observation of discrete bright matter-wave solitons with attractive interaction in an optical lattice. Using an accordion lattice with adjustable spacing, we prepare a Bose-Einstein condensate of cesium atoms across a defined number of lattice sites. By quenching the interaction strength and the trapping potential, we generate both single-site and multi-site solitons. Our results reveal the existence and characteristics of these solitons across a range of lattice depths and spacings. We identify stable regions of the solitons, based on interaction strength and lattice properties, and compare these findings with theoretical predictions. Our results provide insights into the quench dynamics and collapse mechanisms, paving the way for further studies on transport and dynamical properties of matter-wave solitons in lattices.</description>

      <title>Time-Resolved Stokes Analysis of Single Photon Emitters in Hexagonal Boron Nitride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solid-state quantum emitters play a vital role in advancing quantum technologies, particularly in quantum computation and communication, where single-photon polarization acts as a fundamental information carrier. Precise polarization characterization is essential for understanding the mechanisms underlying polarization dynamics, which is critical for developing quantum emitters with minimized polarization-related errors. In this study, we employ the Rotating Quarter-Wave Plate (RQWP) method to comprehensively characterize the polarization state of quantum emitters in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). By examining both time-averaged and dynamic polarization features, we demonstrate the time-resolved evolution of Stokes parameters from a solid-state single-photon emitter using the RQWP technique. This approach provides more complete polarization information than conventional micro-photoluminescence methods, without requiring modifications to the experimental setup. Our results uncover intricate polarization dynamics in hBN emitters, offering insights that were previously inaccessible. The techniques presented here can be broadly applied to polarization analysis of solid-state quantum emitters across various material platforms.</description>

      <title>Accurate Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials for Polyacene Molecular Crystals: Application to Single Molecule Host-Guest Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Emerging machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) offer a promising solution for large-scale accurate material simulations, but stringent tests related to the description of vibrational dynamics in molecular crystals remain scarce. Here, we develop a general MLIP by leveraging the graph neural network-based MACE architecture and active-learning strategies to accurately capture vibrational dynamics across a range of polyacene-based molecular crystals, namely naphthalene, anthracene, tetracene and pentacene. Through careful error propagation, we show that these potentials are accurate and enable the study of anharmonic vibrational features, vibrational lifetimes, and vibrational coupling. In particular, we investigate large-scale host-guest systems based on these molecular crystals, showing the capacity of molecular-dynamics-based techniques to explain and quantify vibrational coupling between host and guest nuclear motion. Our results establish a framework for understanding vibrational signatures in large-scale complex molecular systems and thus represent an important step for engineering vibrational interactions in molecular environments.</description>

      <title>Periodic table for highly charged ions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11237v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mendeleev's periodic table successfully groups atomic elements according to their chemical and spectroscopic properties. However, it becomes less sufficient in describing the electronic properties of highly charged ions (HCIs) in which many of the outermost electrons are ionized. In this work, we put forward a periodic table particularly suitable for HCIs. It is constructed purely based on the successive electron occupation of relativistic orbitals. While providing a much-simplified description of the level structure of highly charged isoelectronic ions -- essential for laboratory and astrophysical plasma spectroscopies, such a periodic table predicts a large family of highly forbidden transitions suitable for the development of next-generation optical atomic clocks. Furthermore, we also identify universal linear $Z$ scaling laws ($Z$ is the nuclear charge) in the so-called ``Coulomb splittings'' between angular momentum multiplets along isoelectronic sequences, complementing the physics of electron-electron interactions in multielectron atomic systems.</description>

      <title>Measurement of the g factor of ground-state 87Sr at the parts-per-million level using co-trapped ultracold atoms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate nuclear magnetic resonance of optically trapped ground-state ultracold 87Sr atoms. Using a scheme in which a cloud of ultracold 87Rb is co-trapped nearby, we improve the determination of the nuclear g factor, gI , of atomic 87Sr by more than two orders of magnitude, reaching accuracy at the parts-per-million level. We achieve similar accuracy in the ratio of relevant g factors between Rb and Sr. This establishes ultracold 87Sr as an excellent linear in-vacuum magnetometer. These results are relevant for ongoing efforts towards quantum simulation, quantum computation and optical atomic clocks employing 87Sr, and these methods can also be applied to other alkaline-earth and alkaline-earth-like atoms.</description>

      <title>Probing General Relativity-Induced Decoherence Using an on-chip Sagnac Interferometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11392v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The intersection of quantum mechanics and general relativity remains an open frontier in fundamental physics, with few experimentally accessible phenomena connecting the two. Recent theoretical proposals suggest that relativistic proper time can act as a source of decoherence in quantum systems, providing a testable overlap between the two theories. Here, we propose a chip-integrated Sagnac interferometer where rotation induces a proper time difference between clockwise and counterclockwise single-photon paths. When this time delay exceeds the photon's coherence time, interference visibility is predicted to decrease, offering a direct signature of relativistic time dilation-induced decoherence. We theoretically derive the proper time difference arising from the Sagnac effect and estimate that for a loop radius of 18.9 cm and a rotation speed of 1000 rad/s, decoherence should occur for single-photon wavepackets with a coherence time of 10 femtoseconds. We also present a practical chip design that accommodates the required high-speed mechanical rotation and includes an all-optical readout scheme to eliminate wiring constraints. This approach enables a stable, on-chip implementation using realistic parameters, with rotation speed serving as a continuously tunable knob to control decoherence. Our platform opens a new route for experimentally probing the interplay between quantum coherence and relativistic proper time in a scalable and compact form.</description>

Abstract: Teleportation is a cornerstone of quantum technologies, and has played a key role in the development of quantum information theory. Pushing the limits of teleportation is therefore of particular importance. Here, we apply a different aspect of quantumness to teleportation -- namely exchange-free, or counterfactual, computation at a distance. We propose a universal controlled-phase gate, where no particles are exchanged between control and target. This allows the full repertoire of quantum computation to me made exchange-free, including both complete Bell detection among two remote parties and so teleportation and telecloning. Further, we show that this gate, and the protocols based on it, is experimentally feasible, simulating the fidelity of our exchange-free teleportation and telecloning protocols for realistic bit-errors.</description>

      <title>Reducing leakage of single-qubit gates for superconducting quantum processors using analytical control pulse envelopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17757v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Improving the speed and fidelity of quantum logic gates is essential to reach quantum advantage with future quantum computers. However, fast logic gates lead to increased leakage errors in superconducting quantum processors based on qubits with low anharmonicity, such as transmons. To reduce leakage errors, we propose and experimentally demonstrate two new analytical methods, Fourier ansatz spectrum tuning derivative removal by adiabatic gate (FAST DRAG) and higher-derivative (HD) DRAG, both of which enable shaping single-qubit control pulses in the frequency domain to achieve stronger suppression of leakage transitions compared to previously demonstrated pulse shapes. Using the new methods to suppress the $ef$-transition of a transmon qubit with an anharmonicity of -212 MHz, we implement $R_X(\pi/2)$-gates achieving a leakage error below $3.0 \times 10^{-5}$ down to a gate duration of 6.25 ns without the need for iterative closed-loop optimization. The obtained leakage error represents a 20-fold reduction in leakage compared to a conventional Cosine DRAG pulse. Employing the FAST DRAG method, we further achieve an error per gate of $(1.56 \pm 0.07)\times 10^{-4}$ at a 7.9-ns gate duration, outperforming conventional pulse shapes both in terms of error and gate speed. Furthermore, we study error-amplifying measurements for the characterization of temporal microwave control pulse distortions, and demonstrate that non-Markovian coherent errors caused by such distortions may be a significant source of error for sub-10-ns single-qubit gates unless corrected using predistortion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03570v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Exposure of matter to high energy, heavy ions induces defects along the trajectories of the ions through electronic and nuclear energy loss processes. Defects, including color centers, can recombine or form along latent damage tracks in many materials, such as insulators and semiconductors. Latent tracks in diamond were only recently observed. Here, we report on color center formation in diamond along the latent tracks of 1 GeV gold and uranium ions. Using depth-resolved photoluminescence, we observe direct formation of single vacancy related color centers (GR1-centers) along the ion tracks. Mobile vacancies can form NV-centers with native nitrogen atoms during thermal annealing. Molecular dynamics simulations show that isolated vacancies and vacancy clusters form through electronic stopping processes, leading to color center formation along ion trajectories from the sample surface to a depth of about 25 microns. We further report on the creation of individually isolated quasi-1D chains of NV-centers by using 1 GeV Au ions with a dilute fluence. The individual 1D NV-chains appear as isolated bright luminescence strings and present competitive electron spin properties compared to a background of NV-centers. Such spin textures can be explored as building blocks for applications in quantum information processing and quantum sensing.</description>

      <title>QOS: A Quantum Operating System</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19120v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum computers face challenges due to hardware constraints, noise errors, and heterogeneity, and face fundamental design tradeoffs between key performance metrics such as \textit{quantum fidelity} and system utilization. This substantially complicates managing quantum resources to scale the size and number of quantum algorithms that can be executed reliably in a given time.
  We introduce QOS, a cloud operating system for managing quantum resources while mitigating their inherent limitations and balancing the design tradeoffs of quantum computing. QOS exposes a hardware-agnostic API for transparent quantum job execution, mitigates hardware errors, and systematically multi-programs and schedules the jobs across space and time to achieve high quantum fidelity in a resource-efficient manner. To achieve this, it leverages two key insights: First, to maximize utilization and minimize fidelity loss, some jobs are more compatible than others for multi-programming on the same quantum computer. Second, sacrificing minimal fidelity can significantly reduce job waiting times.
  We evaluate QOS on real quantum devices hosted by IBM, using 7000 real quantum runs of more than 70.000 benchmark instances. We show that the QOS achieves 2.6--456.5$\times$ higher fidelity, increases resource utilization by up to 9.6$\times$, and reduces waiting times by up to 5$\times$ while sacrificing only 1--3\% fidelity, on average, compared to the baselines.</description>

Abstract: In the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era, flexible quantum operations are essential for advancing large-scale quantum computing, as they enable shorter circuits that mitigate decoherence and reduce gate errors. However, the complex control of quantum interactions poses significant experimental challenges that limit scalability. Here, we propose a transition composite gate scheme based on transition pathway engineering, which digitally implements conditional operations with reduced complexity by leveraging auxiliary energy levels. Experimentally, we demonstrate the controlled-unitary (CU) family and its applications. In entangled state preparation, our CU gate reduces the circuit depth for three-qubit Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) and W states by approximately 40-44% compared to circuits using only CZ gates, leading to fidelity improvements of 1.5% and 4.2%, respectively. Furthermore, with a 72% reduction in circuit depth, we successfully implement a quantum comparator-a fundamental building block for quantum algorithms requiring conditional logic, which has remained experimentally challenging due to its inherent circuit complexity. These results demonstrate the scalability and practicality of our scheme, laying a solid foundation for the implementation of large-scale quantum algorithms in future quantum processors.</description>

      <title>Separable ellipsoids around multipartite states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05400v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that, in finite dimensions, around any $m$-partite product state $\rho_{\rm prod}=\rho_1\otimes...\otimes\rho_m$, there exists an ellipsoid of separable states centered around $\rho_{\rm prod}$. This separable ellipsoid contains the separable ball proposed in previous works, and the volume of the ellipsoid is typically exponentially larger than that of the ball, due to the hierarchy of eigenvalues in typical states. We further generalize this ellipsoidal criterion to a trace formula that yields separable region around all separable states, and further study biseparability. Our criteria not only help numerical procedures to rigorously detect separability, but they also lead to a nested hierarchy of SLOCC-stable subsets that cover the separable set. We apply the procedure for separability detection to 3-qubit X states, genuinely entangled 4-qubit states mixed with noise, and the 1d transverse field Ising model at finite temperature to illustrate the power of our procedure for understanding entanglement in physical systems.</description>

      <title>Revocable Encryption, Programs, and More: The Case of Multi-Copy Security</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13163v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fundamental principles of quantum mechanics have inspired many new research directions, particularly in quantum cryptography. One such principle is quantum no-cloning which has led to the emerging field of revocable cryptography. Roughly speaking, in a revocable cryptographic primitive, a cryptographic object (such as a ciphertext or program) is represented as a quantum state in such a way that surrendering it effectively translates into losing the capability to use this cryptographic object. All of the revocable cryptographic systems studied so far have a major drawback: the recipient only receives one copy of the quantum state. Worse yet, the schemes become completely insecure if the recipient receives many identical copies of the same quantum state -- a property that is clearly much more desirable in practice. While multi-copy security has been extensively studied for a number of other quantum cryptographic primitives, it has so far received only little treatment in context of unclonable primitives. Our work, for the first time, shows the feasibility of revocable primitives, such as revocable encryption and revocable programs, which satisfy multi-copy security in oracle models. This suggest that the stronger notion of multi-copy security is within reach in unclonable cryptography more generally, and therefore could lead to a new research direction in the field.</description>

      <title>Fully smooth one shot multipartite soft covering of quantum states without pairwise independence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17908v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a powerful machinery to prove fully smooth one shot multipartite covering, aka convex split, type results for quantum states. In the important case of smooth multipartite convex split for classical quantum states, aka smooth multipartite soft covering, our machinery works even when certain marginals of these states do not satisfy pairwise independence. The recent paper (arXiv:2410.17893) gave the first proof of fully smooth multipartite convex split by simplifying and extending a technique called telescoping, developed originally for convex split by (arXiv:2304.12056). However, that work as well as all earlier works on convex split assumed pairwise or even more independence amongst suitable marginals of the quantum states.
  We develop our machinery by leveraging known results from (arXiv:1806.07278) involving tilting and augmentation smoothing of quantum states, combined with a novel observation that a natural quantum operation `flattening' quantum states actually preserves the fidelity. This machinery is powerful enough to lead to non pairwise independent results as mentioned above.
  As an application of our soft covering lemma without pairwise independence, we prove the `natural' one shot inner bounds for sending private classical information over a quantum wiretap interference channel, even when the classical encoders at the input lose pairwise independence in their encoding strategies to a certain extent. This result was unknown earlier even in the classical setting.</description>

      <title>The Learning Stabilizers with Noise problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18953v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Random classical codes have good error correcting properties, and yet they are notoriously hard to decode in practice. Despite many decades of extensive study, the fastest known algorithms still run in exponential time. The Learning Parity with Noise (LPN) problem, which can be seen as the task of decoding a random linear code in the presence of noise, has thus emerged as a prominent hardness assumption with numerous applications in both cryptography and learning theory.
  Is there a natural quantum analog of the LPN problem? In this work, we introduce the Learning Stabilizers with Noise (LSN) problem, the task of decoding a random stabilizer code in the presence of local depolarizing noise. We give both polynomial-time and exponential-time quantum algorithms for solving LSN in various depolarizing noise regimes, ranging from extremely low noise, to low constant noise rates, and even higher noise rates up to a threshold. Next, we provide concrete evidence that LSN is hard. First, we show that LSN includes LPN as a special case, which suggests that it is at least as hard as its classical counterpart. Second, we prove a worst-case to average-case reduction for variants of LSN. We then ask: what is the computational complexity of solving LSN? Because the task features quantum inputs, its complexity cannot be characterized by traditional complexity classes. Instead, we show that the LSN problem lies in a recently introduced (distributional and oracle) unitary synthesis class. Finally, we identify several applications of our LSN assumption, ranging from the construction of quantum bit commitment schemes to the computational limitations of learning from quantum data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22694v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Analyzing the kinetics of biological processes plays a significant role in understanding fundamental cellular functions. Many physics-based technologies used to study such processes are limited by the shot noise inherent to the coherent states of light. These technologies can greatly benefit by leveraging quantum probes to improve the sensitivity of measurements in cellular biology. Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) technique has been used effectively to achieve label-free, real-time measurements of protein binding kinetics, which constitutes an important biological phenomenon occurring near the cell membrane. Here, we demonstrate the integration of this technique with the two-mode bright squeezed state having fewer fluctuations as compared to the coherent state to improve the sensitivity of measurement in studying a protein-gold adsorption process. We show 4dB of squeezing as we record the signal-to-noise ratio as the function of time and it is maintained throughout the kinetic process. The quantum advantage as shown in terms of squeezing is achieved despite the total absorption of 74% from the source until the final detection after the sensor. Overall, we provide the most practical setup for improving the sensitivity of the time-dependent measurements involved in various biological processes at the molecular level.</description>

      <title>Stabilizer Tensor Networks with Magic State Injection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12482v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work augments the recently introduced Stabilizer Tensor Network (STN) protocol with magic state injection, reporting a new framework with significantly enhanced ability to simulate circuits with an extensive number of non-Clifford operations. Specifically, for random $T$-doped $N$-qubit Clifford circuits the computational cost of circuits prepared with magic state injection scales as $\mathcal{O}(\text{poly}(N))$ when the circuit has $t \lesssim N$ $T$-gates compared to an exponential scaling for the STN approach, which is demonstrated in systems of up to $200$ qubits. In the case of the Hidden Bit Shift circuit, a paradigmatic benchmarking system for extended stabilizer methods with a tunable amount of magic, we report that our magic state injected STN framework can efficiently simulate $4000$ qubits and $320$ $T$-gates. These findings provide a promising outlook for the use of this protocol in the classical modelling of quantum circuits that are conventionally difficult to simulate efficiently.</description>

Abstract: The equivalence between absolutely separable states and absolutely positive partial transposed (PPT) states in general remains an open problem in quantum entanglement theory. In this work, we study an analogous question for symmetric multiqubit states. We show that symmetric absolutely PPT (SAPPT) states (symmetric states that remain PPT after any symmetry-preserving unitary evolution) are not always symmetric absolutely separable by providing explicit counterexamples. More precisely, we construct a family of entangled five-qubit SAPPT states. Similar counterexamples for larger odd numbers of qubits are identified.</description>

Abstract: In this short review we describe the process of designing a superconducting circuit device for quantum information applications. We discuss the factors that must be considered to implement a desired effective Hamiltonian on a device. We describe the translation between a device's physical layout, the circuit graph, and the effective Hamiltonian. We go over the process of electromagnetic simulation of a device layout to predict its behavior. We also discuss concerns such as connectivity, crosstalk suppression, and radiation shielding, and how they affect both on-chip design and enclosure structures. This paper provides an overview of the challenges in superconducting quantum circuit design and acts as a starter document for researchers working on any of these challenges.</description>

Abstract: We investigate how local distinguishability can restrict global properties of bi-partite states. We begin exploring how non-locality becomes limited by optimal local state discrimination and observe a non-trivial trade-off between CHSH violation and success probability of local discrimination. We extend our findings to bounding the maximally entangled sate fidelity and global observables such as the energy. Our results show that optimal local state discrimination can become a powerful tool to limit global behaviours, e.g. from entangled adversaries in quantum cryptography.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05202v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Encoding classical data in a quantum state is a key prerequisite of many quantum algorithms. Recently matrix product state (MPS) methods emerged as the most promising approach for constructing shallow quantum circuits approximating input functions, including probability distributions, with only linear number of gates. We derive rigorous asymptotic expansions for the decay of entanglement across bonds in the MPS representation depending on the smoothness of the input function, real or complex. We also consider the dependence of the entanglement on localization properties and function support. Based on these analytical results we construct an improved MPS-based algorithm yielding shallow and accurate encoding quantum circuits. By using Tensor Cross Interpolation we are able to construct utility-scale quantum circuits in a compute- and memory-efficient way. We validate our methods on heavy-tailed distributions important in finance, including on L\'evy distributions. We test the performance of the resulting quantum circuits by executing and sampling from them on IBM quantum devices, for up to 64 qubits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09320v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reflections are omnipresent tools in quantum algorithms. We consider the task of reflecting through the eigenspace of an implementable unitary. Such reflections are generally designed using phase estimation or linear combination of unitaries. These methods have size and depth that scale favorably with the desired precision and the spectral gap of the unitary. However, they require a number of ancilla qubits that grows with both parameters. Here, we present a simple algorithm with the same size and depth scaling but requiring only a single ancilla qubit for all problem instances. As such, this algorithm is expected to become the reference method to reflect through eigenspaces of unitaries.</description>

      <title>Quantum chaos on the separatrix of the periodically perturbed Harper model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14926v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the relation between a classical periodic Hamiltonian system and an associated discrete quantum system on a torus in phase space. The model is a sinusoidally perturbed Harper model and is similar to the sinusoidally perturbed pendulum. Separatrices connecting hyperbolic fixed points in the unperturbed classical system become chaotic under sinusoidal perturbation. We numerically compute eigenstates of the Floquet propagator for the associated quantum system. For each propagator eigenstate we compute a Husimi distribution in phase space and an energy and energy dispersion from the expectation value of the unperturbed Hamiltonian operator. The Husimi distribution of each Floquet eigenstate resembles a classical orbit with a similar energy and similar energy dispersion. Chaotic orbits in the mixed classical system are related to Floquet eigenstates that appear ergodic. For a mixed regular and chaotic system, the energy dispersion can separate the Floquet eigenstates into ergodic and integrable subspaces. The width of a chaotic region in the classical system is estimated by integrating the perturbation along a separatrix orbit. We derive a related expression for the associated quantum system from the averaged perturbation in the interaction representation evaluated at states with energy close to the separatrix.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16023v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When estimating an unknown phase rotation of a continuous-variable system with homodyne detection, the optimal probe state strongly depends on the value of the estimated parameter. In this article, we identify the optimal pure single-mode Gaussian probe states depending on the knowledge of the estimated phase parameter before the measurement. We find that for a large prior uncertainty, the optimal probe states are close to coherent states, a result in line with findings from noisy parameter estimation. But with increasingly precise estimates of the parameter it becomes beneficial to put more of the available energy into the squeezing of the probe state. Surprisingly, there is a clear jump, where the optimal probe state changes abruptly to a squeezed vacuum state, which maximizes the Fisher information for this estimation task. We use our results to study repeated measurements and compare different methods to adapt the probe state based on the changing knowledge of the parameter according to the previous findings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02563v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive a novel chain rule for a family of channel conditional entropies, covering von Neumann and sandwiched R\'{e}nyi entropies. In the process, we show that these channel conditional entropies are equal to their regularized version, and more generally, additive across tensor products of channels. For the purposes of cryptography, applying our chain rule to sequences of channels yields a new variant of R\'{e}nyi entropy accumulation, in which we can impose some specific forms of marginal-state constraint on the input states to each individual channel. This generalizes a recently introduced security proof technique that was developed to analyze prepare-and-measure QKD with no limitations on the repetition rate. In particular, our generalization yields ``fully adaptive'' protocols that can in principle update the entropy estimation procedure during the protocol itself, similar to the quantum probability estimation framework.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11631v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically explore the properties of heralded number states including up to three photons that are generated from single-mode twin beams. We investigate the effects of different parameters involved in the state preparation by using the fidelity, normalized second-order factorial moment of photon number for the heralded state $(g^{(2)}_h)$, and photon-number parity as figures of merit. Especially, the photon-number parity offers a practical and robust tool for inferring the target state quality by capturing the contamination of all undesired photon-number contributions. We focus on expressing our results in terms of experimentally easily accessible parameters such as the coincidences-to-accidentals ratio and the detection efficiencies. Our results identify the optimal parameter regions for generating high quality photon-number states by heralding and provide useful insights for advancing their use in quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Surface Code Error Correction with Crosstalk Noise</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04642v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The design and performance analysis of quantum error correction (QEC) codes are often based on incoherent and independent noise models since it is easy to simulate. However, these models fail to capture realistic hardware noise sources, such as correlated errors (crosstalk), which can significantly impact QEC code performance, especially when they occur between data and ancillary qubits. In this paper, we systematically study various types of crosstalk noise and quantify their effects on surface codes through memory and stability experiments. Based on our findings, we introduce crosstalk-robust implementations of QEC via flag qubit designs and redundant stabilizer checks. We perform both numerical and analytical studies to demonstrate the efficacy of these strategies. In addition, we analyze logical crosstalk in an $[[n,k&gt;1,d]]$ code block and establish analytical conditions under which physical crosstalk does not lead to logical crosstalk. Together, our analytical and numerical results shed light on designing QEC codes that are robust against hardware realistic crosstalk noise, paving the way for reliable experimental realization of fault-tolerant quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Energy-time and time-bin entanglement: past, present and future</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14675v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Entanglement is a key resource in many quantum information tasks. From a fundamental perspective entanglement is at the forefront of major philosophical discussions advancing our understanding of nature. An experimental scheme was proposed in 1989 by Franson that exploited the unpredictability in the generation time of a photon pair in order to produce a then new form of quantum entanglement, known as energy-time entanglement. A later modification gave rise to the very popular time-bin entanglement, an important cornerstone in many real-world quantum communication applications. Both forms of entanglement have radically pushed forward our understanding of quantum mechanics throughout the 1990s and 2000s. A decade later modifications to the original proposals were proposed and demonstrated, which opens the path for the highly sought-after device-independence capability for entanglement certification, with a goal of ultra-secure quantum communication. In this review we cover the beginnings of energy-time and time-bin entanglement, many key experiments that expanded our understanding of what was achievable in quantum information experiments all the way down to modern demonstrations based on new technological advances. We will then point out to the future discussing the important place that energy-time and time-bin entanglement will have in upcoming quantum networks and novel protocols based on nonlocality.</description>

      <title>Long-distance quantum communication using concatenated ring graph codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19822v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To realize long-distance quantum communication, it is crucial to design quantum repeater architectures that can deal with transmission losses and operational errors. Code concatenation of photonic graph codes is a promising way to achieve this; however, existing concatenated codes that can correct both transmission losses and operational errors are extremely hardware-demanding. We propose a one-way quantum repeater architecture based on concatenated ring graph codes and linear optical Bell-state measurements. We construct a scheme to generate the concatenated ring graph codes using quantum emitters, where the number of matter qubits scales linearly with concatenation depth. Furthermore, we devise a measurement strategy at each repeater station with a simple experimental setup where photons are measured in the order that they are created and show that entanglement swapping is fault-tolerant to both transmission losses and operational errors. This allows for long-distance quantum communication ($&gt; 10^4$ km) at a kHZ rate even in the presence of single qubit error rates $\epsilon &gt; 10^{-3}$.</description>

      <title>Boundary Time Crystals Induced by Local Dissipation and Long-Range Interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20761v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Driven-dissipative many-body system supports nontrivial quantum phases absent in equilibrium. As a prominent example, the interplay between coherent driving and collective dissipation can lead to a dynamical quantum phase that spontaneously breaks time-translation symmetry. This so-called boundary time crystal (BTC) is fragile in the presence of local dissipation, which can easily relax the system to a stationary state. In this work, we demonstrate a robust BTC that is intrinsically induced by local dissipation. We provide extensive numerical evidences to support existence of the BTC and study its behaviors in different regimes. In particular, with decreasing interaction range, we identify a transition from classical limit cycles to quantum BTCs featuring sizable spatial correlations. Our studies significantly broaden the scope of nonequilibrium phases and shed new light on experimental search for dynamical quantum matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22400v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The incompatibility of measurements is the key feature of quantum theory that distinguishes it from the classical description of nature. Here, we consider groups of d-outcome quantum observables with prime d represented by non-Hermitian unitary operators whose eigenvalues are d'th roots of unity. We additionally assume that these observables mutually commute up to a scalar factor being one of the d'th roots of unity. By representing commutation relations of these observables via a frustration graph, we show that for such a group, there exists a single unitary transforming them into a tensor product of generalized Pauli matrices and some ancillary mutually commuting operators. Building on this result, we derive upper bounds on the sum of the squares of the absolute values and the sum of the expected values of the observables forming a group. We finally utilize these bounds to compute the generalized geometric measure of entanglement for qudit stabilizer subspaces.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we prove security of a quantum conference key agreement (QCKA) protocol augmented with a classical advantage distillation (CAD) protocol. We derive a proof of security, in the finite key setting, that is able to bound the secure key rate for any general, coherent, attack. We evaluate the performance of the system, showing our result can improve the noise tolerance of the protocol in some, but not all, scenarios.</description>

      <title>Quantum Meets SAR: A Novel Range-Doppler Algorithm for Next-Gen Earth Observation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01832v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) plays a vital role in remote sensing due to its ability to capture high-resolution images regardless of weather conditions or daylight. However, to transform the raw SAR signals into interpretable imagery, advanced data processing techniques are essential. A widely used technique for this purpose is the Range Doppler Algorithm (RDA), which takes advantage of Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to convert signals into the frequency domain for further processing. However, the computational cost of this approach becomes significant when dealing with large datasets. This paper presents a Quantum Range Doppler Algorithm (QRDA) that utilizes the Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) to accelerate processing compared to the classical FFT. Furthermore, it introduces a quantum implementation of the Range Cell Migration Correction (RCMC) in the Fourier domain, a critical step in the RDA pipeline, and evaluates its performance relative to its classical counterpart.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05848v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a brief discussion regarding relativistic limits on the discretization and temporal resolution of time values in a quantum clock. Our clock is characterized by a time observable chosen to be the complement of a bounded and discrete Hamiltonian which can have an equally-spaced or a generic spectrum. In the first case the time observable can be described by an Hermitian operator and we find a limit in the discretization for the time eigenvalues. Nevertheless, in both cases, the time observable can be described by a POVM and, by increasing the number of time states, we can arbitrarily reduce the bound on the minimum time quantum, demonstrating that we can safely take the time values as continuous when the number of time states tends to infinity. Finally, we find a limit for temporal resolution of our time observable when the clock is used (together with light signals) in a relativistic framework for measuring spacetime distances.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09281v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the non-Markovian spontaneous emission dynamics of a two-level test atom placed in a cavity formed by two atomic arrays in a waveguide quantum electrodynamics (QED) setup. We demonstrate a crossover from single-mode to multimode strong coupling cavity QED as the cavity length $ \sim d$ becomes comparable to the coherence length associated with collective spontaneous emission $\sim v/(N\gamma)$. The resulting non-Markovian dynamics of the test atom and the emergent spectral density of the field are analyzed as a function of various tunable atomic array parameters: number of atoms, length of the atomic cavity, and resonance frequency of the atoms forming the atomic mirrors. Our results show limitations to cooperatively enhanced light-matter coupling in the presence of time-delayed feedback. We further illustrate that the non-Markovian system dynamics can be efficiently approximated in terms of a few modes of the emergent spectral density of the field.</description>

Abstract: We present a relativistic quantum simulation framework for modeling hydrogen sulfide (H2S) decomposition relevant to hydrogen energy applications. The approach integrates Dirac-Coulomb relativistic quantum chemistry with the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE), implemented on a hybrid quantum-classical architecture. Using quantum algorithms based on Jordan-Wigner encoding and relativistic integrals, we simulate ground-state energies and potential energy surfaces for H2, H2O, and H2S molecules. Results demonstrate that the relativistic VQE correctly reproduces known energy shifts and molecular trends. Optimizer performance, energy variance, and Pauli term complexity are also evaluated. The findings offer insight into scalable quantum simulations of chemically and physically significant systems involving heavy atoms.</description>

      <title>Comparative Analysis of Quantum Support Vector Machines and Variational Quantum Classifiers for B-cell Epitope Prediction in Vaccine Design</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10073v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum computing offers new opportunities for addressing complex classification tasks in biomedical applications. This study investigates two quantum machine learning models-the Quantum Support Vector Machine (QSVM) and the Variational Quantum Classifier (VQC)-in the context of B-cell epitope prediction, a key step in modern vaccine design. QSVM builds upon the classical SVM framework by using quantum circuits to encode nonlinear kernel computations, while VQC replaces the entire classification pipeline with trainable quantum circuits optimized variationally.
  A benchmark dataset from the Immune Epitope Database (IEDB) is used for model evaluation. Each epitope is represented by 10 physicochemical features, and dimensionality reduction via Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is applied to assess model performance across different feature spaces. We also examine the effect of sample size on prediction outcomes.
  Experimental results show that QSVM performs well under limited data conditions, while VQC achieves higher accuracy in larger datasets. These findings highlight the potential of quantum-enhanced models for bioinformatics tasks, particularly in supporting efficient and scalable epitope-based vaccine development.</description>

      <title>On the Rational Degree of Boolean Functions and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.08004v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a natural complexity measure of Boolean functions known as the rational degree. Denoted $\textrm{rdeg}(f)$, it is the minimal degree of a rational function that is equal to $f$ on the Boolean hypercube. For total functions $f$, it is conjectured that $\textrm{rdeg}(f)$ is polynomially related to the Fourier degree of $f$, $\textrm{deg}(f)$. Towards this conjecture, we show that:
  - Symmetric functions have rational degree at least $\Omega(\textrm{deg}(f))$ and unate functions have rational degree at least $\sqrt{\textrm{deg}(f)}$. We observe that both of these lower bounds are asymptotically tight.
  - Read-once AC and TC formulae have rational degree at least $\Omega(\sqrt{\textrm{deg}(f)})$. If these formulae contain parity gates, we show a lower bound of $\Omega(\textrm{deg}(f)^{1/2d})$, where $d$ is the depth.
  - Almost every Boolean function on $n$ variables has rational degree at least $n/2 - O(\sqrt{n})$.
  In contrast, we exhibit partial functions that witness unbounded separations between rational and approximate degree, in both directions. As a consequence, we show that for quantum computers, post-selection and bounded-error are incomparable resources in the black-box model.
  In addition, we show AND and OR composition lemmas for the rational degree and exhibit new polynomial separations between the rational degree and other well-studied complexity measures, such as sensitivity and spectral sensitivity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07056v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the interplay between magic and entanglement in quantum many-body systems. We show that non-local magic, which is supported by the quantum correlations is lower bounded by the non-flatness of entanglement spectrum and upper bounded by the amount of entanglement in the system. We then argue that a smoothed version of non-local magic bounds the hardness of classical simulations for incompressible states. In conformal field theories, we conjecture that the non-local magic should scale linearly with entanglement entropy but sublinearly when an approximation of the state is allowed. We support the conjectures using both analytical arguments based on unitary distillation and numerical data from an Ising CFT. If the CFT has a holographic dual, then we prove that the non-local magic vanishes if and only if there is no gravitational back-reaction. Furthermore, we show that non-local magic is approximately equal to the rate of change of the minimal surface area in response to the change of cosmic brane tension in the bulk.</description>

      <title>Entanglement scaling behaviors of free fermions on hyperbolic lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01706v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, tight-binding models on hyperbolic lattices (discretized AdS space) have gained significant attention, leading to hyperbolic band theory and non-Abelian Bloch states. In this paper, we investigate these quantum systems from the perspective of quantum information, focusing particularly on the scaling of entanglement entropy (EE) that has been regarded as a powerful quantum-information probe into exotic phases of matter. It is known that on $d$-dimensional translation-invariant Euclidean lattice, the EE of band insulators scales as an area law ($\sim L^{d-1}$; $L$ is the linear size of the boundary between two subsystems). Meanwhile, the EE of metals (with finite Density-of-State, i.e., DOS) scales as the renowned Gioev-Klich-Widom scaling law ($\sim L^{d-1}\log L$). The appearance of logarithmic divergence, as well as the analytic form of the coefficient $c$ is mathematically controlled by the Widom conjecture of asymptotic behavior of Toeplitz matrices and can be physically understood via the Swingle's argument. However, the hyperbolic lattice, which generalizes translational symmetry, results in inapplicability of these analytic approaches and the potential non-trivial behavior of EE. Here we make an initial attempt through numerical simulation. Remarkably, we find that both cases adhere to the area law, indicating the effect of background hyperbolic geometry that influences quantum entanglement. To achieve the results, we first apply the vertex inflation method to generate hyperbolic lattice on the Poincar\'{e} disk, and then apply the Haydock recursion method to compute DOS. Finally, we study the scaling of EE for different bipartitions via exact diagonalization and perform finite-size scaling. We also investigate how the coefficient of the area law is correlated to bulk gap in gapped case and to the DOS in gapless case respectively. Future directions are discussed.</description>

      <title>Efficient and systematic calculation of arbitrary observables for the matrix product state excitation ansatz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17117v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Numerical methods based on matrix product states (MPSs) are currently the de facto standard for calculating the ground-state properties of (quasi-)one-dimensional quantum many-body systems. While the properties of the low-lying excitations in such systems are often studied in this MPS framework through _dynamics_ by means of time-evolution simulations, we can also look at their _statics_ by directly calculating eigenstates corresponding to these excitations. The so-called MPS excitation ansatz is a powerful method for finding such eigenstates with a single-particle character in the thermodynamic limit. Although this excitation ansatz has been used quite extensively, a general method for calculating expectation values for these states is lacking in the literature: we aim to fill this gap by presenting a recursive algorithm to calculate arbitrary observables expressed as matrix product operators. This method concisely encapsulates existing methods for -- as well as extensions to -- the excitation ansatz, such as excitations with a larger spatial support and multi-particle excitations, and is robust enough to handle further innovations. We demonstrate the versatility of our method by studying the low-lying excitations in the spin-1 Heisenberg chain and the one-dimensional Hubbard model, looking at how the excitations converge in the former, while in the latter, we present a refined method of targeting single-particle excitations inside a continuum by minimizing the energy _variance_ rather than the energy itself. We hope that this technique will foster further advancements with the excitation ansatz.</description>

      <title>The renormalized stress-energy tensor for scalar fields in the Boulware state with applications to extremal black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04528v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a mode-sum prescription to directly compute the renormalized stress-energy tensor (RSET) for scalar fields in the Boulware vacuum. The method generalizes the recently developed extended coordinate method which was previously only applicable to Hartle-Hawking states. We exhibit the accuracy and efficiency of the method by calculating the RSET in sub-extremal and extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om spacetimes. We find numerical evidence for the regularity of the RSET at the extremal horizon regardless of the field mass and its coupling. We employ our numerical results of the RSET to source the semi-classical Einstein equations, demonstrating that if the RSET is considered as a static perturbation, it will either de-extremalize the black hole, or convert it into a horizonless object.</description>

      <title>Field theory of monitored, interacting fermion dynamics with charge conservation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07317v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Measurement-induced phase transitions (MIPTs) in monitored quantum dynamics are non-equilibrium phase transitions between quantum-chaotic (volume-law entangled) and entanglement-suppressed, area-law phases. We reveal how monitored dynamics are situated within the framework of general far-from-equilibrium, quantum condensed-matter physics. Measurement-induced heating effects scramble the distribution function in generic (interacting) monitored fermion systems, which enables a simplified symmetry-based description of the dynamics. We demonstrate the equivalence of the Keldysh technique with the conventional Statistical-Mechanics Model for circuits, resulting from a doubled Hilbert-space (Choi-Jamio{\l}kowski) mapping. We illustrate this using the monitored dynamics of interacting fermions with a conserved charge, deriving a unified effective field theory that captures all phases and phase transitions. The non-interacting counterpart in 1D space only has an area-law phase, with no MIPT. This was explained via an effective non-linear sigma model replica field theory possessing a very large symmetry. We show that other phases and phase transitions emerge when the replica symmetry is reduced by interactions. The reduced symmetry combines a replica permutation symmetry and charge-conservation within each replica. The former and its spontaneous breaking govern the MIPT, which can be recognized via a separatrix in the renormalization group flow. The replica-resolved charge conservation dictates the ``charge-sharpening" transition between two kinds of dynamics, where the global charge information is either hidden or reconstructible from the measurements. The field theory explains why the charge-sharpening transition should occur only in the volume-law phase. Our framework provides a template for other classes of MIPTs and situates these within the arena of non-equilibrium condensed matter physics.</description>

      <title>Securing HHL Quantum Algorithm against Quantum Computer Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08010v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As the quantum research community expands and new quantum algorithms are created and implemented, it is essential to consider the security implications and potential threats that could lead to the compromise the information processed by them. This work focuses on securing the HHL quantum algorithm against attacks while it executes on a quantum computer. Specifically, two types of potential attacks could be deployed on a cloud-based quantum computer by an attacker circuit attempting to interfere with the victim HHL circuit: the Improper Initialization Attack (IIA) and the Higher Energy Attack (HEA). To protect the HHL algorithm from IIA and HEA, this work proposes first-of-a-kind defense strategies against these attacks on the HHL quantum algorithm. Next, this work demonstrates an implementation of a new quantum circuit for the HHL quantum algorithm that incorporates these defenses. The redesigned quantum circuit is necessary to successfully apply and realize all proposed defense strategies. Finally, this work illustrates how these defense strategies function in practice in the redesigned circuit, specifically how they can protect the HHL quantum algorithm from both IIA and HEA across multiple qubits involving all three types of qubits used in the HHL algorithms: ancilla, clock, and b. The defense requires minimal modification to the circuit, and has only a very small effect on the fidelity of the circuits. The circuits have been tested and validated in both simulation, and also on real IBM quantum computer hardware. The work further analyzes how the modified HHL circuit with the defenses is affected by noise during quantum computation. This work in the end demonstrates that it is practical to add protections to quantum circuits so that they not only perform correct computation, but also self-detect if an attack has occured during the execution.</description>

      <title>Phase diagram of the disordered Kitaev chain with long range pairing connected to external baths</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09423v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the phase diagram of a disordered Kitaev chain with long-range pairing when connected to two metallic leads exchanging particles with external Lindblad baths. We (i) monitor the subgap modes at increasing disorder, (ii) compute the current flowing across the system at a finite voltage bias between the baths, and (iii) study the normal single particle lead correlations across the chain. Throughout our derivation, we evidence the interplay between disorder and topology. In particular, we evidence the reentrant behavior of the massive, topological
  phase at limited values of the disorder strength, similar to what happens in the short-range pairing
  Kitaev model. Our results suggest the possibility of a disorder-induced direct transition between the massive and
  the short-range topological phase of the long-range pairing Kitaev model.</description>

      <title>Brickwall One-Loop Determinant: Spectral Statistics &amp; Krylov Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12301v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate quantum chaotic features of the brickwall model, which is obtained by introducing a stretched horizon - a Dirichlet wall placed outside the event horizon - within the BTZ geometry. This simple yet effective model has been shown to capture key properties of quantum black holes and is motivated by the stringy fuzzball proposal. We analyze the dynamics of both scalar and fermionic probe fields, deriving their normal mode spectra with Gaussian-distributed boundary conditions on the stretched horizon. By interpreting these normal modes as energy eigenvalues, we examine spectral statistics, including level spacing distributions, the spectral form factor, and Krylov state complexity as diagnostics for quantum chaos. Our results show that the brickwall model exhibits features consistent with random matrix theory across various ensembles as the standard deviation of the Gaussian distribution is varied. Specifically, we observe Wigner-Dyson distributions, a linear ramp in the spectral form factor, and a characteristic peak in Krylov complexity, all without the need for a classical interior geometry. We also demonstrate that non-vanishing spectral rigidity alone is sufficient to produce a peak in Krylov complexity, without requiring Wigner-Dyson level repulsion. Finally, we identify signatures of integrability at extreme values of the Dirichlet boundary condition parameter.</description>

      <title>Recurrence method in Non-Hermitian Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14912v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel and systematic recurrence method for the energy spectra of non-Hermitian systems under open boundary conditions based on the recurrence relations of their characteristic polynomials. Our formalism exhibits better accuracy and performance on multi-band non-Hermitian systems than numerical diagonalization or the non-Bloch band theory. It also provides a targeted and efficient formulation for the non-Hermitian edge spectra. As demonstrations, we derive general expressions for both the bulk and edge spectra of multi-band non-Hermitian models with nearest-neighbor hopping and under open boundary conditions, such as the non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger and Rice-Mele models and the non-Hermitian Hofstadter butterfly - 2D lattice models in the presence of non-reciprocity and perpendicular magnetic fields, which is only made possible by the significantly lower complexity of the recurrence method. In addition, we use the recurrence method to study non-Hermitian edge physics, including the size-parity effect and the stability of the topological edge modes against boundary perturbations. Our recurrence method offers a novel and favorable formalism to the intriguing physics of non-Hermitian systems under open boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Simulating Bell inequalities with Qibo</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01434v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present educational material about Bell inequalities in the context of quantum computing. In particular, we provide software tools to simulate their violation, together with a guide for the classroom discussion. The material is organized in three modules of increasing difficulty, and the relative implementation has been written in Qibo, an open-source software suite to simulate quantum circuits with the ability to interface with quantum hardware. The topic of inequalities allows not only to introduce undergraduate or graduate students to crucial theoretical issues in quantum mechanics -- like entanglement, correlations, hidden variables, non-locality --, but also to practically put hands on tools to implement a real simulation, where statistical aspects and noise coming from current quantum chips also come into play.</description>

      <title>Evolving Hard Maximum Cut Instances for Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12012v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms, such as the Recursive Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (RQAOA), have become increasingly popular, offering promising avenues for employing Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum devices to address challenging combinatorial optimization tasks like the maximum cut problem. In this study, we utilize an evolutionary algorithm equipped with a unique fitness function. This approach targets hard maximum cut instances within the latent space of a Graph Autoencoder, identifying those that pose significant challenges or are particularly tractable for RQAOA, in contrast to the classic Goemans and Williamson algorithm. Our findings not only delineate the distinct capabilities and limitations of each algorithm but also expand our understanding of RQAOA's operational limits. Furthermore, the diverse set of graphs we have generated serves as a crucial benchmarking asset, emphasizing the need for more advanced algorithms to tackle combinatorial optimization challenges. Additionally, our results pave the way for new avenues in graph generation research, offering exciting opportunities for future explorations.</description>

      <title>Two-media laser threshold magnetometry: A magnetic-field-dependent laser threshold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08466v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond are a promising platform for high-precision magnetometry. In contrast to the use of spontaneous emission in a number of NV-magnetometers, laser threshold magnetometry (LTM) exploits stimulated emission of NV centers by placing an NV-doped diamond inside an optical cavity. The NV laser system is predicted to reach a high magnetic contrast and strong coherent signal strength, leading to an improved magnetic field sensitivity combined with a high linearity. Here, we consider a two-media setup where the cavity additionally includes a vertical external cavity surface emitting laser. This optically active material compensates cavity losses at 750 nm while still allowing for magnetic-field-dependent effects from the NV-diamond. We demonstrate a magnetic-field-dependent laser threshold and investigate the effects of pump laser induced absorption of the diamond. The experimental data is supported by an analytical simulation based on a rate model. Furthermore, we derive a generalized formula to compute the magnetic field sensitivity in the regime of high contrast yielding 33.79(23) pT/$\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$ for the present setup. Simulations with an optimized diamond suggest that values down to 4.9 fT/$\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$ are possible.</description>
