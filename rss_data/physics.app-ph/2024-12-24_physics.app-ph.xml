      <title>All-Angle Nonlocal Metasurfaces on Demand: Universal Realization of Normal Susceptibilities via Multilayered Printed-Circuit-Board (PCB) Cascades</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Embedding normal susceptibilities in metasurfaces (MS), in tandem with their tangential counterparts, greatly enriches their spatial dispersion. Particularly, judicious siphoning of the microscopic nonlocality associated with such enhanced meta-atoms facilitates global control over the MS response across the entire angular range, specifically at challenging near-grazing scenarios. In this paper, we introduce a rigorous closed-form methodology to realize such intricate mixtures of tangential and normal components via a highly practical platform -- printed-circuit-board- (PCB) compatible cascaded admittance sheets. To this end, we derive a universal all-angular link between this MS-level composite, which leverages macroscopic nonlocality of multiple reflections, to its underlying meta-atom-level susceptibilities. We demonstrate this scheme by devising a PCB all-angle-transparent generalized Huygens' MS radome and an all-angle perfect-magnetic-conductor (PMC) PCB MS. Validated in simulation and experiment, our results pave the path toward a new insightful paradigm for studying and engineering nonlocal metadevices, e.g., optical analog computers and spaceplates.</description>

      <title>Exponential Tethers for Accelerated Space Elevator Deployment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An exponential space elevator is a space elevator with a tether cross-section that varies exponentially with altitude. With such an elevator it is possible to reel in tether material at one end of the elevator while reeling out at the other end, without changing the overall taper profile. I show how to use this property to build up or clone a space elevator much more efficiently than with standard climber-based methods.</description>

      <title>A Fast Inverse Design Method for Multilayered, Multiport Pixelated Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a fast inverse design framework for complex multilayered, multiport pixelated surfaces - a class of structures largely unexplored in current research. Leveraging a method-of-moments (MoM) electromagnetic (EM) solver, the framework enables the rapid synthesis of pixelated device designs. A novel matrix reconstruction technique, based on pre-labeling matrix entries as "inter-pixel" or "inner-pixel," accelerates simulations for each variation of the pixelated structure. To mitigate the cubic increase in computation time associated with additional layers, GPU acceleration is employed. Further enhancing convergence speed, a stochastic multi-pixel flipping search algorithm is integrated into the framework. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated through the design of a diplexer achieving a -3-dB bandwidth for one channel spanning 5.23-5.94 GHz and another covering 6.17-7.15 GHz, validated by a full-wave solver.</description>

      <title>Development of large Micromegas readout planes for experiments searching for rare events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16313v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The use of Time Projection Chambers (TPCs) in particle physics experiments has been growing since their invention, reaching sizes equivalent to buildings (ALICE or ATLAS at CERN). However, their application in another class of experiments, commonly referred to as rare event experiments, has been more recent.
  This work focuses on two such experiments aimed at searching for rare events: the search for neutrinoless double beta decay (PandaX-III experiment) and the search for WIMPs (TREX-DM experiment). Both utilize a large-sized gaseous TPC, necessitating that the corresponding readout plane is also large.
  Both also employ microbulk Micromegas readout planes. This technology has become established in recent years and is continuously improving. Due to the size limitation during manufacturing and the concurrent increase in the size of double beta experiments, there arose a need to develop a tiled readout plane, using a mosaic of modules with microbulk Micromegas, conforming the first part of this thesis, in the context of the PandaX-III experiment. The second part, featuring a single readout plane of 25 x 25 cm2 installed in TREX-DM, focuses on the specifications that define a Micromegas and its response in a high-pressure gaseous detector.
  Additionally, during the work on TREX-DM, the need to reduce the energy threshold of the experiment emerged, leading to the development of another composite readout plane, the GEM-Micromegas system, in which a GEM specifically manufactured for this system was installed above the Micromegas. Finally, leveraging the development of the Micromegas for TREX-DM, a new gaseous detector for the detection of surface alpha particles, called AlphaCAMM, is planned, designed, and implemented, addressing all the requirements of a low-background detector with a projection beyond the TREX-DM experiment.</description>

      <title>Modeling the Dynamics of Sub-Millisecond Electroadhesive Engagement and Release Times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electroadhesion is an electrically controllable switchable adhesive commonly used in soft robots and haptic user interfaces. It can form strong bonds to a wide variety of surfaces at low power consumption. However, electroadhesive clutches in the literature engage to and release from substrates several orders of magnitude slower than a traditional electrostatic model would predict, limiting their usefulness in high-bandwidth applications. We develop a novel electromechanical model for electroadhesion, factoring in polarization dynamics and contact mechanics between the dielectric and substrate. We show in simulation and experimentally how different design parameters affect the engagement and release times of electroadhesive clutches to metallic substrates. In particular, we find that higher drive frequencies and narrower substrate aspect ratios enable significantly faster dynamics. We demonstrate designs with engagement times under 15 us and release times as low as 875 us, which are 10x and 17.1x faster, respectively, than the best times found in prior literature.</description>

      <title>Black GeSn on Silicon for Enhanced Short-Wave Infrared Detection and Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16898v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sensitive and cost-effective Group-IV short-wave infrared (SWIR) photodetectors (PDs), compatible with complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) processes, are crucial for various emerging applications. Here, we developed a black GeSn thin-film PD on silicon, optimised for efficient SWIR photodetection and imaging. Incorporating Sn into the Ge layer effectively extended the photodetection range to 1960 nm. The blackening of the GeSn surface resulted in a substantial reduction of reflection loss across a broad spectral range of 1200-2200 nm. Furthermore, the responsivity experienced a remarkable increase of 1.45 times through reduced reflection loss and carrier multiplication by the carrier ionization. The black GeSn surface significantly boosts the detectivity, enhances the wide-angle SWIR photodetection, and improves the quality of the resultant images. This demonstration heralds a new era for CMOS-compatible, cost-effective, high-performance black GeSn PDs and imagers for a wide range of applications in the underexplored SWIR region.</description>

      <title>X-Ray-Driven Photon Bunching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16975v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hanbury Brown and Twiss (HBT) interferometry is a milestone experiment that transformed our understanding of the nature of light. The concept was demonstrated in 1956 to measure the radii of stars through photon coincidence detection. This form of coincidence detection later became a cornerstone of modern quantum optics. Here we connect HBT interferometry to the physics of scintillation, the process of spontaneous light emission upon excitation by high-energy particles, such as x-rays. Our work reveals intrinsic photon bunching in the scintillation process, which we utilize to elucidate its underlying light emission mechanisms. Specifically, g^((2) ) ({\tau}) enables the quantitative extraction of scintillation lifetime and light yield, showing their dependence on temperature and X-ray flux as well. This approach provides a characterization method that we benchmark on a wide gamut of scintillators, including rare-earth-doped garnets and perovskite nanocrystals. Our method is particularly important for nano- and micro-scale scintillators, whose properties are challenging to quantify by conventional means: We extract the scintillation properties in perovskite nanocrystals of only a few hundreds of nanometers, observing strong photon bunching (g^((2) ) (0)&gt;50). Our research paves the way for broader use of photon-coincidence measurement and methods from quantum optics in studying materials with complex optical properties in extremes regions of the electromagnetic spectrum.</description>

      <title>Multispectral Polarization-Insensitive Graphene/Silicon Guided Mode Resonance Active Metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17177v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate advanced CMOS-compatible Graphene/Silicon active metasurfaces based on guided-mode resonance filters. The simulated results show a high extinction ratio (&gt;25 dB), narrow linewidth (~1.5 nm @1550 nm), quality factor of Q~1000, and polarization-insensitive operation. By taking advantage of graphene broadband absorption, we present a multispectral operation in the MIR using simple geometrical scaling rules. We further showcase that the same device architecture can be employed for thermo-optic tuning using graphene as an integrated microheater. Our work contributes to the development of advanced broadband silicon-based active metasurfaces for tunable spectral filters and laser mirrors, optical switches, modulators, and sensors.</description>

      <title>Franck-Condon electron emission from polar semiconductor photocathodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17207v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A presented analytical formulation of (optical)phonon-mediated and momentum-resonant Franck-Condon emission of photoexcited electrons from polar semiconductors is shown to be very consistent with (i) the observed emission properties of a Cesiated GaAs(001) photocathode at 808nm [J. Phys. D: Appl. Phys. 54, 205301 (2021)] and (ii) the measured spectral emission properties of a GaN(0001) photocathode from just below its bandgap energy to 5eV. The theoretical analysis in the parabolic band approximation predicts the form of both the quantum efficiency and mean transverse energy of photoemission as a function of the photocathode's electron affinity and the electron temperature in the vicinity of its emission face. The good agreement between theory and experimental data also suggests that sub-10nm rms surface roughness effects are not significant for polar semiconductor photocathodes.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Superconducting Properties of Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta}$ Films with sub-50-nm Thickness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Few-unit cell thick Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta}$ (Bi-2212) layers have recently attracted much interest due to their extreme anisotropy and two-dimensional superconductivity, although they are typically susceptible to ambient conditions. In this study, we report on thin films approximately 13 unit cells thick that are stable in air, exhibit high anisotropy, and demonstrate extraordinarily high critical currents. By examining the superconducting transition under magnetic fields applied in both out-of-plane and in-plane orientations, we estimate key parameters such as pinning potentials, coherence lengths, London penetration depth, anisotropy factor, and the Ginzburg-Landau parameter. The volume pinning force is better described by a model incorporating an exponential decay term attributed to pronounced thermally-assisted flux flow. The Hall effect in the Bi-2212 films exhibits an extensive anomaly with a double sign change that may challenge existing theoretical explanations for this poorly understood phenomenon in copper-oxide superconductors.</description>

      <title>Bismuth doping induced enhancement of the spin-orbit coupling strength in the prototype dilute ferromagnetic semiconductor (Ga,Mn)As: a review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17473v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extensive studies on the impact of bismuth incorporation into the (Ga,Mn)As prototype dilute ferromagnetic semiconductor (DFS) on its structural, magnetic and magnetotransport properties are summarized in this review. Thin epitaxial layers of the quaternary (Ga,Mn)(Bi,As) compound, containing up to 1% Bi and 6% Mn atoms, and the reference ternary (Ga,Mn)As compound, have been grown under either a compressive or tensile biaxial misfit strain by the low-temperature molecular-beam epitaxy technique with precisely optimized growth conditions. The high-resolution X-ray diffractometry measurements and transmission electron microscopy imaging of cross-sections across the sample interfaces have evidenced for high structural perfection of the DFS layers and sharp interfaces with the substrate. An addition of bismuth into the layers causes a small decrease in their ferromagnetic Curie temperature and a distinct increase in the coercive fields, as revealed by the superconducting quantum interference device magnetometry investigations. Most of all, the incorporation of a small atomic fraction of heavy Bi atoms, substituting As atoms in the layer, predominantly enhances the spin-orbit coupling strength in its valence band, considerably affecting electromagnetic properties of the layers. Investigations of magnetotransport properties of the DFS layers, performed on micro-Hall-bars prepared from the layers using electron-beam lithography patterning, reveal, as a result of Bi addition to the layers, significantly enhanced magnitudes of magnetoresistance, anomalous and planar Hall effects as well as the spin-orbit torque effect. The latter effect is of special interest for applications to the next generation non-volatile data storage and logic spintronic devices, utilizing electrically controlled magnetization reversal.</description>

Abstract: We report room temperature heterodyne detection of a quantum cascade laser beaten with a local oscillator on a unipolar quantum photodetector in two different atmospheric windows, at 4.8 $\mu$m and 9 $\mu$m. A noise equivalent power of few pW is measured by employing an active stabilization technique in which the local oscillator and the signal are locked in phase. The measured heterodyne noise equivalent power is six orders of magnitude lower than that obtained with direct detection.</description>

      <title>Thermo-optic tuning of directional infrared emissivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tuning the spatial extent of directional thermal emission across an arbitrary, and fixed spectral bandwidth is a fundamentally enabling capability for a range of emerging applications such as thermophotovoltaics, thermal imaging, and radiative cooling. However, previous experimental demonstrations were limited to narrow bandwidths, and the resonance frequency itself changed significantly as a function of the reconfigured directional response. Here, we present a thermally reconfigurable metamaterial platform demonstrate thermo-optic tuning of directional infrared emissivity using InAs-based gradient ENZ materials , functioning as a broadband directional thermal emitters whose angular extent of "thermal beaming", and thus its angular selectivity, can be gradually modified reconfigured via thermal free-carrier effects. We experimentally demonstrate two emitters achievingexhibiting a 5{\deg} and 10{\deg} increase in theeir angular extent of strongof their directional emissivity in the p- polarization across a prescribed, broad wavelength range of operation (12.5 to 15{\mu}m), for moderate temperatures below 400 K. Central to this capability is the decoupling of the angular and spectral response over the entire spectral emissivity bandwidth.Temperature-driven control of directional emissivity offers a new mode of post-fabrication control of radiative heat transfer that may in turn enable novel device functionalities.</description>

Abstract: Decades after being replaced with digital platforms, analogue computing has experienced a surging interest following developments in metamaterials and intricate fabrication techniques. Specifically, wave-based analogue computers which impart spatial transformations on an incident wavefront, commensurate with a desired mathematical operation, have gained traction owing to their ability to directly encode the input in its unprocessed form, bypassing analogue-to-digital conversion. While promising, these systems are inherently limited to single-task configurations. Their inability to concurrently perform multiple tasks, or compute in parallel, represents a major hindrance to advancing conceptual mechanical devices with broader computational capabilities. In here, we present a first attempt to simultaneously process independent computational tasks within the same architected structure. By breaking time invariance in a set of metasurface building blocks, multiple frequency-shifted beams are self-generated which absorb notable energy amounts from the fundamental signal. The onset of these tunable harmonics, enables distinct computational tasks to be assigned to different independent "channels", effectively allowing an analogue mechanical computer to multitask.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Radiation Hardness of InAs/GaAs Quantum Dot Lasers for Space Communication</title>

Abstract: Semiconductor lasers have great potential for space laser communication. However, excessive radiation in space can cause laser failure. In principle, quantum dot (QD) lasers are more radiation-resistant than traditional semiconductor lasers because of their superior carrier confinement and smaller active regions. However, the multifaceted nature of radiation effects on QDs resulted in ongoing controversies. Comprehensive testing under simulated space conditions is also necessary to validate their performance. In this work, we conducted radiation tests on various In(Ga)As/GaAs QD and quantum well (QW) materials and devices. Our results revealed that InAs/GaAs QDs with filling factors greater than 50% exhibit greater radiation hardness than those below 50%. Furthermore, most InAs/GaAs QDs showed superior radiation resistance compared to InGaAs/GaAs QW when exposed to low proton fluences of 1E11 and 1E12 cm-2, resulting from radiation-induced defects. The linewidth enhancement factor (LEF) of well-designed QD lasers remains remarkably stable and close to zero, even under proton irradiation at a maximum fluence of 7E13 cm-2, owing to their inherent insensitivity to irradiation-induced defects. These QD lasers demonstrate an exceptional average relative intensity noise (RIN) level of -162 dB/Hz, with only a 1 dB/Hz increase in RIN observed at the highest fluence, indicating outstanding stability. Furthermore, the lasers exhibit remarkable robustness against optical feedback, sustaining stable performance even under a feedback strength as high as -3.1 dB. These results highlight the significant potential of QD lasers for space laser communication applications, where high reliability and resilience to radiation and environmental perturbations are critical.</description>

      <title>Non-locality detection in nano-semiconductors based on lagging models</title>

Abstract: As the transistors and consequently the chips are getting smaller, the accurate investigation of heat transport at micro/nanoscale, becomes an important issue of concern. This is due to an increase in the energy consumption and the leakage currents as a result of the miniaturization which requires taking care of the thermal behavior to make sure that the device is working in the threshold temperature regime. The current work deals with a two-dimensional framework, incorporating the nonlocality in space, for more accurate investigation of the nanoscale heat transport using the lower computational cost phenomenological macroscopical Dual Phase Lag (DPL) method. The non dimensional non-locality parameter {\gamma}, which indicates the strength of the non-locality, is embedded through the modified DPL model named as nonlocal DPL. It is obtained that for the two-dimensional silicon transistor, the {\gamma} parameter in x and y direction has the same value and like its behavior at one-dimension, is linearly dependent on the Knudsen number, being 1.5 for Kn=10 and 0.015 for Kn=0.1. Also, the phase lagging ratio, B, is found to be 0.08. It should be mentioned that the non-locality effect is more pronounced for smaller systems with higher Knudsen number in which the non-Fourier behavior is more evident but contemplating the non-locality parameter in systems with lower Knudsen number, makes the results more precise. In brief, it is confirmed that taking into account the {\gamma} parameter is noteworthy for accurately predicting the thermal behavior in micro/nano scale systems using the classical macroscopical methods.</description>

      <title>Overcoming the fundamental limit of quantum transduction via intraband entanglement</title>

Abstract: A quantum transducer converts an input signal to an output probe at a distant frequency band while maintaining the quantum information with high fidelity, which is crucial for quantum networking and distributed quantum sensing and computing. In terms of microwave-optical quantum transduction, the state-of-the-art quantum transducers suffer low transduction efficiency from weak nonlinear coupling, wherein increasing pump power to enhance efficiency inevitably leads to thermal noise from heating. Moreover, we reveal that the efficiency-bandwidth product of a cavity electro-optical or electro-optomechanical transducer is fundamentally limited by pump power and nonlinear coupling coefficient, irrespective of cavity engineering efforts. To overcome this fundamental limit, we propose to noiselessly boost the transduction efficiency by consuming intraband entanglement (e.g., microwave-microwave or optical-optical entanglement in the case of microwave-optical transduction). Via a squeezer-coupler-antisqueezer sandwich structure, the protocol enhances the transduction efficiency to unity in the ideal lossless case, given an arbitrarily weak pump and nonlinear coupling. In practical cavity systems, our entanglement-assisted protocol surpasses the non-assisted fundamental limit of the efficiency-bandwidth product and reduces the threshold cooperativity for positive quantum capacity by a factor proportional to two-mode squeezing gain. Given a fixed cooperativity, our approach increases the broadband quantum capacity by orders of magnitude. The entanglement-assisted advantage is robust to ancilla loss and cavity detuning.</description>

      <title>Laser wakefield acceleration of ions with a transverse flying focus</title>

Abstract: The extreme electric fields created in high-intensity laser-plasma interactions could generate energetic ions far more compactly than traditional accelerators. Despite this promise, laser-plasma accelerators have remained stagnant at maximum ion energies of 100 MeV/nucleon for the last twenty years. The central challenge is the low charge-to-mass ratio of ions, which has precluded one of the most successful approaches used for electrons: laser wakefield acceleration. Here we show that a laser pulse with a focal spot that moves transverse to the laser propagation direction enables wakefield acceleration of ions to GeV energies in underdense plasma. Three-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations demonstrate that this relativistic-intensity "transverse flying focus" can trap ions in a comoving electrostatic pocket, producing a monoenergetic collimated ion beam. With a peak intensity of $10^{20}\,$W/cm$^2$ and an acceleration distance of $0.44\,$cm, we observe a proton beam with $23.1\,$pC charge, $1.6\,$GeV peak energy, and $3.7\,$% relative energy spread. This approach allows for compact high-repetition-rate production of high-energy ions, highlighting the capability of more generalized spatio-temporal pulse shaping to address open problems in plasma physics.</description>

      <title>Tailoring MBE Growth of c-Mn3Sn Directly on MgO (111): From Islands to Film</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15442v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present our study of (0001) oriented Mn$_3$Sn (c-Mn$_3$Sn) thin films synthesized directly on an MgO (111) substrate via molecular beam epitaxy. We identify a growth window where Mn$_3$Sn growth can be controlled through slight adjustments of the Mn flux, achieving either $\mu$m$^2$-sized high crystalline-quality islands or an almost completely continuous film. High-resolution X-ray diffraction results indicate that both films are highly (0001) oriented. The atomic resolution images show clear film-substrate interfaces displaying an epitaxial relationship. Scanning precession electron diffraction measurements reveal that the island featured sample has highly crystallized Mn$_3$Sn. The sample featuring a high continuity exhibits defects in some areas but retains the dominant Mn$_3$Sn structure. This work demonstrates a potential method for synthesizing high crystalline-quality Mn$_3$Sn films with substantial coverage, facilitating the study of Mn3Sn films without the influence of an additional buffer layer and promoting their application in integrated spintronics.</description>
