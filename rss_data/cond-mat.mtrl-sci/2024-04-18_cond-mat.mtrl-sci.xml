      <title>Ligand Induced Size-Dependent Circular Dichroism in Quantum Dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent experiments have probed the chiral properties of semiconductor nanocrystal (NC) quantum dots (QDs), but understanding the circular dichroism lineshape, excitonic features, and ligand induction mechanism remains a challenge. We propose an atomistic pseudopotential method to model chiral ligand passivated QDs, computing circular dichroism (CD) spectra for CdSe QDs (2.6 - 3.8 nm). We find strong agreement between calculated and measured spectra, predicting consistent bisignate lineshapes with decreasing CD magnitude as size increases. Our analysis reveals the origin of bisignate lineshapes, arising from nondegenerate excitons with opposing angular momenta. We also explore the impact of chiral ligand orientation on QD surfaces, observing changes in optical activity magnitude and sign. This orientation sensitivity offers means to distinguish ordered from disordered ligand configurations, facilitating the study of order-disorder transitions at ligand-QD interfaces.</description>

      <title>Superior Polymeric Gas Separation Membrane Designed by Explainable Graph Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gas separation using polymer membranes promises to dramatically drive down the energy, carbon, and water intensity of traditional thermally driven separation, but developing the membrane materials is challenging. Here, we demonstrate a novel graph machine learning (ML) strategy to guide the experimental discovery of synthesizable polymer membranes with performances simultaneously exceeding the empirical upper bounds in multiple industrially important gas separation tasks. Two predicted candidates are synthesized and experimentally validated to perform beyond the upper bounds for multiple gas pairs (O2/N2, H2/CH4, and H2/N2). Notably, the O2/N2 separation selectivity is 1.6-6.7 times higher than existing polymer membranes. The molecular origin of the high performance is revealed by combining the inherent interpretability of our ML model, experimental characterization, and molecule-level simulation. Our study presents a unique explainable ML-experiment combination to tackle challenging energy material design problems in general, and the discovered polymers are beneficial for industrial gas separation.</description>

      <title>Strain-dependent Insulating State and Kondo Effect in Epitaxial SrIrO$_{3}$ Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The large spin-orbit coupling in iridium oxides plays a significant role in driving novel physical behaviors, including emergent phenomena in the films and heterostructures of perovskite and Ruddlesden-Popper iridates. In this work, we study the role of epitaxial strain on the electronic behavior of thin SrIrO$_3$ films. We find that compressive epitaxial strain leads to metallic transport behavior, but a slight tensile strain shows gapped behavior. Temperature-dependent resistivity measurements are used to examine different behaviors in films as a function of strain. We find Kondo contributions to the resistivity, with stronger effects in films that are thinner and under less compressive epitaxial strain. These results show the potential to tune SrIrO$_3$ into Kondo insulating states and open possibilities for a quantum critical point that can be controlled with strain in epitaxial films.</description>

      <title>Interplay between magnetic and lattice excitations and emergent multiple phase transitions in MnPSe3-xSx</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The intricate interplay between spin and lattice degrees of freedom in two-dimensional magnetic materials plays a pivotal role in modifying their magnetic characteristics, engendering hybrid quasiparticles, and implementing functional devices. Herein, we present our comprehensive and in-depth investigations on magnetic and lattice excitations of MnPSe3-xSx (x = 0, 0.5, and 1.5) alloys, utilizing temperature- and polarization-dependent Raman scattering. Our experimental results reveal the occurrence of multiple phase transitions, evidenced by notable changes in phonon self-energy and the appearance or splitting of phonon modes. These emergent phases are tied to the development of long and short-range spin-spin correlations, as well as to spin reorientations or magnetic instabilities. Our analysis of two-magnon excitations as a function of temperature and composition showcases their hybridization with phonons whose degree weakens with increasing x. Moreover, the suppression of spin-dependent phonon intensity in chemically most-disordered MnPSe3-xSx (x = 1.5) suggests that chalcogen substitution offers a control knob of tuning spin and phonon dynamics by modulating concurrently superexchange pathways and a degree of trigonal distortions.</description>

      <title>Texture tomography, a versatile framework to study crystalline texture in 3D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The crystallographic texture is a key organization feature of many technical and biological materials. In these materials, especially hierarchically structured ones, the preferential alignment of the nano constituents is heavily influencing the macroscopic behaviour of the material. In order to study local crystallographic texture with both high spatial and angular resolution, we developed Texture tomography (TexTOM). This approach allows to model the diffraction data of polycrystalline materials by using the full reciprocal space of the ensemble of crystals and describe the texture in each voxel via a orientation distribution function. This means, it provides 3D reconstructions of the local texture by measuring the probabilities of all crystal orientations. The TexTOM approach addresses limitations associated with existing models: It correlates the intensities from several Bragg reflections, thus reduces ambiguities resulting from symmetry. Further, it yields quantitative probability distributions of local real space crystal orientations without further assumptions on the sample structure. Finally, its efficient mathematical formulation enables reconstructions faster than the time-scale of the experiment. In this manuscript, we present the mathematical model, the inversion strategy and its current experimental implementation. We show characterizations of simulated data as well as experimental data obtained from a synthetic, inorganic model sample, the silica-witherite biomorph. In conclusion, Tex-TOM provides a versatile framework to reconstruct 3D quantitative texture information for polycrystalline samples. In this way, it opens the door for unprecedented insights into the nanostructural makeup of natural and technical materials.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Local Symmetry Fluctuations of Electron Density in Halide Perovskites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metal halide perovskites have emerged as an exciting class of materials for applications in solar energy harvesting, optical devices, catalysis, and other photophysical applications. Many of the exciting properties of halide perovskites are tied to their soft, dynamic, and anharmonic lattice. In particular, the precise coupling between anharmonic lattice dynamics and electronic fluctuations is not completely understood. To build an understanding of this coupling, we use ab initio molecular dynamics simulations supplemented by the calculation of maximally localized Wannier functions to carry out a dynamic group theory analysis of local electron density fluctuations and how these fluctuations are coupled to lattice fluctuations in the model inorganic halide perovskite CsSnBr3. We detail symmetry-dependent couplings between vibrational modes, including octahedral tilting. Importantly, we suggest that the large anharmonicity of some of the vibrational modes in CsSnBr3 result from electron rotation--nuclear translation coupling, in analogy to rotation--translation coupling effects in molecular plastic crystals. We also identify electronic fluctuations in the Cs cation that couple to distortions in the surrounding Sn-Br cubic coordination environment. We anticipate that our approach and resulting insights into electronic fluctuations will aid in further understanding the role of the fluctuating lattice in determining important physical properties of halide perovskites and beyond.</description>

      <title>Photophysics of defect-passivated quasi-2D (PEA)2PbBr4 perovskite using an organic small-molecule</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 2D Ruddlesden - Popper perovskites are promising candidates for energy harvesting applications due to their tunable optical properties and excellent ambient stability. Moreover, they are solution-processable and compatible with upscalable manufacturing via various printing techniques. Unfortunately, such methods often induce large degrees of heterogeneity due to poorly controlled crystallization. Here, we address this issue by blending the well-known 2D perovskite (PEA)2PbBr4 with an organic small-molecule, namely C8-BTBT, employed as an additive with different blending ratios. Using terahertz (THz) absorption and temperature-dependent photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy techniques we observe that with the C8-BTBT additive the photophysical properties are altered while the perovskite structure in the film remains unaffected. More precisely, the inclusion of trace amounts of C8-BTBT in the hybrid films results in defect passivation at perovskite platelet boundaries and at the surfaces, as indicated by increased carrier lifetimes and substantially increased photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQY). This in turn improves the responsivity of photodetectors using the 2D perovskite as active layer. Our study highlights a straightforward strategy for fabricating high-quality 2D perovskites via large-area processing techniques.</description>

      <title>Intermolecular charge transfer enhances the performance of molecular rectifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular-scale diodes made from self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) could complement silicon-based technologies with smaller, cheaper, and more versatile devices. However, advancement of this emerging technology is limited by insufficient electronic performance exhibited by the molecular current rectifiers. We overcome this barrier by exploiting the charge-transfer state that results from co-assembling SAMs of molecules with strong electron donor and acceptor termini. We obtain a substantial enhancement in current rectification, which correlates with the degree of charge transfer, as confirmed by several complementary techniques. These findings provide a previously unexplored method for manipulating the properties of molecular electronic devices by exploiting donor/acceptor interactions. They also serve as a model test platform for the study of doping mechanisms in organic systems. Our devices have the potential for fast widespread adoption due to their low-cost processing and self-assembly onto silicon substrates, which could allow seamless integration with current technologies.</description>

      <title>Perovskite Phase Heterojunction Solar Cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern photovoltaic devices are often based on a heterojunction structure where two components with different optoelectronic properties are interfaced. The properties of each side of the junction can be tuned by either utilizing different materials (e.g. donor/acceptor) or doping (e.g. PN Si junction) or even varying their dimensionality (e.g. 3D/2D). In this work we demonstrate the concept of phase heterojunction (PHJ) solar cells by utilizing two polymorphs of the same material. We demonstrate the approach by forming $\gamma$-CsPbI3/$\beta$-CsPbI3 perovskite PHJ solar cells. We find that all of the photovoltaic parameters of the PHJ device significantly surpass those of each of the single-phase devices, resulting in a maximum power conversion efficiency of 20.1%. These improvements originate from the efficient passivation of the $\beta$-CsPbI3 by the larger bandgap $\gamma$-CsPbI3, the increase in the built-in potential of the PHJ devices enabled by the energetic alignment between the two phases and the enhanced absorption of light by the PHJ structure. The approach demonstrated here offers new possibilities for the development of photovoltaic devices based on polymorphic materials.</description>

      <title>Stress analysis of functionally graded hyperelastic variable thickness rotating annular thin disk: A semi-analytic approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Functionally graded materials (FGMs) represent a promising class of advanced materials designed with tailored microstructures to achieve optimized mechanical, thermal, and functional properties across varying gradients. The strategic integration of distinct materials within functionally graded materials offers engineers unprecedented control over properties such as strength, thermal conductivity, and corrosion resistance, enabling innovative solutions for demanding applications in aerospace, automotive, and biomedical industries. This study investigates a rotating annular thin disk with variable thickness composed of incompressible hyperelastic material, made up of functionally graded properties under large deformations. To elucidate these phenomena, a power relation is employed to delineate the changes in cross-sectional geometry m, the material property n, and the angular velocity w of hyperelastic material. Constants used for hyperelastic material are obtained from the experimental data. Equations are solved semi-analytically for different values of m, n, and w, and the values of radial stresses, tangential stresses, and elongation are calculated and compared for different conditions. Results show that thickness and FG properties have a significant impact on the behavior of disk, so that the expected behavior of the disk can be obtained by an optimal selection of the disks geometry and material properties. By selecting the optimum values for these variables, the location of maximum stress can be controlled in large deformations, thereby furnishing significance advantages in structural design and material selection.</description>

      <title>Phonon Directionality Determines the Polarization of the Band-Edge Exciton Emission in Two-Dimensional Metal Halide Perovskites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional metal-halide perovskites are highly versatile for light-driven applications due to their exceptional variety in material composition, which can be exploited for tunability of mechanical and optoelectronic properties. The band edge emission is governed by the exciton fine structure that is defined by structure and composition of both organic and inorganic layers. Moreover, electronic and elastic properties are intricately connected in these materials. Electron-phonon coupling plays a crucial role in the recombination dynamics. However, the nature of the electron-phonon coupling, as well as which kind of phonons are involved, is still under debate. Here we investigate the emission and phonon response from single two-dimensional lead-iodide microcrystals with angle-resolved polarized spectroscopy. We find an intricate dependence of the emission polarization with the vibrational directionality in the materials, which clearly reveals that several bands of the low-frequency phonons of the inorganic lead-iodide perovskite lattice play the key role in the band edge emission. Our findings demonstrate how the emission spectrum and polarization of two-dimensional layered perovskites can be designed by their material composition, which is essential for optoelectronic applications, where fine control on the spectral and structural properties of the light is desired.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic Nonsaturating Magnetoresistance Observed in HoMn$_6$Ge$_6$: A Kagome Dirac Semimetal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the magnetic and magnetotransport properties and electronic band structure of the kagome Dirac semimetal HoMn$_6$Ge$_6$. Temperature-dependent electrical resistivity demonstrates various magnetic-transition-driven anomalies. Notably, a crossover from negative to positive magnetoresistance (MR) is observed at around 150 K. While the linear nonsaturating positive MR in the low-temperature region is mainly driven by the linear Dirac-like band dispersions as predicted by the first-principles calculations, the negative MR observed in the high-temperature region is due to the spin-flop type magnetic transition. Consistent with anisotropic Fermi surface topology, we observe anisotropic magnetoresistance at low temperatures. A significant anomalous Hall effect has been noticed at high temperatures in addition to a switching of the dominant charge carrier from electron to hole at around 215 K.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the first principle calculations, we propose a boron and nitrogen cluster incorporated graphene system for efficient valley polarization. The broken spatial inversion symmetry results in high Berry curvature at K and K' valleys of the hexagonal Brillouin zone in this semiconducting system. The consideration of excitonic quasiparticles within GW approximation along with their scattering processes within many-body Bethe-Salpeter equation gives rise to an optical gap of 1.72 eV with an excitonic binding energy of 0.65 eV. Owing to the negligible intervalley scattering, the electrons in opposite valleys are selectively excited by left- and right-handed circular polarized lights, as evident from the oscillator strength calculations. Therefore, this system can exhibit circular-dichroism valley Hall effect in the presence of the in-plane electric field. Moreover, such excitonic qubits can be exploited for information processing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solid-state electrolytes mark a significant leap forward in the field of electrochemical energy storage, offering improved safety and efficiency compared to conventional liquid electrolytes. Among these, antiperovskite electrolytes, particularly those based on Li and Na, have emerged as promising candidates due to their superior ionic conductivity and straightforward synthesis processes. This study focuses on the amorphous phase of antiperovskite Na$_3$OCl, assessing its structural properties through a combination of first-principles molecular dynamics (FPMD) and machine learning interatomic potential (MLIP) simulations. Our comprehensive analysis spans models ranging from 135 to 3645 atoms, allowing for a detailed examination of X-ray and neutron structure factors, total and partial pair correlation functions, coordination numbers, and structural unit distributions. We demonstrate the minimal, albeit partially present, size effects on these structural features and validate the accuracy of the MLIP model in reproducing the intricate details of the amorphous Na$_3$OCl structure described at the FPMD level.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dual-emissive nanorods with fluorescence in both, the visible and infrared range are prepared by a combination of a CdSe-nanocrystal-seeded growth of CdS nanorods, and a successive partial Cd-to-Pb cation exchange. We show that the exchange reaction, which involves Pb halides in oleylamine, starts at the tip of the rods, leading to the formation of CdSe-dot/CdS-rod/PbS-dot nanocrystals (DRDs). Besides these DRDs, the reaction product also contains shorter nanorods and spherical quantum dots. Their fraction strongly depend on the amount of lead halide precursor and the reaction time. The reaction mechanism is investigated in detail, such that by carefully adjusting the reaction conditions, it is possible to synthesize DRDs of distinct PbS-dot sizes with yields over 95%. The resulting DRDs are crystalline and show a CdSe-fluorescence band in the visible range at 600 nm, and also a fluorescence band in the NIR at 1440 nm, resulting from the PbS part of the rods.</description>

      <title>Study of Entropy-Driven Polymorphic Stability for Aspirin Using Accurate Neural Network Interatomic Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we present a systematic computational investigation to analyze the long debated crystal stability of two well known aspirin polymorphs, labeled as Form I and Form II. Specifically, we developed a strategy to collect training configurations covering diverse interatomic interactions between representative functional groups in the aspirin crystals. Utilizing a state-of-the-art neural network interatomic potential (NNIP) model, we developed an accurate machine learning potential to simulate aspirin crystal dynamics under finite temperature conditions with $\sim$0.46 kJ/mol/molecule accuracy. Employing the trained NNIP model, we performed thermodynamic integration to assess the free energy difference between aspirin Forms I and II, accounting for the anharmonic effects in a large supercell consisting of 512 molecules. For the first time, our results convincingly demonstrated that Form I is more stable than Form II at 300 K, ranging from 0.74 to 1.83 kJ/mol/molecule, aligning with the experimental observations. Unlike the majority of previous simulations based on (quasi)harmonic approximations in a small super cell, which often found the degenerate energies between aspirin I and II, our findings underscore the importance of anharmonic effects in determining polymorphic stability ranking. Furthermore, we proposed the use of rotational degrees of freedom of methyl and ester/phenyl groups in the aspirin crystal, as characteristic motions to highlight rotational entropic contribution that favors the stability of Form I. Beyond the aspirin polymorphism, we anticipate that such entropy-driven stabilization can be broadly applicable to many other organic systems and thus our approach, suggesting our approach holds a great promise for stability studies in small molecule drug design.</description>

      <title>Nature of excitons and their ligand-mediated delocalization in nickel dihalide charge-transfer insulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10818v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The fundamental optical excitations of correlated transition-metal compounds are typically identified with multielectronic transitions localized at the transition-metal site, such as $dd$ transitions. In this vein, intense interest has surrounded the appearance of sharp, below band-gap optical transitions, i.e. excitons, within the magnetic phase of correlated Ni$^{2+}$ van der Waals magnets. The interplay of magnetic and charge-transfer insulating ground states in Ni$^{2+}$ systems raises intriguing questions on the roles of long-range magnetic order and of metal-ligand charge transfer in the exciton nature, which inspired microscopic descriptions beyond typical $dd$ excitations. Here we study the impact of charge-transfer and magnetic order on the excitation spectrum of the nickel dihalides (NiX$_2$, X $=$ Cl, Br, and I) using Ni-$L_3$ resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS). In all compounds, we detect sharp excitations, analogous to the recently reported excitons, and assign them to spin-singlet multiplets of octahedrally-coordinated Ni$^{2+}$ stabilized by intra-atomic Hund's exchange. Additionally, we demonstrate that these excitons are dispersive using momentum resolved RIXS. Our data evidence a ligand-mediated multiplet dispersion, which is tuned by the charge-transfer gap and independent of the presence of long-range magnetic order. This reveals the mechanisms governing non-local interactions of on-site $dd$ excitations with the surrounding crystal/magnetic structure, in analogy to ground state superexchange. These measurements thus establish the roles of magnetic order, self-doped ligand holes, and intersite coupling mechanisms for the properties of $dd$ excitations in charge-transfer insulators.</description>

      <title>Multiple charge-density-wave gaps in LaSbTe and CeSbTe as revealed by ultrafast spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Utilizing ultrafast time-resolved pump-probe spectroscopy measurements, we investigate the photoinduced quasiparticle dynamics of the topological materials LaSbTe and CeSbTe. In LaSbTe, the relaxation of quasiparticles is dominated by two different mechanisms: electron-phonon coupling, and phonon-assisted electron-hole recombination. Significantly, the amplitude of photoinduced reflectivity related to the former one shows two pronounced peaks at 156 K and 263 K, indicating the occurrence of two charge density wave (CDW) phase transitions. The ultrafast responses of CeSbTe share a lot of similarities with LaSbTe, and an additional CDW phase transition at 154 K is revealed in CeSbTe. However, the slower relaxation of CeSbTe exhibits an exotic behavior that deviates from the typical phonon-assisted electron-hole recombination process, probably due to the imbalance between the electron- and hole-type carriers. Unlike LaSbTe, the relaxation times of CeSbTe vary slightly with the pump power, inferring the possible participation of 4$f$ electron in the decay process. In addition, two oscillation modes around 1 THz and 3 THz are identified in both LaSbTe and CeSbTe, which are mostly likely to be coherent phonon modes. These findings unravel the existence of multiple CDW orders in LaSbTe and CeSbTe, offering insights into the underlying physics of these systems.</description>

      <title>AI-equipped scanning probe microscopy for autonomous site-specific atomic-level characterization at room temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an advanced scanning probe microscopy system enhanced with artificial intelligence (AI-SPM) designed for self-driving atomic-scale measurements. This system expertly identifies and manipulates atomic positions with high precision, autonomously performing tasks such as spectroscopic data acquisition and atomic adjustment. An outstanding feature of AI-SPM is its ability to detect and adapt to surface defects, targeting or avoiding them as necessary. It's also engineered to address typical challenges such as positional drift and tip apex atomic variations due to the thermal effect, ensuring accurate, site-specific surface analyses. Our tests under the demanding conditions of room temperature have demonstrated the robustness of the system, successfully navigating thermal drift and tip fluctuations. During these tests on the Si(111)-(7x7) surface, AI-SPM autonomously identified defect-free regions and performed a large number of current-voltage spectroscopy measurements at different adatom sites, while autonomously compensating for thermal drift and monitoring probe health. These experiments produce extensive data sets that are critical for reliable materials characterization and demonstrate the potential of AI-SPM to significantly improve data acquisition. The integration of AI into SPM technologies represents a step toward more effective, precise and reliable atomic-level surface analysis, revolutionizing materials characterization methods.</description>

      <title>Structural colors with embedded anti-counterfeit features fabricated by laser-based methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Structural colors can be induced on metals not only to fabricate logos or decorative motives but also to embed anti-counterfeit features for product protection. In this study, stainless steel (EN 1.4301) plates are colorized by growing a thin oxide layer using direct laser writing (DLW) and hidden anti-counterfeit measures are included on their surfaces by direct laser interference patterning (DLIP) processing. The periodic microstructures resulting from the DLIP treatment have a spatial period of 1 um and act as relief diffraction gratings, featuring a characteristic diffraction pattern. These microstructures are not visible to the human eye but are easily detectable upon shining a coherent beam on the surface. Furthermore, the reflectance over the visible spectrum of the colorized surfaces with and without the DLIP microtexture is measured, giving low differences in the color perception following the so-called "CIE L*a*b*" color space. Finally, a demonstrator is fabricated, in which colorized fields with and without the security features are shown.</description>

      <title>Negatively enhanced thermopower near a Van Hove singularity in electron-doped Sr$_2$RuO$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11300v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The layered perovskite Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ serves as a model material of the two-dimensional (2D) Fermi liquid but also exhibits various emergent phenomena including the non-Fermi-liquid (NFL) behavior under external perturbations such as uniaxial pressure and chemical substitutions. Here we present the thermoelectric transport of electron-doped system Sr$_{2-y}$La$_{y}$RuO$_4$, in which a filling-induced Lifshitz transition occurs at the Van Hove singularity (VHS) point of $y\approx 0.2$. We find that the sign of the low-temperature thermopower becomes negative only near the VHS point, where the NFL behavior has been observed in the earlier work. This observation is incompatible with either a numerical calculation within a constant relaxation-time approximation or a toy-model calculation for the 2D Lifshitz transition adopting an elastic carrier scattering. As a promising origin of the observed negatively enhanced thermopower, we propose a skewed NFL state, in which an inelastic scattering with a considerable odd-frequency term plays a crucial role to negatively enhance the thermopower.</description>

      <title>Nanojet Visualization and Dark-field Imaging of Optically Trapped Vaterite Capsules with Endoscopic Illumination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11303v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical responsivity grants biomedical capsules additional capabilities, promoting them towards multifunctional theragnostic nanodevices. In this endeavor, screening candidates under conditions that closely resemble in situ environments is crucial for both the initial optimization and the subsequent inspection stages of development and operation. Optical tweezers equipped with dark-field spectroscopy are among the preferable tools for nanoparticle imaging and refractometry. However, the effectiveness of conventional illumination and light collection arrangements for inspecting anisotropic complex inner composition particles is quite limited due to reduced collection angles, which can result in the omission of features in scattering diagrams. Here we introduce an endoscopic dark-field illumination scheme, where light is launched on an optically trapped particle from a single-mode fiber, immersed into a fluid cell. This arrangement disentangles illumination and collection paths, thus allowing the collection of scattered light with a very high numerical aperture. This methodology is applied to vaterite nanocapsules, which are known to possess strong anisotropic responses. Tweezer configuration allows revealing optical properties for different crystallographic orientations of vaterite, which is complex to do otherwise. Furthermore, endoscopic dark-field images reveal the emergence of polarization-dependent long-range photonic nanojets, which are capable of interacting with nearby particles, demonstrating a new pathway for nanojet image formation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11516v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exciton-phonon coupling limits the homogeneous emission linewidth of nanocrystals. Hence, a full understanding of it is crucial. In this work, we statistically investigate exciton-phonon coupling by performing single-particle spectroscopy on Zn$_{1-x}$Cd$_{x}$Se/CdS dot-in-rod nanocrystals at cryogenic temperatures ($T\approx 10~\rm{K}$). In situ cation exchange enables us to analyze different band alignments and thereby different charge-carrier distributions. We find that the relative intensities of the longitudinal optical S- and Se-type phonon replicas correlate with the charge-carrier distribution. Our experimental findings are complemented with quantum mechanical calculations within the effective mass approximation that hint at the relevance of surface charges.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11612v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kagome metals are known to host Dirac fermions and saddle point Van Hove singularities near Fermi level. With the minimal two-pocket model (Dirac cone + Van Hove singularity), we propose a semiclassical theory to explain the experimentally observed sublinear resistivity in Ni$_3$In and other Kagome metals. We derive the full semiclassical description of kinetic phenomena using Boltzmann equation, and demonstrate that internode electron-electron interaction leads to sublinear in $T$ scaling for both electrical and thermal transport at low temperatures. At higher temperatures above the Dirac node chemical potential, thermal and electric current dissipate through distinct scattering channels, making a ground for Wiedemann-Franz law violation.</description>

Abstract: While classical theory of phase transitions deals with systems where shape variation is energetically neutral, the account of rigidity can lead to the emergence of new thermodynamic features. One of them is a special type of critical points that are characteristic of phase transitions specifically in solids. We develop a general theory of such rigidity-induced critical points and illustrate the results by analyzing in detail the case of an isotropic, geometrically nonlinear solid undergoing a volumetric phase transition at zero temperature.</description>

Abstract: Cold metals have recently gained attention as a promising platform for innovative devices, such as tunnel diodes with negative differential resistance (NDR) and field-effect transistors with subthreshold swings below the thermionic limit. Recently discovered two-dimensional (2D) MA$_2$Z$_4$ (M = Ti, Zr, Hf, Nb, Ta; A = Si, Ge; Z = N, P) compounds exhibit both cold metallic and semiconducting behavior. In this work, we present a computational study of lateral heterojunction tunnel diodes based on 2D NbSi$_2$N$_4$ and HfSi$_2$N$_4$ compounds. Employing density functional theory combined with a nonequilibrium Green function method, we investigate the current-voltage ($I$-$V$) characteristics of lateral tunnel diodes with varying barrier thicknesses in both zigzag and armchair orientations. We find that tunnel diodes in the zigzag orientation exhibit significantly higher peak current densities, while those in the armchair orientation display larger peak-to-valley current ratios (PVCRs) compared to the zigzag orientation. Our findings suggest that MA$_2$Z$_4$ materials are promising candidates for realizing NDR tunnel diodes with high PVCR values, which could have potential applications in memory, logic circuits, and other electronic devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.04473v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Tamura model is a particular type of 1$^{\text{st}}$ Born approximation of the phonon-isotope scattering problem. The expression for the mode-resolved phonon-isotope scattering rates in this model, derived in 1983, is still widely used in ab initio transport calculations. While the original work emphasized its applicability to low-energy acoustic phonons only, it has, nevertheless, been also applied to optical phonons in the field of phonon transport. The model has the salient feature of being a perturbation theory on top of a virtual crystal background. As such, this approach does not correspond to the proper methodology for solving the phonon-substitution defect problem in the respective limit. Here, we explore three avenues to go beyond the Tamura model and carry out calculations on a set of common materials to compare the different approaches. This work allows a systematic improvement of the treatment of phonon-isotope scattering in ab initio phonon transport, while unifying it with the general phonon-substitution scattering problem.</description>

      <title>Oxygen tilt-driven polar super-orders in BiFeO3-based superlattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.07954v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ferroelectric-dielectric superlattices have attracted renewed interest for their ability to frustrate the polar order, leading to the emergence of exotic polar textures. The electrostatic depolarization, thought to be responsible for the complex polar textures in these superlattices can be alleviated by replacing the dielectric layer with a metallic one. One would thus expect that a close to uniform polarization state be recovered in the ferroelectric layer. However, here we show, using Density Functional Theory calculations, that antipolar motions may still appear in superlattices combining multiferroic BiFeO3 and metallic SrRuO3 perovskite layers. We find that a complex oxygen octahedra tilt order, a so-called nanotwin phase, exists in BiFeO3/SrRuO3 superlattices and competes with a more conventional phase. It leads to a doubling of the chemical period along the out-of-plane direction, owing to the presence of an oxygen octahedra tilt wave pattern and antipolar motions caused by trilinear energy couplings. We also show that out-of-plane polar displacements in the BiFeO3 layer may reverse the (anti)polar displacements thanks to a strong quadrilinear coupling term. The oxygen tilt-driven couplings identified here reveal new ways to engineer and control polar displacements in superlattice based polar metals and hybrid improper (anti)ferroelectrics.</description>

      <title>Computational modelling of complex multiphase behavior of environmentally-friendly materials for sustainable technological solutions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07826v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study presents a computational framework to investigate and predict the complicated multiphase properties of eco-friendly lead-free piezoelectric materials, which are crucial for sustainable technological progress. Although their electromechanical properties vary by phase, lead-free piezoelectric materials show a considerable thermo-electromechanical response. Lead-free materials such as Bi$_{0.5}$Na$_{0,5}$TiO$_{3}$ (BNT) and other BNT-type piezoelectric materials transition to rhombohedral (R3c), orthorhombic (Pnma), tetragonal (P4bm), and cubic (Cc) phases with temperature variation. These phases are determined by the symmetry and alignment of the ferroelectric domains. Multiple phases can occur simultaneously under specific thermal, electrical, and mechanical conditions, leading in complex multiphase behaviour. These materials' performance must be assessed by studying such behaviour. This study uses Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire theory to simulate material micro-domain phase transitions. The computational model for BNT-type piezoelectric material covers temperature-induced ferroelectric domain switching and phase transitions. Therefore, the developed computational approach will assist us in better understanding the influence of these materials' complex multiphase behaviour on creating sustainable solutions with green technologies.</description>

      <title>Efficient Electrochemical CO2 Reduction Reaction over Cu-decorated Biphenylene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10409v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Developing efficient electrocatalysts for CO$_2$ reduction into value-added products is crucial for the green economy. Inspired by the recent synthesis of Biphenylene (BPH), we have systematically investigated pristine, defective, and Cu-decorated BPH as an electrocatalyst for the CO$_2$ reduction reactions (CRR). Our first-principles calculations show the CO$_2$ molecules weakly interact with the pristine BPH surface while defective BPH facilitates the CO$_2$ adsorption with a binding energy ($E_b$) of -3.22 eV, indicating the detrimental process for the CRR on the surface of both systems. Furthermore, we have investigated the binding energy and kinetic stability of Cu-decorated BPH as a single-atom-catalyst (SAC). The molecular dynamics simulations confirm the kinetic stability, revealing that the Cu-atom avoids agglomeration under low metal dispersal conditions. The CO$_2$ molecule gets adsorbed horizontally on the Cu-BPH surface with $E_b$ of -0.52 eV. The CRR mechanism is investigated using two pathways beginning with two different initial intermediate states, formate ($\mathrm{^*OCOH}$) and the carboxylic ($\mathrm{^*COOH}$) pathways. The formate pathway confirms the conversion of $\mathrm{^*OCOH}$ to $\mathrm{^*HCOOH}$ with the rate-limiting potential ($U_L$) of 0.57 eV for the production of HCOOH, while for the carboxylic pathway, the conversion of $\mathrm{^*COH}$ to $\mathrm{^*CHOH}$ has $U_L$ of 0.49 eV for the production of CH$_3$OH. We have also investigated the effect of protons using charged hydrogen pseudopotential, which hints towards the possible formation of CH$_3$OH as fuel. Our findings propose Cu-BPH as an efficient single-atom catalyst for CO$_2$ conversion compared to the well-known Cu metal.</description>
