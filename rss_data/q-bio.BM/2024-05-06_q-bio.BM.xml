      <title>AntiFold: Improved antibody structure-based design using inverse folding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The design and optimization of antibodies requires an intricate balance across multiple properties. Protein inverse folding models, capable of generating diverse sequences folding into the same structure, are promising tools for maintaining structural integrity during antibody design. Here, we present AntiFold, an antibody-specific inverse folding model, fine-tuned from ESM-IF1 on solved and predicted antibody structures. AntiFold outperforms existing inverse folding tools on sequence recovery across complementarity-determining regions, with designed sequences showing high structural similarity to their solved counterpart. It additionally achieves stronger correlations when predicting antibody-antigen binding affinity in a zero-shot manner, while performance is augmented further when including antigen information. AntiFold assigns low probabilities to mutations that disrupt antigen binding, synergizing with protein language model residue probabilities, and demonstrates promise for guiding antibody optimization while retaining structure-related properties. AntiFold is freely available under the BSD 3-Clause as a web server at https://opig.stats.ox.ac.uk/webapps/antifold/ and and pip installable package at https://github.com/oxpig/AntiFold</description>

      <title>Quality-Weighted Vendi Scores And Their Application To Diverse Experimental Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02449v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Experimental design techniques such as active search and Bayesian optimization are widely used in the natural sciences for data collection and discovery. However, existing techniques tend to favor exploitation over exploration of the search space, which causes them to get stuck in local optima. This ``collapse" problem prevents experimental design algorithms from yielding diverse high-quality data. In this paper, we extend the Vendi scores -- a family of interpretable similarity-based diversity metrics -- to account for quality. We then leverage these quality-weighted Vendi scores to tackle experimental design problems across various applications, including drug discovery, materials discovery, and reinforcement learning. We found that quality-weighted Vendi scores allow us to construct policies for experimental design that flexibly balance quality and diversity, and ultimately assemble rich and diverse sets of high-performing data points. Our algorithms led to a 70%-170% increase in the number of effective discoveries compared to baselines.</description>
