      <title>Entropic Collapse and Extreme First-Passage Times in Discrete Ballistic Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the extreme first-passage statistics of N non-interacting random walkers on discrete, hierarchical networks. By distinguishing between "injection-limited" and "bulk-limited" transport, we identify a novel universality class of extreme value statistics that arises in geometries dominated by source traps (e.g., the Comet graph). In this regime, the distribution of the minimum arrival time does not converge to any of the classical generalized extreme value distributions. Instead, it follows a discrete, hard-edge distribution determined by the properties of the source. We analytically derive the asymptotic behavior of this class and validate our predictions against Monte Carlo simulations. Crucially, we identify the mechanism of "entropic collapse" that destroys this scaling in bulk-dominated geometries like the Bethe lattice, where the phase space of delayed paths diverges with distance. This work establishes a rigorous topological condition -- the invariance of the entropic penalty for detours -- that separates quantum-like, discrete extreme value statistics from classical bulk transport limits.</description>

      <title>Incremental equations in curvature-dependent surface elasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a general incremental framework for hyperelastic solids whose surfaces exhibit both stretch-dependent and curvature-dependent elastic behavior. Building upon a variational formulation of curvature-dependent surface elasticity, we derive compact governing equations expressed in a coordinate-free Lagrangian setting that remain valid for arbitrary geometries. Linearization about an arbitrarily large finite deformation yields incremental bulk and surface balance laws that closely resemble the classical small-on-large theory, but are now extended to include surface-curvatureinduced stresses. The applicability of the general theory is demonstrated by analyzing the onset of periodic beading in a soft cylindrical substrate coated with a surface layer exhibiting stretching- or curvature-dependent behavior, illustrating how surface stretching and bending effects influence instability thresholds for both compressible and incompressible bulk. This unified formulation thus provides a foundation for studying stability phenomena in elasto-capillary systems where surface curvature plays a critical mechanical role.</description>

      <title>Boxed UC plane partitions and the two-site generalized phase model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the connection between boxed UC plane partitions and the two-site generalized phase model. By introducing two maps, we investigate the representation of two-side generalized phase algebras and actions of monodromy matrix operators on basis vectors. The generating function of boxed UC plane partitions is established by the scalar product of the two-site generalized phase model, which can be expressed as products of Schur functions. It is shown that the generating function of boxed UC plane partitions is that of UC plane partitions with the double scaling limit.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Starting from the following multidimensional integrable generalizations of the heavy rigid body systems: the Euler top, the Lagrange top, the Lagrange bitop, and the totally symmetric case, we add to each of them a gyroscope. For each of the newly constructed systems, we provide a polynomial matrix Lax representation and prove Liouville integrability. We also present Zhukovskiy's geometric representation of motion of the Euler top with a gyroscope.</description>

      <title>Diffraction by a Right-Angle Dielectric Wedge: Closed-Form Solution for $\nu=\sqrt{2}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the two-dimensional time-harmonic transmission problem for an impedance-matched ($\rho=1$) right-angle dielectric wedge at refractive index ratio $\nu=sqrt(2)$, in the integrable lemniscatic configuration $(\theta_w, \nu, \rho)=(\pi/4, \sqrt(2), 1)$. Starting from Sommerfeld spectral representations, the transmission conditions on the two wedge faces yield a closed spectral functional system for the Sommerfeld transforms $Q(\zeta)$ and $S(\zeta)$. In this special configuration the associated Snell surface is the lemniscatic curve $Y^2=2(t^4+1)$, uniformized by the square Weierstrass lattice $\tau=i$. We solve the resulting orbit Wiener-Hopf/Riemann-Hilbert system on the torus and obtain an exact closed-form expression for the scattered transform $Q_{\rm scat}$ as a finite Weierstrass-zeta sum plus an explicitly constructed pole-free elliptic remainder. All pole coefficients are computed algebraically from the forcing pole set, and the construction enforces analyticity at the incident spectral point. We also reconstruct the face transform $S$ and, under standard analyticity and growth hypotheses on the Sommerfeld densities, verify the transmission conditions on both wedge faces, the Sommerfeld radiation condition, and the Meixner edge condition. Finally, by steepest descent of the Sommerfeld integral we extract the far-field diffraction coefficient. The result is restricted to this integrable lemniscatic case; the general penetrable wedge remains challenging.</description>

      <title>Discrete symmetries in classical and quantum oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01960v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the nature of the wave function using the example of a harmonic oscillator. We show that the eigenfunctions $\psi_n{=}z^n$ of the quantum Hamiltonian in the complex Bargmann-Fock-Segal representation with $z\in\mathbb C$ are the coordinates of a classical oscillator with energy $E_n=\hbar\omega n$, $n=0,1,2,...\,$. They are defined on conical spaces ${\mathbb C}/{\mathbb Z}_n$ with cone angles $2\pi/n$, which are embedded as subspaces in the phase space $\mathbb C$ of the classical oscillator. Here ${\mathbb Z}_n$ is the finite cyclic group of rotations of the space $\mathbb C$ by an angle $2\pi/n$. The superposition $\psi =\sum_n c_n\psi_n$ of the eigenfunctions $\psi_n$ arises only with incomplete knowledge of the initial data for solving the Schr\"odinger equation, when the conditions of invariance with respect to the discrete groups ${\mathbb Z}_n$ are not imposed and the general solution takes into account all possible initial data parametrized by the numbers $n\in\mathbb N$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.03280v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aleksandrov, and then Zeeman, showed that the causal relations among the set of points in a Minkowski space of dimension greater than 2 determine the Minkowski space structure of the set up to a global conformal factor. We show that in any dimension the distances between causally related pairs of points determine the distances between spatially related pairs of points, and thus completely determine the Minkowski space structure of the set. This is a step in the direction of proving that causal sets arising from a Poisson process in a Lorentzian manifold determine that manifold up to the degree of approximation inherent in the intensity of the Poisson process -- the Hauptvermutung of causal set theory.</description>

      <title>An overview of the fractional-order gradient descent method and its applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03318v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies have shown that fractional calculus is an effective alternative mathematical tool in various scientific fields. However, some investigations indicate that results established in differential and integral calculus do not necessarily hold true in fractional calculus. In this work we will compare various methods presented in the literature to improve the Gradient Descent Method, in terms of convergence of the method, convergence to the extreme point, and convergence rate. In general, these methods that generalize the gradient descent algorithm by replacing the gradient with a fractional-order operator are inefficient in achieving convergence to the extremum point of the objective function. To avoid these difficulties, we proposed to choose the Fractional Continuous Time algorithm to generalize the gradient method. In this approach, the convergence of the method to the extreme point of the function is guaranteed by introducing the fractional order in the time derivative, rather than in of the gradient. In this case, the issue of finding the extreme point is resolved, while the issue of stability at the equilibrium point remains.
  Fractional Continuous Time method converges to extreme point of cost function when fractional-order is between 0 and 1. The simulations shown in this work suggests that a similar result can be found when $1 \leq \alpha \leq 2$. { This paper highlights the main advantages and disadvantages of generalizations of the gradient method using fractional derivatives, aiming to optimize convergence in complex problems. Some chemical problems, with n=11 and 24 optimization parameters, are employed as means of evaluating the efficacy of the propose algorithms. In general, previous studies are restricted to mathematical questions and simple illustrative examples.</description>

      <title>Non-perturbative data for Weil-Petersson volumes and intersection numbers using ordinary differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03351v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, a new method was introduced for computing $V_{g,1}(b)$, the Weil-Petersson volumes of the moduli space of Riemann surfaces of genus $g$ with one geodesic boundary of length $b$, various supersymmetric generalizations of them, as well as analogous quantities in intersection theory. The physical setting is the computation of a certain one-point function in a variety of models of 2D gravity for which there is a double-scaled random matrix model (RMM) description. The method combines perturbative solutions of two ordinary differential equations (ODEs), the Gel'fand-Dikii resolvent equation, and the RMM's string equation. In this paper, we extend the method to extract non-perturbative information about the $V_{g,1}(b)$ (and their analogues) that is naturally contained in the full ODEs, providing an efficient prescription for computing the transseries coefficients of the one-point correlation function, fully incorporating ZZ-brane and FZZT-brane effects, and for the first time, mixed ZZ-FZZT-effects. We use as a case study the (2,3) minimal string, computing perturbative and non-perturbative quantities, comparing them to perturbative results from topological recursion, and to results from the recent non-perturbative topological recursion framework of Eynard et.al. As a particularly powerful further application we provide general predictions for the large order in $g$ growth of $V_{g,1}(b)$, and apply them to JT gravity, finding agreement with known results, and for analogous quantities in ${N} {=} 1$ JT supergravity, proving a conjecture of Stanford and Witten. Our predictions yield new growth formulae for the cases of ${N} {=} 2$ and ${N}{=}4$ JT supergravity.</description>

      <title>Stratified Pseudobundles and Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03544v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Geometric Quantization is a term used to describe a wide collection of techniques dating back to the 1960s in the work of Kirillov, Kostant, and Souriau, which take symplectic manifolds and produce complex vector spaces. The name comes from the natural interpretation of symplectic manifolds as the phase spaces of classical mechanical systems and complex vector spaces as the natural domains of wave functions in quantum mechanics. In this thesis, I extend the classical framework of Geometric Quantization to handle a class of singular spaces called Symplectic Stratified Spaces, which date back to the work of Sjamaar and Lerman in the 1990s. As part of this work, I develop the theory of stratified pseudobundles to serve as singular replacements for important auxiliary information in Geometric Quantization: prequantum line bundles and polarizations. I then use this formalism to provide [Q,R]=0 results for singular quotients of toric manifolds and cotangent bundles. I also provide an example of singular Geometric Quantization that does not arise from singular reduction.</description>

      <title>Unitary Transformation of Two-Dimensional Spin-Orbit Coupled Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Rashba, Dresselhaus, and Weyl Hamiltonians form a foundational framework for modeling spin-orbit interactions across condensed matter systems. Although they describe distinct material classes and produce seemingly different spin textures, they are conventionally treated as separate, unrelated theoretical frameworks. Here, this work demonstrates that the linear 2D Rashba and Weyl models are connected by a specific unitary transformation that maps one Hamiltonian exactly onto the other. The same unitary can be applied to map the linear Dresselhaus-1 model onto the Dresselhaus-2 models and vice versa. Such hidden correspondence establishes a unified theoretical foundation for spin-orbit interactions, deepening our conceptual understanding of spin-orbit coupling and opening new avenues for exploring complex spin textures. To illustrate the application, this work introduces a unique, improved, and more realistic model Hamiltonian H_MKM combining all known foundational spintronic models, where the stringent condition of equal spin-orbit coupling strength of Rashba and Dresselhaus may not be required to observe persistent spin texture under MKM transformation.</description>

Abstract: We construct gradings on the simple modules of 2-boundary Temperley--Lieb algebras and symplectic blob algebras by realising the latter algebras as quotients of Varagnolo--Vasserot's orientifold quiver Hecke algebras. We prove that the symplectic blob algebras are graded cellular and provide a conjectural algorithm for calculating their graded decomposition matrices. In doing so, we give the first explicit family of finite-dimensional graded quotients of the orientifold quiver Hecke algebras, providing a new entry point for the structure of these algebras -- in the spirit of Libedinsky--Plaza's ``blob algebra approach'' to modular representation theory.</description>

Abstract: The Colin de Verdi\`ere parameter is a number assigned to discrete graphs which equals the maximal multiplicity of the second eigenvalue of a certain family of Laplacian matrices related to the graph. In this paper it is shown that the Colin de Verdi\`ere parameter can be obtained in the setting of metric graphs by looking at the maximal multiplicity of the second eigenvalue for Laplacians on metric graphs with delta couplings at the vertices. Two different families of Laplacians, as well as a family of Schr\"odinger operators, all leading to the Colin de Verdi\`ere number are presented.</description>

      <title>Open $r$-spin theory in genus one, and the Gelfand-Dikii wave function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct the $g=1$ sector of the open $r$-spin theory, that is, an open $r$-spin theory on the moduli space of cylinders. This is the second construction of a $g&gt;0$ open intersection theory, which includes descendents (the first is the all genus construction of the intersection theory on moduli of open Riemann surfaces with boundaries [23,30], whose $g=1$ case equals to the $r=2$ case of our construction). Unlike the construction of [30], in order to construct the $r$-spin cylinder theory we had to overcome the foundational problem of dimension jump loci, which in analogous closed theories has been treated using virtual fundamental class techniques, that are currently absent in the open setting. For this reason our construction is much more involved, and relies on the point insertion technique developed in [31,32].
  We prove that the open $g=1$ potential equals, after a coordinate change, to the $g=1$ part of the Gelfand-Dikii wave function, thus confirming a conjecture of [7]. We also prove that our $g=1$ intersection numbers satisfy a $g=1$ recursion, also predicted in [7,15]. This recursion is the $g=1$ analogue of Solomon's famous $g=0$ Open WDVV equation [25], with descendents, and is also the universal $g=1$ recursion for $F$-Cohomological field theories [1]. Again, this is first geometric construction which is not the $g=1$ sector of [23,30], proven to satisfy this universal recursion.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04180v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that learning an unknown quantum channel with input dimension $d_A$, output dimension $d_B$, and Choi rank $r$ to diamond distance $\varepsilon$ requires $ \Omega\!\left( \frac{d_A d_B r}{\varepsilon \log(d_B r / \varepsilon)} \right)$ queries. This improves the best previous $\Omega(d_A d_B r)$ bound by introducing explicit $\varepsilon$-dependence, with a scaling in $\varepsilon$ that is near-optimal when $d_A=rd_B$ but not tight in general. The proof constructs an ensemble of channels that are well-separated in diamond norm yet admit Stinespring isometries that are close in operator norm.</description>

      <title>From Klein-Gordon-Wave to Schr\"odinger-Wave: a Normal Form Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20576v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a Klein-Gordon-Wave system, describing the evolution of a massive field and a massless one interacting through a Yukawa-like coupling, and we explicitly derive its Hamiltonian normal form to first and second order. To the first-order approximation, the normal form results in a Schr\"odinger-Wave system, which reduces to the Schr\"odinger-Poisson one in the singular limit of vanishing perturbative parameter. The second-order approximation provides the successive corrections to the Schr\"odinger-Wave system, and is presented in order to show that higher-order approximations to all orders can be obtained by iterating our constructive procedure. The normal form technique adopted here formally extends the standard Birkhoff normal form procedure for harmonic oscillators to include a set of free particles in the unperturbed problem. The mathematical result obtained here might explain, for example, the "cooling" process of ultra-light dark matter, the approximate validity of the Schr\"odinger-Poisson system describing its dynamics and the long term conservation of the total dark matter mass.</description>

      <title>Higher order linear differential equations for unitary matrix integrals: applications and generalisations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20797v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider characterisations of the class of unitary matrix integrals $ \langle (\det U)^q e^{s^{1/2} {\rm Tr}(U + U^\dagger)} \rangle_{U(l)}$ in terms of a first order matrix linear differential equation for a vector function of size $l+1$, and in terms of a scalar linear differential equation of degree $l+1$. It will be shown that the latter follows from the former. The matrix linear differential equation provides an efficient way to compute the power series expansion of the matrix integrals, which with $q=0$ and $q=l$ are of relevance to the enumeration of longest increasing subsequences for random permutations, and to the question of the moments of the first and second derivative of the Riemann zeta on the critical line respectively. This procedure is compared against that following from known characterisations involving the $\sigma$-Painlev\'e III$'$ second order nonlinear differential equation. We show too that that the natural $\beta$ generalisation of the unitary group integral permits characterisation by the same classes of linear differential equations.</description>

      <title>The point insertion technique and open $r$-spin theories I: moduli and orientation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.13185v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The papers [3,1,4,10] constructed an intersection theory on the moduli space of $r$-spin disks, proving mirror symmetry and relations with integrable hierarchies. That theory considered only disks with a single boundary state.In this work, we initiate the study of more general $r$-spin surfaces. We define graded $r$-spin surfaces with multiple internal and boundary states, together with their moduli spaces.
  In genus zero, the disk case, we define the associated open Witten bundle and prove that it is canonically oriented relative to the moduli space. We also describe a gluing construction for moduli spaces along boundaries, show that it lifts to the Witten bundle and relative cotangent line bundles, and that the result remains canonically relatively oriented.
  We then study the genus-one cylinder case. Here foundational difficulties arise because the Witten "bundle" is no longer an orbifold vector bundle. We resolve this by removing strata with incorrect fibre dimension, obtaining an orbibundle on the complement. The gluing method extends to genus one, and we prove that the Witten bundle again admits a canonical relative orientation.
  In the sequel [21], we construct a family of $\lfloor r/2\rfloor$ intersection theories in genus-zero indexed by $\mathfrak h\in\{0,\ldots,\lfloor r/2\rfloor-1\}$, where the $\mathfrak h$-th theory has $\mathfrak h+1$ boundary states, and compute their intersection numbers. The case $\mathfrak h=0$ recovers the theory of [3,1].
  In the sequel [20], restricting to the $\mathfrak h=0$ case, we construct an intersection theory on the moduli space of $r$-spin cylinders and show that its potential yields, after a change of variables, the genus-one part of the $r$th Gelfand-Dikii wave function, proving the genus-one case of the main conjecture of [4].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02757v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that encrypted cloning of unknown quantum states is possible. Any number of encrypted clones of a qubit can be created through a unitary transformation, and each of the encrypted clones can be decrypted through a unitary transformation. The decryption of an encrypted clone consumes the decryption key, i.e., only one decryption is possible, in agreement with the no-cloning theorem. Encrypted cloning represents a new paradigm that provides a form of redundancy, parallelism or scalability where direct duplication is forbidden by the no-cloning theorem. For example, a possible application of encrypted cloning is to enable encrypted quantum multi-cloud storage.</description>

      <title>Sharp estimates for large N Weingarten functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15892v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Weingarten functions provide a tool for computing Haar measure matrix integrals of polynomials in the matrix entries. An important property of Weingarten functions, is their particularly simple large $N$ limits. In 2017 Benoit Collins and Sho Matsumoto studied when this limit holds for Weingarten functions associated to integrals of products of $2n$ matrix entries, as $n \to \infty$, together with the matrix size $N$. They showed that the large $N$ limit is uniformly achieved as long as $n=o(N^{4/7})$, a result which already has applications to strong asymptotic freeness. However, their result is not optimal. They conjectured that their result should actually hold up to $n=o(N^{2/3})$ which is optimal. We prove this conjecture for the matrix groups $G \in \{\mathrm{U}(N)$, $\mathrm{O}(N)$, $\mathrm{Sp}(N)\}$. The proof proceeds by introducing a Markov process on permutations (pairings) which we call the unitary (orthogonal) $\textit{Weingarten process}$. We believe this process may have further applications to the theory of Weingarten functions. We also prove two new bounds regarding the large $N$ limit of the Weingarten function in the regimes when $n=o(N^{4/5})$, and $n=o(N)$.</description>

      <title>Quantization of Lie-Poisson algebra and Lie algebra solutions of mass-deformed type IIB matrix model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24060v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A quantization of Lie-Poisson algebras is studied. Classical solutions of the mass-deformed Ishibashi-Kawai-Kitazawa-Tsuchiya (IKKT) matrix model can be constructed from semisimple Lie algebras whose dimension matches the number of matrices in the model. We consider the geometry described by the classical solutions of the Lie algebras in the limit where the mass vanishes and the matrix size tends to infinity. Lie-Poisson varieties are regarded as such geometric objects. We provide a quantization called ``weak matrix regularization'' of Lie-Poisson algebras (linear Poisson algebras) on the algebraic varieties defined by their Casimir polynomials. This quantization is a generalization of matrix regularization, and neither faithfulness of the map nor the correspondence between integration and trace in the commutative limit is required. Casimir polynomials correspond with Casimir operators of the Lie algebra by the quantization. This quantization is a generalization of the method for constructing the fuzzy sphere. In order to define the weak matrix regularization of the quotient space by the ideal generated by the Casimir polynomials, we take a fixed reduced Gr\"obner basis of the ideal. The Gr\"obner basis determines remainders of polynomials. The operation of replacing these remainders with representation matrices of a Lie algebra roughly corresponds to a weak matrix regularization. As concrete examples, we construct weak matrix regularization for $\mathfrak{su}(2)$ and $\mathfrak{su}(3)$. In the case of $\mathfrak{su}(3)$, we not only construct weak matrix regularization for the quadratic Casimir polynomial, but also construct weak matrix regularization for the cubic Casimir polynomial.</description>

      <title>Rigorous results for timelike Liouville field theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02348v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Liouville field theory has long been a cornerstone of two-dimensional quantum field theory and quantum gravity, which has attracted much recent attention in the mathematics literature. Timelike Liouville field theory is a version of Liouville field theory where the kinetic term in the action appears with a negative sign, which makes it closer to a theory of quantum gravity than ordinary (spacelike) Liouville field theory. Making sense of this `wrong sign' requires a theory of Gaussian random variables with negative variance. Such a theory is developed in this paper, and is used to prove the timelike DOZZ formula for the $3$-point correlation function when the parameters satisfy the so-called `charge neutrality condition'. Expressions are derived also for the $k$-point correlation functions for all $k\ge 3$, and it is shown that these functions approach the correct semiclassical limits as the coupling constant is sent to zero</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.11686v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss the application of the Jordanian quantum algebra $\mathcal{U}_h (\mathfrak{sl}(2, \mathbb{R}))$, a Hopf algebra deformation of the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{sl}(2, \mathbb{R})$, in order to generate sets of $N$ qubit quantum states. We construct the associated $h$-deformed Dicke states using the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for $\mathcal{U}_h (\mathfrak{sl}(2, \mathbb{R}))$, showing that the former exhibit completely different features than the $q$-Dicke states obtained from the standard quantum deformation $\mathcal U_q (\mathfrak{sl}(2, \mathbb{R}))$. Moreover, the density matrices of these $h$-deformed Dicke states are compared to the experimental realizations of those of Dicke states, and several similarities are observed, indicating that the $h$-deformation could be used to describe noise and decoherence effects in experimental settings, as well as to control the degree of entanglement of the state in quantum computing protocols. In particular, $h$-Dicke states for $N=2,3,4$ are presented, a method to construct the $h$-deformed analogs of $W$-states for arbitrary $N$ is given, and some algebraic considerations for the explicit derivation of generic $h$-Dicke states are provided.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics of spin-spin correlators weighted by fermion number measurements with low rapidity threshold in the 2D Ising free-fermion QFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13093v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the work, we study the averaged number of massive fermions above a low rapidity threshold $Y$, underlying the form-factor expansions of the spin-spin two-point correlators at an Euclidean distance $r$, in the 2D Ising QFT at the free massive fermion point. Despite the on-shell freeness, the spin operators are still far away from being Gaussian, and create particles in the asymptotic states with complicated correlations. We show how the number observables can still be incorporated into the integrable Sinh-Gordon/Painleve-III framework and controlled by linear differential equations with two variables $(r,Y)$. We show how the differential equations and the information of two crucial scaling functions arising in the $r\rightarrow 0$, $e^{Y}r={\cal O}(1)$ scaling limit, can be combined to fully determine the small-$r$ asymptotics of the observables, in the $\lambda$-extended form. The scaling functions, on the other hand, are analyzed by summing the exponential form-factor expansions directly, generalizing the traditional Ising connecting computations. We show carefully, how the singularities cancel in the physical value limit $\lambda \pi \rightarrow 1$ and how the power-corrections that collapse at this value can be resummed. In particular, we show for the physical $\lambda$-value, the scaling functions are related to an integrated four-point function in the Ising CFT and continue to control the asymptotics of the number-observables in the scaling limit up to ${\cal O}(r^3)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.10565v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We generalize the notion of kinematical Lie algebra introduced in physics for the classification of the various possible relativity algebras an isotropic spacetime can accommodate.
  We first give an elementary proof of the fact that such a generalized kinematical Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ always carries a canonical structure of symplectic involutive Lie algebra (shortly ``siLa''). In other words, if $G$ is a connected Lie group admitting $\mathfrak{g}$ as Lie algebra, there always exists a Lie subgroup $H$ of $G$ constituted by the elements of $G$ that are fixed under an involutive automorphism of $G$ and such that the homogenenous space $M=G/H$ is a symplectic symmetric space. In particular, the manifold $M$ canonically carries a $G$-invariant linear torsionfree connection $\nabla$ whose geodesic symmetries centered at all points extend as global $\nabla$-affine transformations of $M$. The manifold $M$ is also canonically equipped with a symplectic structure $\omega$ which is invariant under every geodesic symmetry, implying in particular that it is parallel w.r.t the linear connection: $\nabla\omega=0$.
  In a second part, we give a complete description of the fine structure of our generalized siLa's. Our discussion yields a complete classification of such sila's.</description>

      <title>The Effective Reactivity for Capturing Brownian Motion by Partially Reactive Patches on a Spherical Surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26381v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the trapping of diffusing ligands, modeled as Brownian particles, by a sphere that has $N$ partially reactive boundary patches, each of small area and arbitrary shape, on an otherwise reflecting boundary. For such a structured target, the partial reactivity of each boundary patch is characterized by a Robin boundary condition, with a local boundary reactivity $\kappa_i$ for $i=1,\ldots,N$. For any spatial arrangement of well-separated patches on the surface of the sphere, the method of matched asymptotic expansions is used to derive explicit results for the capacitance $C_{\rm T}$ of the structured target, which is valid for any $\kappa_i&gt;0$. This target capacitance $C_{\rm T}$ is defined in terms of a Green's matrix, which depends on the spatial configuration of patches, the local reactive capacitance $C_i(\kappa_i)$ of each patch and another coefficient that depends on the local geometry near a patch. The analytical dependence of $C_{i}(\kappa_i)$ on $\kappa_i$ is uncovered via a spectral expansion over Steklov eigenfunctions. For circular patches, the latter are readily computed numerically and provide an accurate fully explicit sigmoidal approximation for $C_{i}(\kappa_i)$. In the homogenization limit of $N\gg 1$ identical uniformly-spaced patches with $\kappa_i=\kappa$, we derive an explicit scaling law for the effective capacitance and the effective reactivity of the structured target that is valid in the limit of small patch area fraction. From a comparison with numerical simulations, we show that this scaling law provides a highly accurate approximation over the full range $\kappa&gt;0$, even when there is only a moderately large number of reactive patches.</description>

      <title>Transmutation operators for Schr\"odinger equations with distributional potentials and the associated impedance equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.12094v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the construction of an integral transmutation operator for the Schr\"odinger equation
  \[
  -y'' + q(x)y = \lambda y, \quad x \in J, \ \lambda \in \mathbb{C},
  \]
  in the case where $q$ is the distributional derivative of an $L^2$ function on a bounded interval $J \subset \mathbb{R}$. Such a transmutation operator transforms solutions of $ v'' + \lambda v = 0 $ into solutions of the Schr\"odinger equation. The construction of the integral transmutation operator relies on a new regularization of the distributional Schr\"odinger equation based on the Polya factorization in terms of a solution $f$ that does not vanish on the closure of $J$. The existence of such a function $f$ is established, together with a constructive method for its computation.
  As a consequence of the Polya factorization, we obtain an integro-differential transmutation operator for the associated Sturm--Liouville operator in impedance form related to $f$, along with smoothness conditions for the transmutation kernel. Furthermore, we introduce the Darboux transform for both the Schr\"odinger and impedance operators and describe their relationships with the corresponding transmutation operators. Finally, we develop several series representations for the solutions, including the spectral parameter power series and the Neumann series of spherical Bessel functions.</description>

Abstract: We develop a mathematical framework that interprets Transformer attention as an interacting particle system and studies its continuum (mean-field) limits. By idealizing attention on the sphere, we connect Transformer dynamics to Wasserstein gradient flows, synchronization models (Kuramoto), and mean-shift clustering. Central to our results is a global clustering phenomenon whereby tokens cluster asymptotically after long metastable states where they are arranged into multiple clusters. We further analyze a tractable equiangular reduction to obtain exact clustering rates, show how commonly used normalization schemes alter contraction speeds, and identify a phase transition for long-context attention. The results highlight both the mechanisms that drive representation collapse and the regimes that preserve expressive, multi-cluster structure in deep attention architectures.</description>

Abstract: We consider eigenfunctions of many-body system Hamiltonians associated with generalized (a-twisted) Cherednik operators used in construction of other Hamiltonians: those arising from commutative subalgebras of the Ding-Iohara-Miki (DIM) algebra. The simplest example of these eigenfunctions is provided by non-symmetric Macdonald polynomials, while generally they are constructed basing on the ground state eigenfunction coinciding with the twisted Baker-Akhiezer function being a peculiar (symmetric) eigenfunction of the DIM Hamiltonians. Moreover, the eigenfunctions admit an expansion with universal coefficients so that the dependence on the twist $a$ is hidden only in these ground state eigenfunctions, and we suggest a general formula that allows one to construct these eigenfunctions from non-symmetric Macdonald polynomials. This gives a new twist in theory of integrable systems, which usually puts an accent on symmetric polynomials, and provides a new dimension to the {\it triad} made from the symmetric Macdonald polynomials, untwisted Baker-Akhiezer functions and Noumi-Shiraishi series.</description>
