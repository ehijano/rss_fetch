      <title>Detecting eigenvalues in a fourth-order nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with a non-regular Maslov box</title>

Abstract: We use the Maslov index to study the eigenvalue problem arising from the linearisation about a standing wave in the fourth-order cubic nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation (NLSE). Our analysis is motivated by a recent work by Bandara et. al., in which the fourth-order cubic NLSE was shown to support infinite families of multipulse soliton solutions with various symmetry properties. By using a homotopy argument, we prove a lower bound for the number of real unstable eigenvalues. We also give a Vakhitov-Kolokolov type stability criterion, which is sufficient to determine the spectral stability or instability for certain classes of standing waves. The interesting aspects of this problem as an application of the Maslov index are the instances of non-regular crossings; in particular, we encounter crossing forms with degeneracies of both zero and nonzero rank. We handle such degeneracies by analysing the partial signatures of higher order crossing forms, using a definition of the Maslov index developed by Piccione and Tausk.</description>

      <title>Hallucination Detox: Sensitivity Dropout (SenD) for Large Language Model Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15460v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed across various industries, concerns regarding their reliability, particularly due to hallucinations - outputs that are factually inaccurate or irrelevant to user input - have grown. Our research investigates the relationship between the training process and the emergence of hallucinations to address a key gap in existing research that focuses primarily on post hoc detection and mitigation strategies. Using models from the Pythia suite (70M - 12B parameters) and several hallucination detection metrics, we analyze hallucination trends throughout training and explore LLM internal dynamics. We introduce Sensitivity Dropout (SenD), a novel training protocol designed to mitigate hallucinations by reducing variance during training. SenD achieves this by deterministically dropping embedding indices with significant variability, referred to as Sensitive Embedding Indices. In addition, we develop an unsupervised hallucination detection metric, Efficient EigenScore (EES), which approximates the traditional EigenScore at 2x speed. This efficient metric is integrated into our protocol, allowing SenD to be both computationally scalable and effective at reducing hallucinations. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that our approach improves LLM reliability at test time by up to 40% compared to normal training while also providing an efficient method to improve factual accuracy when adapting LLMs to Wikipedia, Medical, and LegalBench domains.</description>
