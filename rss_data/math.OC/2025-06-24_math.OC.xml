      <title>PSD and SOS Biquadratic Polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17260v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hilbert indicated that a positive semi-definite (psd) homogeneous quartic polynomial of four variables may not be sum of squares (sos). {Since a} $2 \times 2$ biquadratic polynomial is a homogeneous quartic polynomial of four variables{, this raises a fundamental question:} Is a psd $2 \times 2$ biquadratic polynomial sos? In this paper, we present a necessary and sufficient condition for a $2 \times 2$ psd biquadratic polynomial to be sos. We show that if a $2 \times 2$ {psd} biquadratic polynomial is sos, then it is sos of tetranomials, its sos rank is at most $4$, and the coefficients of the tetranomials can be orthogonal to each other. We prove that every psd $2\times 2$ biquadratic polynomial admits an equivalent representation with two neighbor half-cross terms and one full-cross term. Furthermore, any $2 \times 2$ psd biquadratic polynomial is a sum of squares of binomials (sosb) when it contains at most one half-cross term, and a sum of squares of trinomials (sostri) when it contains exactly two neighbor half-cross terms and no full-cross term.</description>

      <title>Existence and Uniqueness of Physically Correct Hydraulic States in Water Distribution Systems -- A theoretical analysis on the solvability of non-linear systems of equations in the context of water distribution systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Planning and extension of water distribution systems (WDSs) plays a key role in the development of smart cities, driven by challenges such as urbanization and climate change. In this context, the correct estimation of physically correct hydraulic states, i.e., pressure heads, water demands and water flows, is of high interest. Hydraulic emulators such as EPANET or more recently, physic-informed surrogate models are used to solve this task. They require a subset of observed states, such as heads at reservoirs and water demands, as inputs to estimate the whole hydraulic state. In order to obtain reliable results of such emulators, but also to be able to give theoretical guarantees of their estimations, an important question is whether theoretically, the subset of observed states that the emulator requires as an input suffices to derive the whole state, purely based on the physical properties, also called hydraulic principles, it obeys. This questions translates to solving linear and non-linear systems of equations. Previous articles investigate on the existence question under the term observability analysis, however, they rely on the approximation of the non-linear principles using Taylor approximation and on network-dependent numerical or algebraic algorithms. In this work, we provide purely theoretical guarantees on the existence and uniqueness of solutions to the non-linear hydraulic principles, and by this, the existence and uniqueness of physically correct states, given common subsets of them -- a result that seems to be common-sense in the water community but has never been rigorously proven. We show that previous existence results are special cases of our more general findings, and therefore lay the foundation for further analysis and theoretical guarantees of the before-mentioned hydraulic emulators.</description>

      <title>On the convergence of computational methods for the online bin stretching problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Online bin stretching is an online packing problem where some of the best known lower and upper bounds were found through computational searches. The limiting factor in obtaining better bounds with such methods is the computational time allowed. However, there is still no theoretical guarantee that such methods do converge towards the optimal online performance. This paper shows that such methods do, in fact, converge; moreover, bounds on the gap to the optimal are also given. These results frame a theoretical foundation for the convergence of computational approaches for online problems.</description>

      <title>The LQR-Schr\"odinger Bridge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Schr{\"o}dinger bridge problem in discrete time, where the pathwise cost is replaced by a sum of quadratic functions, taking the form of a linear quadratic regulator (LQR) cost. This cost comprises potential terms that act as attractors and kinetic terms that control the diffusion of the process. When the two boundary marginals are Gaussian, we show that the LQR-Schr{\"o}dinger bridge problem can be solved in closed form. We follow the dynamic programming principle, interpreting the Kantorovich potentials as cost-to-go functions. Under the LQR-Gaussian assumption, these potentials can be propagated exactly in a backward and forward passes, leading to a system of dual Riccati equations, well known in estimation and control. This system converges rapidly in practice. We then show that the optimal process is Markovian and compute its transition kernel in closed form as well as the Gaussian marginals. Through numerical experiments, we demonstrate that this approach can be used to construct complex, non-homogeneous Gaussian processes with acceleration and loops, given well-chosen attractive potentials. Moreover, this approach allows extending the Bures transport between Gaussian distributions to more complex geometries with negative curvature.</description>

      <title>KKT-based optimality conditions for neural network approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we obtain necessary optimality conditions for neural network approximation. We consider neural networks in Manhattan ($l_1$ norm) and Chebyshev ($\max$ norm). The optimality conditions are based on neural networks with at most one hidden layer. We reformulate nonsmooth unconstrained optimisation problems as larger dimension constrained problems with smooth objective functions and constraints. Then we use KKT conditions to develop the necessary conditions and present the optimality conditions in terms of convex analysis and convex sets.</description>

      <title>Convergent Proximal Multiblock ADMM for Nonconvex Dynamics-Constrained Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a provably convergent multiblock ADMM for nonconvex optimization with nonlinear dynamics constraints, overcoming the divergence issue in classical extensions. We consider a class of optimization problems that arise from discretization of dynamics-constrained variational problems that are optimization problems for a functional constrained by time-dependent ODEs or PDEs. This is a family of $n$-sum nonconvex optimization problems with nonlinear constraints. We study the convergence properties of the proximal alternating direction method of multipliers (proximal ADMM) applied to those problems. Taking the advantage of the special problem structure, we show that under local Lipschitz and local $L$-smooth conditions, the sequence generated by the proximal ADMM is bounded and all accumulation points are KKT points. Based on our analysis, we also design a procedure to determine the penalty parameters $\rho_i$ and the proximal parameters $\eta_i$. We further prove that among all the subsequences that converge, the fast one converges at the rate of $o(1/k)$. The numerical experiments are performed on 4D variational data assimilation problems and as the solver of implicit schemes for stiff problems. The proposed proximal ADMM has more stable performance than gradient-based methods. We discuss the implementation to solve the subproblems, a new way to solve the implicit schemes, and the advantages of the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>Regularization of Nonlinear Inverse Problems -- From Functional Analysis to Data-Driven Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The focus of this book is on the analysis of regularization methods for solving \emph{nonlinear inverse problems}. Specifically, we place a strong emphasis on techniques that incorporate supervised or unsupervised data derived from prior experiments. This approach enables the integration of data-driven insights into the solution of inverse problems governed by physical models. \emph{Inverse problems}, in general, aim to uncover the \emph{inner mechanisms} of an observed system based on indirect or incomplete measurements. This field has far-reaching applications across various disciplines, such as medical or geophysical imaging, as well as, more broadly speaking, industrial processes where identifying hidden parameters is essential.</description>

      <title>Enhanced PDHG for Linear Programming with Online Preconditioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an online preconditioning technique for the primal-dual hybrid gradient (PDHG) algorithm for linear programming (LP). The method adaptively updates primal and dual preconditioners using an online optimization framework. To improve its practical performance, we introduce several algorithmic enhancements, including using normalized online loss functions and updating preconditioners infrequently. We implement the technique on top of vanilla PDHG and the GPU-based LP solver cuPDLP.jl, and benchmark its performance on standard LP datasets. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that online preconditioning effectively reduces both iteration counts and overall solving time.</description>

      <title>An Analytical Framework for the Linear Best-Worst Method and its Application to Achieve Sustainable Development Goals--Oriented Agri-Food Supply Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Best-Worst Method (BWM) has emerged as a prominent multi-criteria decision-making method for determining the weights of the decision criteria. Among various BWM models, this research focuses on the linear model of the BWM. This model calculates weights by solving an optimization problem, necessitating optimization software. In this article, we present a novel framework that solves this optimization model mathematically, yielding an analytical expression for the resultant weights, thus eliminating the requirement for an optimization software. The proposed approach enhances both the conceptual clarity of the underlying optimization process and the computational efficiency of the model. Based of this framework, we demonstrate the model's limited response to data variations, i.e., its lower data sensitivity. We also compute the values of consistency index for the linear BWM, which are required to calculate the consistency ratio - a consistency indicator used for assessing inconsistency in input data. Finally, we illustrate the validity and applicability of the proposed approach through five numerical examples and a real-world case study that ranks eighteen drivers across three categories - Industry 4.0, sustainability, and circular economy - in relation to sustainable development goals-driven agri-food supply chains.</description>

      <title>Regular Tree Search for Simulation Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tackling simulation optimization problems with non-convex objective functions remains a fundamental challenge in operations research. In this paper, we propose a class of random search algorithms, called Regular Tree Search, which integrates adaptive sampling with recursive partitioning of the search space. The algorithm concentrates simulations on increasingly promising regions by iteratively refining a tree structure. A tree search strategy guides sampling decisions, while partitioning is triggered when the number of samples in a leaf node exceeds a threshold that depends on its depth. Furthermore, a specific tree search strategy, Upper Confidence Bounds applied to Trees (UCT), is employed in the Regular Tree Search. We prove global convergence under sub-Gaussian noise, based on assumptions involving the optimality gap, without requiring continuity of the objective function. Numerical experiments confirm that the algorithm reliably identifies the global optimum and provides accurate estimates of its objective value.</description>

      <title>Pushing the Complexity Boundaries of Fixed-Point Equations: Adaptation to Contraction and Controlled Expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fixed-point equations with Lipschitz operators have been studied for more than a century, and are central to problems in mathematical optimization, game theory, economics, and dynamical systems, among others. When the Lipschitz constant of the operator is larger than one (i.e., when the operator is expansive), it is well known that approximating fixed-point equations becomes computationally intractable even in basic finite-dimensional settings. In this work, we aim to push these complexity boundaries by introducing algorithms that can address problems with mildly expansive (i.e., with Lipschitz constant slightly larger than one) operators not excluded by existing lower bounds, attaining the best possible fixed-point error up to universal constants. We further introduce a class of \emph{gradually expansive operators} that allow for constant (up to $\approx 1.4$) expansion between points, for which we prove convergence to $\epsilon$-approximate fixed points in order-$(1/\epsilon)$ iterations for $\epsilon &gt; 0.$ Our algorithms automatically adapt to the Lipschitz constant of the operator and attain optimal oracle complexity bounds when the input operator is nonexpansive or contractive. Our results apply to general, possibly infinite-dimensional normed vector spaces and can be extended to positively curved geodesic metric spaces.</description>

      <title>On circumcentered direct methods for monotone variational inequality problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The variational inequality problem (VIP) plays a central role in the theory and applications in continuous optimization. In particular, minimization problems and KKT systems can be regard as VIPs. In this work, we present the first methods using circumcenter iterations for solving VIPs. The circumcentered-reflection method (CRM) is a tool based on projections developed with the aim of finding a point in the intersection of finitely many closed convex sets. CRM has gone through enhancements and adaptations over the last few years and was proven to be faster in many settings than competitors such as alternating projections and the Douglas-Rachford method. One of the nice features of CRM is that it is able to deal with approximate projections, which is exactly what we enforced in this article theoretically and numerically. We present both a circumcenter method for the VIP with paramonotone operator and monotone operator, the first employing exact projections and the second approximate ones. Convergence results showing their convergence are established. Numerically, our experiments indicate good performance, including advantages over the well-know extragradient method.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a class of nonconvex nonsmooth multicomposite optimization problems where the objective function consists of a Tikhonov regularizer and a composition of multiple nonconvex nonsmooth component functions. Such optimization problems arise from tangible applications in machine learning and beyond. To define and compute its first-order and second-order d(irectional)-stationary points effectively, we first derive the closed-form expression of the tangent cone for the feasible region of its constrained reformulation. Building on this, we establish its equivalence with the corresponding constrained and $\ell_1$-penalty reformulations in terms of global optimality and d-stationarity. The equivalence offers indirect methods to attain the first-order and second-order d-stationary points of the original problem in certain cases. We apply our results to the training process of recurrent neural networks (RNNs).</description>

      <title>Inverse Chance Constrained Optimal Power Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The chance constrained optimal power flow (CC-OPF) essentially finds the low-cost generation dispatch scheme ensuring operational constraints are met with a specified probability, termed the security level. While the security level is a crucial input parameter, how it shapes the CC-OPF feasibility boundary has not been revealed. Changing the security level from a parameter to a decision variable, this letter proposes the inverse CC-OPF that seeks the highest feasible security level supported by the system. To efficiently solve this problem, we design a Newton-Raphson-like iteration algorithm leveraging the duality-based sensitivity analysis of an associated surrogate problem. Numerical experiments validate the proposed approach, revealing complex feasibility boundaries for security levels that underscore the importance of coordinating security levels across multiple chance constraints.</description>

      <title>ROBBO: An Efficient Method for Pareto Front Estimation with Guaranteed Accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new method to estimate the Pareto Front (PF) in bi-objective optimization problems is presented. Assuming a continuous PF, the approach, named ROBBO (RObust and Balanced Bi-objective Optimization), needs to sample at most a finite, pre-computed number of PF points. Upon termination, it guarantees that the worst-case approximation error lies within a desired tolerance range, predefined by the decision maker, for each of the two objective functions. Theoretical results are derived, about the worst-case number of PF samples required to guarantee the wanted accuracy, both in general and for specific sampling methods from the literature. A comparative analysis, both theoretical and numerical, demonstrates the superiority of the proposed method with respect to popular ones. The approach is finally showcased in a constrained path-following problem for a 2-axis positioning system and in a steady-state optimization problem for a Continuous-flow Stirred Tank Reactor. An open demo implementation of ROBBO is made available online.</description>

      <title>On the Linear Speedup of the Push-Pull Method for Decentralized Optimization over Digraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The linear speedup property is essential for demonstrating the advantage of distributed algorithms over their single-node counterparts. In this paper, we study the stochastic Push-Pull method, a widely adopted decentralized optimization algorithm over directed graphs (digraphs). Unlike methods that rely solely on row-stochastic or column-stochastic mixing matrices, Push-Pull avoids nonlinear correction and has shown superior empirical performance across a variety of settings. However, its theoretical analysis remains challenging, and the linear speedup property has not been generally establishe--revealing a significant gap between empirical success and limited theoretical understanding. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel analysis framework and prove that Push-Pull achieves linear speedup over arbitrary strongly connected digraphs. Our results provide the comprehensive theoretical understanding for stochastic Push-Pull, aligning its theory with empirical performance.

      <title>Wisdom of Crowds Through Myopic Self-Confidence Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The wisdom of crowds is an umbrella term for phenomena suggesting that the collective judgment or decision of a large group can be more accurate than the individual judgments or decisions of the group members. A well-known example illustrating this concept is the competition at a country fair described by Galton, where the median value of the individual guesses about the weight of an ox resulted in an astonishingly accurate estimate of the actual weight. This phenomenon resembles classical results in probability theory and relies on independent decision-making. The accuracy of the group's final decision can be significantly reduced if the final agents' opinions are driven by a few influential agents.
  In this paper, we consider a group of agents who initially possess uncorrelated and unbiased noisy measurements of a common state of the world. Assume these agents iteratively update their estimates according to a simple non-Bayesian learning rule, commonly known in mathematical sociology as the French-DeGroot dynamics or iterative opinion pooling. As a result of this iterative distributed averaging process, each agent arrives at an asymptotic estimate of the state of the world, with the variance of this estimate determined by the matrix of weights the agents assign to each other. Every agent aims at minimizing the variance of her asymptotic estimate of the state of the world; however, such variance is also influenced by the weights allocated by other agents. To achieve the best possible estimate, the agents must then solve a game-theoretic, multi-objective optimization problem defined by the available sets of influence weights. We characterize both the Pareto frontier and the set of Nash equilibria in the resulting game. Additionally, we examine asynchronous best-response dynamics for the group of agents and prove their convergence to the set of strict Nash equilibria.</description>

      <title>Spectral Outer-Approximation Algorithms for Binary Semidefinite Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integer semidefinite programming (ISDP) has recently gained attention due to its connection to binary quadratically constrained quadratic programs (BQCQPs), which can be exactly reformulated as binary semidefinite programs (BSDPs). However, it remains unclear whether this reformulation effectively uses existing ISDP solvers to address BQCQPs. To the best of our knowledge, no specialized ISDP algorithms exploit the unique structure of BSDPs derived from BQCQPs. This paper proposes a novel spectral outer approximation algorithm tailored for BSDPs derived from BQCQP reformulations. Our approach is inspired by polyhedral and second-order representable regions that outer approximate the feasible set of a semidefinite program relying on a spectral decomposition of a matrix that simultaneously diagonalizes the objective matrix and an aggregation of the constraint matrices. Computational experiments show that our algorithm is competitive with, and in some cases outperforms, state-of-the-art ISDP solvers such as SCIP-SDP and PAJARITO, highlighting ISDP's potential for solving BQCQPs.</description>

      <title>Finite-Time Information-Theoretic Bounds in Queueing Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish the first finite-time information-theoretic lower bounds-and derive new policies that achieve them-for the total queue length in scheduling problems over stochastic processing networks with both adversarial and stochastic arrivals. Prior analyses of MaxWeight guarantee only stability and asymptotic optimality in heavy traffic; we prove that, at finite horizons, MaxWeight can incur strictly larger backlog by problem-dependent factors which we identify. Our main innovations are 1) a minimax framework that pinpoints the precise problem parameters governing any policy's finite-time performance; 2) an information-theoretic lower bound on total queue length; 3) fundamental limitation of MaxWeight that it is suboptimal in finite time; and 4) a new scheduling rule that minimizes the full Lyapunov drift-including its second-order term-thereby matching the lower bound under certain conditions, up to universal constants. These findings reveal a fundamental limitation on "drift-only" methods and points the way toward principled, non-asymptotic optimality in queueing control.</description>

      <title>A Computationally Efficient Method for Solving Mixed-Integer AC Optimal Power Flow Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stepwise controllable devices, such as switched capacitors or stepwise controllable loads and generators, transform the nonconvex AC optimal power flow (AC-OPF) problem into a nonconvex mixed-integer (MI) programming problem which is generally hard to solve optimally. Existing methods for solving MI-AC-OPF problems usually suffer from either limited accuracy or computational intractability, making them impractical for real-world applications. To address these challenges, we propose an efficient iterative deflation approach providing high-quality approximate solutions. In each iteration, a continuously relaxed version of the MI-AC-OPF problem is solved and one candidate integer value is systematically eliminated based on the evaluation of a simple power flow result. The computational complexity of the proposed algorithm grows linearly with the number of integer optimization variables, ensuring scalability. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves significant improvements in solution accuracy compared to a state-of-the-art approach. Thus, the proposed method is promising for solving practical MI-AC-OPF problems.</description>

      <title>On the Maximization of Real Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a maximization problem on real sequences. More precisely, for a given sequence, we are interesting in computing the supremum of the sequence and an index for which the associated term is maximal. We propose a general methodology to solve this maximization problem. The method is based on upper approximations constructed from pairs of eventually decreasing sequences of strictly increasing continuous functions on $[0,1]$ and of scalars in $(0,1)$. Then, we can associate integers with those pairs using inverses on $[0,1]$ of the functions. We prove that such pairs always exist and one provides the index maximizer. In general, such pairs provide an upper bound of the greatest maximizer of the sequence. Finally, we apply the methodology on concrete examples including famous sequences such as logistic, Fibonacci and Syracuse sequences. We also apply our techniques to norm based peaks computation problems on discrete-time linear systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an improvement of a recent funnel controller design for uncertain nonlinear multi-input, multi-output systems modeled by higher order functional differential equations in the presence of input constraints. The objective is to guarantee the evolution of the tracking error within a performance funnel with prescribed desired shape for the case of inactive saturation. Compared to its precursor, controller complexity is significantly reduced, much fewer design parameters are involved and simulations exhibit a superior performance.</description>

      <title>FICA: Faster Inner Convex Approximation of Chance Constrained Grid Dispatch with Decision-Coupled Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a Faster Inner Convex Approximation (FICA) method for solving power system dispatch problems with Wasserstein distributionally robust joint chance constraints (WJCC) and incorporating the modelling of the automatic generation control factors. The problem studied belongs to the computationally challenging class of WJCC with left-hand-side uncertainty (LHS-WJCC). By exploiting the special one-dimensional structure (even if only partially present) of the problem, the proposed FICA incorporates a set of strong valid inequalities to accelerate the solution process. We prove that FICA achieves the same optimality as the well-known conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) inner convex approximation method. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed FICA can yield 40x computational speedup compared to CVaR, and can even reach up to 500x speedup when the optimisation horizon exceeds 16 time steps. This speedup is achieved when only 50% of constraints in a WJCC have the one-dimensional structure. The approximation quality is numerically verified to be the same as CVaR, and the quality gap is below 1% when compared to the computationally demanding exact reformulation of the LHS-WJCC in most cases. We also discuss the applications of FICA in optimisation problems from other domains that (partially) exhibit the one-dimensional structure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study variational problems on Banach spaces which involve submodular energies. We extend the notion of exchangeability to this infinite dimensional setting and show that it is in duality with submodularity. These two notions allow us to derive comparison principle in an abstract fashion. We apply our results to the optimal transport and entropic optimal transport problems. We then derive comparison principles on the Kantorovich and Schr\"odinger potentials. We also prove comparison principles for the associated JKO schemes.</description>

      <title>A $C^0$ weak Galerkin method with preconditioning for constrained optimal control problems with general tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17619v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a $C^0$ weak Galerkin ($C^0$-WG) method combined with an additive Schwarz preconditioner for solving optimal control problems (OCPs) governed by partial differential equations with general tracking cost functionals and pointwise state constraints. These problems pose significant analytical and numerical challenges due to the presence of fourth-order variational inequalities and the reduced regularity of solutions. Our first contribution is the design of a $C^0$-WG method based on globally continuous quadratic Lagrange elements, enabling efficient elementwise stiffness matrix assembly and parameter-free implementation while maintaining accuracy, as supported by a rigorous error analysis. As a second contribution, we develop an additive Schwarz preconditioner tailored to the $C^0$-WG method to improve solver performance for the resulting ill-conditioned linear systems. Numerical experiments confirm the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method and preconditioner for both biharmonic and optimal control problems.</description>

      <title>Classical optimization algorithms for diagonalizing quantum Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17883v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diagonalizing a Hamiltonian, which is essential for simulating its long-time dynamics, is a key primitive in quantum computing and has been proven to yield a quantum advantage for several specific families of Hamiltonians. Yet, despite its importance, only a handful of diagonalization algorithms exist, and correspondingly few families of fast-forwardable Hamiltonians have been identified. This paper introduces classical optimization algorithms for Hamiltonian diagonalization by formulating a cost function that penalizes off-diagonal terms and enforces unitarity via an orthogonality constraint, both expressed in the Pauli operator basis. We pinpoint a class of Hamiltonians that highlights severe drawbacks of existing methods, including exponential per-iteration cost, exponential circuit depth, or convergence to spurious optima. Our approach overcomes these shortcomings, achieving polynomial-time efficiency while provably avoiding suboptimal points. As a result, we broaden the known realm of fast-forwardable systems, showing that quantum-diagonalizable Hamiltonians extend to cases generated by exponentially large Lie algebras. On the practical side, we also present a randomized-coordinate variant that achieves a more efficient per-iteration cost than the deterministic counterpart. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these algorithms through explicit examples and numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous recovery of a corroded boundary and admittance using the Kohn-Vogelius method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17938v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the problem of identifying an unknown portion $\Gamma$ of the boundary of a $d$-dimensional ($d \in \{1, 2\}$) domain $\Omega$ and its associated Robin admittance coefficient, using two sets of boundary Cauchy data $(f, g)$--representing boundary temperature and heat flux--measured on the accessible portion $\Sigma$ of the boundary. Identifiability results \cite{Bacchelli2009,PaganiPierotti2009} indicate that a single measurement on $\Sigma$ is insufficient to uniquely determine both $\Gamma$ and $\alpha$, but two independent inputs yielding distinct solutions ensure the uniqueness of the pair $\Gamma$ and $\alpha$. In this paper, we propose a cost function based on the energy-gap of two auxiliary problems. We derive the variational derivatives of this objective functional with respect to both the Robin boundary $\Gamma$ and the admittance coefficient $\alpha$. These derivatives are utilized to develop a nonlinear gradient-based iterative scheme for the simultaneous numerical reconstruction of $\Gamma$ and $\alpha$. Numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Non-Euclidean Enriched Contraction Theory for Monotone Operators and Monotone Dynamical Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17990v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We adopt an operator-theoretic perspective to analyze a class of nonlinear fixed-point iterations and discrete-time dynamical systems. Specifically, we study the Krasnoselskij iteration - at the heart of countless algorithmic schemes and underpinning the stability analysis of numerous dynamical models - by focusing on a non-Euclidean vector space equipped with the diagonally weighted supremum norm. By extending the state of the art, we introduce the notion of enriched weak contractivity, which (i) is characterized by a simple, verifiable condition for Lipschitz operators, and (ii) yields explicit bounds on the admissible step size for the Krasnoselskij iteration. Our results relate the notion of weak contractivity with that of monotonicity of operators and dynamical systems and show its generality to design larger step sizes and improved convergence speed for broader classes of dynamical systems. The newly developed theory is illustrated on two applications: the design of zero-finding algorithms for monotone operators and the design of nonlinear consensus dynamics in monotone multi-agent dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Symbolic Reduction for Formal Synthesis of Global Lyapunov Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18171v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the formal synthesis of global polynomial Lyapunov functions for polynomial vector fields. We establish that a sign-definite polynomial must satisfy specific algebraic constraints, which we leverage to develop a set of straightforward symbolic reduction rules. These rules can be recursively applied to symbolically simplify the Lyapunov candidate, enabling more efficient and robust discovery of Lyapunov functions via optimization or satisfiability modulo theories (SMT) solving. In many cases, without such simplification, finding a valid Lyapunov function is often infeasible. When strict Lyapunov functions are unavailable, we design synthesis procedures for finding weak Lyapunov functions to verify global asymptotic stability using LaSalle's invariance principle. Finally, we encode instability conditions for Lyapunov functions and develop SMT procedures to disprove global asymptotic stability. Through a series of examples, we demonstrate that the proposed symbolic reduction, LaSalle-type conditions, and instability tests allow us to efficiently solve many cases that would otherwise be challenging.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Hybrid Modeling: Incremental Identification and Model Predictive Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mathematical models are crucial for optimizing and controlling chemical processes, yet they often face significant limitations in terms of computational time, algorithm complexity, and development costs. Hybrid models, which combine mechanistic models with data-driven models (i.e. models derived via the application of machine learning to experimental data), have emerged as a promising solution to these challenges. However, the identification of dynamic hybrid models remains difficult due to the need to integrate data-driven models within mechanistic model structures. We present an incremental identification approach for dynamic hybrid models that decouples the mechanistic and data-driven components to overcome computational and conceptual difficulties. Our methodology comprises four key steps: (1) regularized dynamic parameter estimation to determine optimal time profiles for flux variables, (2) correlation analysis to evaluate relationships between variables, (3) data-driven model identification using advanced machine learning techniques, and (4) hybrid model integration to combine the mechanistic and data-driven components. This approach facilitates early evaluation of model structure suitability, accelerates the development of hybrid models, and allows for independent identification of data-driven components. Three case studies are presented to illustrate the robustness, reliability, and efficiency of our incremental approach in handling complex systems and scenarios with limited data.</description>

      <title>Near-Optimal Dynamic Policies for Joint Replenishment in Continuous/Discrete Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18491v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While dynamic policies have historically formed the foundation of most influential papers dedicated to the joint replenishment problem, we are still facing profound gaps in our structural understanding of optimal such policies as well as in their surrounding computational questions. To date, the seminal work of Roundy (1985, 1986) and Jackson et al. (1985) remains unsurpassed in efficiently developing provably-good dynamic policies in this context.
  The principal contribution of this paper consists in developing a wide range of algorithmic ideas and analytical insights around the continuous-time joint replenishment problem, culminating in a deterministic framework for efficiently approximating optimal dynamic policies to any desired level of accuracy. These advances enable us to derive a compactly-encoded replenishment policy whose long-run average cost is within factor $1 + \epsilon$ of the dynamic optimum, arriving at an efficient polynomial-time approximation scheme (EPTAS). Technically speaking, our approach hinges on affirmative resolutions to two fundamental open questions:
  -- We devise the first efficient discretization-based framework for approximating the joint replenishment problem. Specifically, we prove that every continuous-time infinite-horizon instance can be reduced to a corresponding discrete-time $O( \frac{ n^3 }{ \epsilon^6 } )$-period instance, while incurring a multiplicative optimality loss of at most $1 + \epsilon$.
  -- Motivated by this relation, we substantially improve on the $O( 2^{2^{O(1/\epsilon)}} \cdot (nT)^{ O(1) } )$-time approximation scheme of Nonner and Sviridenko (2013) for the discrete-time joint replenishment problem. Beyond an exponential improvement in running time, we demonstrate that randomization and hierarchical decompositions can be entirely avoided, while concurrently offering a relatively simple analysis.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Transfer Learning to Overcome Data Limitations in Czochralski Crystal Growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18774v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Czochralski (Cz) method is a widely used process for growing high-quality single crystals, critical for applications in semiconductors, optics, and advanced materials. Achieving optimal growth conditions requires precise control of process and furnace design parameters. Still, data scarcity -- especially for new materials -- limits the application of machine learning (ML) in predictive modeling and optimization. This study proposes a transfer learning approach to overcome this limitation by adapting ML models trained on a higher data volume of one source material (Si) to a lower data volume of another target material (Ge and GaAs). The materials were deliberately selected to assess the robustness of the transfer learning approach in handling varying data similarity, with Cz-Ge being similar to Cz-Si, and GaAs grown via the liquid encapsulated Czochralski method (LEC), which differs from Cz-Si. We explore various transfer learning strategies, including Warm Start, Merged Training, and Hyperparameters Transfer, and evaluate multiple ML architectures across two different materials. Our results demonstrate that transfer learning significantly enhances predictive accuracy with minimal data, providing a practical framework for optimizing Cz growth parameters across diverse materials.</description>

      <title>Multi-Agent Online Control with Adversarial Disturbances</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-agent control problems involving a large number of agents with competing and time-varying objectives are increasingly prevalent in applications across robotics, economics, and energy systems. In this paper, we study online control in multi-agent linear dynamical systems with disturbances. In contrast to most prior work in multi-agent control, we consider an online setting where disturbances are adversarial and where each agent seeks to minimize its own, adversarial sequence of convex losses. In this setting, we investigate the robustness of gradient-based controllers from single-agent online control, with a particular focus on understanding how individual regret guarantees are influenced by the number of agents in the system. Under minimal communication assumptions, we prove near-optimal sublinear regret bounds that hold uniformly for all agents. Finally, when the objectives of the agents are aligned, we show that the multi-agent control problem induces a time-varying potential game for which we derive equilibrium gap guarantees.</description>

      <title>A model predictive control framework with robust stability guarantees under large disturbances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.10216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.10216v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To address feasibility issues in model predictive control (MPC), most implementations relax state constraints by using slack variables and adding a penalty to the cost. We propose an alternative strategy: relaxing the initial state constraint with a penalty. Compared to state-of-the-art soft constrained MPC formulations, the proposed formulation has two key features: (i) input-to-state stability and bounds on the cumulative constraint violation for large disturbances; (ii) close-to-optimal performance under nominal operating conditions. The idea is initially presented for open-loop asymptotically stable nonlinear systems by designing the penalty as a Lyapunov function, but we also show how to relax this condition to: i) Lyapunov stable systems; ii) stabilizable systems; and iii) utilizing an implicit characterization of the Lyapunov function. In the special case of linear systems, the proposed MPC formulation reduces to a quadratic program, and the offline design and online computational complexity are only marginally increased compared to a nominal design. Numerical examples demonstrate benefits compared to state-of-the-art soft-constrained MPC formulations.</description>

      <title>Bounding-Focused Discretization Methods for the Global Optimization of Nonconvex Semi-Infinite Programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.00219v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use sensitivity analysis to design bounding-focused discretization (cutting-surface) methods for the global optimization of nonconvex semi-infinite programs (SIPs). We begin by formulating the optimal bounding-focused discretization of SIPs as a max-min problem and propose variants that are more computationally tractable. We then use parametric sensitivity theory to design an effective heuristic approach for solving these max-min problems. We also show how our new iterative discretization methods may be modified to ensure that the solutions of their discretizations converge to an optimal solution of the SIP. We then formulate optimal bounding-focused generalized discretization of SIPs as max-min problems and design heuristic algorithms for their solution. Numerical experiments on standard nonconvex SIP test instances from the literature demonstrate that our new bounding-focused discretization methods can significantly reduce the number of iterations for convergence relative to a state-of-the-art feasibility-focused discretization method.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Pricing for Reusable Resources: The Power of Two Prices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.13822v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by real-world applications such as rental and cloud computing services, we investigate pricing for reusable resources. We consider a system where a single resource with a fixed number of identical copies serves customers with heterogeneous willingness-to-pay (WTP), and the usage duration distribution is general. Optimal dynamic policies are computationally intractable when usage durations are not memoryless, so existing literature has focused on static pricing, which incurs a steady-state performance loss of ${O}(\sqrt{c})$ compared to optimality when supply and demand scale with $c$. We propose a class of dynamic "stock-dependent" policies that 1) are computationally tractable and 2) can attain a steady-state performance loss of $o(\sqrt{c})$. We give parametric bounds based on the local shape of the reward function at the optimal fluid admission probability and show that the performance loss of stock-dependent policies can be as low as ${O}((\log{c})^2)$. We characterize the tight performance loss for stock-dependent policies and show that they can in fact be achieved by a simple two-price policy that sets a higher price when the stock is below some threshold and a lower price otherwise. We extend our results to settings with multiple resources and multiple customer classes. Finally, we demonstrate this "minimally dynamic" class of two-price policies performs well numerically, even in non-asymptotic settings, suggesting that a little dynamicity can go a long way.</description>

      <title>Quasioptimal alternating projections and their use in low-rank approximation of matrices and tensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.16097v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the convergence of specific inexact alternating projections for two non-convex sets in a Euclidean space. The $\sigma$-quasioptimal metric projection ($\sigma \geq 1$) of a point $x$ onto a set $A$ consists of points in $A$ the distance to which is at most $\sigma$ times larger than the minimal distance $\mathrm{dist}(x,A)$. We prove that quasioptimal alternating projections, when one or both projections are quasioptimal, converge locally and linearly for super-regular sets with transversal intersection. The theory is motivated by the successful application of alternating projections to low-rank matrix and tensor approximation. We focus on two problems -- nonnegative low-rank approximation and low-rank approximation in the maximum norm -- and develop fast alternating-projection algorithms for matrices and tensor trains based on cross approximation and acceleration techniques. The numerical experiments confirm that the proposed methods are efficient and suggest that they can be used to regularise various low-rank computational routines.</description>

      <title>LieDetect: Detection of representation orbits of compact Lie groups from point clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.03086v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We suggest a new algorithm to estimate representations of compact Lie groups from finite samples of their orbits. Different from other reported techniques, our method allows the retrieval of the precise representation type as a direct sum of irreducible representations. Moreover, the knowledge of the representation type permits the reconstruction of its orbit, which is useful for identifying the Lie group that generates the action, from a finite list of candidates. Our algorithm is general for any compact Lie group, but only instantiations for SO(2), T^d, SU(2), and SO(3) are considered. Theoretical guarantees of robustness in terms of Hausdorff and Wasserstein distances are derived. Our tools are drawn from geometric measure theory, computational geometry, and optimization on matrix manifolds. The algorithm is tested for synthetic data up to dimension 32, as well as real-life applications in image analysis, harmonic analysis, density estimation, equivariant neural networks, chemical conformational spaces, and classical mechanics systems, achieving very accurate results.</description>

      <title>Distributed Optimization of Clique-Wise Coupled Problems via Three-Operator Splitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.18625v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study explores distributed optimization problems with clique-wise coupling via operator splitting and how we can utilize this framework for performance analysis and enhancement. This framework extends beyond conventional pairwise coupled problems (e.g., consensus optimization) and is applicable to broader examples. To this end, we first introduce a new distributed optimization algorithm by leveraging a clique-based matrix and the Davis-Yin splitting (DYS), a versatile three-operator splitting method. We then demonstrate that this approach sheds new light on conventional algorithms in the following way: (i) Existing algorithms (NIDS, Exact diffusion, diffusion, and our previous work) can be derived from our proposed method; (ii) We present a new mixing matrix based on clique-wise coupling, which surfaces when deriving the NIDS. We prove its preferable distribution of eigenvalues, enabling fast consensus; (iii) These observations yield a new linear convergence rate for the NIDS with non-smooth objective functions. Remarkably our linear rate is first established for the general DYS with a projection for a subspace. This case is not covered by any prior results, to our knowledge. Finally, numerical examples showcase the efficacy of our proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Drift Control with Discretionary Stopping for a Diffusion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.10043v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider stochastic control with discretionary stopping for the drift of a diffusion process over an infinite time horizon. The objective is to choose a control process and a stopping time to minimize the expectation of a convex terminal cost in the presence of a fixed operating cost and a control-dependent running cost per unit of elapsed time. Under appropriate conditions on the coefficients of the controlled diffusion, an optimal pair of control and stopping rules is shown to exist. Moreover, under the same assumptions, it is shown that the optimal control is a constant which can be computed fairly explicitly; and that it is optimal to stop the first time an appropriate interval is visited. We consider also a constrained version of the above problem, in which an upper bound on the expectation of available stopping times is imposed; we show that this constrained problem can be reduced to an unconstrained problem with some appropriate change of parameters and, as a result, solved by similar arguments.</description>

Abstract: This paper is concerned with the study of a family of fixed point iterations combining relaxation with different inertial (acceleration) principles. We provide a systematic, unified and insightful analysis of the hypotheses that ensure their weak, strong and linear convergence, either matching or improving previous results obtained by analysing particular cases separately. We also show that these methods are robust with respect to different kinds of perturbations--which may come from computational errors, intentional deviations, as well as regularisation or approximation schemes--under surprisingly weak assumptions. Although we mostly focus on theoretical aspects, numerical illustrations in image inpainting and electricity production markets reveal possible trends in the behaviour of these types of methods.</description>

      <title>A Globally Convergent Gradient Method with Momentum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17613v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we consider smooth unconstrained optimization problems and we deal with the class of gradient methods with momentum, i.e., descent algorithms where the search direction is defined as a linear combination of the current gradient and the preceding search direction. This family of algorithms includes nonlinear conjugate gradient methods and Polyak's heavy-ball approach, and is thus of high practical and theoretical interest in large-scale nonlinear optimization. We propose a general framework where the scalars of the linear combination defining the search direction are computed simultaneously by minimizing the approximate quadratic model in the 2 dimensional subspace. This strategy allows us to define a class of gradient methods with momentum enjoying global convergence guarantees and an optimal worst-case complexity bound in the nonconvex setting. Differently than all related works in the literature, the convergence conditions are stated in terms of the Hessian matrix of the bi-dimensional quadratic model. To the best of our knowledge, these results are novel to the literature. Moreover, extensive computational experiments show that the gradient method with momentum here presented is a solid choice to tackle some classes of nonconvex unconstrained problems.</description>

      <title>Evolution of Measures in Nonsmooth Dynamical Systems: Formalisms and Computation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09189v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article develops mathematical formalisms and provides numerical methods for studying the evolution of measures in nonsmooth dynamical systems using the continuity equation. The nonsmooth dynamical system is described by an evolution variational inequality and we derive the continuity equation associated with this system class using three different formalisms. The first formalism consists of using the {superposition principle} to describe the continuity equation for a measure that disintegrates into a probability measure supported on the set of vector fields and another measure representing the distribution of system trajectories at each time instant. The second formalism is based on the regularization of the nonsmooth vector field and describing the measure as the limit of a sequence of measures associated with the regularization parameter. In doing so, we obtain quantitative bounds on the Wasserstein metric between measure solutions of the regularized vector field and the limiting measure associated with the nonsmooth vector field. The third formalism uses a time-stepping algorithm to model a time-discretized evolution of the measures and show that the absolutely continuous trajectories associated with the continuity equation are recovered in the limit as the sampling time goes to zero. We also validate each formalism with numerical examples. For the first formalism, we use polynomial optimization techniques and the moment-SOS hierarchy to obtain approximate moments of the measures. For the second formalism, we illustrate the bounds on the Wasserstein metric for an academic example for which the closed-form expression of the Wasserstein metric can be calculated. For the third formalism, we illustrate the time-stepping based algorithm for measure evolution on an example that shows the effect of the concentration of measures.</description>

      <title>Optimal Storage Design: An $L^{\infty}$ infused Inventory Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05526v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inventory and queueing systems are often designed by controlling weighted combination of some time-averaged performance metrics (like cumulative holding, shortage, server-utilization or congestion costs); but real-world constraints, like fixed storage or limited waiting space, require attention to peak levels reached during the operating period.
  This work formulates such control problems, which are any arbitrary weighted combination of some integral cost terms and an L-infinity(peak-level) term. The resultant control problem does not fall into standard control framework, nor does it have standard solution in terms of some partial differential equations. We introduce an auxiliary state variable to track the instantaneous peak-levels, enabling reformulation into the classical framework. We then propose a smooth approximation to handle the resultant discontinuities, and show the existence of unique value function that uniquely solves the corresponding Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation. We apply this framework to two key applications to obtain an optimal design that includes controlling the peak-levels. Surprisingly, the numerical results show peak inventory can be minimized with negligible revenue loss (under 6%); without considering peak-control, the peak levels were significantly higher. The peak-optimal policies for queueing-system can reduce peak-congestion by up to 27%, however, at the expense of higher cumulative-congestion costs. Thus, for inventory-control, the performance of the average-terms did not degrade much, while the same is not true for queueing-system. Hence, one would require a judiciously chosen weighted design of all the costs involved including the peak-levels for any application and such a design can now be derived numerically using the proposed framework.</description>

      <title>Examples of small-time controllable Schr\"odinger equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05698v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A variety of physically relevant bilinear Schr\"odinger equations are known to be approximately controllable in large times. There are however examples which are approximately controllable in large times, but not in small times. This obstruction happens e.g. in the presence of (sub)quadratic potentials, because Gaussian states are preserved, at least for small times.
  In this work, we provide the first examples of small-time approximately controllable bilinear Schr\"odinger equations. In particular, we show that a control on the frequency of a quadratic potential permits to construct approximate solutions that evolve arbitrarily fast along space-dilations. Once we have access to space-dilations, we can exploit them to generate time-contractions. In this way, we build on previous results of large-time control, to obtain control in small times.</description>

      <title>Completely Parameter-Free Single-Loop Algorithms for Nonconvex-Concave Minimax Problems</title>

Abstract: Due to their importance in various emerging applications, efficient algorithms for solving minimax problems have recently received increasing attention. However, many existing algorithms require prior knowledge of the problem parameters in order to achieve optimal iteration complexity. In this paper, three completely parameter-free single-loop algorithms, namely PF-AGP-NSC algorithm, PF-AGP-NC algorithm and PF-AGP-NL algorithm, are proposed to solve the smooth nonconvex-strongly concave, nonconvex-concave minimax problems and nonconvex-linear minimax problems respectively using line search without requiring any prior knowledge about parameters such as the Lipschtiz constant $L$ or the strongly concave modulus $\mu$. Furthermore, we prove that the total number of gradient calls required to obtain an $\varepsilon$-stationary point for the PF-AGP-NSC algorithm, the PF-AGP-NC algorithm, and the PF-AGP-NL algorithm are upper bounded by $\mathcal{O}\left( L^2\kappa^3\varepsilon^{-2} \right)$, $\mathcal{O}\left( \log^2(L)L^4\varepsilon^{-4} \right)$, and $\mathcal{O}\left( L^3\varepsilon^{-3} \right)$, respectively, where $\kappa$ is the condition number. To the best of our knowledge, PF-AGP-NC and PF-AGP-NL are the first completely parameter-free algorithms for solving nonconvex-concave and nonconvex-linear minimax problems, respectively. PF-AGP-NSC is a completely parameter-free algorithm for solving nonconvex-strongly concave minimax problems, achieving the best known complexity with respect to $\varepsilon$. Numerical results demonstrate the efficiency of the three proposed algorithms.</description>

      <title>Complexity of trust-region methods in the presence of unbounded Hessian approximations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06243v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend traditional complexity analyses of trust-region methods for unconstrained, possibly nonconvex, optimization. Whereas most complexity analyses assume uniform boundedness of the model Hessians, we work with potentially unbounded model Hessians. Boundedness is not guaranteed in practical implementations, in particular ones based on quasi-Newton updates such as PSB, BFGS and SR1. Our analysis is conducted for a family of trust-region methods that includes most known methods as special cases. We examine two regimes of Hessian growth: one bounded by a power of the number of successful iterations, and one bounded by a power of the number of iterations. This allows us to formalize and address the intuition of Powell [IMA J. Numer. Ana. 30(1):289-301,2010], who studied convergence under a special case of our assumptions, but whose proof contained complexity arguments. Specifically, for \(0 \leq p &lt; 1\), we establish sharp \(O([(1-p)\epsilon^{-2}]^{1/(1-p)})\) evaluation complexity to find an \(\epsilon\)-stationary point when model Hessians are \(O(|\mathcal{S}_{k-1}|^p)\), where \(|\mathcal{S}_{k-1}|\) is the number of iterations where the step was accepted, up to iteration \(k-1\). For \(p = 1\), which is the case studied by Powell, we establish a sharp \(O(\exp(c_1\epsilon^{-2}))\) evaluation complexity for a certain constant \(c_1 &gt; 0\). We establish similar sharp bounds when model Hessians are \(O(k^p)\), where \(k\) is the iteration counter, for \(0 \leq p &lt; 1\). When \(p = 1\), the complexity bound depends on the parameters of the family, but reduces to \(O((1 - \log(\epsilon))\exp(c_2\epsilon^{-2}))\) for a certain constant \(c_2 &gt; 0\) for the special case of the standard trust-region method. As special cases, we derive novel complexity bounds for (strongly) convex objectives under the same growth assumptions.</description>

      <title>Finite Dimensional Projections of HJB Equations in the Wasserstein Space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07688v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper continues the study of controlled interacting particle systems with common noise started in [W. Gangbo, S. Mayorga and A. \'{S}wi\k{e}ch, SIAM J. Math. Anal. 53 (2021), no. 2, 1320--1356] and [S. Mayorga and A. \'{S}wi\k{e}ch, SIAM J. Control Optim. 61 (2023), no. 2, 820--851]. First, we extend the following results of the previously mentioned works to the case of multiplicative noise: (i) We generalize the convergence of the value functions $u_n$ corresponding to control problems of $n$ particles to the value function $V$ corresponding to an appropriately defined infinite dimensional control problem; (ii) we prove, under certain additional assumptions, $C^{1,1}$ regularity of $V$ in the spatial variable. The second main contribution of the present work is the proof that if $DV$ is continuous (which, in particular, includes the previously proven case of $C^{1,1}$ regularity in the spatial variable), the value function $V$ projects precisely onto the value functions $u_n$. Using this projection property, we show that optimal controls of the finite dimensional problem correspond to optimal controls of the infinite dimensional problem and vice versa. In the case of a linear state equation, we are able to prove that $V$ projects precisely onto the value functions $u_n$ under relaxed assumptions on the coefficients of the cost functional by using approximation techniques in the Wasserstein space, thus covering cases where $V$ may not be differentiable.</description>

      <title>Discrete-Time LQ Stochastic Two-Person Nonzero-Sum Difference Games with Random Coefficients:~Open-Loop Nash Equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01741v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a pioneering investigation into discrete-time two-person non-zero-sum linear quadratic (LQ) stochastic games with random coefficients. We derive necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of open-loop Nash equilibria using convex variational calculus. To obtain explicit expressions for the Nash equilibria, we introduce fully coupled forward-backward stochastic difference equations (FBS$\Delta$E, for short), which provide a dual characterization of these Nash equilibria. Additionally, we develop non-symmetric stochastic Riccati equations that decouple the stochastic Hamiltonian system for each player, enabling the derivation of closed-loop feedback forms for open-loop Nash equilibrium strategies. A notable aspect of this research is the complete randomness of the coefficients, which results in the corresponding Riccati equations becoming fully nonlinear higher-order backward stochastic difference equations. It distinguishes our non-zero-sum difference game from the deterministic case, where the Riccati equations reduce to algebraic forms.</description>

      <title>Convex Constrained Controller Synthesis for Evolution Equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02658v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a convex controller synthesis framework for a large class of constrained linear systems, including those described by (deterministic and stochastic) partial differential equations and integral equations, commonly used in fluid dynamics, thermo-mechanical systems, quantum control, or transportation networks. Most existing control techniques rely on a (finite-dimensional) discrete description of the system, via ordinary differential equations. Here, we work instead with more general (infinite-dimensional) Hilbert spaces. This enables the discretization to be applied after the optimization (optimize-then-discretize). Using output-feedback SLS, we formulate the controller synthesis as a convex optimization problem. Structural constraints like sensor and communication delays, and locality constraints, are incorporated while preserving convexity, allowing parallel implementation and extending key SLS properties to infinite dimensions. The proposed approach and its benefits are demonstrated on a linear Boltzmann equation.</description>

      <title>Bishop-Phelps Type Scalarization for Vector Optimization in Real Topological-Linear Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10026v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well-known that scalarization techniques (e.g., in the sense of Gerstewitz; Kasimbeyli; Pascoletti and Serafini; Zaffaroni) are useful for generating (weakly, properly) efficient solutions of vector optimization problems. One recognized approach is the conic scalarization method in vector optimization in real normed spaces proposed by Kasimbeyli (2010, SIAM J Optim 20), which is based on augmented dual cones and Bishop-Phelps type (norm-linear) scalarizing functions. In this paper, we present new results on cone separation in real topological-linear spaces by using Bishop-Phelps type separating cones / separating seminorm-linear functions. Moreover, we study some extensions of known scalarization results in vector optimization (in the sense of Eichfelder; Gerstewitz; Jahn; Kasimbeyli; Pascoletti and Serafini). On this basis, we propose a Bishop-Phelps type scalarization method for vector optimization problems in real topological-linear spaces, which is based on Bishop-Phelps type cone representing and cone monotone scalarizing functions (e.g., Gerstewitz scalarizing functions or seminorm-linear scalarizing functions). Thus, our method also extends Kasimbeyli's conic scalarization method from real normed spaces to real topological-linear spaces. Within this framework, we derive new Bishop-Phelps type scalarization results for the concepts of weak efficiency and different types of proper efficiency.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Proximal Gradient Descent via Silver Stepsizes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05497v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Surprisingly, recent work has shown that gradient descent can be accelerated without using momentum -- just by judiciously choosing stepsizes. An open question raised by several papers is whether this phenomenon of stepsize-based acceleration holds more generally for constrained and/or composite convex optimization via projected and/or proximal versions of gradient descent. We answer this in the affirmative by proving that the silver stepsize schedule yields analogously accelerated rates in these settings. These rates are conjectured to be asymptotically optimal among all stepsize schedules, and match the silver convergence rate of vanilla gradient descent (Altschuler and Parrilo, 2024, 2025), namely $O(\varepsilon^{- \log_{\rho} 2})$ for smooth convex optimization and $O(\kappa^{\log_\rho 2} \log \frac{1}{\varepsilon})$ under strong convexity, where $\varepsilon$ is the precision, $\kappa$ is the condition number, and $\rho = 1 + \sqrt{2}$ is the silver ratio. The key technical insight is the combination of recursive gluing -- the technique underlying all analyses of gradient descent accelerated with time-varying stepsizes -- with a certain Laplacian-structured sum-of-squares certificate for the analysis of proximal point updates.</description>

      <title>Alternating Gradient-Type Algorithm for Bilevel Optimization with Inexact Lower-Level Solutions via Moreau Envelope-based Reformulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18929v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a class of bilevel optimization problems where the lower-level problem is a convex composite optimization model, which arises in various applications, including bilevel hyperparameter selection for regularized regression models. To solve these problems, we propose an Alternating Gradient-type algorithm with Inexact Lower-level Solutions (AGILS) based on a Moreau envelope-based reformulation of the bilevel optimization problem. The proposed algorithm does not require exact solutions of the lower-level problem at each iteration, improving computational efficiency. We prove the convergence of AGILS to stationary points and, under the Kurdyka-{\L}ojasiewicz (KL) property, establish its sequential convergence. Numerical experiments, including a toy example and a bilevel hyperparameter selection problem for the sparse group Lasso model, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed AGILS.</description>

      <title>Infinite Horizon Fully Coupled Nonlinear Forward-Backward Stochastic Difference Equations and Their Application to LQ Optimal Control Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04603v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper focuses on the study of infinite horizon fully coupled nonlinear forward-backward stochastic difference equations (FBS$\bigtriangleup$Es). Firstly, we establish a pair of priori estimates for the solutions to forward stochastic difference equations (S$\bigtriangleup$Es) and backward stochastic difference equations (BS$\bigtriangleup$Es), respectively. Then, to achieve broader applicability, we utilize a set of domination-monotonicity conditions that are more lenient than standard assumptions. Using these conditions, we apply continuation methods to prove the unique solvability of infinite horizon fully coupled FBS$\bigtriangleup$Es and derive a set of solution estimates. Furthermore, our results have considerable implications for a variety of related linear quadratic (LQ) problems, especially when the stochastic Hamiltonian system is consistent with FBS$\bigtriangleup$Es satisfying the introduced domination-monotonicity conditions. Thus, by solving the associated stochastic Hamiltonian system, we explicitly characterize the unique optimal control. This is the first work establishing solvability of fully coupled nonlinear FBS$\bigtriangleup$Es under domination-monotonicity conditions in infinite horizon discrete-time setting.</description>

      <title>A Linear Parameter-Varying Framework for the Analysis of Time-Varying Optimization Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07461v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we propose a framework to analyze iterative first-order optimization algorithms for time-varying convex optimization. We assume that the temporal variability is caused by a time-varying parameter entering the objective, which can be measured at the time of decision but whose future values are unknown. We consider the case of strongly convex objective functions with Lipschitz continuous gradients under a convex constraint set. We model the algorithms as discrete-time linear parameter varying (LPV) systems in feedback with monotone operators such as the time-varying gradient. We leverage the approach of analyzing algorithms as uncertain control interconnections with integral quadratic constraints (IQCs) and generalize that framework to the time-varying case. We propose novel IQCs that are capable of capturing the behavior of time-varying nonlinearities and leverage techniques from the LPV literature to establish novel bounds on the tracking error. Quantitative bounds can be computed by solving a semi-definite program and can be interpreted as an input-to-state stability result with respect to a disturbance signal which increases with the temporal variability of the problem. As a departure from results in this research area, our bounds introduce a dependence on different additional measures of temporal variations, such as the function value and gradient rate of change. We exemplify our main results with numerical experiments that showcase how our analysis framework is able to capture convergence rates of different first-order algorithms for time-varying optimization through the choice of IQC and rate bounds.</description>

Abstract: Copositive matrices and copositive polynomials are objects from optimization. We connect these to the geometry of Feynman integrals in physics. The integral is guaranteed to converge if its kinematic parameters lie in the copositive cone. P\'olya's method makes this manifest. We study the copositive cone for the second Symanzik polynomial of any Feynman graph. Its algebraic boundary is described by Landau discriminants.</description>

Abstract: For a class of path-dependent stochastic evolution equations driven by cylindrical $Q$-Wiener process, we study the Pontryagin's maximum principle for the stochastic recursive optimal control problem. In this infinite-dimensional control system, the state process depends on its past trajectory, the control is delayed via an integral with respect to a general finite measure, and the final cost relies on the delayed state.To obtain the maximum principle, we introduce a functional adjoint operator for the non-anticipative path derivative and establish the well-posedness of an anticipated backward stochastic evolution equation in the path-dependent form, which serves as the adjoint equation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.04420v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work develops and analyzes a novel fractional-order chemostat system (FOCS) with a Caputo fractional derivative (CFD) featuring a sliding memory window and periodic boundary conditions (PBCs), designed to model microbial pollutant degradation in sustainable water treatment. By incorporating the Caputo fractional derivative with sliding memory (CFDS), the model captures time-dependent behaviors and memory effects in biological systems more realistically than classical integer-order formulations. We reduce the two-dimensional fractional differential equations (FDEs) governing substrate and biomass concentrations to a one-dimensional FDE by utilizing the PBCs. The existence and uniqueness of non-trivial, periodic solutions are established using the Caratheodory framework and fixed-point theorems, ensuring the system's well-posedness. We prove the positivity and boundedness of solutions, demonstrating that substrate concentrations remain within physically meaningful bounds and biomass concentrations stay strictly positive, with solution trajectories confined to a biologically feasible invariant set. Additionally, we analyze non-trivial equilibria under constant dilution rates and derive their stability properties. The rigorous mathematical results confirm the viability of FOCS models for representing memory-driven, periodic bioprocesses, offering a foundation for advanced water treatment strategies that align with Sustainable Development Goal 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.11513v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a family of convex quadratic programs in which the coefficients of the linear objective term and the righthand side of the constraints are affine functions of a parameter. It is well known that the solution of such a parametrized quadratic program is a piecewise affine function of the parameter. The number of (polyhedral) regions in the solution map can grow exponentially in problem size, but when the number of regions is moderate, a so-called explicit solver is practical. Such a solver computes the coefficients of the affine functions and the linear inequalities defining the polyhedral regions offline; to solve a problem instance online it simply evaluates this explicit solution map. Potential advantages of an explicit solver over a more general purpose iterative solver can include transparency, interpretability, reliability, and speed. In this paper we describe how code generation can be used to automatically generate an explicit solver from a high level description of a parametrized quadratic program. Our method has been implemented in the open-source software CVXPYgen, which is part of CVXPY, a domain specific language for general convex optimization.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we present a new characterization of symmetric $H^+$-tensors. It is known that a symmetric tensor is an $H^+$-tensor if and only if it is a generalized diagonally dominant tensor with nonnegative diagonal elements. By exploring the diagonal dominance property, we derive new necessary and sufficient conditions for a symmetric tensor to be an $H^+$-tensor. Based on these conditions, we propose a novel method that allows to check if a tensor is a symmetric $H^+$-tensor in polynomial time. Moreover, these results can be applied to the closely related and important class of $M$-tensors. In particular, this allows to efficiently compute the minimum $H$-eigenvalue of symmetric $M$-tensors. Furthermore, we show how this latter result can be used to provide tighter lower bounds for the minimum $H$-eigenvalue of the Fan product of two symmetric $M$-tensors.</description>

      <title>On the fast convergence of minibatch heavy ball momentum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.07553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.07553v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simple stochastic momentum methods are widely used in machine learning optimization, but their good practical performance is at odds with an absence of theoretical guarantees of acceleration in the literature. In this work, we aim to close the gap between theory and practice by showing that stochastic heavy ball momentum retains the fast linear rate of (deterministic) heavy ball momentum on quadratic optimization problems, at least when minibatching with a sufficiently large batch size. The algorithm we study can be interpreted as an accelerated randomized Kaczmarz algorithm with minibatching and heavy ball momentum. The analysis relies on carefully decomposing the momentum transition matrix, and using new spectral norm concentration bounds for products of independent random matrices. We provide numerical illustrations demonstrating that our bounds are reasonably sharp.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Method for Extracting the Shortest Path from the Dubins Set for Short Distances Between Initial and Final Positions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.07565v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Path planning is crucial for the efficient operation of Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMRs) in factory environments. Many existing algorithms rely on Dubins paths, which have been adapted for various applications. However, an efficient method for directly determining the shortest Dubins path remains underdeveloped. This paper presents a comprehensive approach to efficiently identify the shortest path within the Dubins set. We classify the initial and final configurations into six equivalency groups based on the quadrants formed by their orientation angle pairs. Paths within each group exhibit shared topological properties, enabling a reduction in the number of candidate cases to analyze. This pre-classification step simplifies the problem and eliminates the need to explicitly compute and compare the lengths of all possible paths. As a result, the proposed method significantly lowers computational complexity. Extensive experiments confirm that our approach consistently outperforms existing methods in terms of computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Auto-Lesion Segmentation with a Novel Intensity Dark Channel Prior for COVID-19 Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.12638v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: During the COVID-19 pandemic, medical imaging techniques like computed tomography (CT) scans have demonstrated effectiveness in combating the rapid spread of the virus. Therefore, it is crucial to conduct research on computerized models for the detection of COVID-19 using CT imaging. A novel processing method has been developed, utilizing radiomic features, to assist in the CT-based diagnosis of COVID-19. Given the lower specificity of traditional features in distinguishing between different causes of pulmonary diseases, the objective of this study is to develop a CT-based radiomics framework for the differentiation of COVID-19 from other lung diseases. The model is designed to focus on outlining COVID-19 lesions, as traditional features often lack specificity in this aspect. The model categorizes images into three classes: COVID-19, non-COVID-19, or normal. It employs enhancement auto-segmentation principles using intensity dark channel prior (IDCP) and deep neural networks (ALS-IDCP-DNN) within a defined range of analysis thresholds. A publicly available dataset comprising COVID-19, normal, and non-COVID-19 classes was utilized to validate the proposed model's effectiveness. The best performing classification model, Residual Neural Network with 50 layers (Resnet-50), attained an average accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score of 98.8%, 99%, 98%, and 98% respectively. These results demonstrate the capability of our model to accurately classify COVID-19 images, which could aid radiologists in diagnosing suspected COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, our model's performance surpasses that of more than 10 current state-of-the-art studies conducted on the same dataset.</description>

      <title>Nonparametric Steady-State Learning for Nonlinear Output Feedback Regulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16170v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article addresses the nonadaptive and robust output regulation problem of the general nonlinear output feedback system with error output. The global robust output regulation problem for a class of general output feedback nonlinear systems with an uncertain exosystem and high relative degree can be tackled by constructing a linear generic internal model, provided that a continuous nonlinear mapping exists. Leveraging the proposed nonadaptive framework facilitates the conversion of the nonlinear robust output regulation problem into a robust nonadaptive stabilization formulation for the augmented system endowed with Input-to-State Stable dynamics. This approach removes the need for constructing a specific Lyapunov function with positive semi-definite derivatives and avoids the common assumption of linear parameterization of the nonlinear system. The nonadaptive approach is extended by incorporating the nonparametric learning framework to ensure the feasibility of the nonlinear mapping, which can be tackled using a data-driven method. Moreover, the introduced nonparametric learning framework allows the controlled system to learn the dynamics of the steady-state input behaviour from the signal generated from the internal model with the output error as the feedback. As a result, the nonadaptive/nonparametric approach can be advantageous to guarantee the convergence of the estimation and tracking error even when the underlying controlled system dynamics are complex or poorly understood. The effectiveness of the theoretical results is illustrated for a benchmark example: a controlled duffing system and two practical examples: a continuously stirred tank reactor and a continuous bioreactor.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04655v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Model mismatch and process noise are two frequently occurring phenomena that can drastically affect the performance of model predictive control (MPC) in practical applications. We propose a principled way to tune the cost function and the constraints of linear MPC schemes to improve the closed-loop performance and robust constraint satisfaction on uncertain nonlinear dynamics with additive noise. The tuning is performed using a novel MPC tuning algorithm based on backpropagation developed in our earlier work. Using the scenario approach, we provide probabilistic bounds on the likelihood of closed-loop constraint violation over a finite horizon. We showcase the effectiveness of the proposed method on linear and nonlinear simulation examples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07098v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explicitly construct zero loss neural network classifiers. We write the weight matrices and bias vectors in terms of cumulative parameters, which determine truncation maps acting recursively on input space. The configurations for the training data considered are (i) sufficiently small, well separated clusters corresponding to each class, and (ii) equivalence classes which are sequentially linearly separable. In the best case, for $Q$ classes of data in $\mathbb{R}^M$, global minimizers can be described with $Q(M+2)$ parameters.</description>

      <title>Curse of Dimensionality in Neural Network Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05360v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper demonstrates that when a shallow neural network with a Lipschitz continuous activation function is trained using either empirical or population risk to approximate a target function that is $r$ times continuously differentiable on $[0,1]^d$, the population risk may not decay at a rate faster than $t^{-\frac{4r}{d-2r}}$, where $t$ is an analog of the total number of optimization iterations. This result highlights the presence of the curse of dimensionality in the optimization computation required to achieve a desired accuracy. Instead of analyzing parameter evolution directly, the training dynamics are examined through the evolution of the parameter distribution under the 2-Wasserstein gradient flow. Furthermore, it is established that the curse of dimensionality persists when a locally Lipschitz continuous activation function is employed, where the Lipschitz constant in $[-x,x]$ is bounded by $O(x^\delta)$ for any $x \in \mathbb{R}$. In this scenario, the population risk is shown to decay at a rate no faster than $t^{-\frac{(4+2\delta)r}{d-2r}}$. Understanding how function smoothness influences the curse of dimensionality in neural network optimization theory is an important and underexplored direction that this work aims to address.</description>

      <title>When to Forget? Complexity Trade-offs in Machine Unlearning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17323v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine Unlearning (MU) aims at removing the influence of specific data points from a trained model, striving to achieve this at a fraction of the cost of full model retraining. In this paper, we analyze the efficiency of unlearning methods and establish the first upper and lower bounds on minimax computation times for this problem, characterizing the performance of the most efficient algorithm against the most difficult objective function. Specifically, for strongly convex objective functions and under the assumption that the forget data is inaccessible to the unlearning method, we provide a phase diagram for the unlearning complexity ratio -- a novel metric that compares the computational cost of the best unlearning method to full model retraining. The phase diagram reveals three distinct regimes: one where unlearning at a reduced cost is infeasible, another where unlearning is trivial because adding noise suffices, and a third where unlearning achieves significant computational advantages over retraining. These findings highlight the critical role of factors such as data dimensionality, the number of samples to forget, and privacy constraints in determining the practical feasibility of unlearning.</description>

      <title>Locational Energy Storage Bid Bounds for Facilitating Social Welfare Convergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18598v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel method to generate bid bounds that can serve as offer caps for energy storage in electricity markets to help reduce system costs and regulate potential market power exercises. We derive the bid bounds based on a tractable multi-period economic dispatch chance-constrained formulation that systematically incorporates the uncertainty and risk preference of the system operator. The key analytical results verify that the bounds effectively cap storage bids across all uncertainty scenarios with a guaranteed confidence level. We show that bid bounds decrease as the state of charge increases but rise with greater netload uncertainty and risk preference. We test the effectiveness of the proposed pricing mechanism based on the 8-bus ISO-NE test system, including agent-based storage bidding models. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed bid bounds effectively align storage bids with the social welfare objective and outperform existing deterministic bid bounds. Under 30% renewable capacity and 20% storage capacity, the bid bounds contribute to an average reduction of 0.17% in system cost, while increasing storage profit by an average of 10.16% across various system uncertainty scenarios and bidding strategies. These benefits scale up with increased storage economic withholding and storage capacity.</description>

      <title>ASGO: Adaptive Structured Gradient Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20762v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Training deep neural networks is a structured optimization problem, because the parameters are naturally represented by matrices and tensors rather than by vectors. Under this structural representation, it has been widely observed that gradients are low-rank and Hessians are approximately block-wise diagonal. These structured properties are crucial for designing efficient optimization algorithms, but are not utilized by many current popular optimizers like Adam. In this paper, we present a novel optimization algorithm ASGO that capitalizes on these properties by employing a preconditioner that is adaptively updated using structured gradients. By fine-grained theoretical analysis, ASGO is proven to achieve superior convergence rates compared to existing structured gradient methods. Based on the convergence theory, we further demonstrate that ASGO can benefit from the low-rank and block-wise diagonal properties. We also discuss practical modifications of ASGO and empirically verify ASGO's effectiveness on language model tasks.</description>

      <title>Learning to Insert for Constructive Neural Vehicle Routing Solver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13904v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural Combinatorial Optimisation (NCO) is a promising learning-based approach for solving Vehicle Routing Problems (VRPs) without extensive manual design. While existing constructive NCO methods typically follow an appending-based paradigm that sequentially adds unvisited nodes to partial solutions, this rigid approach often leads to suboptimal results. To overcome this limitation, we explore the idea of insertion-based paradigm and propose Learning to Construct with Insertion-based Paradigm (L2C-Insert), a novel learning-based method for constructive NCO. Unlike traditional approaches, L2C-Insert builds solutions by strategically inserting unvisited nodes at any valid position in the current partial solution, which can significantly enhance the flexibility and solution quality. The proposed framework introduces three key components: a novel model architecture for precise insertion position prediction, an efficient training scheme for model optimization, and an advanced inference technique that fully exploits the insertion paradigm's flexibility. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world instances of the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) and Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) demonstrate that L2C-Insert consistently achieves superior performance across various problem sizes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13518v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this technical communique, we develop a graphical design procedure for reset controllers for unstable LTI plants based on recent developments on Scaled Relative Graph analysis, yielding an $L_2$-gain performance bound. The stabilizing controller consists of a second order reset element in parallel with a proportional gain. The proposed method goes beyond existing approaches that are limited to stable systems only, providing a well-applicable approach to design problems in practice where the plant is unstable.</description>

      <title>Soft decision trees for survival analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16846v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Decision trees are popular in survival analysis for their interpretability and ability to model complex relationships. Survival trees, which predict the timing of singular events using censored historical data, are typically built through heuristic approaches. Recently, there has been growing interest in globally optimized trees, where the overall tree is trained by minimizing the error function over all its parameters. We propose a new soft survival tree model (SST), with a soft splitting rule at each branch node, trained via a nonlinear optimization formulation amenable to decomposition. Since SSTs provide for every input vector a specific survival function associated to a single leaf node, they satisfy the conditional computation property and inherit the related benefits. SST and the training formulation combine flexibility with interpretability: any smooth survival function (parametric, semiparametric, or nonparametric) estimated through maximum likelihood can be used, and each leaf node of an SST yields a cluster of distinct survival functions which are associated to the data points routed to it. Numerical experiments on 15 well-known datasets show that SSTs, with parametric and spline-based semiparametric survival functions, trained using an adaptation of the node-based decomposition algorithm proposed by Consolo et al. (2024) for soft regression trees, outperform three benchmark survival trees in terms of four widely-used discrimination and calibration measures. SSTs can also be extended to consider group fairness.</description>
