      <title>$2+2=4$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.00058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the observation that $2+2=4$, we consider four-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=2$ superconformal field theories on $S^2\times\Sigma$, turning on a suitable rigid supergravity background. On the one hand, reduction of a four-dimensional theory ${T}$ on a Riemann surface $\Sigma$ leads to a family $\mathscr{F}[{T}, \Sigma]$ of two-dimensional $(2,2)$ unitary SCFTs, a two-dimensional analog of the four-dimensional theories of class $\mathscr{S}$. On the other hand, reduction on $S^2$ yields a non-unitary two-dimensional CFT $\mathscr{C}[{T}]$ whose chiral algebra is the same as the one associated to ${T}$ by the standard SCFT/VOA correspondence. This construction upgrades the vertex operator algebra to a full-fledged two-dimensional CFT. What's more, it leads to a novel 2d/2d correspondence, a "$2+2 = 4$" analog of the "$4+2=6$" AGT correspondence: the $S^2$ partition function of $\mathscr{F}[{T}; \Sigma]$ is computed by correlation functions of $\mathscr{C}[{T}]$ on $\Sigma$. The elliptic genus of $\mathscr{F}[{T}; \Sigma]$ is instead computed by a topological QFT $\mathscr{E}[T]$ on $\Sigma$. A central question is whether one can give a purely two-dimensional presentation of the family $\mathscr{F}[{T}; \Sigma]$ of $(2, 2)$ theories. We propose an algorithm to realize the $(2, 2)$ theories as gauged linear sigma models when ${T}$ is an Argyres-Douglas theory of type $(A_1, A_{2k})$ and $\Sigma$ an $n$-punctured sphere. We perform stringent checks of our conjecture for $k=1$ and $k=2$.</description>

      <title>Diagnosing Critical Behavior in AdS Einstein-Maxwell-Scalar Theory via Holographic Entanglement Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the holographic mixed-state entanglement measures in the Einstein-Maxwell-Scalar (EMS) theory. Several quantities are computed, including the holographic entanglement entropy (HEE), mutual information (MI), entanglement wedge cross-section (EWCS), and butterfly velocity ($v_B$). Our findings demonstrate that these measures can effectively diagnose phase transitions. Notably, EWCS and MI, as mixed-state entanglement measures, exhibit behavior opposite to that of the HEE. Additionally, we study the butterfly velocity, a dynamic quantum information measure, and observe that it behaves differently from the static quantum information measures. We propose that the butterfly velocity is initially dominated by entanglement and subsequently by thermal entropy as the coupling constant increases. Moreover, we examine the scaling behavior of the holographic entanglement measures and find that all the critical exponents are equal to $1$, which is twice that of the scalar field. We also explore the inequality between EWCS and MI, noting that the growth rate of MI consistently exceeds that of EWCS during phase transitions. These features are expected to be universal across thermodynamic phase transitions, with the inequalities becoming more significant as one moves away from the critical point.</description>

      <title>Diagnosing Metal-Insulator and Hawking-Page Transitions: A Mixed-State Entanglement Perspective in Einstein-Born-Infeld-Massive Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study mixed-state entanglement measures in Einstein-Born-Infeld (EN-BI) massive gravity theory, a model exhibiting both Hawking-Page transitions and metal-insulator transitions (MIT) at finite temperatures. Our comprehensive investigation reveals that the entanglement wedge cross-section (EWCS), a novel mixed-state entanglement measure, demonstrates unique properties in detecting phase transitions. For MIT, we find the higher-order terms of EWCS align closely with the critical point, outperforming measures like holographic entanglement entropy (HEE) and mutual information (MI) in finite temperature systems. This enhanced sensitivity provides a more accurate tool for probing quantum phase transitions in strongly correlated systems. In Hawking-Page transitions, we observe that all entanglement measures effectively diagnose both first-order and second-order phase transitions, with EWCS showing configuration-independent behavior. Importantly, we discover that all geometry-related quantities, including entanglement measures, demonstrate a universal critical exponent of 1/3 near the second-order phase transition point, suggesting fundamental connections between quantum information theory and critical phenomena in gravitational systems. Our results highlight EWCS's potential as a powerful probe for phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Soft Algebras in AdS$_4$ from Light Ray Operators in CFT$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flat Minkowski space (M$^4$) and AdS$_4$ can both be conformally mapped to the Einstein cylinder. The maps may be judiciously chosen so that some null generators of the $\mathcal{I}^+$ boundary of M$^4$ coincide with antipodally-terminating null geodesic segments on the boundary of AdS$_4$. Conformally invariant nonabelian gauge theories in M$^4$ have an asymptotic $S$-algebra generated by a tower of soft gluons given by weighted null line integrals on $\mathcal{I}^+$. We show that, under the conformal map to AdS$_4$, the leading soft gluons are dual to light transforms of the conserved global symmetry currents in the boundary CFT$_3$. The tower of light ray operators obtained from the $SO(3,2)$ descendants of this light transform realize a full set of generators of the $S$-algebra in the boundary CFT$_3$. This provides a direct connection between holographic symmetry algebras in M$^4$ and AdS$_4$.</description>

      <title>Equivariant Cohomology, BRST Quantization, and Analytic Localization: A Unified Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper provides a detailed exposition of the two main models for equivariant cohomology -- the Cartan and Weil models -- and their explicit isomorphism via the Kalkman (Mathai--Quillen) transformation. We then connect this framework to the BRST quantization of gauge theories, showing how the BRST complex can be identified with the Cartan model. Viewing both the Kalkman transformation and Witten's Morse-theoretic deformation as gauge-fixing procedures leads naturally to the \emph{equivariant Witten deformation}. This combined perspective yields a transparent analytic proof of the Atiyah--Bott--Berline--Vergne (ABBV) localization formula for integrals of equivariantly closed forms.The theory is richly illustrated with computations on $\mathbb{CP}^1$ and $\mathbb{CP}^n$, supplemented by explicit coordinate calculations.</description>

      <title>Generalized $2$-split for higher-derivative YM and GR amplitudes at tree-level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the generalized $2$-split of higher-derivative amplitudes, including Yang-Mills (YM) and Gravity (GR) amplitudes with special insertions of higher-derivative vertices, by expanding them into ${\rm YM}\oplus{\rm BAS}$, ${\rm GR}\oplus{\rm YM}$, and ${\rm GR}\oplus{\rm YM}\oplus{\rm BAS}$ amplitude, respectively. By leveraging the established $2$-split properties of these constituent theories, we show that these higher-derivative amplitudes -- which also exhibit another newly discovered phenomenon called hidden zero -- do not factorize into a single product of two currents. Instead, their factorization universally appears as a sum of multiple $2$-split contributions.</description>

      <title>Log Soft Constraints on KMOC Formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The KMOC formalism provides a systematic framework for extracting classical observables perturbatively from on-shell scattering amplitudes. In this work, we apply this formalism to compute electromagnetic observables in four dimensions, focusing in particular on the linear memory effect and its tail contributions. Using the leading and subleading soft-photon theorems to construct the soft radiation kernel, we demonstrate how these infrared observables emerge directly from amplitude data. We further show that demanding the expected non-perturbative properties of memory and tail effects imposes a nontrivial set of consistency conditions on the underlying S-matrix. We interpret these constraints as imposing the requirement of macroscopic causality on the S-matrix via analysis of inclusive observables.</description>

      <title>Large-party limit of topological entanglement entropy in Chern-Simons theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the topological entanglement entropy of quantum states arising in the context of three-dimensional Chern-Simons theory with compact gauge group $G$ and Chern-Simons level $k$. We focus on the quantum states associated with the $T_{dm,dn}$ torus link complements, which is a $d$-party pure quantum state, and analyze its large-party limit, i.e., $d\to \infty$ limit. We show that the entanglement measures in this limit will receive contributions only from the Abelian anyons, and non-Abelian sectors are suppressed in the large-party limit. Consequently, the large-party limiting value of the entanglement entropy has an upper bound of $\ln |Z_G|$, where $|Z_G|$ is the order of the center of the group $G$. As an explicit example, we perform quantitative analysis for the simplest case of the SU(2) group and $T_{d,dn}$ torus link to obtain the large-party limit of the entanglement entropy. We further investigate the semiclassical ($k \to \infty$) limit of the entropies after taking the large-party limit for this particular example.</description>

      <title>The JLMS formula in a large code with approximate error correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gauge/gravity duality is often described as a quantum error correcting code. However, as seen in the Jafferis-Lewkowycz-Maldacena-Suh (JLMS) formula, exact quantum error correction with complementary recovery (and thus entanglement wedge reconstruction) emerges only in the limit $G \to 0$. As a result, precise arguments controlling error terms have focused on what we call `small' codes which, as $G \to 0$, describe only perturbative excitations near a given classical solution. Such settings are quite restrictive and, in particular, they prohibit discussion of any modular flow that would change the classical background. As a result, they forbid consideration of modular flows generated by semiclassical bulk states at order-one modular parameters.
  In contrast, we present a single `large' code for the bulk theory that can accommodate such flows and, in particular, in the $G \to 0$ limit includes superpositions of states associated with distinct classical backgrounds. This large code is assembled from small codes that each satisfy an approximate Faulkner-Lewkowycz-Maldacena formula. In this extended setting we clarify the meaning of the (approximate) JLMS relation between bulk and boundary modular Hamiltonians and quantify its validity in an appropriate class of states.</description>

      <title>One loop renormalization of 5D gauge-Yukawa theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The common lore dictates that extra dimensional theories loose predictive power at energies just above the compatification scale, due to the power-law running of bulk coupling. We show that five-dimensional gauge-Yukawa theories can be valid up to arbitrarily high scales, provided: 1) A finite number of terms are required to absorb power-law divergences; 2) All power-law running couplings flow to UV fixed points. By explicitly computing bulk and localized divergences for a gauge-Yukawa theory on $\mathcal{S}^1/\mathbb{Z}_2$, we prove the one-loop renormalization properties of Lagrangians containing only interactions that would be renormalizable in four dimensions. The existence of UV fixed points imposes further constraints on the content of the model. Our results provide a consistency check for the high-energy behavior of any 5D theory, and provide a discrimination between UV consistent models and those that can describe only a handful of Kaluza-Klein modes. Hence, we offer the first concrete step towards an all-order proof of `renormalizability' for gauge-Yukawa theories in five dimensions.</description>

      <title>Effective field theory for dissipative photons from higher-form symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent developments in generalized symmetries have provided new insights into quantum field theories. Within this framework, photons can be understood as Nambu-Goldstone modes associated with a spontaneously broken higher-form symmetry. In this work, we develop an effective field theory that builds on this symmetry structure to describe the real-time dynamics of photons in insulating media at finite temperature. Combining the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism with the generalized coset construction, we formulate a symmetry-based effective action that incorporates both conservative and dissipative effects. The effective theory implements the dynamical Kubo-Martin-Schwinger symmetry, ensuring consistency with the fluctuation-dissipation relation and Onsager's reciprocal relations. Within this framework, we derive the entropy current associated with dissipative photon dynamics and demonstrate the non-negativity of its divergence, in accordance with the second law of thermodynamics. We also clarify the symmetry origin of the gauge redundancy in the unbroken phase within the Schwinger-Keldysh framework, relating it to strong and weak realizations of higher-form symmetries. Our results provide a model-independent effective description of photon dynamics in insulating media at finite temperature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.00662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct in detail the irreducible representations of the BMS group with super rotations in three and four dimensions that have the same rest frame momenta as the massive and massless Poincare point particles. We compare these representations to those of the Poincare group and also to the analogous representations of global BMS. We argue that these extended BMS representations are carried by a string rather than a point particle. The super rotations play a crucial role in our discussions.</description>

      <title>Thermal and Casimir effects in a Lorentz-violating massive scalar field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, a massive scalar field theory incorporating Lorentz violation is investigated. The symmetry breaking is introduced via a background traceless antisymmetric tensor. Within the framework of Thermo Field Dynamics (TFD), the effects of space-time compactification are explored, allowing the simultaneous treatment of thermal and finite-size phenomena. The resulting modifications to the energy-momentum tensor and Feynman propagator are analyzed, leading to Lorentz-violating corrections to the Stefan-Boltzmann law and the Casimir effect. This unified approach highlights the interplay between temperature, spatial constraints, and Lorentz-violating backgrounds in shaping the behavior of quantum fields.</description>

      <title>Spin-operator form factors of the critical Ising chain and their finite volume scaling limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we provide a self-contained derivation of the spin-operator matrix elements in the fermionic basis, for the critical Ising chain at a generic system length $N\in 2Z_{\ge 2}$. The approach relies on the near-Cauchy property of certain matrices formed by the Toeplitz symbol in the critical model, and leads to simpler product formulas for the dressing functions in terms of square root functions. These square root products allow fully dis-singularized integral representations. In the finite volume scaling limit, they further reduce to the Binet's second integral for the gamma function logarithm and its Hermite's generalization. As such, all the matrix elements in the scaling limit allow simple product formulas in terms of the gamma function at integer and half-integer arguments, and are rational numbers up to $\sqrt{2}$. They are exactly the spin-operator form factors of the Ising CFT in the fermionic basis, whose explicit forms are much less well known in comparison to the finite-volume form factors in the massive theory. We also fully determine the normalization factor of the spin-operator and show explicitly how the coefficient $G(\frac{1}{2})G(\frac{3}{2})$ appear through a ground state overlap.</description>

      <title>Taming the dark photon production via a non-minimal coupling to gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12309v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inflationary production of massive dark photons with non-minimal couplings to gravity shows surprising growth at large momenta. These couplings appear in the effective low energy description of a more fundamental theory. We find that the growth is absent in explicit gauge invariant UV-complete models. Such completions are also free of "ghost" instabilities, which often appear in the effective models.</description>

      <title>Total Gluon Helicity Contribution to Proton Spin from Lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report a state-of-the-art lattice QCD calculation of the total gluon helicity contribution to proton spin, $\Delta G$. The calculation is done on ensembles at three different lattice spacings $a=\{0.08, 0.09, 0.11\}$ fm. By employing distillation + momentum smearing for proton external states, we extract the bare matrix elements of the topological current $K^\mu$ under the 5-HYP smeared Coulomb gauge fixing configurations. Furthermore, we apply a non-perturbative $\mathrm{RI/MOM}$ renormalization scheme augmented with the Cluster Decomposition Error Reduction (CDER) technique to determine the renormalization constants of $K^\mu$. The results obtained from different components $K^{t,i}$ (with $i$ being the direction of proton momentum or polarization) are consistent with Lorentz covariance within uncertainties. After extrapolating to the continuum limit, $\Delta G$ is found to be $\Delta G = 0.231(17)^{\mathrm{sta.}}(33)^{\mathrm{sym.}}$ at the $\overline{\mathrm{MS}}$ scale ${\mu}^2=10\ \mathrm{GeV}^2$, which constitutes approximately $46(7)\%$ of the proton spin.</description>

      <title>Freeze-in leptogenesis without the need for right-handed neutrino oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00063v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an experimentally testable leptogenesis mechanism based on the standard type-I seesaw model that successfully operates at right-handed-neutrino (RHN) masses around the GeV scale. The mechanism takes place in a cosmological background with an asymmetry between right-handed electrons and left-handed positrons generated at high temperatures, and does not require oscillations between RHNs or any CP violation in the RHN sector. In contrast to standard leptogenesis via freeze-in, our mechanism works even in the presence of a single RHN around the GeV scale. The mechanism is illustrated for the minimal type-I seesaw with two RHNs, where we show that successful baryogenesis via leptogenesis is viable in large regions of parameter space even without a small mass splitting between the RHNs.</description>

      <title>Pauli stabilizer formalism for topological quantum field theories and generalized statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological quantum field theory (TQFT) provides a unifying framework for describing topological phases of matter and for constructing quantum error-correcting codes, playing a central role across high-energy physics, condensed matter, and quantum information. A central challenge is to formulate topological order on the lattice and to extract the properties of topological excitations from microscopic Hamiltonians. In this work, we construct new classes of lattice gauge theories as Pauli stabilizer models, realizing a wide range of TQFTs in general spacetime dimensions. We develop a lattice description of the resulting extended excitations and systematically determine their generalized statistics.
  Our main example is the $(4+1)$D \emph{fermionic-loop toric code}, obtained by condensing the $e^2 m^2$-loop in the $(4+1)$D $\mathbb{Z}_4$ toric code. We show that the loop excitation exhibits fermionic loop statistics: the 24-step loop-flipping process yields a phase of $-1$. Our Pauli stabilizer models realize all twisted 2-form gauge theories in $(4+1)$D, the higher-form Dijkgraaf-Witten TQFT classified by $H^{5}(B^{2}G, U(1))$. % Beyond $(4+1)$D, the fermionic-loop toric codes form a family of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological orders in arbitrary dimensions featuring fermionic loop excitations, realized as explicit Pauli stabilizer codes using $\mathbb{Z}_4$ qudits. % Finally, we develop a Pauli-based framework that defines generalized statistics for extended excitations in any dimension, yielding computable lattice unitary processes to detect nontrivial generalized statistics. For example, we propose anyonic membrane statistics in $(6+1)$D, as well as fermionic membrane and volume statistics in arbitrary dimensions. We construct new families of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological orders: the \emph{fermionic-membrane toric code} and the \emph{fermionic-volume toric code}.</description>

      <title>From Rotating Attractors to Extremal Black Holes with Axionic Hair</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study extremal, rotating black holes in four-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell-axion (EMA) theory through a combined near-horizon and bulk analysis. At the level of the near-horizon extremal geometry (NHEG), using the entropy function formalism, we prove that regular rotating attractors with axionic hair exist only for configurations that are purely electrically or purely magnetically charged; regular rotating dyonic attractors are excluded by the axion equation of motion, a result that we established perturbatively and non-perturbatively within the NHEG system. On the global side, we construct families of asymptotically flat, rotating extremal EMA black holes that interpolate to the electric NHEG branch, confirming that horizon data are fixed by extremization of the entropy function and decoupled from asymptotic moduli in line with the attractor mechanism.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.00128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This is an updated version of my PhD thesis, defended at the University of Waterloo on the 2nd of April 2025, uploaded to the ArXiv with the goal of reaching a wider audience. The thesis is divided into 5 chapters, respectively containing (I) a brief introduction to local quantum field theory (QFT), (II) a description of local probes in QFT, (III) a discussion of entanglement in QFT and how to probe it, (IV) a description of the regimes where QFT interactions can be approximated by direct interactions, and (V) a discussion the information about the geometry of spacetime contained in quantum fields. The partial goal of this thesis is to serve as a guide for students aiming to tackle these different research programs. If the reader is interested in pursuing one or more research projects detailed here, they are encouraged to contact me for collaboration in these topics.</description>

      <title>Metric Reconstruction and Second Order Perturbation for Generic Spherically Symmetric spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Higher-order perturbations during the ringdown phase are essential for testing gravitational theories. This requires a perturbation framework that extends beyond General Relativity, as well as an appropriate method for reconstructing the spacetime metric. In this work, we address these challenges within the context of general spherically symmetric spacetimes. We introduce a modified Teukolsky equation for perturbative calculations in asymptotically flat, spherically symmetric spacetimes. The metric reconstruction method, which does not rely on the Hertz potential, is extended to $tr$-symmetric spacetime, allowing for the calculation of metric components under specific gauge conditions. Additionally, we present a second-order perturbation theory applicable to generic spherically symmetric spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Tails and Transient Behaviors of Quantum-Corrected Black Holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.00164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational wave astronomy plays a pivotal role in testing the dynamics of gravity in strong-field regimes and probing the nature of black holes. Motivated by recent studies on late-time tails in gravitational waves, we examine the gravitational wave tails of black holes incorporating quantum corrections within the framework of effective Loop Quantum Gravity. Our findings indicate that both the amplitudes and the intermediate behavior of these tails are influenced by quantum corrections. We demonstrate that the amplitude and transient characteristics of the tail are sensitive to the specific details of the black hole's dynamics.</description>

      <title>The Maximal Entanglement Limit in Statistical and High Energy Physics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.00405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: These lectures advocate the idea that quantum entanglement provides a unifying foundation for both statistical physics and high-energy interactions. I argue that, at sufficiently long times or high energies, most quantum systems approach a Maximal Entanglement Limit (MEL) in which phases of quantum states become unobservable, reduced density matrices acquire a thermal form, and probabilistic descriptions emerge without invoking ergodicity or classical randomness. Within this framework, the emergence of probabilistic parton model, thermalization in the break-up of confining strings and in high-energy collisions, and the universal small $x$ behavior of structure functions arise as direct consequences of entanglement and geometry of high-dimensional Hilbert space.</description>

Abstract: Assuming that Dark Matter is an ultralight scalar field which is coupled to electromagnetism via a gauge-kinetic function and which at the time of recombination is oscillating coherently over a Hubble patch, we show that there is a tachyonic instability for the gauge field modes which leads to the generation of magnetic fields on cosmological scales of sufficient amplitude to explain observations.</description>

Abstract: Uniqueness of the four-dimensional static, asymptotically flat, Einstein-Maxwell spacetime with both electric and magnetic charges, containing non-extremal massive particle sphere, being an inner boundary in it, has been proved. It is isometric to Reissner-Nordstr\"om spacetime with electric/magnetic charges. In contrast to the previous results concerning the classification of photon spheres, it describes the existence of the entire set of spacetme foliations, a set of massive particle sphere addressed to the various energies of the particles. The conformal positive energy, positive mass theorem and adequate conformal transformations constitute the mail tools in the proof.</description>

      <title>Dissecting the Hubble tension: Insights from a diverse set of Sound Horizon-free H0 measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Hubble tension is commonly framed as a discrepancy between local, late-time measurements favoring $H_0 \approx 73$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ and early-time, Sound-Horizon-based measurements favoring $H_0 \approx 67$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$. We challenge this viewpoint by analyzing 83 Sound-Horizon-independent $H_0$ measurements, categorized into four classes: Distance Ladder measurements using local calibrators; Local One-Step $\Lambda$CDM measurements assuming the standard expansion history; Pure Local One-Step measurements independent of $H(z)$ shape; and CMB Sound Horizon free measurements using CMB data without the Sound Horizon scale. We find that the 29 Distance Ladder measurements yield $H_0 = 72.74 \pm 0.40$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ ($\chi^2_\nu \equiv \chi^2/d.o.f= 0.74$), while the 54 One-Step measurements collectively yield $H_0 = 68.67 \pm 0.46$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ ($\chi^2_\nu = 0.85$), a $6.7\sigma$ tension exceeding the Planck--SH0ES discrepancy. This tension remains significant at $4.5\sigma$ after accounting for correlations. Among One-Step categories, Local One-Step $\Lambda$CDM measurements favor the lowest value ($H_0 = 67.18 \pm 0.90$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$), Pure Local One-Step yield an intermediate value ($H_0 = 70.38 \pm 1.00$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$), and CMB Sound Horizon Free measurements give $H_0 = 68.71 \pm 0.63$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$. Thus, that the Hubble tension is better characterized as a discrepancy between the Distance Ladder and all other methodologies, rather than an early-vs-late-time split. We also identify a $2.4\sigma$ internal tension among One-Step measurements: analyses assuming $\Lambda$CDM systematically recover lower $H_0$ values by about 3.2 km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ compared to model-independent methods. This suggests either unrecognized systematics/physics in the Distance Ladder or deviations from $\Lambda$CDM in the late-time Universe.</description>

      <title>Exceptional Lines and Excitation of (Nearly) Double-Pole Quasinormal Modes: A Semi-Analytic Study in the Nariai Black Hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that quasinormal modes (QNMs) of a massive scalar field in Kerr-de Sitter and Myers-Perry black holes exhibit an exceptional line (EL), which is a continuous set of exceptional points (EPs) in parameter space, at which two QNM frequencies and their associated solutions coincide. We find that the EL appears in the parameter space spanned by the scalar mass and the black hole spin parameter, and also in the Nariai limit, i.e., $r_{\rm c} - r_{\rm h} \to 0$, where $r_{\rm c}$ and $r_{\rm h}$ denote the radii of the cosmological and black hole horizons, respectively. We analytically study the amplitudes or excitation factors of QNMs near the EL. Such an analytic treatment becomes possible since, in the Nariai limit, the perturbation equation reduces to a wave equation with the P\"{o}schl-Teller (PT) potential. We discuss the destructive excitation of QNMs and the stability of the ringdown near and at the EL. The transient linear growth of QNMs -- a characteristic excitation pattern near an EP or EL -- together with the conditions under which this linear growth dominates the early ringdown, is also studied analytically. Our conditions apply to a broad class of systems that involve the excitation of (nearly) double-pole QNMs.</description>

Abstract: The first goal of this paper is to give a precise and simple definition for off-shell Bethe vectors in a generic $g$-invariant integrable model for $g=gl_n$, $o_{2n+1}$, $sp_{2n}$ and $o_{2n}$. We prove from our definition that the off-shell Bethe vectors indeed become on-shell when the Bethe equations are obeyed.
  Then, we show that some properties for these off-shell Bethe vectors, such as the action formulas of monodromy entries on these vectors, their rectangular recurrence relations and their coproduct formula, are a consequence of our definition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.00790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Right-handed neutrinos are naturally induced by dark extra dimension models and play an essential role in neutrino oscillations. The model parameters can be examined by the long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiments. In this work, we compute the predicted neutrino oscillation spectra within/without extra dimension models and compare them with the experimental data. We find that the neutrino data in the T2K and NOvA experiments are compatible with the standard neutrino oscillation hypothesis. The results set the stringent exclusion limit on the extra dimension model parameters at a high confidence level. The derived constraints on dark dimension right-handed neutrinos are complementary to those results from the collider experiments and cosmological observations.</description>

Abstract: We introduce SOFIA, a Mathematica package that automatizes the computation of singularities of Feynman integrals, based on new theoretical understanding of their analytic structure. Given a Feynman diagram, SOFIA generates a list of potential singularities along with a candidate symbol alphabet. The package also provides a comprehensive set of tools for analyzing the analytic properties of Feynman integrals and related objects, such as cosmological and energy correlators. We showcase its capabilities by reproducing known results and predicting singularities and symbol alphabets of Feynman integrals at and beyond the high-precision frontier.</description>

Abstract: This letter investigates the contribution of the $\sqrt{-g}\xi R\phi^2$ interaction to the long range gravitational potential for massive scalar fields, from the non-relativistic limit of the 2-2 scattering amplitude with graviton exchanges. Such coupling is naturally motivated from the renormalisation of a scalar field theory with quartic self interaction in a curved spacetime. This is qualitatively different from the minimal ones like $ \sqrt{G} h^{\mu\nu}T_{\mu\nu}$, as the vertices corresponding to the former do not explicitly contain any scalar momenta, but instead explicitly contains the momentum carried by graviton line. For the minimal vertex, the long range gravitational potential up to one loop $({\cal O}(G), {\cal O}(G^2))$ was obtained earlier from the terms non-analytic in the transfer momentum, $q^{-2},\ q^{-1},\ \ln q^2 $, yielding potentials respectively like $r^{-1}$, $r^{-2}$, $r^{-3}$. However owing to the aforesaid explicit appearance of transfer momentum for the non-minimal vertices, the leading contribution in this case comes at ${\cal O}(\xi G^2)$, and turns out to be subleading compared to even $r^{-3}$. To complement this `screening' effect, we consider the three graviton vertex generated by the $\sim \Lambda \sqrt{-g}/G$ term in the action, where $\Lambda$ is the cosmological constant. This vertex does not explicitly contain any graviton momentum. With this vertex, and assuming short scale scattering much small compared to the Hubble horizon, we compute the seagull, the vacuum polarisation and the fish diagrams and obtain the 2-2 scattering amplitudes. The leading gravitational potential at ${\cal O}(\xi \Lambda G^2 )$ behaves like $ r^{-1}$, even though it is much subleading compared to Newton's potential due to the appearance of $\Lambda$. We also discuss the scenario where this potential dominates the aforesaid ${\cal O}(\xi G^2)$ one.</description>

      <title>Four-charge static non-extremal black holes in the five-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=2$, $STU-W^2U$ supergravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13655v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct, for the first time, new static non-extremal five-dimensional black hole solutions (without or with squashed horizons) endowing with four different electric charge parameters in the $D = 5$, $\mathcal{N} = 2$ supergravity coupled to three vector multiplets with a specific pre-potential $\mathcal{V} = STU -W^2U \equiv 1$. When the fourth charge parameter disappears, the solution simplify reduces to the three-charge static black hole solution previously presented in ref. [1], which belongs to the solution to the $D = 5$, $\mathcal{N} = 2$ supergravity coupled to two vector multiplets (also notably known as the $STU$ model). We parameterize the model in such a simple fashion that not only can one easily recover the static three-charge solution but also it is very convenient to study their thermodynamical properties of the obtained black hole solutions in the case without a squashing horizon. We then show that the thermodynamical quantities perfectly obey both the differential first law and integral Smarr formula of thermodynamics. Finally, we also extend to present its generalizations with squashed horizons or including a nonzero cosmological constant.</description>

      <title>Probing decoupled Throats of AdS$_{D}$ Black Holes in $D=6,7$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.15426v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Kerr/CFT correspondence establishes a relationship between extremal black holes in higher dimensions and a chiral conformal field theory (CFT) in their near-horizon limit. A generalization of this framework, known as the EVH/CFT correspondence, has been developed for four- and five-dimensional AdS black holes. It was further proposed in arXiv:1910.14293 that a generalized duality between $(D-2)$-dimensional geometry and $(D-3)$-dimensional field theory may emerge in AdS$_{D=6,7}$ black holes under a suitably defined extremal vanishing horizon (EVH) limit. In this work, we demonstrate that the near-EVH geometries arising in these AdS$_{6,7}$ black hole models are not of the standard lower dimensional AdS kinds of black holes to establish a lower dimensional version of AdS/CFT correspondence, but instead belong to the family of Einstein-Maxwell-Maxwell-dilaton (EMMD) gravity theories. This realization opens a pathway toward a microscopic counting of non-AdS black hole entropy via higher-dimensional AdS/CFT techniques.</description>

      <title>Classical Spin Transitions and Absorptive Scattering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.19601v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe an on-shell, amplitudes-based approach to incorporating radiation absorption effects in the post-Minkowskian scattering of generic, compact, spinning bodies. Classical spinning observables are recovered by extrapolating to large spin, results calculated with finite quantum spin-$s$ particles using the properties of spin universality and Casimir interpolation. At leading-order our results give a completely general and non-redundant parametrization of absorptive observables in terms of a finite number of Wilson coefficients associated with 3-particle mass and spin-magnitude changing on-shell amplitudes. We denote these semi-fictitious microscopic processes: \textit{classical spin transitions}. Explicit results for the leading-order impulse due to the absorption of scalar, electromagnetic and gravitational radiation, for spin transitions $\Delta s = 0,\pm 1, \pm 2$ are given in a fully interpolated form up to $\mathcal{O}\left(S^2\right)$, and Casimir independent contributions given up to $\mathcal{O}\left(S^4\right)$. Our explicit results reveal some surprising universal patterns. We find that, up to identification of Wilson coefficients, the Casimir independent contributions to the impulse for spinning-up and spinning-down by the same magnitude $|\Delta s|$ are identical. For processes where the quantum $\Delta s&lt;0$ transition is forbidden, the corresponding classical observable is suppressed in powers of $S$ by a predictable amount. Additionally we find that, while for generic non-aligned spin configurations there is a non-zero scattering angle at leading-order, for aligned spin, similar to non-spinning absorption, the scattering angle vanishes and the impulse is purely longitudinal.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.05082v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explain why the surprising one-loop finiteness of 6D half-maximal supergravities recently discovered in \cite{Huang:2025nyr} is the result of the cancellation of the six-dimensional gravitational and gauge anomalies in (2,0) supergravity with 21 tensor multiplets and its anomaly-free SO(5, 21) duality. The one-loop finiteness of (1,1) supergravity with 20 vector multiplets is also explained by anomaly-free SO(4, 20) duality symmetry.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian representation of isomonodromic deformations of twisted rational connections: The Painlev\'{e} $1$ hierarchy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.13905v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we build the Hamiltonian system and the corresponding Lax pairs associated to a twisted connection in $\mathfrak{gl}_2(\mathbb{C})$ admitting an irregular and ramified pole at infinity of arbitrary degree, hence corresponding to the Painlev\'{e} $1$ hierarchy. We provide explicit formulas for these Lax pairs and Hamiltonians in terms of the irregular times and standard $2g$ Darboux coordinates associated to the twisted connection. Furthermore, we obtain a map that reduces the space of irregular times to only $g$ non-trivial isomonodromic deformations. In addition, we perform a symplectic change of Darboux coordinates to obtain a set of symmetric Darboux coordinates in which Hamiltonians and Lax pairs are polynomial. Finally, we apply our general theory to the first cases of the hierarchy: the Airy case $(g=0)$, the Painlev\'{e} $1$ case $(g=1)$ and the next two elements of the Painlev\'{e} $1$ hierarchy.</description>

      <title>CoHA of Cyclic Quivers and an Integral Form of Affine Yangians</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02618v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We calculate the deformed and non-deformed cohomological Hall algebra (CoHA) of the preprojective algebra for the case of cyclic quivers by studying the Kontsevich-Soibelman CoHA and using tools from cohomological Donaldson-Thomas theory. We show that for the cyclic quiver of length $K$, this algebra is the universal enveloping algebra of the positive half of a certain extension of matrix differential operators on $\mathbb{C}^{*}$, while its deformation gives a positive half of an explicit integral form of Guay's Affine Yangian $\ddot{\mathcal{Y}}_{\hbar_1,\hbar_2}(\mathfrak{gl}(K))$. By the main theorem of Botta-Davison (2023) and Schiffmann-Vasserot (2023), we also determine the Maulik-Okounkov Yangian for the case of cyclic quivers. Furthermore, we explain the construction of factorization coproduct, provide evidence for the strong rationality conjecture, calculate the spherical subalgebra of the non-deformed CoHA for any quiver without loops, recover results about the CoHA of compactly supported semistable sheaves on the minimal resolution of the Kleinian singularity $\mathbb{C}^2/\mathbb{Z}_{K}$ and identify a commutative algebra inside the additive shuffle algebra associated to the cyclic quiver. We end by conjecturally relating the obtained integral form with the algebra defined by Gaiotto-Rap\v{c}\'ak-Zhou, in the context of twisted M-theory.</description>

      <title>Biased-Noise Thresholds of Zero-Rate Holographic Codes with Tensor-Network Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06232v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A crucial insight for practical quantum error correction is that different types of errors, such as single-qubit Pauli operators, typically occur with different probabilities. Finding an optimal quantum code under such biased noise is a challenging problem, related to the (generally unknown) maximum capacity of the corresponding noisy channel. A benchmark for this capacity is given by the hashing bound, which describes the performance of random stabilizer codes and leads to the matter of identifying codes that come close to the bound while also being efficiently decodable. In this work, we perform the first comprehensive analysis of asymptotically zero-rate holographic codes under biased noise. We show that many representatives from such models of this code class fulfill both the channel optimality and efficient decoding guarantees for tensor-network codes. In fact, all holographic codes tested were found to reach the hashing bound in some bias regime, while several built from the $\codepar{5,1,2}$ surface code and $\codepar{6,1,3}$ code exceed state-of-the-art code performance in the 2-Pauli noise regime. Furthermore, we consider Clifford deformations which allow all considered codes to reach the hashing bound for 1-Pauli noise as well. Our results establish that holographic codes, which were previously shown to possess efficient tensor-network decoders, also exhibit competitive thresholds under biased noise.</description>

      <title>Charge pumps, boundary modes, and the necessity of unnecessary criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15351v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We link the presence of "unnecessary" quantum critical surfaces within a single gapped phase of matter to the non-trivial topology of families of gapped Hamiltonians that encircle the critical surface. We study a specific set of one-dimensional spin models where each such family forms a one-parameter loop in a two-dimensional phase diagram. Foliating the non-critical region by such loops identifies "radial" and "angular" coordinates in the phase diagram that respectively parametrize different families and different members of a single family. We show that each one-parameter family is a generalized Thouless charge pump, all with the same topological index, and hence the gapped phase undergoes one or more nontrivial boundary phase transitions as we vary the angular coordinate in a loop through members of one family. Tuning the radial coordinate generates loci of boundary critical points that terminate at endpoints of the bulk unnecessary critical line within the gapped phase. We discuss broader implications of our results and possible extensions to higher dimensions.</description>

These coordinates are obtained by combining shear type coordinates with length-twist type coordinates. On the real component corresponding to the moduli space of compact Riemann surfaces $ \mathcal{M}_g$, the generating function corresponding to the symplectomorphism between these new coordinates and Fenchel-Nielsen coordinates is explicitly computed.</description>

Abstract: We consider quantum mechanics in spacetime with anisotropy in time. Such Lifshitz quantum mechanics is characterized by a kinetic term
  with fractional derivatives. We show that, contrary to a common claim in the literature, local conservation of probability is respected when
  the probability current is properly identified. As an application we consider a Josephson Junction with an insulating layer exhibiting
  Lifshitz anisotropy. We show that anisotropy modifies the tunneling rate and can significantly enhance the performance of the Josephson
  Junction.</description>

Abstract: The Balitsky-Kovchegov (BK) equation offers a tractable description of the high-energy growth of gauge-theory scattering amplitudes and the nonlinear saturation effects that eventually tame it. Motivated by the upcoming Electron-Ion Collider (EIC), whose extended kinematic reach promises more decisive tests of saturation at high energies, we present a framework based on the spacelike-timelike correspondence that streamlines the computation of multi-loop corrections to the BK equation. We explicitly verify the correspondence at three loops in the large-flavor limit and predict the full nonconformal component of the three-loop BK Hamiltonian in the planar limit of a generic gauge theory, treating the numbers of fermions and scalars as free parameters.</description>

Abstract: We investigate $P$-$V$ criticality, with a focus on Ruppeiner geometry, in the extended phase space of Hayward anti-de Sitter (AdS) black holes. Through thermodynamic analysis, we confirm that Hayward-AdS black holes undergo distinct $P$-$V$ phase transitions and exhibit well-defined critical phenomena in the vicinity of their critical points. These behaviors are characterized by four critical exponents that typically obey the scaling laws predicted by mean-field theory--indicating a consistent thermodynamic framework with classical phase transition systems ($e.g.,$ van der Waals fluids). Furthermore, we employ Ruppeiner geometry to probe the thermodynamic fluctuations of Hayward-AdS black holes, and by calculating the corresponding curvature scalar, we gain direct insights into the interaction nature of the black hole's microscopic constituents.</description>

Abstract: Vacuum fluctuations in quantum field theory impose fundamental limitations on our ability to measure time in short scales. To investigate the impact of universal quantum field theory effects on observer-dependent time measurements, we introduce a clock model based on the vacuum decay probability of a finite-sized quantum system. Using this model, we study a microscopic twin paradox scenario and find that, in the smallest scales, time is not only dependent on the trajectory connecting two events, but also on how vacuum fluctuations interact with the microscopic details of the clocks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15704v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There is currently no rigorous definition of gravitational wave strain at second order in cosmological perturbation theory. The usual association of gravitational waves with transverse and traceless fluctuations of the metric on spatial hypersurfaces becomes ambiguous at second order, as it inherently depends on the spacetime slicing. While this poses no practical issues in linearized gravity, it presents a fundamental problem for secondary gravitational waves, especially notorious for gravitational waves induced by primordial fluctuations. We compute, for the first time, the physical effects of gravitational waves at second order, as measured by geodesic observers that emit and receive electromagnetic signals, thereby settling the debate on gauge ambiguities. We find that the measured gravitational wave strain coincides with the transverse-traceless components in the Newton gauge.</description>

Abstract: We introduce the Lense-Thirring Acoustic Black Hole (LTABH), motivated by the relevance of analogue models for black holes embedded in various physical systems, such as the cosmological microwave background or quantum superfluids. We investigate the LTABH spacetime geometry, showing that the roots of the metric function determine a partition of the spacetime into four regions, depending on the acoustic parameter $\xi $ (whereas the dependence vanishes for the rotation parameter $a$); on the other hand, the parameter $a$ turns out to affect the critical radii associated to the maxima of the effective potential. All in all, both the acoustic sphere radius $r_{as}$ and the photon sphere radius $r_{ps}$, respectively giving rise to the acoustic shadow $R_{as}$ and to the optical shadow $R_{s}$, depend on $\xi $ and $a$. More precisely, the rotation parameter $a$ is more relevantly affecting $R_{s}$ (through a right shift), while $R_{as}$ retains its circular shape. For what concerns the acoustic parameter, we notice that the higher $\xi $ is, the larger the size of both shadows. All of these results are confirmed through a detailed analysis of the distortions and of the shadows radii. Moreover, by deriving the magnitude of the precession frequency $\Omega $, we observe that it significantly increases near the acoustic horizons, both in the extremal and in the non-extremal cases, which implies that the Lense-Thirring (frame dragging) effect, which can be traced back to $\xi $ itself, becomes important near such regions. On the other hand, we also show that there are regions of the LTABH spacetime in which $% \Omega $ vanishes, suggesting that therein possible probe particles would not be affected by the frame dragging at all. Finally, we derive the deflection of the light near the LTABH.</description>
