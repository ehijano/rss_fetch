      <title>Bipath Persistence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In persistent homology analysis, interval modules play a central role in describing the birth and death of topological features across a filtration. In this work, we extend this setting, and propose the use of bipath persistent homology, which can be used to study the persistence of topological features across a pair of filtrations connected at their ends, to compare the two filtrations. In this setting, interval-decomposability is guaranteed, and we provide an algorithm for computing persistence diagrams for bipath persistent homology and discuss the interpretation of bipath persistence diagrams.</description>

      <title>Multifunctorial Equivariant Algebraic K-Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A central question in equivariant algebraic K-theory asks whether there exists an equivariant K-theory machine from genuine symmetric monoidal G-categories to orthogonal G-spectra that preserves equivariant algebraic structures. We answer this question positively by constructing an enriched multifunctor K from the G-categorically enriched multicategory of O-pseudoalgebras to the symmetric monoidal category of orthogonal G-spectra, for a compact Lie group G and a 1-connected pseudo-commutative G-categorical operad O. As the main application of its enriched multifunctoriality, K preserves all equivariant algebraic structures parametrized by multicategories enriched in either G-spaces or G-categories. For example, for a finite group G and the G-Barratt-Eccles operad, K transports equivariant E-infinity algebras, in the sense of Guillou-May or Blumberg-Hill, of genuine symmetric monoidal G-categories to equivariant E-infinity algebras of orthogonal G-spectra.</description>

      <title>Recovering generalized homology from Floer homology: the complex oriented case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We associate an invariant called the completed Tate cohomology to a filtered circle-equivariant spectrum and a complex oriented cohomology theory. We show that when the filtered spectrum is the spectral symplectic cohomology of a Liouville manifold, this invariant depends only on the stable homotopy type of the underlying manifold. We make explicit computations for several complex oriented cohomology theories, including Eilenberg-Maclane spectra, Morava K-theories, their integral counterparts, and complex K-theory. We show that the result for Eilenberg-Maclane spectra depends only on the rational homology, and we use the computations for Morava K-theory to recover the integral homology (as an ungraded group). In a different direction, we use the completed Tate cohomology computations for the complex K-theory to recover the complex K-theory of the underlying manifold from its equivariant filtered Floer homotopy type. A key Floer theoretic input is the computation of local equivariant Floer theory near the orbit of an autonomous Hamiltonian, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Lax monoidal adjunctions, two-variable fibrations and the calculus of mates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.08808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2011.08808v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a calculus of mates for functors to the $\infty$-category of $\infty$-categories and extend Lurie's unstraightening equivalences to show that (op)lax natural transformations correspond to maps of (co)cartesian fibrations that do not necessarily preserve (co)cartesian edges. As a sample application we obtain an equivalence between lax symmetric monoidal structures on right adjoint functors and oplax symmetric monoidal structures on the left adjoint functors between symmetric monoidal $\infty$-categories that is compatible with both horizontal and vertical composition of such structures.
  As the technical heart of the paper we study various new types of fibrations over a product of two $\infty$-categories. In particular, we show how they can be dualised over one of the two factors and how they encode functors out of the Gray tensor product of $(\infty, 2)$-categories.</description>

      <title>On the Whitehead theorem for nilpotent motivic spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.05933v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We improve some foundational connectivity results and the relative Hurewicz theorem in motivic homotopy theory, study functorial central series in motivic local group theory, establish the existence of functorial Moore--Postnikov factorizations for nilpotent morphisms of motivic spaces under a mild technical hypothesis and establish an analog of the Whitehead theorem for nilpotent motivic spaces. As an application, we deduce a surprising unstable motivic periodicity result.</description>

      <title>An algebraic criterion for the vanishing of bounded cohomology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16259v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove the vanishing of bounded cohomology with separable dual coefficients for many groups of interest in geometry, dynamics, and algebra. These include compactly supported structure-preserving diffeomorphism groups of certain manifolds; the group of interval exchange transformations of the half line; piecewise linear and piecewise projective groups of the line, giving strong answers to questions of Calegari and Navas; direct limit linear groups of relevance in algebraic K-theory, thereby answering a question by Kastenholz and Sroka and a question of two of the authors and L\"oh; and certain subgroups of big mapping class groups, such as the stable braid group and the stable mapping class group, proving a conjecture of Bowden. Moreover, we prove that in the recently introduced framework of enumerated groups, the generic group has vanishing bounded cohomology with separable dual coefficients. At the heart of our approach is an elementary algebraic criterion called the commuting cyclic conjugates condition that is readily verifiable for the aforementioned large classes of groups.</description>
