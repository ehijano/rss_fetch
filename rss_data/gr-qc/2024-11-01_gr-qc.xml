      <title>Non-minimally coupled teleparallel scalar field reconstruction of matter bounce scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Teleparallel description of gravity theories where the gravity is mediated through the tetrad field and consequent torsion provide an alternative route to explain the late time cosmic speed up issue. Generalization of the teleparallel gravity theory with different functional forms of the torsion scalar $T$ leads to $f(T)$ gravity. The role of scalar field played in addressing issues in cosmology and astrophysics has developed an interest in the inclusion of a scalar field along with an interaction potential in the action. Such a generalized gravity theory is dubbed as $f(T,\phi)$ theory. We have explored such a gravity theory to reconstruct the interaction potential of the scalar field required for an extended matter bounce scenario. The cosmological implications of the reconstructed scalar field potential are studied considering two viable and well known functional forms of $f(T,\phi)$. The energy conditions of these model are discussed to assess the viability of the cosmological models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Black holes are extreme outcomes of General Relativity, and can form through a variety of ways, including gravitational collapse of massive stars, or quantum fluctuations in the early universe. Here, we ask the question of whether they can form via focusing of radiation by compact binaries or intense lasers, or via trapping at the light ring of black holes. We provide evidence that gravitational lensing of radiation from a small, finite number of sources is not a viable mechanism to form black holes.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Polarizability of Schwarzschild Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The linear response of a Schwarzschild black hole to an external quadrupolar perturbation is studied in analogy to a mechanical electrodynamical system, with the goal to describe the gravitational polarizability. Its causality properties imply dispersion relations that relate fluctuation and dissipative properties. We review and combine results obtained via the Regge-Wheeler equation on one side and a perturbative, worldline effective field theory description on the other, obtaining a consistent description of the dispersion relations for the gravitational polarizability of a Schwarzschild black hole. We find that the classical part of the 2-point correlation function of the black hole multipole depends on the boundary conditions of the space-time the black hole is immersed in, which is relevant for the dispersion relations considered.</description>

      <title>Connecting Gravitational Perturbations: from Bertotti-Robinson to Extreme Reissner-Nordstrom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study spherically symmetric spacetime perturbations induced by a neutral scalar in the near-horizon region of extreme Reissner-Nordstrom black holes. For the unperturbed black hole, the near-horizon region is given by another exact solution of the Einstein-Maxwell equations, namely the Bertotti-Robinson spacetime. Our aim is to extend this connection beyond the background level and identify perturbations of a Bertotti-Robinson spacetime as near-horizon perturbations of an extreme Reissner-Nordstrom black hole. We explain that explicit identification of the perturbative solutions to the two different backgrounds can only work in appropriate gauges. For this reason, we first solve the two perturbation problems in the most general spherically symmetric gauges and then find the necessary gauge conditions for matching the Reissner-Nordstrom and Bertotti-Robinson perturbative solutions in the near-horizon limit.</description>

      <title>Primordial Perturbations Including Second-Order Derivatives of the Inflationary Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In inflationary cosmology, the form of the potential is still an open problem. In this work, second-order effects of the inflationary potential are evaluated and related to the known formula for the primordial perturbations at a wide range of scales. We found effects that may help to unravel the unknown inflationary potential form and impose new constraints on the parameters that define this potential. In particular, we demonstrate that even slight deviations in the inflationary potential can lead to significant differences in the calculated spectra if inflation persists sufficiently long and the normal modes of perturbations are affected by these variations.</description>

      <title>Inferring cosmology from gravitational waves using non-parametric detector-frame mass distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The challenge of understanding the Universe's dynamics, particularly the Hubble tension, requires precise measurements of the Hubble constant. Building upon the existing spectral-siren method, which capitalizes on population information from gravitational-wave sources, this paper explores an alternative way to analyze the population data to obtain the cosmological parameters in $\Lambda$CDM. We demonstrated how non-parametric methods, which are flexible models that can be used to agnostically reconstruct arbitrary probability densities, can be incorporated into this framework and leverage the detector-frame mass distribution to infer the cosmological parameters. We tested our method with mock data and applied it to $70$ binary black hole mergers from the third gravitational-wave transient catalog of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration.</description>

      <title>Growth of Gravitational Wave Spectrum from Sound Waves in a Universe with Generic Expansion Rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derived here the factor $\Upsilon$, which quantifies how the gravitational wave spectrum generated by sound waves in the radiation sector grows over time, in a universe with a generic expanding rate set by another dominant energy content. When the dominant energy density satisfies $\rho \propto a^{-3(1+w)}$, we found that $\Upsilon$ has a compact analytical expression: $\Upsilon =\frac{2[1-y^{3(w-1)/2}]}{3(1-w)}$, where $y = a(t)/a(t_s)$ which is the ratio of the scale factor at a later time $t$ to that at $t_s$ when gravitational wave production from sound waves starts. This generic result reduces to that derived previously for radiation-dominated and matter-dominated cases, thus generalizing previous formulas to more general cosmological contexts and providing more accurate results. The derivation relies solely on a stationary source, implying that this generic result of $\Upsilon$ serves as an universal factor in describing the growth of the gravitational wave production and can appear beyond cosmological phase transitions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the flow of the non-local truncation in quantum gravity and we focus in particular on the Polyakov effective action for a non-minimally coupled scalar field on a two dimensional curved space. We show that it is possible to explicitly integrate the flow of all the local and non-local operator terms up to $k=0$ and recover effective action without the integration of the conformal anomaly.</description>

      <title>Quantum anomaly triggers the violation of scaling laws in gravitational system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scaling laws for critical phenomena take pivotal status in almost all branches of physics. However, as scaling laws are commonly guaranteed by the renormalization group theory, systems that violate them have rarely been found. In this letter, we demonstrate that gravitational system can break scaling laws. We derive this result through investigating phase transition and critical phenomenon in a gravitational system with quantum anomaly. For the first time, we outline the key conditions to violate the scaling laws in generic gravitational system viewed from the equation of state $P=P(T,V)$. Our results indicate that quantum effects can magnify the distinctiveness of gravity, which may be significant to understand the microscopic structure of spacetime.</description>

      <title>Hair is complicated: Gravitational waves from stable and unstable boson-star mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the gravitational-wave emission from head-on collisions of equal-mass solitonic boson-star binaries from simulations spanning a two-dimensional parameter space, consisting of the central scalar-field amplitude of the stars and the solitonic potential parameter. We report the gravitational-wave energies emitted by boson-star binaries which, due to their combination of moderately high compactness with significant deformability, we often find to be louder by up to an order of magnitude than analogous black-hole collisions. The dependence of the radiated energy on the boson-star parameters exhibits striking needle-sharp features and discontinuous jumps to the value emitted by black-hole binaries. We explain these features in terms of the solitonic potential and the stability properties of the respective individual stars.</description>

      <title>Gravitational memory: new results from post-Newtonian and self-force theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the (displacement) gravitational wave memory due to a quasicircular inspiral of two black holes using a variety of perturbative techniques. Within post-Newtonian theory, we extend previous results for non-spinning binaries to 3.5PN order. Using the gravitational self-force approach, we compute the memory at first order in the mass ratio for inspirals into a Kerr black hole. We do this both numerically and via a double post-Newtonian--self-force expansion which we carry out to 5PN order. At second order in the self-force approach, near-zone calculations encounter an infrared divergence associated with memory, which is resolved through matching the near-zone solution to a post-Minkowskian expansion in the far zone. We describe that matching procedure for the first time and show how it introduces nonlocal-in-time memory effects into the two-body dynamics at second order in the mass ratio, as was also predicted by recent 5PN calculations within the effective field theory approach. We then compute the gravitational-wave memory through second order in the mass ratio (excluding certain possible memory distortion effects) and find that it agrees well with recent results from numerical relativity simulations for near-comparable-mass binaries.</description>

      <title>Integral quantization based on the Heisenberg-Weyl group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a relativistic framework of integral quantization applied to the motion of spinless particles in the four-dimensional Minkowski spacetime. The proposed scheme is based on coherent states generated by the action of the Heisenberg-Weyl group and has been motivated by the Hamiltonian description of the geodesic motion in General Relativity. We believe that this formulation should also allow for a generalization to the motion of test particles in curved spacetimes. A key element in our construction is the use of suitably defined positive operator-valued measures. We show that this approach can be used to quantize the one-dimensional nonrelativistic harmonic oscillator, recovering the standard Hamiltonian as obtained by the canonical quantization. Our formalism is then applied to the Hamiltonian associated with the motion of a relativistic particle in the Minkowski spacetime. A direct application of our model, including a computation of transition amplitudes between states characterized by fixed positions and momenta, is postponed to a forthcoming article.</description>

      <title>Divergent Energy-Momentum Fluxes In Nonlocal Gravity Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the second order perturbations of the Deser-Woodard II (DWII), Vardanyan-Akrami-Amendola-Silvestri (VAAS) and Amendola-Burzilla-Nersisyan (ABN) nonlocal gravity models in an attempt to extract their associated gravitational wave energy-momentum fluxes. In Minkowski spacetime, the gravitational spatial momentum density is supposed to scale at most as $1/r^{2}$, in the $r \rightarrow \infty$ limit, where $r$ is the observer-source spatial distance. The DWII model has a divergent flux because its momentum density goes as $1/r$; though this can be avoided when we set to zero the first derivative of its distortion function at the origin. Meanwhile, the ABN model also suffers from a divergent flux because its momentum density goes as $r^{2}$. The momentum density from the VAAS model was computed on a cosmological background expressed in a Fermi-Normal-Coordinate system, and was found to scale as $r$. For generic parameters, therefore, none of these three Dark Energy models appear to yield well-defined gravitational wave energies, as a result of their nonlocal gravitational self-interactions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.24149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the formation of gravitating global strings through quantum mechanical tunneling. The instantons that describe the nucleation process are characterized by two parameters: the string core thickness and its gravitational backreaction controlled by the string core energy density. We obtain solutions across a wide range of these parameters by carrying out numerical integration via multiple shooting methods. Our results are in agreement with previous findings on the nucleation of other topological defects; specifically, after reaching a certain threshold for the string core thickness or its gravitational backreaction, the configuration becomes homogeneous in a manner akin to Hawking-Moss solutions. Additionally, we analyze the global structure of the analytical continuation of the solutions to Lorentzian signature, revealing the emergence of a region of spacetime that describes an anisotropic universe. Finally, we also discuss the relevance of these instantons in the context of quantum cosmology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.24161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate perturbations in a rotational and incompressible fluid flow. Interested in the phenomenon analogous to the black hole ergoregion instability, we verify the influence of the vorticity in the instability associated with this fluid system, in the presence of a region in which the fluid flow velocity is greater than the speed of the perturbation. With this aim, we compute the quasinormal modes of the system, using two different numerical methods, obtaining an excellent numerical agreement between them. We find that the vorticity tends to diminish the ergoregion instability of the system.</description>

      <title>Cosmological tests of quintessence in quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use a suite of the most recent cosmological observations to test models of dynamical dark energy motivated by quantum gravity. Specifically, we focus on hilltop quintessence scenarios, able to satisfy theoretical constraints from quantum gravity. We discuss their realisation based on axions, their supersymmetric partners, and Higgs-like string constructions. We also examine a specific parameterisation for dynamical dark energy suitable for hilltop quintessence. We then perform an analysis based on Markov Chain Monte-Carlo to assess their predictions against CMB, galaxy surveys, and supernova data. We show to what extent current data can distinguish amongst different hilltop set-ups, providing model parameter constraints that are complementary to and synergetic with theoretical bounds from quantum gravity conjectures, as well as model comparisons across the main dark energy candidates in the literature. However, all these constraints are sensitive to priors based on theoretical assumptions about viable regions of parameter space. Consequently, we discuss theoretical challenges in refining these priors, with the aim of maximizing the informative power of current and forthcoming cosmological datasets for testing dark energy scenarios in quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of the Kerr-AdS black hole from an ensemble-averaged theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exploring the universal structure of the gravitational path integral beyond semi-classical saddles and uncovering a compelling statistical interpretation of black hole thermodynamics have long been significant challenges. We investigate the statistical interpretation of the Kerr-AdS black hole thermodynamics through an ensemble-averaged theory. By extending the phase space to include all possible states with conical singularities in their Euclidean counterparts, we derive the probability distribution of different states inherited from the Euclidean gravitational path integral. Moreover, we can define a density matrix of all the states in the phase space. By ensemble-averaging over all states, we show that the black hole phase transition naturally arises in the semi-classical limit, just as in the Schwarzschild-AdS and Reissner-Nordstr\"om-AdS cases. Away from the semi-classical regime, the ensemble-averaged theory exhibits a notable deviation from the conventional phase transition. Expanding around the classical saddles yields the subleading-order correction to the Gibbs free energy, which is half of the Hawking temperature. We demonstrate that the half Hawking temperature correction is a universal feature inherent to black holes in asymptotically AdS spacetime. With the subleading-order correction to Gibbs free energy, we also suggest that the whole black hole thermodynamic should be corrected accordingly.</description>

      <title>Double Copy in AdS3 from Minitwistor Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23342v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The double copy relates gravitational theories to the square of gauge theories. While it is well understood in flat backgrounds, its precise realisation around curved spacetimes remains an open question. In this paper, we construct a classical double copy for cohomology class representatives in the minitwistor space of hyperbolic spacetimes. We find that the realisation of a physical double copy requires that the masses of the different spinning fields are not equal, contrary to the flat space prescription. This leads to a position-space double copy for bulk-to-boundary propagators. We also show that in coordinate space, this implies the Cotton double copy for waves and warped black holes of Topologically Massive Gravity. We show that these are exact double copy relations by constructing their Kerr-Schild metrics and also analysing the Kerr-Schild double copy. Furthermore, we find that near the boundary the double copy relates the dual CFT currents.</description>

      <title>Observable CMB Tensor Modes from Cosmological Phase Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A B-mode polarization signal in the cosmic microwave background is widely regarded as smoking gun evidence for gravitational waves produced during inflation. Here we demonstrate that tensor perturbations from a cosmological phase transition in the post-inflationary universe can nearly mimic the characteristic shape and power of inflationary predictions across a range of observable angular scales. Although phase transitions arise from subhorizon physics, they nevertheless exhibit a white noise power spectrum on superhorizon scales. Thus, while B-mode power is suppressed on these large scales, it is not necessarily negligible. For viable phase transition parameters, the maximal B-mode amplitude at multipole moments around the recombination peak can be comparable to nearly all single-field inflationary predictions that can be tested with current and future experiments. This approximate degeneracy can be broken if a signal is measured at different angular scales, since the inflationary power spectrum is nearly scale invariant while the phase transition predicts a distinct suppression of power on large scales.</description>

      <title>On the time-dependent density of quadratically coupled dark matter around ordinary matter objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wave-like dark matter may feature quadratic couplings to ordinary matter. This carries profound consequences for the phenomenologies of such models. It changes the dark matter density around dense objects made from ordinary matter such as planets and stars, thereby changing the sensitivity of direct detection experiments on Earth as well as implying forces on other ordinary matter objects in the vicinity. In this note we study the time dependence of the dark matter field around spherical objects of ordinary matter. This work indicates the time-scale on which accelerating objects settle into a stationary state and delineates the applicability of stationary solutions for experimental dark matter tests. We also use this to understand (and effectively eliminate) the infinities in energies, forces, and pressures that appear when naively comparing the total energy around objects with different size but the same total number of ordinary matter particles.</description>

      <title>Orthonormal Bases for Reconstructing Pairwise Interpulsar Correlations in Pulsar Timing Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23381v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For pulsar timing arrays (PTAs), the telltale signature of an isotropic stochastic background of gravitational waves is a pattern of pairwise interpulsar timing correlations approximately following the Hellings &amp; Downs (HD) curve. Certain systematic errors and new physics processes also lead to interpulsar correlations with different patterns that can be distinguished from the HD curve to varied degrees. As evidence of HD correlations in PTA data mounts in coming years, it is important to develop principled strategies for flexibly and optimally reconstructing the pattern of interpulsar timing correlations, both to test how well the correlations track the HD pattern and to possibly detect additional effects, systematic or otherwise. To this end, we develop orthonormal basis functions that fully capture HD correlations and eliminate covariances between the HD curve and any additional correlated structure. We do this analytically and in a data-adaptive way informed by "optimal statistic" analysis techniques widely used by PTA groups. These bases are adaptive in that they will vary from PTA to PTA and from data release to data release as new pulsars of varied timing quality and baseline are added to arrays, as instrumentation advances, and as observations accrue. We discuss how the techniques we introduce can be extended to future multi-signal searches by PTAs and to robust assessment of HD detection significance.</description>

      <title>Wormhole-induced effective coupling in SYK chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inhomogeneous quantum chains have recently been considered in the context of developing novel discrete realizations of holographic dualities. To advance this programme, we explore the ground states of infinite chains with large number $N$ of Majorana fermions on each site, which interact via on-site $q$-body Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) couplings, as well as via additional inhomogeneous hopping terms between nearest-neighbour sites. The hopping parameters are either aperiodically or randomly distributed. Our approach unifies techniques to solve SYK-like models in the large $N$ limit with a real-space renormalization group method known as strong-disorder renormalization group (SDRG). We show that the SDRG decimation of SYK dots linked by a strong hopping induces an effective hopping interaction between their neighbouring sites. If two decimated sites are nearest neighbours, in the large $q$ limit their local ground states admit a holographic dual description in terms of eternal traversable wormholes. At the end of the SDRG procedure, we obtain a factorised ground state of the infinite inhomogeneous SYK chains that we consider, which has a spacetime description involving a sequence of wormholes. This amounts to a local near-boundary description of the bulk geometry in the context of discrete holography.</description>

      <title>On a Rigidity Result in Positive Scalar Curvature Geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23406v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I prove a scalar curvature rigidity theorem for spheres. In particular, I prove that geodesic balls of radii strictly less than $\frac{\pi}{2}$ in $n+1~(n\geq 2)$ dimensional unit sphere are rigid under smooth perturbations that increase scalar curvature preserving the intrinsic and extrinsic geometry of the boundary, and such rigidity result fails for the hemisphere. The proof of this assertion requires the notion of a real Killing connection and solution of the boundary value problem associated with its Dirac operator. The result serves as the sharpest refinement of the now-disproven Min-Oo conjecture.</description>

      <title>Perturbative unitarity bounds from momentum-space entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physical theories have a limited regime of validity and hence must be accompanied by a breakdown diagnostic to establish when they cease to be valid as parameters are varied. For perturbative theories, estimates of the first neglected order offer valuable guidance, but one is often interested in sharp bounds beyond which perturbation theory necessarily fails. In particle physics, it is common to employ the bounds on partial waves imposed by unitarity as such a diagnostic. Unfortunately, these bounds don't extend to curved spacetime, where scattering experiments are challenging to define. Here, we propose to use the growth of entanglement in momentum space as a breakdown diagnostic for perturbation theory in general field theories. This diagnostic can be readily used in cosmological spacetimes and does not require any flat spacetime limit. More in detail, we consider the so-called purity of the reduced density operator constructed by tracing out all but one of the Fourier modes in an effective theory and we present a diagrammatic technique to compute it perturbatively. Constraints on the theory's regime of validity are then derived when the perturbative purity violates its unitarity bounds.
  In flat spacetime, we compare these purity bounds to those from partial waves. We find general qualitative agreement but with remarkable differences: purity bounds can be sometimes weaker, but other times they exist when no partial wave bounds exist. We then derive purity bounds for scalar field theories in de Sitter spacetime for a variety of interactions that appear in inflationary models. Importantly, our bounds make no reference to time evolution and in de Sitter they depend exclusively on scale-invariant ratios of the physical kinematics.</description>

      <title>Mode analysis of Nambu-Goldstone modes in U(1) charged first-order relativistic viscous hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We conduct a mode analysis of a general U(1)-charged first-order relativistic hydrodynamics within the framework of the effective field theory of dissipative fluids in a Minkowski background. The most general quadratic action for collective excitations around hydrodynamic solutions -- specifically, the Nambu-Goldstone (NG) modes associated with the symmetry-breaking pattern induced by external fields -- is derived. It is found that the hydrodynamical frame invariants write the first-order dispersion relations in the low energy limit. In thermodynamical viscous fluids realized by integrating out fast modes, unitarity and local KMS symmetry for its underlying UV theory are guaranteed. Then, we find that first-order hydrodynamics are stable if the null energy condition is satisfied. As the NG modes nonlinearly realize the diffeomorphism symmetries, our mode analysis is valid in any coordinate systems, including Lorentz-transformed references. We also comment on the causal structure for the diffusive modes based on the retarded Green functions for the stochastic NG mode.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of quadrature interferometric metrology of translation and tilt: QUIMETT</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23887v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Future gravitational wave observation in space will demand the improvement on the sensitivity of the local sensor for the drag-free control. This paper presents the proposal, design, and demonstration of a new laser interferometric sensor named Quadrature Interferometric Metrology of Translation and Tilt (QUIMETT) for the drag-free local sensor. QUIMETT enables simultaneous measurements of both translational displacement and tilts of an reflective object with a single interferometer package. QUIMETT offers the characteristic feature where the sensitivity to tilt is independent of the interference condition while maintaining the ability to measure the translational displacement for a range greater than the laser wavelength. The tilt-sensing function has been demonstrated in a prototype experiment. The tilt sensitivity remained unchanged in different interference conditions and stayed at 10 nrad/Hz$^{1/2}$ at 0.1 Hz.</description>

      <title>Ultra-Slow-Roll Inflation on the Lattice: Backreaction and Nonlinear Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23942v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Violating the slow-roll regime during the final stages of inflation can significantly enhance curvature perturbations, a scenario often invoked in models producing primordial black holes and small-scale scalar induced gravitational waves. When perturbations are enhanced, one approaches the regime in which tree-level computations are insufficient, and nonlinear corrections may become relevant. In this work, we conduct lattice simulations of ultra-slow-roll (USR) dynamics to investigate the significance of nonlinear effects, both in terms of backreaction on the background and in the evolution of perturbations. Our systematic study of various USR potentials reveals that nonlinear corrections are significant when the tree-level curvature power spectrum peaks at $\mathcal{P}^{\rm max}_{\zeta} = {\cal O}(10^{-3})-{\cal O}(10^{-2})$, with 5%$-$10% corrections. Larger enhancements yield even greater differences. We establish a universal relation between simulation and tree-level quantities $\dot\phi = \dot\phi_{\rm tree}\left(1+\sqrt{\mathcal{P}^{\rm max}_{\zeta,\rm tree}}\right)$ at the end of the USR phase, which is valid in all cases we consider. Additionally, we explore how nonlinear interactions during the USR phase affect the clustering and non-Gaussianity of scalar fluctuations, crucial for understanding the phenomenological consequences of USR, such as scalar-induced gravitational waves and primordial black holes. Our findings demonstrate the necessity of going beyond leading order perturbation theory results, through higher-order or non-perturbative computations, to make robust predictions for inflation models exhibiting a USR phase.</description>

      <title>Quantum Inhomogeneous Field Theory: Unruh-Like Effects and Bubble Wall Friction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.24011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a free scalar field in a specific (1+1)-dimensional curved spacetime. By introducing an algebraic state that is locally Hadamard, we derive the renormalized Wightman function and explicitly calculate the covariantly conserved quantum energy-momentum tensor up to a relevant order. From this result, we show that the Hadamard renormalization scheme, which has been effective in traditional quantum field theory in curved spacetime, is also applicable in the quantum inhomogeneous field theory. As applications of this framework, we show the existence of an Unruh-like effect for an observer slightly out of the right asymptotic region, as well as a quantum frictional effect on the bubble wall expansion during the electroweak phase transition in the early universe. Consequently, this study validates the consistency of our method for constructing meaningful physical quantities in quantum inhomogeneous field theory.</description>

      <title>Extreme mass ratio inspirals in galaxies with dark matter halos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.05088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.05088v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using an analytic, static, and spherically symmetric metric for a Schwarzschild black hole immersed in a dark matter (DM) halo with the Hernquist-type profile, we derive analytic expressions for the orbital period and precession of eccentric extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs) surrounded by DM halos, and we show how the precession rates decrease and even undergo a prograde-to-retrograde precession transition if the density of DM halo is large enough. The presence of local DM halos also retards the decrease of the semi-latus rectum and the eccentricity. The orbital evolution of EMRIs immersed in DM halos is then calculated numerically by considering the combined effects of gravitational radiation reaction, dynamical friction, and accretion. Comparing the number of orbital cycles accumulated over a one-year evolution for EMRIs with and without DM halos, we find that DM halos with compactness as small as $10^{-5}$ can be detected. From the mismatch between gravitational waveforms of EMRIs with and without DM halos, we show that EMRIs in galaxies can be used to probe the existence of DM halos and detect the compactness of DM halos as small as $10^{-5}$. Employing the Fisher information matrix method, we find that larger compactness and density values of DM halos help to reduce the estimation error of parameters and further break the degeneracy between the parameters.</description>

      <title>Statistical and Observation Comparison of Weyl-Type $f(Q,T)$ Models with the $\Lambda$CDM Paradigm</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.11190v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the $f(Q,T)$ gravity in the framework of Weyl geometry (known as Weyl-type $f(Q,T)$ gravity), where $Q$ denotes the non-metricity scalar, and $T$ denotes the energy-momentum tensor trace. In this work, we consider the $f(Q,T)$ model, which is defined as $f(Q,T)=\alpha Q^{m+1}+\frac{\beta}{6\kappa^2}T$ and investigating two scenarios: $(I)$ $m=0$ (linear model) and $(II)$ $m\neq 0$ (nonlinear model). For both scenarios, we find the explicit solution for the field equations by using the barotropic equation of state as $p=w\rho$, where $w$ is the equation-of-state (EoS) parameter. Further, we study the obtained solutions statistically using the $Pantheon^+$ (Without SHOES Calibrated) dataset with 1701 data points. For both models, the best-fit values of model parameters for $1-\sigma$ and $2-\sigma$ confidence level. The higher Hubble constant values in both models emphasize the presence of Tension. We statistically compare our models to the $\Lambda$CDM model using ${{\protect\chi}^2_{min}}$, ${{\protect\chi}^2_{red}}$, $AIC$, $\Delta AIC$, $BIC$ and $\Delta BIC$. We also examine cosmological parameters such as deceleration and EoS parameters to determine the current acceleration expansion of the Universe. Furthermore, we test our model using $Om$ diagnostic and compare it to the $\Lambda$CDM model to determine its dark energy profile. Finally, we draw the conclusion that statistically speaking, both linear and nonlinear models show good compatibility with the $\Lambda$CDM model.</description>

      <title>Macroscopic noncommutative-geometry wormholes as emergent phenomena in $f(Q)$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.03760v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Noncommutative geometry, an offshoot of string theory, replaces point-like particles by smeared objects. These local effects have led to wormhole solutions in a semiclassical setting, but it has also been claimed that the noncommutative effects can be implemented by modifying only the energy momentum tensor in the Einstein field equations, while leaving the Einstein tensor unchanged. The implication is that noncommutative-geometry wormholes could be macroscopic. This result can be readily explained by considering the noncommutative-geometry background to be a fundamental property and the macroscopic wormhole spacetime to be emergent, according to an earlier version of this paper. However, it is shown in the present version that such wormholes could not be sufficiently massive to exist on a macroscopic scale. A major objective in this paper is to invoke $f(Q)$ gravity to provide the extra degrees of freedom to overcome these obstacles.</description>

      <title>Arrows of time in bouncing cosmologies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01380v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Different approaches to quantum gravity, such as loop quantum cosmology and group field theory, predict the resolution of the initial cosmological singularity via a bounce: a regular spacetime region that connects the expanding branch of the universe to a contracting branch. The cosmological arrow of time, which by definition points in the direction of cosmic expansion, is reversed at the bounce. Nonetheless, it is still possible to discriminate between the two branches by considering different arrows, as defined for instance by the growth of perturbations. After reviewing general aspects of the time arrow problem in cosmology, we examine the properties of different arrows of time in bouncing cosmologies, focusing on the loop quantum cosmology bounce as a case study. These issues are examined in detail for an exact solution to the effective Friedmann equations of loop quantum cosmology with pressureless dust and a cosmological constant, which is a simplified version of the $\Lambda$CDM bounce scenario.</description>

      <title>Primordial black holes generated by fast-roll mechanism in non-canonical natural inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08563v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, a new fast-roll (FR) mechanism to generate primordial black holes (PBHs) and gravitational waves (GWs) in generalized non-canonical natural inflation is introduced. In this model, choosing a suitable function for non-canonical mass scale parameter $M(\phi)$ gives rise to produce a cliff-like region in the field evolution path. When inflaton rolls down the steep cliff, its kinetic energy during a FR stage increases in comparison with a slow-roll (SR) stage. Hence, seeds of PBH production are born in this transient FR stage. Depending on the position of the cliff, appropriate cases of PBHs for explaining total dark matter (DM), microlensing effects, LIGO-VIRGO events and NANOGrav 15 year data can be formed. The density spectrum of GWs related to one case of the model lies in the NANOGrav 15 year domain and behaves like $\Omega_{\rm GW_0}\sim f^{5-\gamma}$. The spectral index $\gamma=3.42$ for this case satisfies the NANOGrav 15 year constraint. Moreover, regarding reheating considerations, it is demonstrated that PBHs are born in the radiation-dominated (RD) era. Furthermore, viability of the model in light of theoretical swampland criteria and observational constraints on cosmic microwave background (CMB) scales are illustrated.</description>

      <title>Monge-Amp\`ere gravity, optimal transport theory and their link to the Galileons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15035v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mathematicians have been proposing for sometimes that Monge-Amp\`ere equation, a nonlinear generalization of the Poisson equation, where trace of the Hessian is replaced by its determinant, provides an alternative non-relativistic description of gravity. Monge-Amp\`ere equation is affine invariant, has rich geometric properties, connects to optimal transport theory, and remains bounded at short distances. Monge-Amp\`ere gravity, that uses a slightly different form of the Monge-Amp\`ere equation, naturally emerges through the application of large-deviation principle to a Brownian system of indistinguishable and independent particles. In this work we provide a physical formulation of this mathematical model, study its theoretical viability and confront it with observations. We show that Monge-Amp\`ere gravity cannot replace the Newtonian gravity as it does not withstand the solar-system test. We then show that Monge-Amp\`ere gravity can describe a scalar field, often evoked in modified theories of gravity such as Galileons. We show that Monge-Amp\`ere gravity, as a nonlinear model of a new scalar field, is screened at short distances, and behaves differently from Newtonian gravity above galactic scales but approaches it asymptotically. Finally, we write a relativistic Lagrangian for Monge-Amp\`ere gravity in flat space time, which is the field equation of a sum of the Lagrangians of all Galileons. We also show how the Monge-Amp\`ere equation can be obtained from the fully covariant Lagrangian of quartic Galileon in the static limit. The connection between optimal transport theory and modified theories of gravity with second-order field equations, unravelled here, remains a promising domain to further explore.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03371v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study provides a comprehensive analytical investigation of the bound and unbound motion of magnetized particles orbiting a Schwarzschild black hole immersed in an external asymptotically uniform magnetic field, which includes all conceivable types of bounded and unbounded orbits. In particular, for planetary orbits, we perform a comparative analysis of our findings with the observed position of the S2 star carrying magnetic dipole moment around Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*). We found maximum and minimum values for the parameter of magnetic interaction between the magnetic dipole of the star and the external magnetic field, as well as the energy and angular momentum of the S2 star. As a result, we obtain estimations of the magnetic dipole of the star in order of $10^6 \rm \ G\cdot cm^{3}$. Additionally, we explore deflecting trajectories akin to gravitational Rutherford scattering. In obtaining the solutions for the orbital equations, we articulate the elliptic integrals and Jacobi elliptic functions, and our study is augmented by illustrative figures and simulations.</description>

      <title>Corrected Thermodynamics and Stability of Magnetic charged AdS Black Holes surrounded by Quintessence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10946v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we explore the corrected thermodynamics of non-linear magnetic charged anti-de Sitter (AdS) black holes surrounded by quintessence, incorporating thermal fluctuations and deriving the corrected thermodynamic potentials. We analyze the effects of corrections due to thermal fluctuations on various thermodynamic potentials, including enthalpy, Helmholtz free energy, and Gibbs free energy. Our results show significant impacts on smaller black holes, with first-order corrections destabilizing them, while second-order corrections enhance stability with increasing parameter values. The specific heat analysis further elucidates the stability criteria, indicating that the large black holes ensure stability against phase transitions. However, the thermal fluctuations do not affect the physical limitation points as well as the second-order phase transition points of the black hole. Our findings highlight the intricate role of thermal fluctuations in black hole thermodynamics and their influence on stability, providing deeper insights into the behaviour of black holes under corrected thermodynamic conditions.</description>

      <title>Local quantum detection of cosmological expansion: Unruh-DeWitt in spatially compact Milne</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11860v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyse the excitations and de-excitations of an inertial Unruh-DeWitt detector in the $(1+1)$-dimensional expanding Milne cosmology with compact spatial sections, coupled to a real massless scalar field with either untwisted or twisted boundary conditions, prepared in the conformal vacuum. We find the detector's response as a function of the energy gap, the Milne spatial circumference parameter, the interaction duration, the age of the universe at the switch-on moment, the detector's peculiar velocity at the switch-on moment, and, for the untwisted field, the state of the zero mode. Asymptotic analytic results are obtained at large energy gap and at large circumference parameter, in each case recovering the Minkowski vacuum response in the leading order, and in the double limit of small circumference parameter and late cosmological time, recovering the response in a static Minkowski cylinder. Numerical results are given in the interpolating regimes. The results confirm the detector's sensitivity to both classical and quantum properties of its environment.</description>

      <title>Interacting hypersurfaces and multiple scalar-tensor theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12680v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel method to construct ghost-free multiple scalar-tensor theories. The key idea is to use the geometric quantities of hypersurfaces defined by the scalar fields, rather than the covariant derivatives of scalar fields or spacetime curvature, to build the theory. This approach has proven effective in developing ghost-free scalar-tensor theories in the single-field case. When multiple scalar fields are present, each field specifies a foliation of spacelike hypersurfaces, on which we can define the normal vector, induced metric, extrinsic and intrinsic curvatures, as well as extrinsic (Lie) and intrinsic (spatial) derivatives, respectively. By employing these hypersurface geometric quantities as foundational elements, we construct the Lagrangian for interacting hypersurfaces that describes a multiple scalar-tensor theory. Given that temporal (Lie) and spatial derivatives are separated, it becomes relatively easier to control the order of time derivatives, thus helping to avoid ghost-like or unwanted degrees of freedom. In this work, we use bi-scalar-field theory as an example, focusing on polynomial-type Lagrangians. We construct monomials of hypersurface geometric quantities up to $d=3$, where $d$ denotes the number of derivatives in each monomial. Additionally, we present the correspondence between expressions in terms of hypersurface quantities and those in covariant bi-scalar-tensor theory. Through a cosmological perturbation analysis of a simple model, we demonstrate that the theory propagates two tensor and two scalar degrees of freedom at the linear order in perturbations, thereby remaining free from any extra degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>Quantum nonlinear effects in the number-conserving analogue gravity of Bose-Einstein condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13596v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the unitary quantum dynamics of a Bose-Einstein condensates at absolute zero, and demonstrate that an analogue gravity model in such a setting must take into account the backreaction of quasiparticle excitations onto the condensate background. This in turn requires that one expands to second order in perturbations, and takes the nonlinearity of the theory into account. It is shown that this leads to significant modifications of the standard linearized analogue gravity paradigm \`a la Unruh. In particular, to obtain a fully Lorentz-covariant equation in curved spacetime for second-order perturbations, we demonstrate that it is necessary to introduce, to leading order in powers of the formal expansion parameter $N^{-1/2}$ (where $N$ is total particle number), a quantum-fluctuation-renormalized spacetime metric which substantially differs from the Unruh metric and, to subleading order, two emergent vector fields. Both the renormalized metric and the vector fields then keep track of the backreaction of the quasiparticles onto the condensate up to the order in powers of $N^{-1/2}$ considered. Finally, we apply our formalism to an analogue-cosmological Friedmann-Lema\^{i}tre-Robertson-Walker metric and establish its renormalized form due to the quantum many-body backreaction exerted by the excitation cloud.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, the weak gravitational lensing phenomenon for a recently proposed rotating regular black hole with an asymptotically Minkowski core characterized by a sub-Planckian curvature was investigated. Using the Gauss-Bonnet Theorem, the deflection of light in the weak limit was computed by taking the black hole as a lens at a finite distance from both the source and the observer. It was shown that the weak deflection angle slightly differs between the prograde and retrograde motion but both eventually converge to $0$ as $b$ increases. Moreover, the deflection angle correction for Kerr classical black hole and this sort of rotating regular black hole is a decreasing function for large values of $b$. It was also shown that the weak deflection angle for this sort of regular black hole is similar to Bardeen and Hayward black hole given its corresponding values for the parameters $x$ and $n$</description>

Abstract: Anisotropy of local pressure distribution and dissipation are essential in understanding the evolution of the internal structure of compact objects and their observable characteristics. In this work, we reinterpret local pressure anisotropy in relativistic stellar structures as a contribution to the energy density. This approach allows the modelling of any anisotropic equation of state in self-gravitating systems by treating anisotropy as a contribution. We demonstrate that this approach provides more realistic stellar models that meet essential physical criteria, such as mass-radius relationships and stability conditions. The results are compared to observational data, particularly the inferred compactness values for pulsars PSR J0740+6620 and PSR J0030+0451, showing that anisotropic and isotropic models can represent these objects. We further explore how dissipation, such as temperature gradients, influences radial pressure and show that it can be modelled similarly to anisotropy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19261v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine the stability of a spherically symmetric regular black hole when subjected to perturbations from a charged scalar field. This particular black hole is constructed by deforming the Minkowski spacetime. It has been observed that the charged superradiant instability arises only within a specific range of the deformation parameter, potentially resulting in an instability growth rate with a maximum magnitude of approximately $\text{Im} (M \omega) \sim 10^{-3}$. This growth rate significantly exceeds the instability identified in ABG black holes discussed in prior research, suggesting a notable timescale for detecting this phenomenon in astrophysical scenarios. Additionally, we conduct a thorough investigation into how the three parameters of the model influence the onset and intensity of the instability. Our analysis offers further insights into the possible emergence of this instability in spherically regular black holes and its association with the nonlinear effects of the electromagnetic field.</description>

Abstract: Regarding the proximity of dark energy scale and neutrino mass, one can get new insight into the probe signatures of vector field dark energy component on neutrino flavor conversion. A vector field is assumed to be conformally coupled to various matter components through a screening paradigm. We show how the oscillation probabilities evolve differently with a finite-size matter density like the Sun for different values of relevant model parameters. Considering existing neutrino flavor conversion data, we point out how this non-standard coupling affects neutrino fluxes and also we compute the discrepancy in the total flux of solar electron-neutrinos.</description>

      <title>Black holes and gravitational waves from slow phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04158v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Slow first-order phase transitions generate large inhomogeneities that can lead to the formation of primordial black holes (PBHs). We show that the gravitational wave (GW) spectrum then consists of a primary component sourced by bubble collisions and a secondary one induced by large perturbations. The latter gives the dominant peak if $\beta/H_0 &lt; 12$, impacting, in particular, the interpretation of the recent PTA data. The GW signal associated with a particular PBH population is stronger than in typical scenarios because of a negative non-Gaussianity of the perturbations and it has a distinguishable shape with two peaks.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Memory Imprints on the CMB from Populations of Massive Black Hole Mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06927v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Aims: To showcase and characterise the rich phenomenology of temperature fluctuation patterns that are imprinted on the CMB by the gravitational wave memory (GWM) of massive black hole (BH) mergers. Methods: We analyse both individual binaries as well as populations of binaries, distributed in local cosmological boxes at a given redshift. Results: The magnitude of the temperature fluctuations scales primarily as a function of binary total mass and pattern angular scale, and accumulates as a random-walk process when populations of mergers are considered. Fluctuations of order $\sim 10^{-10}$ K are easily reached across scales of $\sim 1'$ to $\sim 1^{\circ}$ for realistic volumetric merger rates of 10$^{-3}$ Mpc$^{-3}$ Gyr$^{-1}$, as appropriate for massive galaxies at $z=1$. We determine numerically that GWM temperature fluctuations result in a universal power spectrum with a scaling of $P(k)\propto k^{-2.7}$. Conclusion: While not detectable given the limitations of current all-sky CMB surveys, our work explicitly shows how every black hole merger in the Universe left us its unique faint signature.</description>

      <title>Be careful in multi-messenger inference of the Hubble constant: A path forward for robust inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11965v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-messenger observations of coalescing binary neutron stars (BNSs) are a direct probe of the expansion history of the universe and carry the potential to shed light on the disparity between low- and high-redshift measurements of the Hubble constant $H_0$. To measure the value of $H_0$ with such observations requires pristine inference of the luminosity distance and the true source redshift with minimal impact from systematics. In this analysis, we carry out joint inference on mock gravitational wave (GW) signals and their electromagnetic (EM) afterglows from BNS coalescences and find that the inclination angle inferred from the afterglow light curve and apparent superluminal motion can be precise, but need not be accurate and is subject to systematic uncertainty that could be as large as $1.5\sigma$. This produces a disparity between the EM and GW inferred inclination angles, which if not carefully treated when combining observations can bias the inferred value of $H_0$. We also find that already small misalignments of $3^{\circ}-6^{\circ}$ between the inherent system inclinations for the GW and EM emission can bias the inference by $\mathcal{O}(1-2\sigma)$ if not taken into account. As multi-messenger BNS observations are rare, we must make the most out of a small number of events and harness the increased precision, while avoiding reduced accuracy. We demonstrate how to mitigate these potential sources of bias by jointly inferring the mismatch between the GW- and EM-based inclination angles and $H_0$.</description>

      <title>2D BAO vs 3D BAO: solving the Hubble tension with an alternative cosmological model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04322v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ordinary 3D Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) data are model-dependent, requiring the assumption of a cosmological model to calculate comoving distances during data reduction. Throughout the present-day literature, the assumed model is $\Lambda$CDM. However, it has been pointed out in several recent works that this assumption can be inadequate when analyzing alternative cosmologies, potentially biasing the Hubble constant ($H_0$) low, thus contributing to the Hubble tension. To address this issue, 3D BAO data can be replaced with 2D BAO data, which is only weakly model-dependent. The impact of using 2D BAO data, in combination with alternative cosmological models beyond $\Lambda$CDM, has been explored for several phenomenological models, showing a promising reduction in the Hubble tension. In this work, we accommodate these models in the theoretically robust framework of bimetric gravity. This is a modified theory of gravity that exhibits a transition from a (possibly) negative cosmological constant in the early universe to a positive one in the late universe. By combining 2D BAO data with cosmic microwave background and type Ia supernovae data, we find that the inverse distance ladder in this theory yields a Hubble constant of $H_0 = (71.0 \pm 0.9) \, \mathrm{km/s/Mpc}$, consistent with the SH0ES local distance ladder measurement of $H_0 = (73.0 \pm 1.0) \, \mathrm{km/s/Mpc}$. Replacing 2D BAO with 3D BAO results in $H_0 = (68.6 \pm 0.5) \, \mathrm{km/s/Mpc}$ from the inverse distance ladder. Thus, the choice of BAO data significantly impacts the Hubble tension, with ordinary 3D BAO data exacerbating the tension, while 2D BAO data provides results consistent with the local distance ladder.</description>

      <title>On one-loop corrections to the Bunch-Davies wavefunction of the universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16386v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the loop corrections to cosmological observables is of paramount importance for having control on the quantum consistency of a theory in an expanding universe as well as for phenomenological reasons. In the present work, we begin with a systematic study of such corrections in the context scalar toy models whose perturbative Bunch-Davies wavefunction enjoys an intrinsic definition in terms of cosmological polytopes, focusing on one-loop graphs. Owing to the underlying twisted period integral representation they admit, their combinatorial structure along with their vector space structure, emerging from polynomial ideals algebra and intersection theory, are exploited to set-up and analyse the differential equations that the two- and three-site one-loop corrections have to satisfy upon variation of the external kinematic variables. We find that, while the two-site contribution can be written in terms of multiple-polylogarithms, this is no longer true for the three-site case, for which elliptic structures appear. As a non-trivial check, we consider the scattering amplitude limit, recovering the known result in terms of polylogarithms only.</description>

      <title>Beyond the ensemble paradigm in low dimensional quantum gravity: Schwarzian density, quantum chaos and wormhole contributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02270v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Based on periodic orbit theory we address the individual-system versus ensemble interpretation of quantum gravity from a quantum chaos perspective. To this end we show that the spectrum of geodesic motion on high-dimensional hyperbolic manifolds, described by the Selberg trace formula, displays a Schwarzian ($\sinh 2\pi\sqrt{E}$) mean level density. Due to its chaotic classical limit, this quantum system also shows all universal signatures of quantum chaos. These two properties imply a possible duality to Jackiw-Teitelboim-type quantum gravity at the level of a single system instead of an ensemble of systems like matrix theories and SYK models. Beyond the universal regime we show how the full wormhole geometry on the gravity side emerges from the discreteness of the set of periodic orbits. Thereby, we take initial steps towards a duality between gravitational and mesoscopic chaotic quantum systems through the topological, respectively, periodic orbit expansions of their correlators.</description>

      <title>Scalar one-loop tensor power spectrum during single-field inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16688v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We calculate the scalar-induced one-loop correction to the power spectrum of tensor perturbations produced during single-field slow-roll inflation. We find that the correction is given by the square of the product of the slow-roll parameter and the tree-level scalar power spectrum. We also discuss the implications of the logarithmic contribution.</description>

      <title>Accelerated Bayesian parameter estimation and model selection for gravitational waves with normalizing flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21076v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an accelerated pipeline, based on high-performance computing techniques and normalizing flows, for joint Bayesian parameter estimation and model selection and demonstrate its efficiency in gravitational wave astrophysics. We integrate the Jim inference toolkit, a normalizing flow-enhanced Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampler, with the learned harmonic mean estimator. Our Bayesian evidence estimates run on $1$ GPU are consistent with traditional nested sampling techniques run on $16$ CPU cores, while reducing the computation time by factors of $5\times$ and $15\times$ for $4$-dimensional and $11$-dimensional gravitational wave inference problems, respectively. Our code is available in well-tested and thoroughly documented open-source packages, ensuring accessibility and reproducibility for the wider research community.</description>
