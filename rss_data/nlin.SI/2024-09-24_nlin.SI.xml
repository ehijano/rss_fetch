      <title>Modulational Instability of Small Amplitude Periodic Traveling Waves in the Novikov Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the spectral stability of smooth, small-amplitude periodic traveling wave solutions of the Novikov equation, which is a Camassa-Holm type equation with cubic nonlinearities. Specifically, we investigate the $L^2(\mathbb{R})$-spectrum of the associated linearized operator, which in this case is an integro-differential operator with periodic coefficients, in a neighborhood of the origin in the spectral plane. Our analysis shows that such small-amplitude periodic solutions are spectrally unstable to long-wavelength perturbations if the wave number if greater than a critical value, bearing out the famous Benmajin-Feir instability for the Novikov equation. On the other hand, such waves with wave number less than the critical value are shown to be spectrally stable. Our methods are based on applying spectral perturbation theory to the associated linearization.</description>

      <title>$\bar{\partial}$-problem for focusing nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation and soliton shielding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14825v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider soliton gas solutions of the Focusing Nonlinear Schr\"odinger (NLS) equation, where the point spectrum of the Zakharov-Shabat linear operator condensate in a bounded domain $\mathcal{D}$ in the upper half-plane. We show that the corresponding inverse scattering problem can be formulated as a $\overline{\partial}$-problem on the domain. We prove the existence of the solution of this $\overline{\partial}$-problem by showing that the $\tau$-function of the problem (a Fredholm determinant) does not vanish. We then represent the solution of the NLS equation via the $\tau$ of the $\overline{\partial}$- problem. Finally we show that, when the domain $\mathcal{D}$ is an ellipse and the density of solitons is analytic, the initial datum of the Cauchy problem is asymptotically step-like oscillatory, and it is described by a periodic elliptic function as $x \to - \infty$ while it vanishes exponentially fast as $x \to +\infty$.</description>

      <title>Boundary overlap in the open XXZ spin chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we compute the overlaps of the ground states for the open spin chains after a change of one of the boundary magnetic fields. It can be considered as the first step toward the study of the boundary quench problem: behaviour of an open spin chain after an abrupt change of one boundary magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Spectral instability of peakons for the $b$-family of Novikov equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08759v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we are concerned with a one-parameter family of peakon equations with cubic nonlinearity parametrized by a parameter usually denoted by the letter $b$. This family is called the ``$b$-Novikov'' since it reduces to the integrable Novikov equation in the case $b=3$. By extending the corresponding linearized operator defined on functions in $H^1(\mathbb{R})$ to one defined on weaker functions on $L^2(\mathbb{R})$, we prove spectral and linear instability on $L^2(\mathbb{R})$ of peakons in the $b$-Novikov equations for any $b$. We also consider the stability on $H^1(\mathbb{R})$ and show that the peakons are spectrally or linearly stable only in the case $b=3$.</description>

      <title>A solvable non-unitary fermionic long-range model with extended symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10164v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define and study a long-range version of the XX model, arising as the free-fermion point of the XXZ-type Haldane--Shastry (HS) chain. It has a description via non-unitary fermions, based on the free-fermion Temperley--Lieb algebra, and may also be viewed as an alternating $\mathfrak{gl}(1|1)$ spin chain. Even and odd length behave very differently; we focus on odd length. The model is integrable, and we explicitly identify two commuting hamiltonians. While non-unitary, their spectrum is real by PT-symmetry. One hamiltonian is chiral and quadratic in fermions, while the other is parity-invariant and quartic. Their one-particle spectra have two linear branches, realising a massless relativistic dispersion on the lattice. The appropriate fermionic modes arise from 'quasi-translation' symmetry, which replaces ordinary translation symmetry. The model exhibits exclusion statistics, like the isotropic HS chain, with even more 'extended symmetry' and larger degeneracies.</description>

      <title>Modulation theory of soliton-mean flow in KdV equation with box type initial data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20826v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For the KdV equation with box type initial data, the interaction between a trial soliton and large-scale dispersive mean flow is studied theoretically and numerically. The pure box initial value can cause rarefaction wave and dispersive shock wave, and can create an area of soliton train. The key to the interaction of soliton and mean flow is that the dynamic evolutions of the mean flow and the local soliton can be described by the same modulation system. The soliton modulation system is derived from the degenerations of the two-genus Whitham modulation system. Considering the influence of rarefaction wave, dispersive shock wave and soliton train on the trial soliton, in the framework of Whitham modulation theory, the equation describing the soliton trajectory and the changes in amplitude and phase shift are given explicitly. The predicted results are compared with the numerical simulations, which verifies the corrections of the theoretical analysis. The exotic interaction phenomena between soliton and mean flow found in this work have broad applications to shallow water soliton propagations and real soliton experiments in fluid dynamics.</description>
