      <title>Uniform asymptotic expansions for Bessel functions of imaginary order and their zeros</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bessel and modified Bessel functions of imaginary order $i\nu$ ($\nu &gt;0$) are studied. Asymptotic expansions are derived as $\nu \to \infty$ that are uniformly valid in unbounded complex domains, with error bounds provided. Coupled with appropriate connection formulas the approximations are uniformly valid for all complex argument. The expansions are of two forms, Liouville-Green type expansions only involving elementary functions, and ones involving Airy functions that are valid at a turning point of the defining differential equation. The new results have coefficients and error bounds that are simpler than in prior expansions, and further are used to construct asymptotic expansions for the zeros of Bessel and modified Bessel functions of large imaginary order, these being uniformly valid without restriction on their size (small or large).</description>

      <title>Elliptic hypergeometric functions: integrals versus series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The univariate elliptic beta integral is represented as a bilinear combination of infinite $_{10}V_9$ very-well-poised elliptic hypergeometric series representing the sum of residues of the integrand poles. Convergence of this combination of series for some particular choice of parameters is discussed. Additionally, the asymptotics of the Frenkel--Turaev sum for a terminating $_{10}V_9$ series is considered when the termination parameter $n$ goes to infinity.</description>

      <title>Endpoint estimates for Haar shift operators with balanced measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove $\mathrm{H}^1$ and $\mathrm{BMO}$ endpoint inequalities for generic cancellative Haar shifts defined with respect to a possibly non-homogeneous Borel measure $\mu$ satisfying a weak regularity condition. This immediately yields a new, highly streamlined proof of the $L^p$-results for the same operators due to L\'opez-Sanchez, Martell, and Parcet. We also prove regularity properties for the Haar shift operators on the natural martingale Lipschitz spaces defined with respect to the underlying dyadic system, and show that the class of measures that we consider is sharp.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a positive, non-increasing sequence $a$ with a finite sum $L$, we consider all the closed subsets of $[0,L]$ such that the lengths of their complementary open intervals are a rearrangement of the sequence $a$. We study all possible $\theta$-intermediate dimensions for these sets and show that, under some assumptions, it is an interval.</description>

      <title>Model agnostic signal encoding by leaky integrate and fire, performance and uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12994v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrate and fire is a resource efficient time-encoding mechanism that summarizes into a signed spike train those time intervals where a signal's charge exceeds a certain threshold. We analyze the IF encoder in terms of a very general notion of approximate bandwidth, which is shared by most commonly-used signal models. This complements results on exact encoding that may be overly adapted to a particular signal model. We take into account, possibly for the first time, the effect of uncertainty in the exact location of the spikes (as may arise by decimation), uncertainty of integration leakage (as may arise in realistic manufacturing), and boundary effects inherent to finite periods of exposure to the measurement device. The analysis is done by means of a concrete bandwidth-based Ansatz that can also be useful to initialize more sophisticated model specific reconstruction algorithms, and uses the earth mover's (Wassertein) distance to measure spike discrepancy.</description>

      <title>A numerical algorithm for computing the zeros of parabolic cylinder functions in the complex plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13085v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A numerical algorithm (implemented in Matlab) for computing the zeros of the parabolic cylinder function $U(a,z)$ in domains of the complex plane is presented. The algorithm uses accurate approximations to the first zero plus a highly efficient method based on a fourth-order fixed point method with the parabolic cylinder functions computed by Taylor series and carefully selected steps, to compute the rest of the zeros. For $|a|$ small, the asymptotic approximations are complemented with a few fixed point iterations requiring the evaluation of $U(a,z)$ and $U'(a,z)$ in the region where the complex zeros are located. Liouville-Green expansions are derived to enhance the performance of a computational scheme to evaluate $U(a,z)$ and $U'(a,z)$ in that region. Several tests show the accuracy and efficiency of the numerical algorithm.</description>

      <title>A chronology of continued square roots and other continued compositions, through the year 2016</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.06139</link>
      <description>arXiv:1707.06139v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An infinite continued composition is an expression of the form \begin{equation*} \lim_{n\to\infty}t_0\circ t_1 \circ t_2 \circ \cdots \circ t_n(c)\;, \end{equation*} where the $t_i$ are maps from a set $D$ to itself, the initial value $c$ is a point in $D$, and the order of operations proceeds from right to left.
  This document is a bibliography, in chronological order through the year 2016, of selected continued compositions whose primary sources have typically been obscure. In particular, we include continued square roots: \begin{equation*} a_0+\sqrt{a_1+\sqrt{a_2+\sqrt{\ldots}}}\;, \end{equation*} as well as continued powers, continued cotangents, continued logarithms, and $f$-expansions. However, we do not include continued fractions, continued exponentials, or forms such as infinite sums and products in which the $t_i$ are linear functions, because the literature on these forms is extensive.</description>

      <title>Injective ellipticity, cancelling operators, and endpoint Gagliardo-Nirenberg-Sobolev inequalities for vector fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.01201v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although Ornstein's nonestimate entails the impossibility to control in general all the $L^1$-norm of derivatives of a function by the $L^1$-norm of a constant coefficient homogeneous vector differential operator, the corresponding endpoint Sobolev inequality has been known to hold in many cases: the gradient of scalar functions (Gagliardo and Nirenberg), the deformation operator (Korn-Sobolev inequality by M.J. Strauss), and the Hodge complex (Bourgain and Brezis). The class of differential operators for which estimates holds can be characterized by a cancelling condition. The proof of the estimates rely on a duality estimate for $L^1$-vector fields lying in the kernel of a cocancelling differential operator, combined with classical linear algebra and harmonic analysis techniques. This characterization unifies classes of known Sobolev inequalities and extends to fractional Sobolev and Hardy inequalities. A similar weaker condition introduced by Rai\c{t}\u{a} characterizes the operators for which there is an $L^\infty$-estimate on lower-order derivatives.</description>

      <title>On $p$-adic spectral zeta functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12775v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The spectral zeta functions have been found many application in several branches of modern physics, including the quantum field theory, the string theory and the cosmology. In this paper, we shall consider the spectral zeta functions and their functional determinants in the $p$-adic field. Our approach for the constructions of $p$-adic spectral zeta functions is to apply the $p$-adic Mellin transforms with respect to locally analytic functions $f$, where $f$ interpolates the spectrum for the Hamiltonian of a quantum model.</description>

      <title>Simplex and interior point methods foe solving budgetary allocation linear programing problem in industry revolution 4.0</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04929v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Increasing the complexity of solving budgetary allocation (NP-hardness problem) has led a wide range of methods to minimize the costs. Metaheuristics and Linear Programming (LP) are the most optimization in this fields. Therefore, this study provides insights and a deep understanding of the applicability of LP models in industry and how to formulate SM and affine IPM for solving real world linear problems. Moreover, it will present a better way to deal with decision making problems through the development and comparison of the SM and affine IPM to solve LP optimization problem to maximize profit. Finally, to other researchers particularly of similar interests who are undertaking further investigation on this topic, this study can be vital as a secondary source of information and guidance.</description>
