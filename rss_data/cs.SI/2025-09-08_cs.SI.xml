      <title>CleanNews: a Network-aware Fake News Mitigation Architecture for Social Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the widespread use of the internet and handheld devices, social media now holds a power similar to that of old newspapers. People use social media platforms for quick and accessible information. However, this convenience comes with a variety of risks. Anyone can freely post content, true or false, with the probability of remaining online forever. This makes it crucial to identify and tackle misinformation and disinformation on online platforms. In this article, we propose CleanNews, a comprehensive architecture to identify fake news in real-time accurately. CleanNews uses advanced deep learning architectures, combining convolutional and bidirectional recurrent neural networks, i.e., LSTM and GRU, layers to detect fake news. A key contribution of our work is a novel embedding technique that fuses textual information with user network structure, allowing the model to jointly learn linguistic and relational cues associated with misinformation. Furthermore, we use two network immunization algorithms, i.e., SparseShield and NetShield, to mitigate the spread of false information within networks. We conduct extensive ablation studies to evaluate the contribution of each model component and systematically tune hyperparameters to maximize performance. The experimental evaluation on two real-world datasets shows the efficacy of CleanNews in combating the spread of fake news.</description>

      <title>ThumbnailTruth: A Multi-Modal LLM Approach for Detecting Misleading YouTube Thumbnails Across Diverse Cultural Settings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Misleading video thumbnails on platforms like YouTube are a pervasive problem, undermining user trust and platform integrity. This paper proposes a novel multi-modal detection pipeline that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to flag misleading thumbnails. We first construct a comprehensive dataset of 2,843 videos from eight countries, including 1,359 misleading thumbnail videos that collectively amassed over 7.6 billion views -- providing a unique cross-cultural perspective on this global issue. Our detection pipeline integrates video-to-text descriptions, thumbnail images, and subtitle transcripts to holistically analyze content and flag misleading thumbnails. Through extensive experimentation and prompt engineering, we evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs, including GPT-4o, GPT-4o Mini, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Gemini-1.5 Flash. Our findings show the effectiveness of LLMs in identifying misleading thumbnails, with Claude 3.5 Sonnet consistently showing strong performance, achieving an accuracy of 93.8\%, precision over 92\%, and recall exceeding 94\% in certain scenarios. We discuss the implications of our findings for content moderation, user experience, and the ethical considerations of deploying such systems at scale. Our findings pave the way for more transparent, trustworthy video platforms and stronger content integrity for audiences worldwide.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Cognitive-Behavioral Fixation via Multimodal User Viewing Patterns on Social Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Digital social media platforms frequently contribute to cognitive-behavioral fixation, a phenomenon in which users exhibit sustained and repetitive engagement with narrow content domains. While cognitive-behavioral fixation has been extensively studied in psychology, methods for computationally detecting and evaluating such fixation remain underexplored. To address this gap, we propose a novel framework for assessing cognitive-behavioral fixation by analyzing users' multimodal social media engagement patterns. Specifically, we introduce a multimodal topic extraction module and a cognitive-behavioral fixation quantification module that collaboratively enable adaptive, hierarchical, and interpretable assessment of user behavior. Experiments on existing benchmarks and a newly curated multimodal dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, laying the groundwork for scalable computational analysis of cognitive fixation. All code in this project is publicly available for research purposes at https://github.com/Liskie/cognitive-fixation-evaluation.</description>

      <title>From Post To Personality: Harnessing LLMs for MBTI Prediction in Social Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Personality prediction from social media posts is a critical task that implies diverse applications in psychology and sociology. The Myers Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI), a popular personality inventory, has been traditionally predicted by machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques. Recently, the success of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revealed their huge potential in understanding and inferring personality traits from social media content. However, directly exploiting LLMs for MBTI prediction faces two key challenges: the hallucination problem inherent in LLMs and the naturally imbalanced distribution of MBTI types in the population. In this paper, we propose PostToPersonality (PtoP), a novel LLM based framework for MBTI prediction from social media posts of individuals. Specifically, PtoP leverages Retrieval Augmented Generation with in context learning to mitigate hallucination in LLMs. Furthermore, we fine tune a pretrained LLM to improve model specification in MBTI understanding with synthetic minority oversampling, which balances the class imbalance by generating synthetic samples. Experiments conducted on a real world social media dataset demonstrate that PtoP achieves state of the art performance compared with 10 ML and DL baselines.</description>

      <title>Analyzing Classroom Interaction Data Using Prompt Engineering and Network Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18912v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Classroom interactions play a vital role in developing critical thinking, collaborative problem-solving abilities, and enhanced learning outcomes. While analyzing these interactions is crucial for improving educational practices, the examination of classroom dialogues presents significant challenges due to the complexity and high-dimensionality of conversational data. This study presents an integrated framework that combines prompt engineering with network analysis to investigate classroom interactions comprehensively. Our approach automates utterance classification through prompt engineering, enabling efficient and scalable dialogue analysis without requiring pre-labeled datasets. The classified interactions are subsequently transformed into network representations, facilitating the analysis of classroom dynamics as structured social networks. To uncover complex interaction patterns and how underlying interaction structures relate to student learning, we utilize network mediation analysis. In this approach, latent interaction structures, derived from the additive and multiplicative effects network (AMEN) model that places students within a latent social space, act as mediators. In particular, we investigate how the gender gap in mathematics performance may be mediated by students' classroom interaction structures.</description>
