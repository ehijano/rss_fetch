      <title>Lieb-Thirring inequalities for the Dirac operator on spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we obtain bounds for the best constants in two inequalities which can be seen as analogues of the Lieb-Thirring inequality, but with the Dirac operator, on the $n-$sphere. We then apply these results in order to improve the known upper bounds on the classical Lieb-Thirring constant on the $n$-sphere for $n\geq 5$.</description>

      <title>On the discrete spectrum of non-selfadjoint operators with applications to Schr\"odinger operators with complex potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For relatively form-compact perturbations of non-negative selfadjoint operators, we obtain an upper bound on the number of discrete eigenvalues in half-planes separated from the positive real axis. The bound is given in terms of a partial trace of the real part of the Birman--Schwinger operator, or an appropriate rotation thereof. As an application to Schr\"odinger operators, we generalise the Cwikel--Lieb--Rozenblum inequality to complex potentials and derive new Lieb--Thirring type inequalities.</description>

      <title>Exact cospectrality probabilities for uniform random matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the conjugation action of orthogonal matrices on symmetric random matrices. Given a fixed orthogonal matrix over an algebraic number field and a random matrix with entries sufficiently uniform in the ring of integers, we wonder what the probability is that the conjugate is again integral. Our main result establishes an exact formula for this probability in terms of the Smith ideals associated to the orthogonal matrix.
  As an illustrative application, we establish exact formulas for the expected number of rational orthogonal matrices that preserve the integrality of a random matrix for every fixed denominator in dimensions two and three. Notably, the dependence on the denominator turns out to be non-monotone due to number-theoretic fluctuations. We also prove bounds on the probability of rational cospectrality with bounded but arbitrarily large denominator.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic expansions for spectral convergence of compact self-adjoint operators on general spectral subsets, with application to kernel Gram matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00999v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the spectral convergence of compact, self-adjoint operators on a separable Hilbert space under operator norm perturbations, and derive asymptotic expansions for their eigenvalues and eigenprojections. Our analysis focuses on eigenvalues indexed by a general subset, with minimal restrictions on their selection. The usefulness of the provided expansions is illustrated by an application to kernel Gram matrices, deriving concentration inequalities as well as weak convergence results, which, in contrast to existing literature, are primarily relying on assumptions on the kernel that are easy to check.</description>

      <title>On the nodal set conjecture for the $p$-Laplacian in circularly symmetric domains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.01210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 1990, P\"utter shown that the nodal line of any second eigenfunction of the Dirichlet Laplacian on a planar bounded simply connected domain $\Omega$ intersects the boundary $\partial\Omega$ provided $\Omega$ has the circular symmetry. By adopting the method of moving polarization, we establish similar information on the nodal set of second eigenfunctions of the Dirichlet $p$-Laplacian on circularly symmetric domains in arbitrary higher dimension.</description>

      <title>Spectral Superposition: A Theory of Feature Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural networks represent more features than they have dimensions via superposition, forcing features to share representational space. Current methods decompose activations into sparse linear features but discard geometric structure. We develop a theory for studying the geometric structre of features by analyzing the spectra (eigenvalues, eigenspaces, etc.) of weight derived matrices. In particular, we introduce the frame operator $F = WW^\top$, which gives us a spectral measure that describes how each feature allocates norm across eigenspaces. While previous tools could describe the pairwise interactions between features, spectral methods capture the global geometry (``how do all features interact?''). In toy models of superposition, we use this theory to prove that capacity saturation forces spectral localization: features collapse onto single eigenspaces, organize into tight frames, and admit discrete classification via association schemes, classifying all geometries from prior work (simplices, polygons, antiprisms). The spectral measure formalism applies to arbitrary weight matrices, enabling diagnosis of feature localization beyond toy settings. These results point toward a broader program: applying operator theory to interpretability.</description>

      <title>Approximation of magnetic Schr\"odinger operators with $\delta$-interactions supported on networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08301v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper deals with the approximation of a magnetic Schr\"odinger operator with a singular $\delta$-potential that is formally given by $(i \nabla + A)^2 + Q + \alpha \delta_\Sigma$ by Schr\"odinger operators with regular potentials in the norm resolvent sense. This is done for $\Sigma$ being the finite union of $C^2$-hypersurfaces, for coefficients $A$, $Q$, and $\alpha$ under almost minimal assumptions such that the associated quadratic forms are closed and sectorial, and $Q$ and $\alpha$ are allowed to be complex-valued functions. In particular, $\Sigma$ can be a graph in $\mathbb{R}^2$ or the boundary of a piecewise $C^2$-domain. Moreover, spectral implications of the mentioned convergence result are discussed.</description>

      <title>Upper bounds on eigenvalue multiplicities for spheres and plane domains revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.06587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.06587v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit two papers which appeared in 1999: M.~Hoffmann-Ostenhof, T.~Hoffmann-Ostenhof, and N.~Nadirashvili [Ann. Global Anal. Geom. 17 (1999) 43--48] and T.~Hoff\-mann-Ostenhof, P.~Michor, and N.~Nadirashvili [Geom. Funct. Anal. 9 (1999) 1169--1188]. The main result of these papers is that the multiplicity of the $k$th eigenvalue of the Riemannian surface $M$ is bounded from above by $(2k-3)$ provided that $k \ge 3$. In the first paper, $M$ is homeomorphic to a sphere. In the second, $M$ is a plane domain with Dirichlet boundary condition. In both cases, the starting label of eigenvalues is $1$. The proofs given in these papers are not very detailed. The purpose of this monograph is to provide detailed general proofs for the above upper bounds and to extend the results to Robin boundary conditions. We provide a survey of previous results (Chap.~1), as well as proofs of prerequisite theorems (Chap.~2). When $M$ is homeomorphic to a sphere, we provide a complete proof of the upper bound, $\mathrm{mult}(\lambda_k) \le (2k-3)$ for any $k\ge 3$, by introducing and carefully studying the combinatorial type and a labeling of the nodal domains of some eigenfunctions (Chap.~3). When $M$ is a plane domain, we consider the three boundary conditions, Dirichlet, Neumann, Robin, and we also study the combinatorial types and a labeling of the nodal domains. More precisely, we prove the inequality $\mathrm{mult}(\lambda_k) \le (2k-2)$ for general $C^{\infty}$ bounded domains and all $k \ge 3$ (Chap.~4). We prove the inequality $\mathrm{mult}(\lambda_k) \le (2k-3)$ for $k \ge 3$ under the additional assumption that the domain is simply connected (Chap.~5). These chapters rely on Euler's inequality applied to the nodal graph and a careful analysis of eigenfunctions which optimize Euler's inequality. Chap.~6 contains related results (nodal line conjecture; Courant-sharp eigenvalues).</description>

      <title>Uniform density in matroids, matrices and graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.15267v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give new characterizations for the class of uniformly dense matroids and study applications of these characterizations to graphic and real representable matroids. We show that a matroid is uniformly dense if and only if its base polytope contains a point with constant coordinates. As a main application, we derive new spectral, structural and classification results for uniformly dense graphs. In particular, we show that connected regular uniformly dense graphs are $1$-tough and thus contain a (near-)perfect matching. As a second application, we show that strictly uniformly dense real represented matroids can be represented by projection matrices with a constant diagonal and that they are parametrized by a subvariety of the Grassmannian.</description>

      <title>Optimization of maximal quantum f-divergences between unitary orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08268v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Maximal quantum $f$-divergences, defined via the commutant Radon--Nikodym derivative, form a fundamental class of distinguishability measures for quantum states associated with operator convex functions. In this paper, we study the optimization of maximal quantum $f$-divergences along unitary orbits of two quantum states.
  For any operator convex function $f:(0,+\infty)\to\mathbb{R}$, we determine the exact minimum and maximum of $$ U \longmapsto \widehat S_f(\rho\|U^*\sigma U) $$ over the unitary group, and derive explicit spectral formulas for these extremal values together with complete characterizations of the unitaries that attain them.
  Our approach combines the integral representation of operator convex functions with majorization theory and a unitary-orbit variational method. A key step is to show that any extremizer must commute with the reference state, which reduces the noncommutative optimization problem to a spectral permutation problem. As a consequence, the minimum is achieved by pairing the decreasing eigenvalues of $\rho$ and $\sigma$, while the maximum corresponds to pairing the decreasing eigenvalues of $\rho$ with the increasing eigenvalues of $\sigma$. Hence, the range of the maximal quantum $f$-divergence along the unitary orbit is exactly the closed interval determined by these two extremal configurations.
  Finally, we compare our results with recent unitary-orbit optimization results for quantum $f$-divergences defined via the quantum hockey-stick divergence, highlighting fundamental structural differences between the two frameworks. Our findings extend earlier extremal results for Umegaki, R\'enyi, and related quantum divergences, and clarify the distinct operator-theoretic nature of maximal quantum $f$-divergences.</description>
