      <title>Dual Phonon Universe in a Spinor Bose Gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show the possibility of simulating a dual universe in a pseudospin-1/2 Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), wherein two phononic modes experience distinct curved spacetime metrics. Through ramping the interspecies interaction of the BEC, we observe that one universe expands, and in the mean time, the other contracts. These findings can be directly verified in existing cold-atom experimental setups by detecting the correlators of the scaled density contrast (SDC): The sizes of the expanded/contracted universes can be deduced from the SDC's oscillating frequencies, while the expanding/contracting histories are reflected in the SDC's amplitude. Our study demonstrates the great potential of spinor BECs for exploring multiverse-related physics in laboratory settings.</description>

      <title>Effective two- and three-body interactions between dressed impurities in a tilted double-well potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the impact and scaling of effective interactions between two and three impurity atoms, induced by a bosonic medium, on their density distributions. To facilitate the detection of mediated interactions, we propose a setup where impurities are trapped in a tilted double-well potential, while the medium is confined to a ring. The tilt of the potential breaks the spatial inversion symmetry allowing us to exploit the population of the energetically elevated well as a probe of induced interactions. For two impurities, the interaction with the medium reduces the impurity population at the energetically elevated well, which we interpret as evidence of induced impurity-impurity attraction. Furthermore, the impact of an induced three-body interaction is unveiled by comparing the predictions of an effective three-body model with many-body simulations. We extend our study for induced interactions to a three-component mixture containing distinguishable impurities. Our results suggest pathways to detect and tune induced two- and three-body interactions.</description>

      <title>Quantum phase transitions in the multiphoton Jaynes-Cummings-Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20185v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore quantum phase transitions in the multiphoton Jaynes-Cummings-Hubbard model (JCHM). Using the mean-field approximation, we show that multiphoton JCHM reveals quantum phase transitions between the Mott insulator (MI), superfluid and Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) phases. The multiphoton JCHM MI phases are classified according to a conserved quantity associated with the total number of excited atoms and photons. If this conserved quantity diverges to infinity, this system is in the BEC phase. Exploring this system we observe the MI, BEC, and superfluid phases in both the single- and two-photon JCHMs although the two-photon JCHM MI phases are restricted to the small conserved quantity subspace. Contrastingly, only the superfluid and BEC phases arise in the three- and four-photon JCHMs (the MI phase is not observed).</description>

      <title>Boundary Time Crystals Induced by Local Dissipation and Long-Range Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20761v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Driven-dissipative many-body system supports nontrivial quantum phases absent in equilibrium. As a prominent example, the interplay between coherent driving and collective dissipation can lead to a dynamical quantum phase that spontaneously breaks time-translation symmetry. This so-called boundary time crystal (BTC) is fragile in the presence of local dissipation, which inevitably relaxes the system to a stationary state. In this work, we demonstrate a robust BTC that is intrinsically induced by local dissipation. We provide extensive numerical evidences to support existence of the BTC and study its behaviors in different regimes. In particular, with decreasing interaction range, we identify a transition from classical limit cycles to quantum BTCs featuring sizable spatial correlations. Our studies significantly broaden the scope of nonequilibrium phases and shed new light on experimental search for dynamical quantum matter.</description>

      <title>Diminished quantum depletion and correlated droplets in one-dimensional dipolar Bose gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03513v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the formation of self-bound states in a one-dimensional dipolar Bose gas under the influence of both strong short-range repulsive and strong non-local attractive interactions. While conventional methods like the Bogoliubov de-Gennes (BdG) method typically fail in regimes with strong interactions due to significant quantum depletion, we reveal a particular scenario where the interplay of these strong interactions significantly mitigates quantum depletion, thus restoring the applicability of the BdG method. Remarkably, this restoration occurs even though the system exhibits pronounced anti-bunching, a feature usually linked with strongly correlated systems. By comparing our BdG results with exact ab initio calculations, we confirm the accuracy of the BdG approach in predicting the ground-state energy and correlation functions under these conditions. Furthermore, we demonstrate that adjusting the polarization direction of the dipoles allows for a tunable transition between a strongly interacting regime and the novel balanced regime explored in this research.</description>

      <title>Vortex phases and domain walls in trapped spinor Bose-Einstein condensates with inhomogeneous spin-orbital-angular-momentum coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01590v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the ground-state structures and vortex configurations in a two-component Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) under the influence of spin-orbital-angular-momentum coupling (SOAMC) with a high spatial inhomogeneity and high characteristic orbital angular momentum. By modulating the coupling strength, we uncover two distinct quantum phases: a stripe phase at low coupling strengths and a new vortex-necklace phase at higher coupling intensities. The latter is characterized by vortices forming a ring-shaped structure that acts as a domain wall, a unique phase boundary between a central stripe phase and an outer single-momentum phase. For a better understanding of this new mixed phase of the system, we develop an analytical model to describe the domain wall radius as a function of coupling strength, which aligns well with numerical simulations. Our findings contribute to the understanding of SOAMC-driven quantum phase transitions and domain wall formation, offering new insights into topological phenomena in ultracold atomic systems.</description>

      <title>Moir\'e Superradiance in Cavity Quantum Electrodynamics with Quantum Atom Gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17696v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As a novel platform for exploring exotic quantum phenomena, the moir\'e lattice has garnered significant interest in solid-state physics, photonics, and cold atom physics. While moir\'e lattices in two- and three-dimensional systems have been proposed for neutral cold atoms, the simpler one-dimensional moir\'e effect remains largely unexplored. We present a scheme demonstrating moir\'e effects in a one-dimensional cold atom-cavity coupling system, which resembles a generalized open Dicke model exhibiting superradiant phase transitions. We reveal a strong link between the phase transition critical point and the one-dimensional moir\'e parameter. Additionally, we derive the cavity field spectrum, connected to the dynamical structure factor, and showcase controlled atomic diffusion. This work provides a new route for testing one-dimensional moir\'e effects with cold atoms and open new possibility of moir\'e metrology.</description>

      <title>Achieving quantum advantage in a search for a violations of the Goldbach conjecture, with driven atoms in tailored potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00517v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The famous Goldbach conjecture states that any even natural number $N$ greater than $2$ can be written as the sum of two prime numbers $p^{\text{(I)}}$ and $p^{\text{(II)}}$. In this article we propose a quantum analogue device that solves the following problem: given a small prime $p^{\text{(I)}}$, identify a member $N$ of a $\mathcal{N}$-strong set even numbers for which $N-p^{\text{(I)}}$ is also a prime. A table of suitable large primes $p^{\text{(II)}}$ is assumed to be known a priori. The device realizes the Grover quantum search protocol and as such ensures a $\sqrt{\mathcal{N}}$ quantum advantage. Our numerical example involves a set of 51 even numbers just above the highest even classical-numerically explored so far [T. O. e Silva, S. Herzog, and S. Pardi, Mathematics of Computation {\bf 83}, 2033 (2013)]. For a given small prime number $p^{\text{(I)}}=223$, it took our quantum algorithm 5 steps to identify the number $N=4\times 10^{18}+14$ as featuring a Goldbach partition involving $223$ and another prime, namely $p^{\text{(II)}}=4\times 10^{18}-239$. Currently, our algorithm limits the number of evens to be tested simultaneously to $\mathcal{N} \sim \ln(N)$: larger samples will typically contain more than one even that can be partitioned with the help of a given $p^{\text{(I)}}$, thus leading to a departure from the Grover paradigm.</description>

      <title>A normalized gradient flow method for computing ground states of spin-2 Bose-Einstein condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14441v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose and analyze an efficient and accurate numerical method for computing ground states of spin-2 Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) by using the normalized gradient flow (NGF). In order to successfully extend the NGF to spin-2 BECs which has five components in the vector wave function but with only two physical constraints on total mass conservation and magnetization conservation, two important techniques are introduced for designing the proposed numerical method. The first one is to systematically investigate the ground state structure and property of spin-2 BECs within a spatially uniform system, which can be used on how to properly choose initial data in the NGF for computing ground states of spin-2 BECs. The second one is to introduce three additional projection conditions based on the relations between the chemical potentials, together with the two existing physical constraints, such that the five projection parameters used in the projection step of the NGF can be uniquely determined. Then a backward-forward Euler finite difference method is adapted to discretize the NGF. We prove rigorously that there exists a unique solution of the nonlinear system for determining the five projection parameters in the full discretization of the NGF under a mild condition on the time step size. Extensive numerical results on ground states of spin-2 BECs with different types of phases and under different potentials are reported to show the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed numerical method and to demonstrate several interesting physical phenomena on ground states of spin-2 BECs.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Witness for Indistinguishable Electrons using Solid-State Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04876v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Characterizing entanglement in quantum materials is crucial for advancing next-generation quantum technologies. Despite recent strides in witnessing entanglement in magnetic materials with distinguishable spin modes, quantifying entanglement in systems formed by indistinguishable electrons remains a formidable challenge. To solve this problem, we introduce a method to extract various four-fermion correlations by analyzing the nonlinearity in resonant inelastic x-ray scattering spectra. These correlations constitute the primary components of the cumulant two-particle reduced density matrix. We further derive bounds for its eigenvalues and demonstrate the linear scaling with fermionic entanglement depth, providing a reliable witness for entanglement. Using the material-relevant strongly correlated models as examples, we show how this entanglement witness can efficiently quantify multipartite entanglement across different phase regions, highlighting its advantage over quantum Fisher information.</description>
