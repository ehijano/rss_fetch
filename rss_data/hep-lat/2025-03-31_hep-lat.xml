      <title>SU(3) centre vortex geometry at finite temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The importance of examining the structure of centre-vortex matter in the ground-state fields of nonabelian gauge-field theory has been demonstrated in the recent centre-vortex based discovery of a second finite-temperature transition in QCD associated with quark deconfinement. This signals the presence of a new phase of ground-state field structure between the well separated chiral and deconfinement transitions. In this short presentation, we re-examine pure SU(3) gauge theory which provides a foundation for the development of techniques for the examination of full QCD. This time, we reconsider visualisations of the centre-vortex structure in light of the quantitative analysis that demonstrates the first order nature of the deconfinement phase transition in the pure-gauge theory. Here we consider a detailed side-by-side comparison of the field structure slightly below and slightly above the critical temperature. The abrupt changes of the field structure in the first order phase transition are easy to observe in the representative visualisations.</description>

      <title>QCD thermodynamics with dynamical chiral fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss properties of thermal Quantum Chromodynamics obtained by means of lattice simulations with overlap fermions. This fermion discretisation preserves chiral symmetry at finite lattice spacing. We present details of the formulation and results for the chiral observables. We determine the topological susceptibility from simulations at fixed global topological charge based on the slab method. Using the measured values of the topological susceptibility we sum the chiral observables over all topological sectors. The volume dependence of the chiral susceptibility is in agreement with the crossover nature of the thermal QCD phase transition. Additionally we discuss the spectrum of the overlap Dirac operator and its volume and temperature dependence. Presented results are obtained at the temporal lattice extent $N_t=8$.</description>

      <title>Aspects of Propagator Sparsening in Lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05404v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In lattice field theory, field sparsening aims to replace quantum fields, or objects constructed from them, with approximations that preserve the appropriate symmetries and maintain many aspects of the physics that the fields determine. For example, an effective sparsening of a quark propagator provides an efficient map from a quark propagator on a fine lattice geometry to a quark propagator defined on a coarser geometry in order to reduce storage and computational costs of subsequent calculational stages while maintaining long-distance correlations and corresponding low-energy physical information. Previous studies have focused on decimating lattice sites or randomly sampling lattice sites to reduce the size of the propagator and subsequent costs of Wick contractions. Here, we extend the study of sparsening to incorporate covariant averaging of spatial sites and examine the effects on two-point and three-point correlation functions involving various hadrons. We find that sparsening is most effective in reproducing the unsparsened versions of these correlation functions when weighted covariant-averaging is sequentially applied many times.</description>

      <title>Quantum decoherence in the Caldeira-Leggett model by the real-time path integral on a computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20699v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose first-principle calculations of an open system based on the real-time path integral formalism treating the environment as well as the system of our interest together on a computer. The sign problem that occurs in applying Monte Carlo methods can be overcome in general by using the so-called Lefschetz thimble method, which has been developed over the past decade. Here we focus on the Caldeira-Leggett model, which is well known, in particular, as a model of quantum decoherence. In this case, the calculation simplifies drastically since the path integral becomes Gaussian for typical initial conditions. The relevant saddle point, which is unique and complex, can be determined by solving a linear equation with a huge but sparse coefficient matrix, and the integration over the Lefschetz thimble can be performed analytically. Thus we obtain, without assumptions or approximations, the reduced density matrix after a long-time evolution, tracing out a large number of harmonic oscillators in the environment. In particular, we confirm the dependence of the decoherence time on the coupling constant and the temperature that has been predicted from the master equation in a certain parameter regime.</description>

      <title>Quantum Simulation with Gauge Fixing: from Ising Lattice Gauge Theory to Dynamical Flux Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01422v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum simulation of synthetic dynamic gauge field has attracted much attentions in recent years. There are two traditional ways to simulate gauge theories. One is to directly simulate the full Hamiltonian of gauge theories with local gauge symmetries. And the other is to engineer the projected Hamiltonian in one gauge subsector. In this work, we provide the third way towards the simulation of gauge theories based on gauge fixing. To demonstrate this concept, we fix the gauge of an Ising lattice gauge field coupled with spinless fermions on a ladder geometry. After the gauge fixing, this gauge theory is reduced to a simpler model, in which fermions hop on a ladder with a fluctuating dynamical $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ flux. Then we shows that this model can be realized via Floquet engineering in ultracold atomic gases. By analytical and numerical studies of this dynamical flux model, we deduce that there is confinement to deconfinement phase transition in the original unfixed gauge theory. This work paves the way to quantum simulate lattice gauge theory using the concept of gauge fixing, relevant both for condensed matter and high energy physics.</description>

      <title>Quantum Computing for Energy Correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13830v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, energy correlators have emerged as powerful observables for probing the fragmentation dynamics of high-energy collisions. We introduce the first numerical strategy for calculating energy correlators using the Hamiltonian lattice approach, providing access to the intriguing nonperturbative dynamics of these observables. Furthermore, motivated by rapid advances in quantum computing hardware and algorithms, we propose a quantum algorithm for calculating energy correlators in quantum field theories. This algorithm includes ground state preparation, the application of source, sink, energy flux and real-time evolution operators, and the Hadamard test. We validate our approach by applying it to the SU(2) pure gauge theory in $2+1$ dimensions on $3\times 3$ and $5\times 5$ honeycomb lattices with $j_{\rm max} = \frac{1}{2}$ at various couplings, utilizing both classical methods and the quantum algorithm, the latter tested using the IBM emulator for specific configurations. The results are consistent with the expected behavior of the strong coupling regime and motivate a more comprehensive study to probe the confinement dynamics across the weak and strong coupling regimes.</description>

      <title>Isospin breaking corrections in $2\pi$ production in tau decays and $e^+e^-$ annihilation: consequences for the muon $g-2$ and CVC tests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07696v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the isospin-breaking corrections relating the $e^+e^-$ hadronic cross-section and the tau decay spectral function, focusing on the di-pion channel, that gives the dominant contribution to the hadronic vacuum polarization piece of the muon $g-2$. We test different types of electromagnetic and weak form factors and show that both, the Gounaris-Sakurai and a dispersive-based approach, describe accurately $\tau$ lepton and $e^+e^-$ data (less when KLOE measurements are included in the fits) and comply reasonably well with analyticity constraints. From these results we obtain the isospin-breaking contribution to the conserved vector current (CVC) prediction of the ${\rm BR}(\tau \to \pi\pi\nu_{\tau})$ and to the $2\pi$ hadronic vacuum polarization (HVP) contribution to the muon $g-2$, in agreement with previous determinations and with similar precision. Our results abound in the convenience of using tau data-based results in the updated data-driven prediction of the muon $g-2$ in the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>Critical fluid dynamics in two and three dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15994v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe a numerical method for simulating stochastic fluid dynamics near a critical point in the Ising universality class. This theory is known as model H, and is expected to govern the non-equilibrium dynamics of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) near a possible critical endpoint of the phase transition between a hadron liquid and the quark-gluon plasma. The numerical algorithm is based on a Metropolis scheme, and automatically ensures that the distribution function of the hydrodynamic variables in equilibrium is independent of the transport coefficients and only governed by the microscopic free energy. We verify dynamic scaling near the critical point of a two and three-dimensional fluid and extract the associated critical exponent $z$. We find $z\simeq 3$ in three dimensions, and $z\simeq 2$ for a two-dimensional fluid. In a finite system, we observe a crossover between the mean field value $z=4$ and the true critical exponent $z\simeq 3$ ($z \simeq 2$ in $d=2$). This crossover is governed by the values of the correlation length and the renormalized shear viscosity.</description>

      <title>Pion condensation versus 2SC, speed of sound, and charge neutrality effects in the quark-meson diquark model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10229v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We employ the two-flavor quark-meson diquark model as a low-energy model for QCD at non-zero quark and isospin chemical potentials $\mu$ and $\mu_I$, and at zero temperature. We map out the phase diagram in the $\mu$-$\mu_I$ plane, which has four phases: a vacuum phase, a phase with condensed charged pions/Cooper pairs of $u$ and $\bar{d}$ quarks, a normal quark matter phase, and a color superconducting phase (2SC phase). %In the 2SC phase, we study the effects of imposing color and %electric charge neutrality. The global symmetry breaking $SU(3)_c\rightarrow SU(2)_c$ in the 2SC phase gives rise to a number of Nambu-Goldstone bosons. We classify them and briefly discuss their properties. We calculate the speed of sound $c_s$ in the two special cases, finite $\mu_I$ and $\mu=0$, and finite $\mu$ and $\mu_I=0$. In both cases, the speed of sound exhibits a maximum and approaches the conformal limit from above as the density increases. For non-zero isospin $\mu_I$, this behavior is in agreement with the speed of sound obtained from lattice simulations. In the 2SC phase, the behavior is qualitatively the same if we impose local charge neutrality. Finally, we discuss the possibility of having a mixed phase of negatively charged normal quark matter and positively charged 2SC matter with global color charge neutrality imposed on the latter.</description>
