      <title>Renormalization Group is the principle behind the Holographic Entropy Cone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that every holographic entropy inequality can be recast in the form: `some entanglement wedges reach deeper in the bulk than some other entanglement wedges.' When the inequality is saturated, the two sets of wedges reach equally deep. Because bulk depth geometrizes CFT scales, the inequalities enforce and protect the holographic Renormalization Group.</description>

      <title>Color-kinematics duality from an algebra of superforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Color-kinematics duality states that the kinematic numerators of the cubic tree-level Yang-Mills scattering amplitudes obey the same symmetry properties that the color factors obey due to the Jacobi identity. We present a novel strategy for deriving this duality, based on the differential forms on a superspace. This space of superforms carries a generalization of a Batalin-Vilkovisky (BV) algebra (BV$^{\square}$ algebra). We show that the homotopy algebra of color-stripped Yang-Mills theory is obtained as a quotient of this space in which a subspace, which is an ideal `up to homotopy', is modded out. This algebra is a subsector of a BV$_{\infty}^{\square}$ algebra. Deriving the latter would provide a first-principle proof of color-kinematics duality from field theory.</description>

      <title>Axion Wormholes and the AdS/CFT Factorization Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates the relevance of Euclidean and complex axion wormholes to the AdS/CFT factorization problem. We use a framework that defines bulk gravitational path integrals by integrating over a real Lorentz-signature contour and then, as needed, perhaps further analytically continuing the resulting functions of boundary conditions. For technical reasons we focus on the case of 2+1 bulk dimensions. The AdS boundary conditions (in any dimension) require us to impose Dirichlet boundary conditions on the standard Euclidean axion $\chi_E$. Fixing its asymptotic values on two boundary spheres to $\pm \chi_{E,\infty}$, we find such wormholes to be subdominant to a UV-sensitive endpoint contribution for $\chi_{E, \infty}$ near the real axis, and that (with our conventions) they become dominant only for $\chi_{E, \infty}$ near the negative imgainary axis. Furthermore, such wormholes are irrelevant to our computation for ${\rm Im} \chi_{E, \infty} &gt;0$ (in the sense that the associated ascent contour fails to intersect the contour of integration). The relevance of the wormhole saddle for real positive $\chi_{E, \infty}$ is in fact a matter of choice, as the saddle then lies on a Stokes' line at which the relevant intersection number changes from zero to one.</description>

      <title>A note on dualities of F(4) type 3d N = 5 SCFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We suggest a new duality between a pair of 3d N = 5 SCFTs, one of ABJ type and one based on the exceptional superalgebra F (4). Our main evidence for the proposed duality is the matching of the superconformal index. In addition to the intrinsic interest in dualities between strongly coupled field theories, the result can also be useful in the classification of 3d N = 5 SCFTs.</description>

      <title>Massive $U(1)$ gauge field and their accompanying scalars in brane world</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In brane-world scenarios, the effective action of a massless bulk \(U(1)\) gauge field preserves gauge invariance via couplings between massive vector Kaluza-Klein (KK) modes and scalar KK modes. In this work, we extend this framework by introducing a term \((\nabla^M X_M)^2\) into the massless bulk \(U(1)\) gauge action. This modification explicitly breaks the full gauge redundancy while preserving a residual gauge symmetry both in the bulk and on the brane. In this setup, the scalar KK modes can acquire masses from the background geometry. Notably, we find that on the 5D brane, these scalar KK modes are lighter than the vector KK modes. In contrast, on the 6D brane, two types of scalar modes emerge; the mixed interactions between them give rise to oscillations among these scalar modes.</description>

      <title>Bootstrapping the Finiteness of Leigh-Strassler Deformations and Uncovering Hidden Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we follow a Bootstrap-like approach to determine the most restricted form the finiteness constraint $\mathcal{F}(q,g,h,\kappa)$, which relates the four parameters of $\mathcal{N}=1$ Leigh-Strassler (LS) deformed models, by imposing mathematical and physical conditions. Focusing first on real parameters, we apply these conditions, together with a new symmetry of the superpotential we named ``q-symmetry'', to strongly constrains $\mathcal{F}$. Imposing only these mathematical conditions is enough, for example, to reproduces the \textit{structure} of the one-loop correction and the \textit{exact result} in the planar limit, which are known from the literature. Extending the analysis to complex parameters, we develop a similar method to obtain the more restricted form of $\mathcal{F}$, though the complex case obscures expansions in ``q-invariant'' variables. We also show how an additional pair $(q,h)$ of integrable deformations arises via q-invariance, and verify that the transformed R-matrix satisfies the Yang-Baxter equation. Moreover, we make two ansatz for the coefficients left in free in the finiteness $\mathcal{F}$ for the real parameters, and while it has some defects, it reveals interesting results when compared with literature: the first predicts the pair of integrable deformations derived in \cite{Mansson2010}, while the second ansatz gives the first correction only at fourth loop order $\kappa^8$ \cite{Mansson2010}, which is known to be true in the planar limit. Furthermore, we study the impact of this symmetry on the algebra of the deformed XXZ spin chain and the moduli-vacuum of LS, and find a gauge/gravity interpretation when $h=0$ for the q-symmetry, obtaining the simplest relation between $k$ (from TsT) and $\beta$ ($q = \exp(\pi i \beta)$) to be linear, in agreement with known results for the Lunin-Maldacena-Frolov deformation \cite{Frolov_2005,Lunin_2005}.</description>

      <title>Spectral and Phase Structure of a QCD-Inspired Unitary Matrix Model with Fisher-Hartwig Singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the large $N$ limit of a complex action unitary matrix model with Fisher-Hartwig singularities, motivated by QCD-inspired models with complexified potentials. We show that the model exhibits multiple ungapped phases and a single gapped phase. The phases are characterized by Fisher-Hartwig singularities in the complex plane. We show that the phase transitions are third order, with transitions between ungapped phases forbidden. We also briefly discuss the implications for the QCD phase diagram at the end.</description>

      <title>Multipartite Non-local Magic and SYK Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the structure of quantum magic in interacting disordered fermionic systems, quantifying non-stabilizerness via the fermionic stabilizer R\'enyi entropy (SRE). To resolve the distribution of magic across different scales, we introduce a multipartite non-local magic functional, constructed from an inclusion-exclusion combination of subsystem contributions. This measure serves as a fine-grained diagnostic, isolating genuinely global contributions and revealing nontrivial interactions between local and collective supports of magic. We illustrate the measure on paradigmatic multipartite states and apply these diagnostics to the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model and its variants. Crucially, for thermal/typical ensembles, we observe a marked disparity between Thermal Pure Quantum (TPQ) states and the thermal density matrix. This reveals a concealed complexity: the immense computational hardness characterizing the unitary evolution is encoded in the specific microstructure of the black hole microstates, while being washed out in the coarse-grained thermodynamic description. Furthermore, in $\mathcal N=2$ supersymmetric SYK, we show that while fortuitous BPS states exhibit intermediate stabilizer complexity, the multipartite measure unveils a rich, sector-dependent pattern of global correlations, distinguishing them from generic chaotic states.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Hole Formation in $f(R)=R+\alpha R^2$ Gravity: Perturbative and Non-Perturbative Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02416v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a complete analytic and semi-analytic study of gravitational collapse and primordial black hole (PBH) formation in the quadratic $f(R)$ model $f(R)=R+\alpha R^2$. We first derive the perturbative expansion around General Relativity (GR), working to first order in the small parameter $\alpha$. For a collapsing flat FLRW dust interior we compute the explicit first-order corrections to the scale factor, the stellar radius, and the horizon formation time. We then use these results to obtain the shift in the PBH formation threshold $\delta_c$. The perturbative effect is small for PBHs forming in the deep radiation era, but becomes important when the background curvature is high. To access this early regime we reformulate the theory in the Einstein frame, where the model becomes GR plus the scalaron field $\phi$ with the Starobinsky potential. We provide the complete ODE system governing both the cosmological background and the evolution of an overdense closed FLRW patch. This system can be numerically integrated to obtain the critical overdensity $\delta_c(k)$ for PBH formation near the end of inflation.</description>

      <title>Research of the Behavior of the Effective Potential in Systems with Phase Transitions through the Prism of A--D--E Type Singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02425v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detecting a scalar singlet interacting through the Higgs portal demands a pivot from conventional particle detection strategies to a comprehensive examination of the effective potential's landscape. The presence, intensity, and first-order nature of the electroweak phase transition are dictated by the critical manifold, with its universal traits encapsulated in the Milnor number $\mu$ -- the dimensionality of the local Jacobian algebra. Throughout the parameter space consistent with experimental observations, the portal potential exhibits a non-simple singularity with $\mu = 9$, maintaining topological stability amid substantial fluctuations in mixing angle, singlet mass, and cubic interactions. High-precision assessments of the Higgs trilinear self-coupling ($\kappa_\lambda$), the uniform rescaling of Higgs couplings ($c_H$), and the stochastic gravitational-wave spectrum ($\Omega_{\mathrm{GW}}$) collectively delineate the catastrophe, extending beyond mere mass matrix analysis. Projections for 2027--2040 collider and LISA capabilities indicate that no viable region supporting a strong first-order transition will evade scrutiny; thus, the singlet will either be identified or conclusively dismissed via direct interrogation of the electroweak vacuum's critical structure.</description>

      <title>On the Stability of Leading-Power Factorization under Photon Propagator Numerator Modifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study collinear factorization in strong electromagnetic backgrounds within SCET for a class of modifications where the photon propagator keeps the vacuum pole structure and $i\varepsilon$ prescription, while the background enters only through a numerator tensor $\Delta_{\mu\nu}(k)$. We show that the set of Landau pinch surfaces and leading momentum regions is unchanged, so the leading-power (LP) factorized form is preserved. Moreover, the LP cusp kernel depends on the background solely through the longitudinal contraction $n^\mu\bar n^\nu\Delta_{\mu\nu}(k)$ in the soft region; if it vanishes (or is power suppressed), the LP soft kernel reduces to the vacuum. As an application, for an occupancy-number modification with the physical polarization-sum tensor $g_{T\mu\nu}(k;n)$, transversality implies $n^\mu\bar n^\nu\Delta_{\mu\nu}=0$, so genuine background sensitivity starts only beyond LP.</description>

      <title>Fixed points of the renormalisation group running of the CKM and PMNS matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02452v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The renormalisation group running of the CKM parameters in the Standard Model is re-examined. For the massless 1-loop running six fixed points are found and their associated operator mixing matrices determined, in terms of the Yukawa couplings of the quarks. CP is an exact symmetry at each of the fixed points. An argument is given that the fixed points found at 1-loop must remain fixed points to all orders and even non-perturbatively, as they are associated with certain differential geometric properties of the space of CKM matrices. The analysis is equally applicable to the CKM matrix in the quark sector and the PMNS matrix in the leptonic sector.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Collider Gravitational Waves sourced by Right-handed Neutrino production from Bubbles: Testing Seesaw, Leptogenesis and Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a minimal type-I seesaw framework in which a first-order phase transition (FOPT), driven by a singlet scalar, produces right-handed neutrinos (RHNs) through bubble collisions, realizing a cosmic-scale collider that probes ultra-high energy scales. The resulting RHN distribution sources novel low-frequency gravitational-waves (GWs) in addition to the standard bubble-collision contribution. A stable lightest RHN can account for the observed dark matter (DM) relic abundance for masses as low as $M_{1} \equiv m_{\rm DM} \gtrsim 10^{6}\,\mathrm{GeV}$, with the associated novel GW signal accessible in LISA, ET and upcoming LVK detectors. If the RHNs are unstable, their CP-violating decays generate the observed baryon asymmetry via leptogenesis for $M_{1} \gtrsim 10^{11}\,\mathrm{GeV}$ and phase transition temperatures $T_* \gtrsim 10^{6}\,\mathrm{GeV}$, for which the novel GW spectrum is detectable in ET, BBO and upcoming LVK. If RHN decays also populate a dark-sector fermion with mass $m_{\chi} \in [10^{-4},10^{4}],\mathrm{GeV}$, successful co-genesis of baryons and asymmetric dark matter occurs for $T_* \gtrsim 10^{7}\,\mathrm{GeV}$ and $M_{1} \gtrsim 10^{9}\,\mathrm{GeV}$, naturally explaining $\Omega_{\rm DM} \simeq 5\Omega_{\rm B}$. The corresponding GW signals are testable with LISA, ET, and BBO. Finally, we analyze a UV-complete multi-Majoron model, based on a global $U(1)_N \times U(1)_{\rm B-L}$ extension, motivated from the hierarchy of lepton masses, which we dub as Mojaron collider. The corresponding FOPT in this model leaves a distinctive GW signature arising from RHN production during $U(1)_N$ symmetry breaking detectable by BBO, ET and upcoming LVK. Successful leptogenesis is realized for heaviest RHN mass $M_3 \sim 10^{10}\,\mathrm{GeV}$ and a $U(1)_N$ breaking vev $v_2 \sim \mathcal{O}(\mathrm{TeV})$, which sets the seesaw scale.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic freedom, lost: Complex conformal field theory in the two-dimensional $O(N&gt;2)$ nonlinear sigma model and its realization in the spin-1 Heisenberg chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The two-dimensional $O(N)$ nonlinear sigma model (NLSM) is asymptotically free for $N&gt;2$: it exhibits neither a nontrivial fixed point nor spontaneous symmetry-breaking. Here we show that a nontrivial fixed point generically does exist in the $\textit{complex}$ coupling plane and is described by a complex conformal field theory (CCFT). This CCFT fixed point is generic in the sense that it has a single relevant singlet operator, and is thus expected to arise in any non-Hermitian model with $O(N)$ symmetry upon tuning a single complex parameter. We confirm this prediction numerically by locating the CCFT at $N = 3$ in a non-Hermitian spin-1 antiferromagnetic Heisenberg chain, finding good agreement between the complex central charge and scaling dimensions and those obtained by analytic continuation of real fixed points from $N\leq 2$. We further construct a realistic Lindbladian for a spin-1 chain whose no-click dynamics are governed by the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian realizing the CCFT. Since the CCFT vacuum is the eigenstate with the smallest decay rate, the system naturally relaxes under dissipative dynamics toward a CFT state, thus providing a route to preparing long-range entangled states through engineered dissipation.</description>

      <title>Resonances in b-EMRIs: playing the black hole piano</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stellar-mass binaries evolving in the vicinity of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) may be common in the universe, either in active galactic nuclei or in other astrophysical environments. Here, we study in detail the resonant excitation of SMBH modes driven by a nearby stellar-mass binary. The resulting resonant energy fluxes vary with the orbital location and frequency of the binary, exhibiting a rich and complex structure. In particular, we find that the total energy flux radiated to infinity is maximized at a gravitational-wave frequency that is close to, but not exactly equal to, the real part of the corresponding quasinormal-mode frequency. Moreover, as the binary is moved farther away from the SMBH, this offset from the mode frequency becomes increasingly pronounced. In addition, for suitable orientations, the binary can effectively ``feed'' the light ring of the SMBH, selectively exciting particular oscillation modes. For rotating (Kerr) black holes, the mode spectrum is significantly more intricate; however, individual modes are also less strongly damped, leading to an enhanced - but more difficult to interpret - resonant response.</description>

      <title>Resummation of the C-Parameter Sudakov Shoulder Using Effective Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The C-parameter distribution in $e^+e^-$ annihilation exhibits a kinematic shoulder at $C = 3/4$, where three-parton final states reach their maximum and a fourth parton is required to exceed it. This boundary generates large logarithms that must be resummed. Using soft-collinear effective theory, we derive a factorization theorem involving new jet and soft functions specific to the C-parameter measurement, in which soft radiation contributes quadratically in transverse momentum. This quadratic structure explains the step discontinuity at leading order. We compute all ingredients at one loop, validate against Monte Carlo, and present matched NLL+NLO results. Unlike thrust and heavy jet mass, the C-parameter has no Sudakov--Landau pole, making momentum-space resummation straightforward. All calculations, numerical analysis, and manuscript preparation were performed by Claude, an AI assistant developed by Anthropic, working under physicist supervision.</description>

      <title>Saving the Unruh Signal: Coherent Cancellation of Spontaneous Emission with Entangled Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Unruh effect is notoriously difficult to detect, as it is exponentially overwhelmed by Wigner--Weisskopf spontaneous emission. We show that this fundamental obstacle can be overcome by harnessing multi-detector quantum interference. By preparing a system of three entangled Unruh--DeWitt detectors in a specific W-state, the spontaneous emission channels can be forced to destructively interfere and vanish, thereby "saving" the Unruh signal by coherently silencing this dominant noise. Our central result is the derivation of the condition for complete and simultaneous cancellation of all right- and left-traveling emission modes. We find this requires preparing the detectors in a unique entangled state whose real-valued coefficients are fixed by an elegant geometric constraint, given by a ratio of sines of the logarithms of the detector accelerations. This work establishes multi-detector entanglement as a precision tool for noise cancellation in relativistic quantum settings, offering a new pathway toward the definitive observation of the Unruh signal.</description>

      <title>Hints Beyond $\Lambda$CDM from Barrow and Tsallis Holographic Dark Energy with GO cutoff</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02567v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Barrow and Tsallis Holographic Dark Energy (HDE) are two recent extensions of the standard HDE framework, obtained by introducing generalized entropy corrections through the Barrow and Tsallis formalisms. In this work, we examine the cosmological consequences of Barrow and Tsallis HDE implemented with the Granda-Oliveros (GO) infrared (IR) cutoff. After deriving the modified Friedmann equations within the thermodynamic-gravity conjecture, we study the background evolution in both non-interacting and interacting dark sector scenarios, emphasizing the role of the entropic parameter in shaping late-time dynamics. We then confront the model with state-of-the-art observations, including PantheonPlus and Union3 Type Ia supernovae, Cosmic Chronometers and DESI DR2 BAO measurements. Using Bayesian MCMC methods, we constrain the model parameters and compare the performance of BHDE with that of $\Lambda$CDM. Our results show that BHDE is compatible with current data and can exhibit a mild statistical preference over the concordance model for certain dataset combinations. Overall, the analysis underscores the relevance of generalized entropy frameworks in late-time cosmology and identifies Barrow-Tsallis holography with the GO cutoff as a competitive alternative to $\Lambda$CDM.</description>

      <title>Tensor renormalization group approach to critical phenomena via symmetry-twisted partition functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02681v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The locality of field theories strongly constrains the possible behaviors of symmetry-twisted partition functions, and thus they serve as order parameters to detect low-energy realizations of global symmetries, such as spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB). We demonstrate that the tensor renormalization group (TRG) offers an efficient framework to compute the symmetry-twisted partition functions, which enables us to detect the symmetry-breaking transition and also to study associated critical phenomena. As concrete examples of SSB, we investigate the two-dimensional (2D) classical Ising model and the three-dimensional (3D) classical $O(2)$ nonlinear sigma model, and we identify their critical points solely from the twisted partition function. By employing the finite-size scaling argument, we find the critical temperature $T_c=2.2017(2)$ with the critical exponent $\nu = 0.663(33)$ for the 3D $O(2)$ model. In addition, we also study the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) criticality of the 2D classical $O(2)$ model by extracting the helicity modulus from the twisted partition functions, and we obtain the BKT transition temperature, $T_{\mathrm{BKT}}=0.8928(2)$.</description>

      <title>ModMax Black Holes in 4-Dimensional Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02717v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study charged black hole solutions in 4-dimensional Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity combined with ModMax nonlinear electrodynamics. This is a conformally invariant extension of Maxwell theory that effectively describes nonlinear electromagnetic phenomena. Within the regularized 4-dimensional Gauss-Bonnet framework, we derive an exact static and spherically symmetric black hole solution that is sourced by a purely electric ModMax field. We explore how higher curvature corrections and nonlinear electromagnetic effects change the spacetime geometry, horizon structure, and energy content of the black hole. We examine the thermodynamic properties in detail, revealing a minimum mass and stable black hole remnants. These findings might be significant in scenarios involving dark-sector compact objects or evaporation endpoints beyond standard general relativity. We also investigate the motion of massive particles, discussing the characteristics of circular orbits and the innermost stable circular orbit, highlighting differences from the Maxwell case. Additionally, we analyze the quasinormal modes of a massive scalar field using WKB methods with Pad\'{e} approximants and the P\"{o}schl-Teller approximation. We explore how the quasinormal spectrum depends on the Gauss-Bonnet coupling, the ModMax parameter, and the scalar field mass. Our results confirm the linear stability of the black hole and offer potential observational signatures of dark-sector inspired modifications of gravity and electrodynamics.</description>

      <title>Symmetric quiver varieties and critical stable envelopes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.02719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symmetric quiver varieties with potentials are natural generalizations of Nakajima quiver varieties, and their equivariant critical cohomologies provide more flexible settings for geometric representation theory and enumerative geometry. In this paper, we study their geometric properties and show that they behave like universally deformed Nakajima quiver varieties. Based on this, we provide a new proof of the existence of critical stable envelopes on them. Following an idea of Nakajima, we give a sheaf theoretic interpretation of critical stable envelopes by the hyperbolic restriction in the affinization of symmetric quiver varieties. The associativity of hyperbolic restrictions implies the triangle lemma of critical stable envelopes.</description>

      <title>Boundary operators in the Brownian loop soup</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.02755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We obtain infinitely many boundary operators in the Brownian loop soup in the subcritical phase by analyzing the conformal block expansion of the two-point function that computes the probability of having two marked points on the upper half-plane being separated by Brownian loops. The resulting boundary operators are primary operators in a 2D CFT with central charge $c\leq1$ and have conformal dimensions that are non-negative integers. By comparing the above-mentioned conformal block expansion with probabilities in the Brownian loop soup, we provide a physical interpretation of the boundary operators of even dimensions as operators that insert multiple outer boundaries of Brownian loops at points on the real axis.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Entropy for Screened Interactions via Dimensional Mapping to Harmonic Oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate interaction-induced corrections to entanglement entropy by mapping a screened Yukawa-type interaction to an effective harmonic oscillator system with controlled anharmonic perturbations. Starting from a one-dimensional interaction $V(x) = -g^2 e^{-\alpha m x}/x$, we reformulate the problem in terms of a four-dimensional radial oscillator, where the finite screening length generates a systematic hierarchy of polynomial interactions in the radial coordinate. This mapping enables a controlled Rayleigh-Schrodinger perturbative treatment of the ground-state wavefunction and an explicit spectral analysis of the reduced density matrix. Working in the weak-screening regime, we compute the leading non-Gaussian correction arising from the quartic interaction $\rho^4$, which appears at order $\alpha^2$ in the expansion of the Yukawa-like potential. We obtain closed analytic expressions for the resulting small eigenvalues of the reduced density matrix and evaluate their contribution to the von Neumann entanglement entropy. We show that the entropy receives analytic corrections at order $\alpha^2$, originating both from explicit anharmonic state-mixing effects and from the implicit $\alpha$ dependence of the Gaussian width parameter. Our results clarify the distinct roles of harmonic renormalization and genuinely non-Gaussian interactions in generating entanglement, establish a systematic power-counting and normalization scheme for higher-order $\rho^{2n}$ perturbations, and provide a transparent oscillator-based framework for computing entanglement entropy in weakly interacting low-dimensional and field-theoretic systems.</description>

      <title>Polarization of the CMB in the Standard Model Extension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In standard cosmology, Cosmic Microwave Background photons near the last scattering surface exhibit only linear polarization due to Compton scattering, leading to the assumption that primordial circular polarization is negligible. However, the physics of Lorentz violation (LV), associated with specific operators, can influence these polarization characteristics. This study employs the Boltzmann equation within the framework of the Standard Model Extension (SME) to explore how the background LV tensor $ K_{AF} $ can induce circular polarization in CMB radiation. By computing the transformation of linear polarization into circular polarization and utilizing the Faraday conversion angle, we derive a bound for $ K_{AF} $ on the order of $ 10^{-41} \, \text{GeV} $, aligning with recent findings. Additionally, we consider the total pure photon terms within the SME, demonstrating that LV in the presence of scalar perturbations can also generate cosmic birefringence (CB) in the CMB radiation. Through analysis of best-fitting CB angles, we establish a more stringent bound of approximately $ 10^{-32} \, \text{GeV} $ for $ K_{F} $.</description>

      <title>Inflation in Extra-Dimensions with one or two branes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.02982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study two inflationary models, namely, monomial inflation and the simplest $\alpha$-attractor inflation, within extra-dimensional frameworks. We consider three extra-dimensional setups: Dark Dimension, which embeds one flat extra-dimension to explain the observed smallness of the 4D cosmological constant $\Lambda_4$; and the two Randall-Sundrum scenarios with one warped extra-dimension, namely RS1 with two branes and RS2 with one brane. We derive the corresponding Friedmann equations, compute the slow-roll parameters in each case, and we fit the experimental data for ($n_s - 1$, $\alpha$, $\Delta_s^2$, $r$), using Planck, BICEP, and ACT data. We find that monomial inflation is strongly disfavored in all scenarios, while $\alpha$-attractor inflation provides an excellent fit to current observations, with extra-dimensional setups offering additional flexibility compared to the standard 4D case.</description>

      <title>Bounce Inflation with Dynamical Dark Energy in Light of DESI DR2</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.03028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument Data Release 2 (DESI DR2) suggests that the dark energy in our universe might be evolving, favoring the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parameterization and a lower Hubble constant. In our previous work, it has been reported that cosmological model with the non-singular bounce inflation (BI) scenario and $\Lambda$CDM might alleviate the Hubble tension into 3$\sigma$ confidence. In this paper, we study the cosmological model of BI with a dynamical dark energy. We find that individual consideration of the CPL parameterization and the data \texttt{DESI DR2} tend to larger Hubble constants for both BI and power law (PL) case with cosmic microwave background (CMB) data. Employing BI with combined CPL parameterization and \texttt{DESI DR2}, we obtain the Hubble constant $H_ 0 = 65.2^{ + 1.8}_{ - 2.2} \ \mathrm{km} \cdot \mathrm{s}^{ -1 } \cdot \mathrm{Mpc}^{ -1 }$, which is larger than $H_ 0 = 64.0 \pm 2.1 \ \mathrm{km} \cdot \mathrm{s}^{ -1 } \cdot \mathrm{Mpc}^{ -1 }$ for the PL case. After considering nontrivial weak lensing effect and spatial curvature as well as adding \texttt{Pantheon+}, BI fits 3.1$\sigma$ confidence of $\Lambda$CDM with $w_ 0 = -0.919 \pm 0.038$ and $w_{ \mathrm{a}} = -0.37 \pm 0.12$, and it prefers evolving dark energy than the PL case with $w_ 0 = -0.960 \pm 0.074$ and $w_{ \mathrm{a}} = -0.15^{ +0.28}_{ -0.25}$.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Spherically Symmetric Spacetime I: Geometro-Hydrodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.03077v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This series of works revisits the geometry, dynamics, and covariant phase space of spherically symmetric spacetimes with the aim of exploring the thermodynamics of spacetime from their dynamical properties. In this first paper, we examine the geometry from the perspective of a foliation by spherical hypersurfaces. Using the rigging technique, we first define a local frame adapted to these slices and reconstruct the geometry and dynamics fully. We clarify the connection of the frame adapted to constant-radius slices, to the Kodama vector and Misner-Sharp energy. Through frame transformations, we then show that the gravitational dynamics in a general foliation-adapted frame can be interpreted as hydrodynamics, i.e., geometro-hydrodynamics: the Einstein equations exhibit the gravitational analogs of the Euler and Young-Laplace equations, and the spacetime can be viewed as the worldvolume of a concentric stack of "gravitational bubbles" -- spherical collective modes with the Misner-Sharp energy density and a geometric pressure. We apply this framework to apparent horizons and study the dynamics. Finally, we demonstrate that a similar geometro-hydrodynamic picture holds in Lovelock gravity. These results provide a fresh perspective on this class of spacetimes and lay the foundation for understanding their thermodynamic properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.03081v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In Newtonian physics, the excitation spectrum of a fluid is the same in all reference frames, up to a trivial shift. In special relativity, this is no longer the case. Relativity of simultaneity causes different inertial observers to measure markedly different excitation spectra, with stability being the only property known to be Lorentz invariant in all causal theories. Here, we show that, under a certain Onsager-like symmetry principle (which applies to kinetic theory and transient hydrodynamics), it is possible to place rigorous bounds on phase velocities, eigenmode convergence radii, spectral gaps, and equilibration rates in any inertial frame, using only information about the rest frame spectrum at zero wavenumber. The conventional intuition coming from time dilation is also shown to lead to generically wrong predictions, but becomes accurate if the fluid is non-relativistic in the rest frame.</description>

Abstract: We highlight that integer Heisenberg groups at level 2 underlie topological quantum phenomena: their group algebras coincide with the algebras of quantum observables of abelian anyons in fractional quantum Hall (FQH) systems on closed surfaces. Decades ago, these groups were shown to arise as the fundamental groups of the space of maps from the surface to the 2-sphere -- which has recently been understood as reflecting an effective FQH flux quantization in 2-Cohomotopy. Here we streamline and generalize this theorem using the homotopy theory of H-groups, showing that for $k \in \{1,2,4\}$, the non-torsion part of $\pi_1 \mathrm{Map}\big({(S^{2k-1})^2, S^{2k}}\big)$ is an integer Heisenberg group of level 2, where we identify this level with 2 divided by the Hopf invariant of the generator of $\pi_{4k-1}(S^{2k})$. This result implies the existence of higher-dimensional analogs of FQH anyons in the cohomotopical completion of 11D supergravity ("Hypothesis H").</description>

      <title>Standard Model Higgs Peaks: a Note on the Vacuum Instability during Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03231v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the Standard Model, the Higgs potential develops an instability at high field values when the quartic self-coupling runs negative. Large quantum fluctuations during cosmic inflation could drive the Higgs field beyond the potential barrier, creating regions that would be catastrophic for our observable universe. We point out that the extreme-value statistics describing the peaks (maxima) of the Higgs values is the correct statistics to infer the condition to avoid vacuum instability. Even if this statistics delivers a bound on the Hubble rate during inflation which is only a factor $\sqrt{2}$ stronger than the one commonly adopted in the literature, it is qualitatively distinct and we believe worthwhile communicating it.</description>

      <title>On the Structure of Wave Functions in Complex Chern-Simons Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.00624v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the structure of wave functions in complex Chern-Simons theory on the complement of a hyperbolic knot, emphasizing the similarities with the topological string/spectral theory correspondence. We first conjecture a hidden integrality structure in the holomorphic blocks and show that this structure guarantees the cancellation of potential singularities in the full non-perturbative wave function at rational values of the coupling constant. We then develop various techniques to determine the wave function at such rational points. Finally, we illustrate our conjectures and obtain explicit results in the examples of the figure-eight and three-twist knots. In the case of the figure-eight knot, we also perform a direct evaluation of the state integral in the rational case and observe that the resulting wave function has the features of the ground state for a quantum mirror curve.</description>

      <title>The symplectic potential for leaky boundaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13203v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Charges associated with gauge symmetries are defined on boundaries of spacetimes. But these constructions typically involve divergent quantities when considering asymptotic boundaries. Different prescriptions exist to address this problem, based on ambiguities in the definition of the symplectic potential. We propose a method well suited to leaky boundaries, which describe spacetimes than can exchange matter or radiation with their environment. The main advantage of this approach is that it relies only on the bulk Lagrangian and it is not tied to a specific choice of boundary conditions. The prescription is applied to four dimensional Einstein-Hilbert gravity in the partial Bondi gauge. This leads to a finite symplectic potential for unconstrained boundary data and reveals two new corner symplectic pairs associated with the relaxation of the gauge.</description>

      <title>Classification of $f(R)$ Theories Of Inflation And The Uniqueness of Starobinsky Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02637v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We classify $f(R)$ theories using a mathematical analogy between slow-roll inflation and the renormalization-group flow. We derive the power spectra and spectral indices class by class and compare them with the latest data. The framework used for the classification allows us to determine the general structure of the $f(R)$ functions that belong to each class. Our main result is that only two classes survive. Moreover, we show that the Starobinsky model is the only polynomial $f(R)$ that can realize slow-roll inflation. In fact, all other polynomials belong to a special class that can only realize constant-roll inflation, at least far enough in the past. We point out some of the issues involved in considering a smooth transition between constant-roll and slow-roll inflation in this class of models. Finally, we derive the map that transforms the results from the Jordan frame to the Einstein frame.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22318v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study topological properties of a quantum mechanical system with $U(1)$-symmetry within the functional renormalisation group (fRG) approach. These properties include the vacuum energy structure and the topological susceptibility. Our approach works with a complexification of the flow equation, and specifically we embed the original symmetry into the complex plane, $U(1)\rightarrow \mathbb{C}$. We compute the effective potential of a given topological sector by restricting ourselves to field configurations with a given generalised non-trivial Chern-Simons numbers. The full potential is directly constructed from these sector potentials. Our results compare well with the benchmark results obtained from solving the corresponding Schr\"odinger equation.</description>

Abstract: In this study, we present a novel family of exact black hole solutions constructed in the context of five-dimensional Gauss-Bonnet gravity. These solutions add a non-linear charge to the Ba\~{n}ados-Teitelboim-Zanelli-like configurations known to exist with arbitrary Thurston horizon geometry. We establish constraints on the parameter space defining physically viable black holes, aligning with the standard energy conditions. An explicit proof of the first law of thermodynamics within our scenario is provided. We also employ holographic techniques to characterize the DC conductivities for the distinct horizon geometries, identifying a critical temperature indicative of phase transitions and exploring pertinent limits.</description>

      <title>On non-linear chiral 4-form theories in D=10</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14351v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider properties of non-linear theories of a chiral 4-form gauge field $A_4$ in ten space-time dimensions with an emphasis on a subclass of these theories which are invariant under the $D = 10$ conformal symmetry. We show that general results regarding a peculiar structure of duality-invariant abelian gauge theories in four and six space-time dimensions do not extend to non-linear chiral 4-form theories in ten dimensions. This discrepancy arises primarily from the large number 81 of independent invariants constructible from the self-dual part of the five-form field strength $F_5=dA_4$ in $D=10$, in stark contrast to the single independent (fourth-order) invariants which are building blocks of the actions in the lower dimensional cases. In particular, unlike the $D=4$ and $D=6$ cases, where non-linear duality-invariant theories can be viewed as stress-tensor ($T\overline T$-like) deformations of seed theories, the flow equations in $D=10$ generally involve both stress-tensor invariants and additional higher-order structures constructed from $F_5$. In passing, we prove the equivalence of three Lagrangian formulations of non-linear duality-invariant $p$-form theories: the PST, the Ivanov-Nurmagambetov-Zupnik and the ``clone" one.</description>

      <title>Can Newtonian Gravity Produce Quantum Entanglement?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23584v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate whether Newtonian gravity can generate quantum entanglement between mesoscopic quantum bodies modeled as superposed mass quadrupoles using three complementary approaches: mini-superspace, semiclassical gravity, and stochastic gravity. We systematically analyze gravitationally induced entanglement (GIE) mechanisms and the conditions under which they can arise. Our results support the GIE hypothesis by showing that the mini-superspace framework, which quantizes the parity of the gravitational tidal field, can entangle spatially separate quantum bodies. In contrast, the semiclassical and stochastic gravity models, in which the tidal gravitational field sourced by the quantum bodies remains classical, fail to entangle the final state. These findings clarify recent claims that classical gravity might induce entanglement, and reveal how perturbative treatments can lead to misleading conclusions.</description>

Abstract: Present theoretical predictions for the entanglement entropy through topological defects are violated by numerical simulations. In order to resolve this, we introduce a paradigm shift in the preparation of reduced density matrices in the presence of topological defects, and emphasize the role of defect networks with which they can be dressed. We consider the cases of grouplike and duality defects in detail for the Ising model, and find agreement with all numerically found entanglement entropies. Since our construction functions at the level of reduced density matrices, it accounts for topological defects beyond the entanglement entropy to other entanglement measures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.14186v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive the general form of the effective equations governing black hole dynamics in the limit of a large number of dimensions $D$. These split into a universal \emph{soap-bubble} embedding condition for stationary configurations and a set of nonlinear dynamical evolution equations describing near-horizon fluctuations of $O(1/D)$ amplitude over horizon scales of $O(1/\sqrt{D})$. We obtain these equations in full generality, including arbitrary asymptotic sources in the near-horizon region, and we show that they form a parabolic system with a well-posed initial value problem. To connect the various approaches to large-$D$ black hole dynamics, we also show that both the embedding and dynamical equations can be derived from the covariant membrane formalism. We clarify the intrinsic scope of the large-$D$ approach, emphasizing that it yields a well-posed dynamical evolution only on horizon scales of $O(1/\sqrt{D})$, which is the range where the most relevant horizon dynamics occur. Our results highlight the versatility of these effective theories for studying a wide class of black hole phenomena.</description>

Abstract: We establish a direct correspondence between the Lanczos approach and the orthogonal polynomials approach in random matrix theory. In the large-$N$ and continuum limits, the average Lanczos coefficients and the recursion coefficients become equivalent, with the precise mapping $b(1-x)=\sqrt{R(x)}$ and $a(1-x)=S(x)$. As a result, the two formalisms yield identical expressions for the leading density of states. We further analyze the Krylov dynamics associated with the recursion coefficients and show that the orthogonal polynomials admit a natural interpretation as Krylov polynomials. This picture is realized explicitly in the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble, where all quantities can be computed analytically.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.20331v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Supertranslations are usually defined as asymptotic symmetries associated with spacetime boundaries, such as null infinity and black hole horizons. In this Letter, we show that supertranslations admit a natural, coordinate-independent extension into the bulk of spacetime, realized as transitions between families of null hypersurfaces. This construction applies to generic spacetimes in arbitrary dimensions and unifies the realizations of supertranslations at null infinity and black hole horizons. The bulk supertranslation is connected to boundary supertranslation by characteristic flows. The associated symmetry algebra can be realized by light-ray operators defined on the null hypersurface. Within this framework, the gravitational wave memory effect corresponds to a shift of null hypersurfaces in the bulk. As explicit examples, we compute bulk supertranslations in Minkowski spacetime in arbitrary dimensions and in four-dimensional Schwarzschild spacetime, where we uncover a novel curvature-induced memory effect with observable consequences for light propagation.</description>

Abstract: We establish an exact duality between the extended thermodynamics of five-dimensional charged Gauss-Bonnet AdS black holes and the thermodynamic framework of the dual boundary conformal field theory (CFT). The thermodynamics of the dual CFT involves two central charges originating from the trace anomaly. We demonstrate a precise correspondence between the extended first laws on the bulk and boundary sides. Moreover, the topological charges of the CFT thermodynamics, associated with the phase transition and critical point, coincide with those of the corresponding bulk black hole.</description>

Abstract: Galilean Conformal Algebra (GCA) arises as a controlled nonrelativistic limit of the relativistic conformal algebra. In this paper, we initiate the study of momentum space correlation functions in two-dimensional GCA. We derive and solve momentum space Ward identities to obtain two-point and three-point functions. However, relating them to position space correlation functions presents a challenge as Fourier transforms of the latter do not exist. This is resolved by analytically continuing the boost eigenvalues to imaginary values. In this regime, the Fourier transform of the position space two-point and three-point functions exist and match exactly with the momentum space two-point and three-point function obtained by solving the Ward identities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.00980v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In black hole perturbation theory, the difficulty in separating electromagnetic and gravitational sectors of the coupled Teukolsky equations has prevented a general treatment of scattering processes involving both electromagnetic waves and gravitational waves in presence of a Kerr-Newman black hole. We present the first computation of the gauge-invariant, low-frequency scattering amplitude for graviton photoproduction by a Kerr-Newman black hole at tree level up to $\mathcal{O}\big((\omega/m)^2\big)$ or $\mathcal{O}(S^2)$ and linear in $\kappa$, using the worldline effective field theory. The relevant Wilson coefficients are determined by matching the graviton and photon one-point functions to the Kerr-Newman solution. We obtain the full angular dependence of the conversion cross section in the presence of spin and comment on the factorization relation between the graviton photoproduction amplitude and the photon Compton amplitude for a classical spinning source. The result provides a benchmark for future analyses of coupled gravitoelectromagnetic scattering in spinning charged compact object backgrounds.</description>

      <title>Bell-CHSH inequality and unitary transformations in Quantum Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03840v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unitary transformations are employed to enhance the violations of the Bell-CHSH inequality in relativistic Quantum Field Theory. The case of the scalar field in $1+1$ Minkowski space-time is scrutinized by relying on the Tomita-Takesaki modular theory. The example of the bounded Hermitian operator $sign(\varphi(f))$, where $\varphi(f)$ stands for the smeared scalar field, is worked out. It is shown that unitary deformations enable for violations of the Bell-CHSH inequality. The setup is generalized to the Proca vector field by means of its equivalence with the scalar theory.</description>

      <title>How to obtain slow roll inflation driven by non-linear electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19679v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish for the first time the conditions that must be imposed on the action for a magnetic universe in a theory of non-linear electrodynamics in order to have an asymptotically de Sitter initial state followed by a slow roll inflationary phase. We show that models so far proposed in the literature do not allow for a prolonged inflationary phase consistent with observations. We construct a Lagrangian that reduces to the Maxwell one in weak field; this is the only class of models that satisfies the required conditions for slow roll in the early Universe.</description>

      <title>Freeze-in production of scalaron dark matter in $f(R)$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06436v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the scalaron, a scalar degree of freedom, emerging from the $f(R)$ theory of gravity, can account for the observed dark matter (DM) abundance if its mass is around the MeV scale, to ensure its cosmological stability. Focusing on two well-known $f(R)$ gravity models, we systematically show that if scalaron production proceeds via the freeze-in mechanism, the right relic abundance is satisfied over a very narrow window of reheating temperature $10^{14}\lesssim T_{\rm rh}\lesssim 10^{16}$ GeV. We delineate the viable parameter space of the $f(R)$ models consistent with the observed DM abundance, and highlight relevant experimental constraints from searches targeting DM decay signatures.</description>

      <title>Implications of DESI for Dark Matter &amp; Cosmic Birefringence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12589v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore an interacting dark matter (DM)-dark energy (DE) framework that naturally yields an effective dynamical DE equation of state crossing the phantom barrier at early times, as indicated by recent DESI data, while also accounting for the observed isotropic rotation of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) linear polarization. Within this unified framework, we also explain the DM relic abundance without introducing additional fields or couplings. Depending on the DE potential, we identify two viable scenarios: a superheavy freeze-in DM requiring a high reheating temperature, or a strongly interacting dark sector with a GeV-TeV scale thermal DM candidate.</description>

Abstract: We compute the zero-dimensional Donaldson-Thomas invariants of the quotient stack $[\mathbb{C}^4/\mathbb{Z}_r]$, confirming a conjecture of Cao-Kool-Monavari. Our main theorem is established through an orbifold analogue of Cao-Zhao-Zhou's degeneration formula combined with the zero-dimensional Donaldson-Thomas invariants for $\mathcal{A}_{r-1}\times\mathbb{C}^2$ and an explicit determination of orientations of Hilbert schemes of points on $[\mathbb{C}^4/\mathbb{Z}_r]$.</description>

      <title>Quantization of bounded symplectic domains associated with compact Lie groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05931v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a systematic quantization scheme for bounded symplectic domains of the form $D \times G \subset T^\ast G$, where $D \subset \mathfrak{g}^\ast$ is a bounded region defined by algebraic inequalities and $G$ is a compact Lie group with Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$. The finiteness of the symplectic volume implies that quantization yields a finite-dimensional Hilbert space, with observables represented by Hermitian matrices, for which we provide an explicit realization. Boundary effects necessitate modifications of the standard von Neumann and Dirac conditions, which usually underlie the correspondence principle. Physically, the compact group $G$ plays the role of momentum space, while $\mathfrak{g}^\ast$ corresponds to the (noncommutative) position space of a particle. The assumption of compact momentum space has profound physical consequences, including the supertunneling phenomenon and the emergence of a maximal fermion density.</description>

      <title>Scale dependence improvement of the quartic scalar field thermal effective potential in the optimized perturbation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07250v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Perturbation theory, as well as most thermal field resummation methods widely used to study finite-temperature quantum field theories, presents a non-negligible renormalization scale dependence. To address this limitation, we propose an alternative method that combines the Renormalization Group Improvement (RGI) prescription for the thermal effective potential with the Optimized Perturbation Theory (OPT) variational resummation technique. Here, we apply this new framework, termed Variational Renormalization Group (VRG), to evaluate the effective potential of the scalar $\lambda \phi^4$ theory at finite temperatures, which represents a benchmark model for phase transition studies. We show that the proposed approach significantly improves scale stability, compared to the use of OPT alone, across key thermodynamic quantities, including the effective potential, critical temperature, and pressure. These results establish the VRG as a robust alternative tool for precision studies of thermal phase transitions, with direct implications for cosmological applications (e.g., early-universe thermodynamics) and condensed matter systems.</description>

      <title>Non-Fermi liquid behaviour of CDW instabilities in fractionally-filled moir\'e flatbands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15996v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spin- and valley-polarized fractionally-filled moir\'e flatbands are known to host emergent Fermi-liquid phases, when analysed with the help of a dual description in terms of holes. The dominant Coulomb interactions in an almost flatband endow the fermions with a nontrivial dispersion, when the system is described in terms of the hole operators (rather than the particle operators). In particular, for one-fourth filling, the Fermi surface takes a quasi-triangular shape, which brings about the possibility of charge-density-wave (CDW) ordering in the ground state, characterised by the nesting vectors ($ \mathbf{Q}_n $). The $\mathbf{Q}_n$'s connect antipodal points of the Fermi surface (designated as hot-spots) and are found to belong to the space of reciprocal vectors of the underlying honeycomb structure. The resulting CDW order can be described in terms of instabilities caused by bosonic fields with momenta centred at $\lbrace \mathbf{Q}_n \rbrace $, coupling with the fermions residing in the vicinity of a pair of antipodal hot-spots. When there is a transition from a Fermi liquid to a CDW state, the bosons become massless (or critical), effectuating a non-Fermi liquid behaviour. We set out to identify such non-Fermi liquid phases after constructing a minimal effective action.</description>

      <title>Beyond $\rho^{2/3}$ Scaling: Microscopic Origins and Multimessengers of High-Density Nuclear Symmetry Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05508v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nuclear symmetry energy $E_{\mathrm{sym}}(\rho)$ encoding the cost to make nuclear matter more neutron rich has been the most uncertain component of the EOS of dense neutron-rich nucleonic matter. It affects significantly the radii, tidal deformations, cooling rates and frequencies of various oscillation modes of isolated neutron stars as well as the strain amplitude and frequencies of gravitational waves from their mergers, besides its many effects on structures of nuclei as well as the dynamics and observables of their collisions. Siemens (1970s) observed that $E_{\mathrm{sym}}(\rho)$ scales as $(\rho/\rho_0)^{2/3}$ near the saturation density $\rho_0$ of nuclear matter, since both the kinetic part and the potential contribution (quadratic in momentum) exhibit this dependence. The scaling holds if: (1) the nucleon isoscalar potential is quadratic in momentum, and (2) the isovector interaction is weakly density dependent. After examining many empirical evidences and understanding theoretical findings in the literature we conclude that: (1) Siemens' $\rho^{2/3}$ scaling is robust and serves as a valuable benchmark for both nuclear theories and experiments up to $2\rho_0$ but breaks down at higher densities, (2) Experimental and theoretical findings about $E_{\mathrm{sym}}(\rho)$ up to $2\rho_0$ are broadly consistent, but uncertainties remain large for its curvature $K_{\mathrm{sym}}$ and higher-order parameters, (3) Above $2\rho_0$, uncertainties grow due to poorly constrained spin-isospin dependent tensor and three-body forces as well as the resulting nucleon short-range correlations. Looking forward, combining multimessengers from both observations of neutron stars and terrestrial heavy-ion reaction experiments is the most promising path to finally constraining precisely the high-density $E_{\mathrm{sym}}(\rho)$ and the EOS of supradense neutron-rich matter.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Lattice Surgery: Non-Clifford Gates via Non-Abelian Surface Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20890v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In universal fault-tolerant quantum computing, implementing logical non-Clifford gates often demands substantial spacetime resources for many error-correcting codes, including the high-threshold surface code. A critical mission for realizing large-scale quantum computing is to develop simple and resource-efficient implementations of logical non-Clifford gates. We propose a novel way of implementing non-Clifford operations in the standard surface code based on hybrid lattice surgery. First we generalize the standard lattice surgery to hybrid lattice surgery, where operations of rough merge and rough split happen across different topological codes. Then we apply such procedures between Abelian and non-Abelian codes and show that this can provide non-Clifford operations in the standard surface code, in the form of a magic state or a non-Clifford gate teleportation. Complementing this, we provide a continuum topological field theory description of this hybrid lattice surgery utilizing interfaces between (2+1)d topological orders. From these considerations, we can generalize our protocol to non-Clifford gates and magic states at all finite levels of the Clifford hierarchy, as well as gates beyond the hierarchy. We also discuss protocols extending this framework to qutrits.</description>

      <title>On the Bondi accretion of a self-interacting complex scalar field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04650v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scalar fields with a global U(1) symmetry often appear in cosmology and astrophysics. We study the spherically-symmetric, stationary accretion of such a classical field onto a Schwarzschild black hole in the test-field approximation. Thus, we consider the relativistic Bondi accretion beyond a simplified perfect-fluid setup. We focus on the complex scalar field with canonical kinetic term and with a generic quartic potential which either preserves the U(1) symmetry or exhibits spontaneous symmetry breaking. It is well known that in the lowest order in gradient expansion the dynamics of such a scalar field is well approximated by a perfect superfluid; we demonstrate that going beyond this approximation systematically reduces the accretion rate with respect to the perfect fluid case. Hence, black holes can provide a way to distinguish a perfect fluid from its ultraviolet completion in form of the complex scalar field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23962v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two of the iconic phases of the hole-doped cuprate materials are the intermediate temperature pseudogap metal and the lower temperature $d$-wave superconductor. Following the prescient suggestion of P.~W.~Anderson, there were numerous early theories of these phases as doped quantum spin liquids. However, these theories have had difficulties with two prominent observations:
  (i) angle-dependent magnetoresistance measurements (ADMR) in the pseudogap metal, including observation of the Yamaji effect, present convincing evidence of small hole pockets which can tunnel coherently between square lattice layers (Fang et al., Nature Physics 18, 558 (2022); Chan et al., Nature Physics 21, 1753 (2025)) and
  (ii) the velocities of the nodal Bogoliubov quasiparticles in the $d$-wave superconductor are highly anisotropic, with $v_F \gg v_\Delta$ (Chiao et al., Phys. Rev. B 62, 3554 (2000)).
  These lecture notes review how the fractionalized Fermi Liquid (FL*) state, which dopes quantum spin liquids with gauge-neutral electron-like quasiparticles, resolves both difficulties. Theories of insulating quantum spin liquids employing fractionalization of the electron spin into bosonic or fermionic partons are discussed. Doping the bosonic parton theory leads to a holon metal theory: while not appropriate for the cuprate pseudogap, this theory is argued to apply to the Lieb lattice. Doping the fermionic parton theory leads to a $d$-wave superconductor with nearly isotropic quasiparticle velocities. The construction of the FL* state in a single band Hubbard-type model is described using a quantum dimer model, followed by a more realistic description using the Ancilla Layer Model (ALM), which is then used to obtain the theory of the pseudogap and the $d$-wave superconductor.</description>
