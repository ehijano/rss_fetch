      <title>Fractality in resistive circuits: The Fibonacci resistor networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose two new kinds of infinite resistor networks based on the Fibonacci sequence: a serial association of resistor sets connected in parallel (type 1) or a parallel association of resistor sets connected in series (type 2). We show that the sequence of the network's equivalent resistance converges uniformly in the parameter $\alpha=\frac{r_2}{r_1} \in [0,+\infty)$, where $r_1$ and $r_2$ are the first and second resistors in the network. We also show that these networks exhibit self-similarity and scale invariance, which mimics a self-similar fractal. We also provide some generalizations, including resistor networks based on high-order Fibonacci sequences and other recursive combinatorial sequences.</description>

      <title>Oscillatory and dissipative dynamics of complex probability in non-equilibrium stochastic processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a Markov and stationary stochastic process described by the well-known classical master equation, we introduce complex transition rates instead of real transition rates to study the pre-thermal oscillatory behaviour in complex probabilities. Further, for purely imaginary transition rates we obtain persistent infinitely long lived oscillations in complex probability whose nature depends on the dimensionality of the state space. We also take a peek into cases where we perturb the relaxation matrix for a dichotomous process with an oscillatory drive where the relative sign of the angular frequency of the drive decides whether there will be dissipation in the complex probability or not.</description>

      <title>Models of heat transport with microscopic reversibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The behavior of lattice models in which time reversibility is enforced at the level of trajectories (microscopic reversibility) is studied analytically. Conditions for ergodicity breaking are explored, and a few examples of systems characterized by an additional conserved quantity besides energy are presented. All the systems are characterized by ergodicity restoration when put in contact with a thermal bath, except for specific choices of the interactions between the atoms in the system and the bath. The study shows that the additional conserved quantities return to play a role in non-equilibrium conditions, with behaviors similar to those of some mesoscale systems, in which the transition rates satisfy detailed balance but not microscopic reversibility.</description>

      <title>Exact moments for a run and tumble particle in a harmonic trap with a finite tumble time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of a run and tumble particle in a harmonic trap, with a finite run and tumble time, by a direct integration of the equation of motion. An exact 1D steady state distribution, diagram laws and a programmable Volterra difference equation are derived to calculate any order of moments in any other dimension, both for steady state as well as the Laplace transform in time for the intermediate states. We also use the moments to infer the distribution by considering a Gaussian quadrature for the corresponding measure, and from the scaling law of high order moments.</description>

      <title>Percolation in semicontinuum geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study percolation problems of overlapping objects where the underlying geometry is such that in D-dimensions, a subset of the directions has a lattice structure, while the remaining directions have a continuum structure. The resulting semicontinuum problem describes the percolation of overlapping shapes in parallel layers or lanes with positional constraints for the placement of the objects along the discrete directions. Several semicontinuum percolation systems are analyzed like hypercuboids with a particular focus on 2D and 3D cases, disks, and parallelograms. Adapting the excluded volume arguments to the semicontinuum setting, we show that for the semicontinuum problem of hypercuboids, for fixed side-lengths of the hypercuboids along the directions in which a lattice structure is maintained, the percolation threshold is always independent of the side-lengths along the continuum directions. The result holds even when there is a distribution for the side-lengths along the continuum directions. Trends in the variation of the thresholds, as we vary the linear measure of the shapes along the continuum directions, are obtained for other semicontinuum models like disks and parallelograms in 2D. The results are compared with those of corresponding continuum and lattice models. For the 2D and 3D models considered, using Monte Carlo simulations, we verify the excluded volume predictions for the trends and numerical values of the percolation thresholds. Very good agreement is seen between the predicted numerical values and the simulation results. The semicontinuum setting also allows us to establish a connection between the percolation problem of overlapping shapes in 2D continuum and triangular lattice. We also verify that the isotropy of the threshold for anisotropic shapes and standard percolation universality class is maintained in the semicontinuum setting.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic Langevin Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The physical significance of the stochastic processes associated to the generalized Gibbs ensembles is scrutinized here with special attention to the thermodynamic fluctuations of small systems. The contact with the environment produces an interaction entropy, which controls the distribution of fluctuations and allows writing the generalized Gibbs ensembles for macrostates in potential form. This naturally yields exact nonlinear thermodynamic Langevin equations (TLEs) for such variables, with drift expressed in terms of entropic forces. The analysis of the canonical ensemble for an ideal monoatomic gas and the related TLEs show that introducing currents leads to nonequilibrium heat transfer conditions with interesting bounds on entropy production but with no obvious thermodynamic limit. For a colloidal particle under constant force, the TLEs for macroscopic variables are different from those for the microscopic position, typically used in the so-called stochastic thermodynamics; while TLEs are consistent with the fundamental equation obtained from the Hamiltonian, stochastic thermodynamics requires isothermal conditions and entropy proportional to position.</description>

      <title>Beyond the Carnot Limit in the Internal Cycles of a Quantum Heat Engine under Finite Heat Reservoirs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate, in an analytical fashion, quantum Carnot cycles of a microscopic heat engine coupled to two nite heat reservoirs, whose internal cycles could own higher e ciency than the standard Carnot limit without consuming extra quantum resources, e.g., coherence or squeezing properties. The engine runs time-dependently, involving both the internal and external cycles to collaboratively accomplish a complete Carnot cycle, and the e ciency of the engine depends on the reservoirs heat capacities and the working substance. Our analytical results of the maximum efficiency and the maximum power output clarify the mechanism behind the high performance of the microscopic engines, displaying the key roles played by the nite-sized heat reservoirs. Our proposal is generally valid for any microscopic thermodynamic system and fully feasible under current laboratory conditions.</description>

      <title>Modeling contagious disease spreading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An understanding of the disease spreading phenomenon based on a mathematical model is extremely needed for the implication of the correct policy measures to contain the disease propagation. Here, we report a new model namely the Ising-SIR model describing contagious disease spreading phenomena including both airborne and direct contact disease transformations. In the airborne case, a susceptible agent can catch the disease either from the environment or its infected neighbors whereas in the second case, the agent can be infected only through close contact with its infected neighbors. We have performed Monte Carlo simulations on a square lattice using periodic boundary conditions to investigate the dynamics of disease spread. The simulations demonstrate that the mechanism of disease spreading plays a significant role in the growth dynamics and leads to different growth exponent. In the direct contact disease spreading mechanism, the growth exponent is nearly equal to two for some model parameters which agrees with earlier empirical observations. In addition, the model predicts various types of spatiotemporal patterns that can be observed in nature.</description>

      <title>Tripartite Entanglement In Mixed-Spin Triangle Trimer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heisenberg model spin systems offer favorable and manageable physical settings for generating and manipulating entangled quantum states. In this work mixed spin-(1/2,1/2,1) Heisenberg spin trimer with two different but isotropic Lande g-factors and two different exchange constants is considered. The study undertakes the task of finding the optimal parameters to create entangled states and control them by external magnetic field. The primary objective of this work is to examine the tripartite entanglement of a system and the dependence of the tripartite entanglement on various system parameters. Particularly, the effects of non-conserving magnetization are in the focus of our research. The source of non-commutativity between the magnetic moment operator and the Hamiltonian is the non-uniformity of g-factors. To quantify the tripartite entanglement, an entanglement measure called "tripartite negativity" has been used in this work.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01250v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rare events play a crucial role in understanding complex systems. Characterizing and analyzing them in scale-invariant situations is challenging due to strong correlations. In this work, we focus on characterizing the tails of probability distribution functions (PDFs) for these systems. Using a variety of methods, perturbation theory, functional renormalization group, hierarchical models, large $n$ limit, and Monte Carlo simulations, we investigate universal rare events of critical $O(n)$ systems. Additionally, we explore the crossover from universal to nonuniversal behavior in PDF tails, extending Cram\'er's series to strongly correlated variables. Our findings highlight the universal and nonuniversal aspects of rare event statistics and challenge existing assumptions about power-law corrections to the leading stretched exponential decay in these tails.</description>

      <title>Current fluctuations for the boundary-driven zero-range process on graphs: microscopic versus macroscopic approach and a theory of non-reversible resistor-like networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the joint large deviation rate functional in the limit of large time for the current flowing through the edges of a finite graph for a boundary-driven zero-range dynamics. This generalizes one-dimensional results previously obtained with different approaches \cite{BDGJL1,HRS}; our alternative techniques illuminate various connections and complementary perspectives. In particular, we here use a variational approach to derive the rate functional by contraction from a level 2.5 large deviation rate functional. We perform an exact minimization and finally obtain the rate functional as a variational problem involving a superposition of cost functions for each edge. The contributions from different edges are not independent since they are related by the values of a potential function on the nodes of the graph. The rate functional on the graph is a microscopic version of the continuous rate functional predicted by the macroscopic fluctuation theory \cite{MFT}, and we indeed show a convergence in the scaling limit. If we split the graph into two connected regions by a cutset and are interested just in the current flowing through the cutset, we find that the result is the same as that of an effective system composed of only one effective edge (as happens at macroscopic level and is expected also for other models \cite{Cap}). The characteristics of this effective edge are related to the ``capacities'' of the graph and can be obtained by a reduction using elementary transformations as in electrical networks; specifically, we treat components in parallel, in series, and in $N$-star configurations (reduced to effective complete $N$-graphs). Our reduction procedure is directly related to the reduction to the trace process \cite{L} and, since the dynamics is in general not reversible, it is also closely connected to the theory of non-reversible electrical networks in \cite{B}.</description>

      <title>Microcanonical Free Cumulants in lattice systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the full version of the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH) has been systematized using Free Probability. In this paper, we present a detailed discussion of the Free Cumulants approach to many-body dynamics within the microcanonical ensemble. Differences between the later and canonical averages are known to manifest in the time-dependent fluctuations of extensive operators. Thus, the microcanonical ensemble is essential to extend the application of Free Probability to the broad class of extensive observables. We numerically demonstrate the validity of our approach in a non-integrable spin chain Hamiltonian for extensive observables at finite energy density. Our results confirm the full ETH properties, specifically the suppression of crossing contributions and the factorization of non-crossing ones, thus demonstrating that the microcanonical free cumulants encode ETH smooth correlations for both local and extensive observables.</description>

      <title>The square lattice Ising model with quenched surface disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using exact enumeration, the Casimir amplitude and the Casimir force are calculated for the square lattice Ising model with quenched surface disorder on one surface in cylinder geometry at criticality. The system shape is characterized by the aspect ratio $\rho=L/M$, where the cylinder length $L$ can take arbitrary values, while the circumference $M$ is varied from $M=4$ to $M=54$, resulting in up to $2^{54}$ numerically exact free energy calculations. A careful $M\to\infty$ extrapolation shows that quenched surface disorder is irrelevant in two dimensions, but gives rise to logarithmic corrections.</description>

      <title>Universal critical phase diagram using Gini index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The critical phase boundary of a system, in general, can depend on one or more parameters. We show that by calculating the Gini index ($g$) of any suitably defined response function of a system, the critical phase boundary can always be reduced to that of a single parameter, starting from $g=0$ and terminating at $g=g_f$, where $g_f$ is a universal number for a given universality class. We demonstrate the construction with analytical and numerical calculations of mean field transverse field Ising model and site diluted Ising model on the Bethe lattice, respectively. Both models have two parameter phase boundaries -- transverse field and Temperature for the first case and site dilution and temperature in the second case. Both can be reduced to single parameter transition points in terms of the Gini index. The method is generally applicable for any multi-parameter critical transition.</description>

      <title>Stochastic parametric modulation of linear and non-linear oscillators: Perturbation theory of the response function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a stochastically driven, damped nonlinear oscillator whose frequency is modulated by a white or coloured noise. Using diagrammatic perturbation theory, we find that in the absence of nonlinearity, parametric modulation by a coloured noise can lead to a Kapitza pendulum-like stabilization of an unstable configuration provided the noise is anti-correlated. Further, we show that for modulation by a white noise of amplitude $\lambda$ and correlation strength $F$, the system will have an extremely large response if the product of $\lambda^{2}F$ equals a specific combination of the frequency and the damping coefficient. This prediction can be experimentally tested.</description>

      <title>Probing the mesoscopics of competing interactions with the thermodynamic curvature: the case of a two-parameter ANNNI chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work examines the full scope of long-standing conjectures identifying the invariant thermodynamic curvature $R$ as the correlation volume $\xi^d$ and also as a measure of underlying statistical interactions. To this end, we set up a two-parameter ANNNI (Axial Next Nearest Neighbour Ising) chain featuring two next nearest neighbour (nnn) and a nearest neighbour (nn) interaction. Competition between interactions and resulting frustration engender a rich phase behaviour including a cross-over between two ferrimagnetic sub-phases. We show that $R$ attests to all its conjectured attributes with valuable insights into the character of mesoscopic fluctuating substructures. In a remarkable demonstration of its relevance at a far-from-critical point, $R$ is shown to resolve a hitherto unnoticed tricky issue involving $\xi$. A physically transparent expression for the zero field $R$ helps bring into focus the pivotal role played by some third order fluctuation moments.</description>

      <title>Quick design of feasible tensor networks for constrained combinatorial optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we propose a new method for constrained combinatorial optimization using tensor networks. Combinatorial optimization methods employing quantum gates, such as quantum approximate optimization algorithm, have been intensively investigated. However, their limitations in errors and the number of qubits prevent them from handling large-scale combinatorial optimization problems. Alternatively, attempts have been made to solve larger-scale problems using tensor networks that can approximately simulate quantum states. In recent years, tensor networks have been applied to constrained combinatorial optimization problems for practical applications. By preparing a specific tensor network to sample states that satisfy constraints, feasible solutions can be searched for without the method of penalty functions. Previous studies have been based on profound physics, such as U(1) gauge schemes and high-dimensional lattice models. In this study, we devise to design feasible tensor networks using elementary mathematics without such a specific knowledge. One approach is to construct tensor networks with nilpotent-matrix manipulation. The second is to algebraically determine tensor parameters. For the principle verification of the proposed method, we constructed a feasible tensor network for facility location problem and conducted imaginary time evolution. We found that feasible solutions were obtained during the evolution, ultimately leading to the optimal solution. The proposed method is expected to facilitate the discovery of feasible tensor networks for constrained combinatorial optimization problems.</description>

      <title>The effect of quenched heterogeneity on creep lifetimes of disordered materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the problem of describing creep in heterogeneous materials by an effective temperature by considering more realistic (and complex) non-mean-field elastic redistribution kernels. We show first, from theoretical considerations, that, if elastic stress redistribution and memory effects are neglected, the average creep failure time follows an Arrhenius expression with an effective temperature explicitly increasing with the quenched heterogeneity. Using a thermally activated progressive damage model of compressive failure, we show that this holds true when taking into account elastic interactions and memory effects, however with an effective temperature $T_{eff}$ depending as well on the nature of the (non-democratic) elastic interaction kernel. We observe that the variability of creep lifetimes, for given external conditions of load and temperature, is roughly proportional to the mean lifetime, therefore depends as well on $T$, on quenched heterogeneity, and the elastic kernel. Finally, we discuss the implications of this effective temperature effect on the interpretation of macroscopic creep tests to estimate an activation volume at the microscale.</description>

      <title>2D additive small-world network with distance-dependent interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we have employed Monte Carlo calculations to study the Ising model on a 2D additive small-world network with long-range interactions depending on the geometric distance between interacting sites. The network is initially defined by a regular square lattice and with probability $p$ each site is tested for the possibility of creating a long-range interaction with any other site that has not yet received one. Here, we used the specific case where $p=1$, meaning that every site in the network has one long-range interaction in addition to the short-range interactions of the regular lattice. These long-range interactions depend on a power-law form, $J_{ij}=r_{ij}^{-\alpha}$, with the geometric distance $r_{ij}$ between connected sites $i$ and $j$. In current two-dimensional model, we found that mean-field critical behavior is observed only at $\alpha=0$. As $\alpha$ increases, the network size influences the phase transition point of the system, i.e., indicating a crossover behavior. However, given the two-dimensional system, we found the critical behavior of the short-range interaction at $\alpha\approx2$. Thus, the limitation in the number of long-range interactions compared to the globally coupled model, as well as the form of the decay of these interactions, prevented us from finding a regime with finite phase transition points and continuously varying critical exponents in $0&lt;\alpha&lt;2$.</description>

      <title>Highly complex novel critical behavior from the intrinsic randomness of quantum mechanical measurements on critical ground states -- a controlled renormalization group analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the effects of weak measurements on the quantum critical ground state of the one-dimensional (a) tricritical and (b) critical quantum Ising model, by measuring in (a) the local energy and in (b) the local spin operator in a lattice formulation. By employing a controlled renormalization group (RG) analysis we find that each problem exhibits highly complex novel scaling behavior, arising from the intrinsically indeterministic ('random') nature of quantum mechanical measurements, which is governed by a measurement-dominated RG fixed point that we study within an $\epsilon$ expansion. In the tricritical Ising case (a) we find (i): multifractal scaling behavior of energy and spin correlations in the measured groundstate, corresponding to an infinite hierarchy of independent critical exponents and, equivalently, to a continuum of universal scaling exponents for each of these correlations; (ii): the presence of logarithmic factors multiplying powerlaws in correlation functions, a hallmark of 'logarithmic conformal field theories' (CFT); (iii): universal 'effective central charges' $c^{({\rm eff})}_n$ for the prefactors of the logarithm of subsystem size of the $n$th R\'enyi entropies, which are independent of each other for different $n$, in contrast to the unmeasured critical ground state, and (iv): a universal ("Affleck-Ludwig") 'effective boundary entropy' $S_{\rm{eff}}$ which we show, quite generally, to be related to the system-size independent part of the Shannon entropy of the measurement record, computed explicitly here to 1-loop order. - A subset of these results have so-far also been obtained within the $\epsilon$ expansion for the measurement-dominated critical point in the critical Ising case (b).</description>

      <title>Phases and phase transition in Grover's algorithm with systematic noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While limitations on quantum computation by Markovian environmental noise are well-understood in generality, their behavior for different quantum circuits and noise realizations can be less universal. Here we consider a canonical quantum algorithm - Grover's algorithm for unordered search on $L$ qubits - in the presence of systematic noise. This allows us to write the behavior as a random Floquet unitary, which we show is well-characterized by random matrix theory (RMT). The RMT analysis enables analytical predictions for phases and phase transitions of the many-body dynamics. We find two separate transitions. At moderate disorder $\delta_{c,\mathrm{gap}}\sim L^{-1}$, there is a ergodicity breaking transition such that a finite-dimensional manifold remains non-ergodic for $\delta &lt; \delta_{c,\mathrm{gap}}$. Computational power is lost at a much smaller disorder, $\delta_{c,\mathrm{comp}} \sim L^{-1/2}2^{-L/2}$. We comment on relevance to non-systematic noise in realistic quantum computers, including cold atom, trapped ion, and superconducting platforms.</description>

      <title>Mixed Steklov-Neumann problem: asymptotic analysis and applications to diffusion-controlled reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00213v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many first-passage processes in complex media and related diffusion-controlled reactions can be described by means of eigenfunctions of the mixed Steklov-Neumann problem. In this paper, we investigate this spectral problem in a common setting when a small target or escape window (with Steklov condition) is located on the reflecting boundary (with Neumann condition). We start by inspecting two basic settings: an arc-shaped target on the boundary of a disk and a spherical-cap-shaped target on the boundary of a ball. We construct the explicit kernel of an integral operator that determines the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions and deduce their asymptotic behavior in the small-target limit. By relating the limiting kernel to an appropriate Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator, we extend these asymptotic results to other bounded domains with smooth boundaries. A straightforward application to first-passage processes is presented; in particular, we revisit the small-target behavior of the mean first-reaction time on perfectly or partially reactive targets, as well as for more sophisticated surface reactions that extend the conventional narrow escape problem.</description>

      <title>Phase behaviors and dynamics of active particle systems in double-well potential</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00425v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the phase behaviors and dynamics of self-propelled particles with active reorientation in double-well potential. We observe the self-propelled particles exhibit flocking and clustering in an asymmetric potential trap. By MD simulations, we obtain a phase diagram of flocking with active reorientation and potential asymmetry as parameters. We compare the responses of inactive and active particles to the potential. It shows that active reorientation of particles amplifies the degree of aggregation on one side in the asymmetric potential well. Furthermore, we calculate the mean squared displacement and identify distinct diffusion regimes. These results highlight active particles with active reorientation exhibit greater sensitivity in double-well potentials.</description>

      <title>Universal bound on the relaxation rates for quantum Markovian dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Relaxation rates provide important characteristics both for classical and quantum processes. Essentially they control how fast the system thermalizes, equilibrates, {decoheres, and/or dissipates}. Moreover, very often they are directly accessible to be measured in the laboratory and hence they define key physical properties of the system. Experimentally measured relaxation rates can be used to test validity of a particular theoretical model. Here we analyze a fundamental question: {\em does quantum mechanics provide any nontrivial constraint for relaxation rates?} We prove the conjecture formulated a few years ago that any quantum channel implies that a maximal rate is bounded from above by the sum of all the relaxation rates divided by the dimension of the Hilbert space. It should be stressed that this constraint is universal (it is valid for all quantum systems with finite number of energy levels) and it is tight (cannot be improved). In addition, the constraint plays an analogous role to the seminal Bell inequalities and the well known Leggett-Garg inequalities (sometimes called temporal Bell inequalities). Violations of Bell inequalities rule out local hidden variable models, and violations of Leggett-Garg inequalities rule out macrorealism. Similarly, violations of the bound rule out completely positive-divisible evolution.</description>

      <title>Look beyond additivity and extensivity of entropy for black hole and cosmological horizons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00802v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comparative analysis of the plethora of nonextensive and/or nonadditive entropies which go beyond the standard Boltzmann-Gibbs formulation. After defining the basic notions of additivity, extensivity, and composability we discuss the properties of these entropies and their mutual relations, if they exist. The results are presented in two informative tables supposedly of strong interest to gravity and cosmology community in the context of explored vastly recent days the horizon entropies for black hole and cosmological models. This is since gravitational systems admit long-range interactions which usually lead to a break of the standard additivity rule for thermodynamical systems composed of subsystems in Boltzmann-Gibbs thermodynamics. The features of additivity, extensivity, and the composability are listed systematically. Some brief discussion on the validity of the notion of equilibrium temperature for nonextensive systems is also presented.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thermal transport is a fundamental mechanism of energy transfer process quite distinct from wave propagation phenomena. It can be manipulated well beyond the possibilities offered by natural materials with a new generation of artificial metamaterials: thermal metamaterials. Topological physics, a focal point in contemporary condensed matter physics, is closely intertwined with thermal metamaterials in recent years. Inspired by topological photonics and topological acoustics in wave metamaterials, a new research field emerged recently, which we dub `topological thermotics', which encompasses three primary branches: topological thermal conduction, convection, and radiation. For topological thermal conduction, we discuss recent advances in both 1D and higher-dimensional thermal topological phases. For topological thermal convection, we discuss the implementation of thermal exceptional points with their unique properties and non-Hermitian thermal topological states. Finally, we review the most recent demonstration of topological effects in the near-field and far-field radiation. Anticipating future developments, we conclude by discussing potential directions of topological thermotics, including the expansion into other diffusion processes such as particle dynamics and plasma physics, and the integration with machine learning techniques.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic and energetic constraints on out-of-equilibrium tunneling rates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00981v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study bipartite quantum systems kept at different temperatures where a tunnel coupling between the two subsystems induces transitions. We find two independent constraints on the temperature-bias-dependent, out-of-equilibrium tunneling rates between the two subsystems, which both turn out to be particularly restrictive when the coupled quantum systems are small. These bounds take the form of a thermodynamic and of an energetic constraint, as they are associated with the dissipated heat and with the absorbed energy required to establish and deplete the temperature bias, respectively. The derived constraints apply to a large class of experimentally accessible quantum systems: except for the restriction to the tunneling regime, they hold for arbitrary subsystem Hamiltonians, including interactions or non-linear energy spectra. These results hold for a large class of experimentally relevant systems, ranging from molecular junctions to coupled cavities, and can be tested by, for instance, measuring the out-of-equilibrium tunneling current and its noise.</description>

Abstract: We study the conformation and topological properties of cyclical star polymers with $f$ ring arms, each made of $n$ beads. We find that the conformational properties of unlinked cyclical star polymers are compatible to those of linear star polymers with $2f$ arms made of $n/2$ beads each. This compatibility vanishes when the topology of the star, measured as the degree of linking between arms, changes. In fact, when links are allowed we notice that the gyration radius decreases as a function of the absolute linking number $\vert Lk \vert$ of the arms, regardless of the protocol that is employed to introduce said links. Furthermore, the internal structure of the macromolecules, as highlighted by the radial density function, changes qualitatively for large values of $\vert Lk \vert$.</description>

Abstract: The Maxwell stress tensor for the linear and uniform media in static electromagnetic field implies a new form of pressure caused by the mutual field energy density. When it is introduced into the fundamental thermodynamic equation for the media, we have a new pressure-volume work term. The combination of new term and proper electromagnetic work term naturally gives the well-known form that is currently obtained by a working hypothesis.</description>

      <title>Robust analytic continuation using sparse modeling approach imposed by semi-positive definiteness for multi-orbital systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01509v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Analytic continuation (AC) from imaginary-time Green's function to spectral function is essential in the numerical analysis of dynamical properties in quantum many-body systems. However, this process faces a fundamental challenge: it is an ill-posed problem, leading to unstable spectra against the noise in the Green's function. This instability is further complicated in multi-orbital systems with hybridization between spin-orbitals, where off-diagonal Green's functions yield a spectral matrix with off-diagonal elements, necessitating the matrix's semi-positive definiteness to satisfy the causality. We propose an advanced AC method using sparse modeling for multi-orbital systems, which reduces the effect of noise and ensures the matrix's semi-positive definiteness. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach by contrasting it with the conventional sparse modeling method, focusing on handling Green's functions with off-diagonal elements, thereby demonstrating our proposed method's enhanced stability and precision.</description>

Abstract: The formation, dissolution, and dynamics of multi-particle complexes is of fundamental interest in the study of stochastic chemical systems. In 1976, Masao Doi introduced a Fock space formalism for modeling classical particles. Doi's formalism, however, does not support the assembly of multiple particles into complexes. Starting in the 2000's, multiple groups developed rule-based methods for computationally simulating biochemical systems involving large macromolecular complexes. However, these methods are based on graph-rewriting rules and/or process algebras that are mathematically disconnected from the statistical physics methods generally used to analyze equilibrium and nonequilibrium systems. Here we bridge these two approaches by introducing an operator algebra for the rule-based modeling of multi-particle complexes. Our formalism is based on a Fock space that supports not only the creation and annihilation of classical particles, but also the assembly of multiple particles into complexes, as well as the disassembly of complexes into their components. Rules are specified by algebraic operators that act on particles through a manifestation of Wick's theorem. We further describe diagrammatic methods that facilitate rule specification and analytic calculations. We demonstrate our formalism on systems in and out of thermal equilibrium, and for nonequilibrium systems we present a stochastic simulation algorithm based on our formalism. The results provide a unified approach to the mathematical and computational study of stochastic chemical systems in which multi-particle complexes play an important role.</description>

      <title>Exact computation of Transfer Entropy with Path Weight Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Information processing in networks entails a dynamical transfer of information between stochastic variables. Transfer entropy is widely used for quantification of the directional transfer of information between input and output trajectories. However, currently there is no exact technique to quantify transfer entropy given the dynamical model of a general network. Here we introduce an exact computational algorithm, Transfer Entropy-Path Weight Sampling (TE-PWS), to quantify transfer entropy and its variants in an arbitrary network in the presence of multiple hidden variables, nonlinearity, transient conditions, and feedback. TE-PWS extends a recently introduced algorithm Path Weight Sampling (PWS) and uses techniques from the statistical physics of polymers and trajectory sampling. We apply TE-PWS to linear and nonlinear systems to reveal how transfer entropy can overcome naive applications of data processing inequalities in presence of feedback.</description>

      <title>Relaxation to universal non-Maxwellian equilibria in a collisionless plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01742v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generic equilibria are derived for turbulent relaxing plasmas via an entropy-maximization procedure that accounts for the short-time conservation of certain collisionless invariants. The conservation of these collisionless invariants endows the system with a partial `memory' of its prior conditions, but is imperfect on long time scales due to the development of a turbulent cascade to small scales, which breaks the precise conservation of phase volume, making this memory imprecise. The equilibria are still determined by the short-time collisionless invariants, but the invariants themselves are driven to a universal form by the nature of the turbulence. This is numerically confirmed for the case of beam instabilities in one-dimensional electrostatic plasmas, where sufficiently strong turbulence appears to cause the distribution function of particle energies to develop a universal power-law tail, with exponent -2.</description>

      <title>Using test particle sum rules to construct accurate functionals in classical Density Functional Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fundamental Measure Theory (FMT) is a successful and versatile approach for describing the properties of the hard-sphere fluid and hard-sphere mixtures within the framework of classical density functional theory (DFT). Lutsko [Phys. Rev. E 102, 062137 (2020)] introduced a version of FMT containing two free parameters, to be fixed by additional physical constraints. Whereas Lutsko focused on the stability of crystalline phases, we introduce and employ two statistical mechanical sum rules pertinent for the fluid phase, that are not automatically satisfied by FMT. By minimizing the relative deviation between different routes to calculate the excess chemical potential and the isothermal compressibility we determine the two free parameters of the theory. Our results indicate that requiring consistency with these sum rules can improve the quality of predictions of FMT for properties of the hard-sphere fluid phase. We suggest that employing these (test particle) sum rules, which apply for any interparticle pair-potential, might provide a means of testing the performance and accuracy of general DFT approximations.</description>

      <title>Non-stabilizerness in U(1) lattice gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a thorough investigation of non-stabilizerness - a fundamental quantum resource that quantifies state complexity within the framework of quantum computing - in a one-dimensional U(1) lattice gauge theory. We show how non-stabilizerness is always extensive with volume, and has no direct relation to the presence of critical points. However, its derivatives typically display discontinuities across the latter: This indicates that non-stabilizerness is strongly sensitive to criticality, but in a manner that is very different from entanglement (that, typically, is maximal at the critical point). Our results indicate that error-corrected simulations of lattice gauge theories close to the continuum limit have similar computational costs to those at finite correlation length and provide rigorous lower bounds for quantum resources of such quantum computations.</description>

      <title>Quantum transport on Bethe lattices with non-Hermitian sources and a drain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider quantum transport on a tight-binding model on the Bethe lattice of a finite generation, or the Cayley tree, which may model the energy transport in a light-harvesting molecule. As a new feature to analyze the quantum transport, we add complex potentials for sources on the peripheral sites and for a drain on the central site. We find that the eigenstates that can penetrate from the peripheral sites to the central site are quite limited to the number of generation. All the other eigenstates are localized around the peripheral sites and cannot reach the central site. The former eigenstates can carry the current, which reduces the problem to the quantum transport on a parity-time ($PT$)-symmetric tight-binding chain. When the number of links is common to all generations, the current takes the maximum value at the exceptional point for the zero-energy states, which emerges because of the non-Hermiticity due to the $PT$-symmetric complex potentials. As we introduce randomness in the number of links in each generation of the tree, the resulting linear chain is a random-hopping tight-binding model. We find that the current reaches its maximum not exactly but approximately for a zero-energy state, although it is no longer located at an exceptional point in general.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01902v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a general framework to implement massive Nambu-Goldstone quasi-particles in driven many-body systems. The underlying mechanism leverages an explicit Lie group structure imprinted into an effective Hamiltonian that governs the dynamics of slow degrees of freedom; the resulting emergent continuous symmetry is weakly explicitly broken, giving rise to a massive Nambu-Goldstone mode, with a spectral mass gap scaling linearly with the drive period. We discuss explicit and experimentally implementable realizations, such as Heisenberg-like spin models that support gapped spin-wave excitations. We provide a protocol to certify the existence of the massive Nambu-Goldstone mode from the dynamics of specific observables, and analyse the dispersion spectrum and their lifetime in the presence of weak explicit symmetry breaking.</description>

      <title>Dualization of ingappabilities through Hilbert-space extensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Duality in various dimensions is understood through a Hilbert-space extension method. We rigorously dualize the quantum ingappabilities to discrete height model in one dimension which is inaccessible by earlier work such as flux-insertion arguments. It turns out that the ingappabilities of quantum discrete height model is protected by an exotic ``modulating'' translation symmetry, which is a combination of modulating internal symmetry transformation and the conventional lattice translation. It can be also generalize to higher-form gauge fields in arbitrary dimensions, e.g., $\mathbb{Z}$-gauge theory in two dimensions with $\mathbb{Z}$ one-form symmetry and a modulating translation symmetry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2201.04009v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The parametric cubic van der Waals polynomial $p V^3 - (R T + b p) V^2 + a V - a b$ is analysed mathematically and some new generic features (theoretically, for any substance) are revealed - if the pressure is not allowed to take negative values [temperatures not lower than $1/(4Rb)$], the localization intervals of the three volumes on the isobar-isotherm are: $3b/2 &lt; V_A \le 3b$, $\,\, 2b &lt; V_B &lt; (3 + \sqrt{5})b$, and $3b \le V_C &lt; RT/p + b = V_0 + b$ (with $V_0$ being Clapeyron's ideal gas volume). For lower values of the temperature, the root $V_A$ is bounded from below by $b$, while $V_B$ has the localization interval $b &lt; V_B &lt; 2a/(R \, \tau)$, where $\tau &gt; 0$ is the new minimum temperature of the model. The unstable states of the van der Waals model have also been generically localized: they lie in an interval within the localization interval of $V_B$. A discussion on finding the volumes $V_{A, B, C}$, on the premise of Maxwell's hypothesis, is also presented.</description>

      <title>Full Eigenstate Thermalization via Free Cumulants in Quantum Lattice Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.00713v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Eigenstate-Thermalization-Hypothesis (ETH) has been established as the general framework to understand quantum statistical mechanics. Only recently has the attention been paid to so-called full ETH, which accounts for higher-order correlations among matrix elements, and that can be rationalized theoretically using the language of Free Probability. In this work, we perform the first numerical investigation of the full ETH in physical many-body systems with local interactions by testing the decomposition of higher-order correlators into thermal free cumulants for local operators. We perform exact diagonalization on two classes of local non-integrable (chaotic) quantum many-body systems: spin chain Hamiltonians and Floquet brickwork unitary circuits. We show that the dynamics of four-time correlation functions are encoded in fourth-order free cumulants, as predicted by ETH. Their dependence on frequency encodes the physical properties of local many-body systems and distinguishes them from structureless, rotationally invariant ensembles of random matrices.</description>

      <title>Continuous symmetry breaking of low-dimensional systems driven by inhomogeneous oscillatory driving forces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.14235v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The driving forces of chiral active particles and deformations of cells are often modeled by spatially inhomogeneous but temporally periodic driving forces. Such inhomogeneous oscillatory driving forces have only recently been proposed in the context of active matter, and their effects on the systems are not yet fully understood. In this work, we theoretically study the impact of spatially inhomogeneous oscillatory driving forces on continuous symmetry breaking. We first analyze the linear model for the soft modes in the ordered phase to derive the lower critical dimension of the model, and then analyze the spherical model to investigate more detailed phase behaviors. Interestingly, our analysis reveals that symmetry breaking occurs even in one and two dimensions, where the Hohenberg--Mermin--Wagner theorem prohibits continuous symmetry breaking in equilibrium. Furthermore, fluctuations of conserved quantities, such as density, are anomalously suppressed in the long-wavelength, {\it i.e.}, show hyperuniformity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.04657v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Observing stochastic trajectories with rare transitions between states, practically undetectable on time scales accessible to experiments, makes it impossible to directly quantify the entropy production and thus infer whether and how far systems are from equilibrium. To solve this issue for Markovian jump dynamics, we show a lower bound that outperforms any other estimation of entropy production (including Bayesian approaches) in regimes lacking data due to the strong irreversibility of state transitions. Moreover, in the limit of complete irreversibility, our new effective version of the thermodynamic uncertainty relation sets a lower bound to entropy production that depends only on nondissipative aspects of the dynamics. Such an approach is also valuable when dealing with jump dynamics with a deterministic limit, such as irreversible chemical reactions.</description>

      <title>The non-reciprocal Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.05471v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Systems with non-reciprocal interactions generically display time-dependent states. These are routinely observed in finite systems, from neuroscience to active matter, in which globally ordered oscillations exist. However, the stability of these uniform non-reciprocal phases in noisy spatially-extended systems, their fate in the thermodynamic limit, and the criticality of the corresponding phase transitions are not fully understood. Here, we address these questions by introducing a non-reciprocal generalization of the Ising model and study its critical behavior by means of numerical and analytical approaches. While the mean-field equations predict three stable homogeneous phases (disordered, ordered and a time-dependent swap phase), our large scale numerical simulations reveal a more complex picture. Static order is destroyed in any finite dimension due to the growth of rare droplets unless the symmetry between the two spins types is broken triggering a stabilizing droplet-capture mechanism. The swap phase is destroyed by fluctuations in two dimensions through the proliferation of spiral defects, but stabilized in three dimensions where non-reciprocity changes the critical exponents from Ising to XY, thus giving rise to a robust spatially-distributed clock.</description>

      <title>Universality of closed nested paths in two-dimensional percolation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.18700v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent work on percolation in $d=2$ [J. Phys. A {\bf 55} 204002] introduced an operator that gives a weight $k^{\ell}$ to configurations with $\ell$ `nested paths' (NP), i.e. disjoint cycles surrounding the origin, if there exists a cluster that percolates to the boundary of a disc of radius $L$, and weight zero otherwise. It was found that ${\rm E}(k^{\ell}) \sim L^{-X_{\rm NP}(k)}$, and a formula for $X_{\rm NP}(k)$ was conjectured. Here we derive an exact result for $X_{\rm NP}(k)$, valid for $k \ge -1$, replacing the previous conjecture. We find that the probability distribution ${\rm P}_\ell (L)$ scales as $ L^{-1/4} (\ln L)^\ell [(1/\ell!) \Lambda^\ell]$ when $\ell \geq 0$ and $L \gg 1$, with $\Lambda = 1/\sqrt{3} \pi$. Extensive simulations for various critical percolation models confirm our theoretical predictions and support the universality of the NP observables.</description>

      <title>Mapping the influence of impurity interaction energy on nucleation in a lattice-gas model of solute precipitation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.08342v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study nucleation in the two dimensional Ising lattice-gas model of solute precipitation in the presence of randomly placed static and dynamic impurities. Impurity-solute and impurity-solvent interaction energies are varied whilst keeping other interaction energies fixed. In the case of static impurities, we observe a monotonic decrease in the nucleation rate when the difference between impurity-solute and impurity-solvent interaction energies is increased. The nucleation rate saturates to a minimum value with increasing interaction energy difference when the impurity density is low. However the nucleation rate does not saturate for high impurity densities. Similar behaviour is observed with dynamic impurities both at low and high densities. We explore a broad range of both symmetric and anti-symmetric interactions with impurities and map the regime for which the impurities act as a surfactant, decreasing the surface energy of the nucleating phase. We also characterise different nucleation regimes observed at different values of interaction energy. These include additional regimes where impurities play the role of inert-spectators, bulk-stabilizers or cluster together to create heterogeneous nucleation sites for solute clusters to form.</description>

      <title>Controlling noise with self-organized resetting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.09307v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Biological systems often consist of a small number of constituents and are therefore inherently noisy. To function effectively, these systems must employ mechanisms to constrain the accumulation of noise. Such mechanisms have been extensively studied and comprise the constraint by external forces, nonlinear interactions, or the resetting of the system to a predefined state. Here, we propose a fourth paradigm for noise constraint: self-organized resetting, where the resetting rate and position emerge from self-organization through time-discrete interactions. We study general properties of self-organized resetting systems using the paradigmatic example of cooperative resetting, where random pairs of Brownian particles are reset to their respective average. We demonstrate that such systems undergo a delocalization phase transition, separating regimes of constrained and unconstrained noise accumulation. Additionally, we show that systems with self-organized resetting can adapt to external forces and optimize search behavior for reaching target values. Self-organized resetting has various applications in nature and technology, which we demonstrate in the context of sexual interactions in fungi and spatial dispersion in shared mobility services. This work opens routes into the application of self-organized resetting across various systems in biology and technology.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium Phase Transition in a 2D Ferromagnetic Spins with Effective Interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06162v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of nonequilibrium steady-state (NESS) in the Ising model offers rich insights into the properties of complex systems far from equilibrium. This paper explores the nature of NESS phase transitions in two-dimensional (2D) ferromagnetic Ising model on a square lattice under effective interactions using Monte Carlo (MC) algorithms. This requires extensive MC simulations using the modified Metropolis and modified Glauber update rules. The qualification of the modified update rules is characterized by the definition of an effective parameter $h$. For $|h|&gt;1$, it is analytically shown that the nature of the phase transition (including the critical temperature) is independent of $h$. Furthermore, for $-1&lt;h&lt;1$, we study the steady-state properties of phase transitions using numerical methods. Therefore, we performed simulations for different lattice sizes and measured relevant physical quantities. From the data, we determined the numerical results of the transition temperature and relevant critical exponents for various values of $h$ by applying finite-size scaling (FSS). We found that the FSS analysis of the exponents is consistent with the analytical values of the equilibrium 2D Ising model.</description>

      <title>Entropic pulling and diffusion diode in an It\^o process</title>

Abstract: Biological environments at micrometer scales and below are often crowded, and experience incessant stochastic thermal fluctuations. The presence of membranes/pores, and multiple biological entities in a constricted space can make the damping/diffusion inhomogeneous. This effect of inhomogeneity is presented by the diffusion becoming coordinate-dependent. In this paper, we analyze the consequence of inhomogeneity-induced coordinate-dependent diffusion on Brownian systems in thermal equilibrium under the It\^o's interpretation. We argue that the presence of coordinate-dependent diffusion under It\^o's formulation gives rise to an effective diffusion potential (and, equivalently an entropy) that can have substantial contribution to system's transport. This emergent force when looked at as of entropic origin it provides a physical basis of the notion of the entropic pulling postulated in the context of working of some biological systems.</description>

      <title>Ordering kinetics with long-range interactions: interpolating between voter and Ising models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06917v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the ordering kinetics of a generalization of the voter model with long-range interactions, the $p$-voter model, in one dimension. It is defined in terms of boolean variables $S_{i}$, agents or spins, located on sites $i$ of a lattice, each of which takes in an elementary move the state of the majority of $p$ other agents at distances $r$ chosen with probability $P(r)\propto r^{-\alpha}$. For $p=2$ the model can be exactly mapped onto the case with $p=1$, which amounts to the voter model with long-range interactions decaying algebraically. For $3\le p&lt;\infty$, instead, the dynamics falls into the universality class of the one-dimensional Ising model with long-ranged coupling constant $J(r)=P(r)$ quenched to small finite temperatures. In the limit $p\to \infty$, a crossover to the (different) behavior of the long-range Ising model quenched to zero temperature is observed. Since for $ p &gt; 3$ a closed set of differential equations cannot be found, we employed numerical simulations to address this case.</description>

      <title>Rare Events in Extreme Value Statistics of Jump Processes with Power Tails</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19406v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study rare events in the extreme value statistics of stochastic symmetric jump processes with power tails in the distributions of the jumps, using the big-jump principle. The principle states that in the presence of stochastic processes with power tails statistics, if at a certain time a physical quantity takes on a value much larger than its typical value, this large fluctuation is realised through a single macroscopic jump that exceeds the typical scale of the process by several orders of magnitude. In particular, our estimation focuses on the asymptotic behaviour of the tail of the probability distribution of maxima, a fundamental quantity in a wide class of stochastic models used in chemistry to estimate reaction thresholds, in climatology for earthquake risk assessment, in finance for portfolio management, and in ecology for the collective behaviour of species. We determine the analytical form of the probability distribution of rare events in the extreme value statistics of three jump processes with power tails; L\'evy flights, L\'evy walks and the L\'evy-Lorentz gas. For the L\'evy flights, we re-obtain through the big-jump approach recent analytical results, extending their validity. For the L\'evy-Lorentz gas we show that the topology of the disordered lattice along which the walker moves induces memory effects in its dynamics, which influences the extreme value statistics. Our results are confirmed by extensive numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Bifurcation in correlation length of the Ising model on a "Toblerone" lattice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20749v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The classical Ising chain is the paradigm for the non-existence of phase transitions in 1D systems and was solved by Ernst Ising one hundred years ago. More recently, a decorated two leg Ising ladder has received interest for the curious thermodynamics that resemble a phase transition; a sharp peak in the specific heat at low, but finite temperature. We use this model to reveal a bifurcation in the correlation lengths due to a crossing of the sub-leading eigenvalues of the transfer matrix, which results in two distinct length scales necessary to describe to the decay of correlations. We discuss this phenomenon in the context of the geometric frustration in the model. We also provide additional results to aid in the understanding of the curious thermodynamics of the model through a study of the magnetic susceptibilities.</description>

      <title>Coarsening and metastability of the long-range voter model in three dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11386v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study analytically the ordering kinetics and the final metastable states in the three-dimensional long-range voter model where $N$ agents described by a boolean spin variable $S_i$ can be found in two states (or opinion) $\pm 1$. The kinetics is such that each agent copies the opinion of another at distance $r$ chosen with probability $P(r) \propto r^{-\alpha}$ ($\al &gt;0$). In the thermodynamic limit $N\to \infty$ the system approaches a correlated metastable state without consensus, namely without full spin alignment. In such states the equal-time correlation function $C(r)=\langle S_iS_j\rangle$ (where r is the $i-j$ distance) decrease algebraically in a slow, non-integrable way. Specifically, we find $C(r)\sim r^{-1}$, or $C(r)\sim r^{-(6-\al)}$, or $C(r)\sim r^{-\al}$ for $\al &gt;5$, $3&lt;\al \le 5$ and $0\le \al \le 3$, respectively. In a finite system metastability is escaped after a time of order $N$ and full ordering is eventually achieved. The dynamics leading to metastability is of the coarsening type, with an ever increasing correlation length $L(t)$ (for $N\to \infty$). We find $L(t)\sim t^{\frac{1}{2}}$ for $\al &gt;5$, $L(t)\sim t^{\frac{5}{2\al}}$ for $4&lt;\al \le 5$, and $L(t)\sim t^{\frac{5}{8}}$ for $3\le \al \le 4$. For $0\le \al &lt; 3$ there is not macroscopic coarsening because stationarity is reached in a microscopic time. Such results allow us to conjecture the behavior of the model for generic space dimension.</description>

Abstract: Scale invariance profoundly influences the dynamics and structure of complex systems, spanning from critical phenomena to network architecture. Here, we propose a precise definition of scale-invariant networks by leveraging the concept of a constant entropy loss rate across scales in a renormalization-group coarse-graining setting. This framework enables us to differentiate between scale-free and scale-invariant networks, revealing distinct characteristics within each class. Furthermore, we offer a comprehensive inventory of genuinely scale-invariant networks, both natural and artificially constructed, demonstrating, e.g., that the human connectome exhibits notable features of scale invariance. Our findings open new avenues for exploring the scale-invariant structural properties crucial in biological and socio-technological systems.</description>

Abstract: We consider entropy generating flows for fluids that achieve a steady state in the presence of a driving electric field. Having chosen one among the space of stationarity constraints that define such flows we show how energy and momentum relaxation are related in the presence of dissipation. Furthermore, we find that if such a fluid obeys Onsager reciprocity then the incoherent conductivity must be identically zero and consequently makes no contribution to the observable AC or DC charge conductivities.</description>

Abstract: We adapt statistical models of the physics of complex fluids to study the rheology of granular liquids. This allows us to provide laws of granular rheology based on first principles, which compare well with previously established phenomenological laws. In particular, the very successful law of mu(I) rheology can be understood within our model as the lowest order non trivial Pade approximant of the macroscopic laws of rheology. Our model's ability to describe granular physics outside of the Bagnold scaling regime allows for a natural extension to the rheology of granular suspensions.</description>

      <title>Emergence of Time from Unitary Equivalence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2204.06366v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss the concept of unitary equivalence $\hat{H}\sim\hat{U}^{\dagger}\hat{H}_{\mathrm{mod}}\hat{U}$ between the modular Hamiltonian $\hat{H}_{\mathrm{mod}}$ and the subsystem Hamiltonian $\hat{H}$ in the context of realizing the emergence of time through a unitary operator $\hat{U}$. This concept suggests a duality between the modular flow and time evolution. Additionally, requiring unitary equivalence implies a connection between the "Modular Chaos Bound" and the "Chaos Bound". Furthermore, we demonstrate this duality using quantum chaos diagnostic quantities in the thermofield double state of a fermionic system. Quantum chaos diagnostic quantities are mathematical measures that characterize chaotic behavior in quantum systems. By examining these quantities in the thermofield double state, we illustrate the duality between them and the modular Hamiltonian. We show a specific duality between correlators, the spectral form factor, and the Loschmidt echo with the modular Hamiltonian. The spectral form factor is a quantity that provides information about the energy spectrum of a quantum system, while the Loschmidt echo characterizes the sensitivity of a system's modular time evolution to perturbations. Finally, we demonstrate that a different entanglement spectrum does not impose the same constraint on the subsystem Hamiltonian. The entanglement spectrum is related to entanglement entropy and provides information about the eigenvalues of the reduced density matrix associated with a subsystem. We discuss complex concepts related to the interplay between quantum chaos, time emergence, and the relationship between modular and subsystem Hamiltonians. These ideas are part of ongoing research in quantum information theory and related fields.</description>

      <title>Nonreciprocity and odd viscosity in chiral active fluids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.06901v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Odd viscosity couples stress to strain rate in a dissipationless way. It has been studied in plasmas under magnetic fields, superfluid ${\rm He}^3$, quantum-Hall fluids, and recently in the context of chiral active matter. In most of these studies, odd terms in the viscosity obey Onsager reciprocal relations. Although this is expected in equilibrium systems, it is not obvious that Onsager relations hold in active materials. By directly coarse graining the kinetic energy and independently using both the Poisson-bracket formalism and a kinetic theory derivation, we find that the appearance of a non-vanishing angular momentum density, which is a hallmark of chiral active materials, necessarily breaks Onsager reciprocal relations. This leads to a non-Hermitian dynamical matrix for the total hydrodynamic momentum and to the appearance of odd viscosity and other non-dissipative contributions to the viscosity. Furthermore, by accounting for both the angular momentum density and interactions that lead to odd viscosity, we find regions in the parameter space in which 3D odd mechanical waves propagate and regions in which they are mechanically unstable. The lines separating these regions are continuous lines of exceptional points, suggesting a possible non-reciprocal phase transition.</description>

Abstract: We show that for the ground state of a one dimensional free electron gas on a circle the analytic expression for the canonical ensemble partition function can be easily derived from the density matrix by assuming that the thermodynamic limit coincides with the limit of the eigenfunction expansion of the kinetic energy. This approximation fails to give the finite temperature partition function because those two limits cannot be chosen as coincident.</description>

Abstract: Flocks of animals represent a fascinating archetype of collective behavior in the macroscopic classical world, where the constituents, such as birds, concertedly perform motions and actions as if being one single entity. Here, we address the outstanding question of whether flocks can also form in the microscopic world at the quantum level. For that purpose, we introduce the concept of active quantum matter by formulating a class of models of active quantum particles on a one-dimensional lattice. We provide both analytical and large-scale numerical evidence that these systems can give rise to quantum flocks. A key finding is that these flocks, unlike classical ones, exhibit distinct quantum properties by developing strong quantum coherence over long distances. We propose that quantum flocks could be experimentally observed in Rydberg atom arrays. Our work paves the way towards realizing the intriguing collective behaviors of biological active particles in quantum matter systems. We expect that this opens up a path towards a yet totally unexplored class of nonequilibrium quantum many-body systems with unique properties.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.09740v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce and study a natural multispecies variant of the inhomogeneous PushTASEP with site-dependent rates on the finite ring. We show that the stationary distribution of this process is proportional to the ASEP polynomials at $q = 1$ and $t = 0$. This is done by constructing a multiline process which projects to the multispecies PushTASEP, and identifying its stationary distribution using time-reversal arguments. We also study symmetry properties of the process under interchange of the rates associated to the sites. These results hold not just for events depending on the configuration at a single time in equilibrium, but also for systems out of equilibrium and for events depending on the path of the process over time. Lastly, we give explicit formulas for nearest-neighbour two-point correlations in terms of Schur functions.</description>

      <title>Exact zeros of fidelity in finite-size systems as a signature for probing quantum phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.11951v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The fidelity is widely used to detect quantum phase transitions, which is characterized by either a sharp change of fidelity or the divergence of fidelity susceptibility in the thermodynamical limit when the phase-driving parameter is across the transition point. In this work, we unveil that the occurrence of exact zeros of fidelity in finite-size systems can be applied to detect quantum phase transitions. In general, the fidelity $\mathcal{F}(\gamma,\tilde{\gamma})$ always approaches zero in the thermodynamical limit, due to the Anderson orthogonality catastrophe, no matter whether the parameters of two ground states ($\gamma$ and $\tilde{\gamma}$) are in the same phase or different phases, and this makes it difficult to distinguish whether an exact zero of fidelity exists by finite-size analysis. To overcome the influence of orthogonality catastrophe, we study finite-size systems with twist boundary conditions, which can be introduced by applying a magnetic flux, and demonstrate that exact zeros of fidelity can be always accessed by tuning the magnetic flux when $\gamma$ and $\tilde{\gamma}$ belong to different phases. On the other hand, no exact zero of fidelity can be observed if $\gamma$ and $\tilde{\gamma}$ are in the same phase. We demonstrate the applicability of our theoretical scheme by studying concrete examples, including the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model, Creutz model and Haldane model. Our work provides a practicable way to detect quantum phase transitions via the calculation of fidelity of finite-size systems.</description>

      <title>Honeybee-like collective decision making in a kilobot swarm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.15592v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Drawing inspiration from honeybee swarms' nest-site selection process, we assess the ability of a kilobot robot swarm to replicate this captivating example of collective decision-making. Honeybees locate the optimal site for their new nest by aggregating information about potential locations and exchanging it through their waggle-dance. The complexity and elegance of solving this problem relies on two key abilities of scout honeybees: self-discovery and imitation, symbolizing independence and interdependence, respectively. We employ a mathematical model to represent this nest-site selection problem and program our kilobots to follow its rules. Our experiments demonstrate that the kilobot swarm can collectively reach consensus decisions in a decentralized manner, akin to honeybees. However, the strength of this consensus depends not only on the interplay between independence and interdependence but also on critical factors such as swarm density and the motion of kilobots. These factors enable the formation of a percolated communication network, through which each robot can receive information beyond its immediate vicinity. By shedding light on this crucial layer of complexity --the crowding and mobility conditions during the decision-making--, we emphasize the significance of factors typically overlooked but essential to living systems and life itself.</description>

      <title>Noise-induced phase transitions in hybrid quantum circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16631v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The presence of quantum noises inherent to real physical systems can strongly impact the physics in hybrid quantum circuits with local random unitaries and mid-circuit measurements. The quantum noises with a size-independent occurring probability can lead to the disappearance of a measurement-induced entanglement phase transition and the emergence of a single area-law phase. In this work, we investigate the effects of quantum noises with size-dependent probabilities $q=p/L^{\alpha}$ where $\alpha$ represents the scaling exponent. We have identified a noise-induced entanglement phase transition from a volume law to a power (area) law in the presence (absence) of measurements as $p$ increases when $\alpha=1$. With the help of an effective statistical model, we reveal that the phase transition is of first-order arising from the competition between two types of spin configurations and shares the same analytical understanding as the noise-induced coding transition. This unified picture further deepens the understanding of the connection between entanglement behavior and the capacity of information protection. When $\alpha \neq 1$, one spin configuration always dominates regardless of $p$ and thus the phase transition disappears. Moreover, we highlight the difference between the effects of size-dependent bulk noise and boundary noises. We validate our analytical predictions with extensive numerical results from stabilizer circuit simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.10683v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose energy-saving fast-forward scaling. Fast-forward scaling is a method which enables us to speed up (or slow down) given dynamics in a certain measurement basis. We introduce energy costs of fast-forward scaling, and find possibility of energy-saving speedup for time-independent measurement bases. As concrete examples, we show such energy-saving fast-forward scaling in a two-level system and quantum annealing of a general Ising spin glass. We also discuss the influence of a time-dependent measurement basis, and give a remedy for unwanted energy costs. The present results pave the way for realization of energy-efficient quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Typical thermalization of low-entanglement states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18007v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Proving thermalization from the unitary evolution of a closed quantum system is one of the oldest questions that is still nowadays only partially resolved. Several efforts have led to various formulations of what is called the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis, which leads to thermalization under certain conditions on the initial states. These conditions, however, are sensitive to the precise formulation of the hypothesis. In this work, we focus on the important case of low entanglement initial states, which are operationally accessible in many natural physical settings, including experimental schemes for testing thermalization and for quantum simulation. We prove thermalization of these states under precise conditions that have operational significance. More specifically, motivated by arguments of unavoidable finite resolution, we define a random energy smoothing on local Hamiltonians that leads to local thermalization when the initial state has low entanglement. Finally we show that such a transformation affects neither the Gibbs state locally nor, under generic smoothness conditions on the spectrum, the short-time dynamics.</description>

      <title>Interplay of network structure and talent configuration on wealth dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04175v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The economic success of individuals is often determined by a combination of talent, luck, and assistance from others. We introduce a new agent-based model that simultaneously considers talent, luck, and social interaction. This model allows us to explore how network structure (how agents interact) and talent distribution among agents affect the dynamics of capital accumulation through analytical and numerical methods. We identify a phenomenon as ``talent configuration effect", which refers to the influence of how talent is allocated to individuals (nodes) in the network. We analyze this effect through two key properties: talent assortativity (TA) and talent-degree correlation (TD). In particular, we focus on three economic indicators: growth rate ($n_{\rm rate}$), Gini coefficient (inequality: $n_{\rm Gini}$), and meritocratic fairness ($n_{LT}$). This investigation helps us understand the interplay between talent configuration and network structure on capital dynamics. We find that, in the short term, positive correlations exist between TA and TD for all three economic indicators. Furthermore, the dominant factor influencing capital dynamics depends on the network topology. In scale-free networks, TD has a stronger influence on the economic indices than TA. Conversely, in lattice-like networks, TA plays a more significant role. Our findings address that high socioeconomic homophily can create a dilemma between growth and equality, and that hub monopolization by few highly talented agents makes economic growth strongly dependent on their performances.</description>

      <title>Addendum to "Power-law decay of the fraction of the mixed eigenstates in kicked top model with mixed-type classical phase space"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15874v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By using the Krylov subspace technique to generate the spin coherent states in kicked top model, a prototype model for studying quantum chaos, the accessible system size for studying the Husimi functions of eigenstates can be much larger than that reported in the literature and our previous study Phys. Rev. E 108, 054217 (2023) [arXiv:2308.04824]. In the fully chaotic kicked top, we find that the mean Wehrl entropy localization measure approaches the prediction given by the Circular Unitary Ensemble. In the mixed-type case, we identify mixed eigenstates by the overlap of the Husimi function with regular and chaotic regions in classical compact phase space. Numerically, we show that the fraction of mixed eigenstates scales as $j^{-\zeta}$, a power-law decay as the system size $j$ increases, across nearly two orders of magnitude. This provides supporting evidence for the principle of uniform semiclassical condensation of Husimi functions and the Berry-Robnik picture in the semiclassical limit.</description>

      <title>Exact finite-size scaling of the maximum likelihood spectra in the quenched and annealed Sherrington-Kirkpatrick spin glass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14215v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fine resolution of the discrete eigenvalues at the spectral edge of an $N\times N$ random matrix is required in many applications. Starting from a finite-size scaling ansatz for the Stieltjes transform of the maximum likelihood spectrum, we demonstrate that the scaling function satisfies a first-order ODE of the Riccati type. Further transformation yields a linear second-order ODE for the characteristic function, whose nodes determine leading eigenvalues. Using this technique, we examine in detail the spectral crossover of the annealed Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) spin glass model, where a gap develops below a critical temperature. Our analysis provides analytic predictions for the finite-size scaling of the spin condensation phenomenon in the annealed SK model, validated by Monte Carlo simulations. Deviation of scaling amplitudes from their predicted values is observed in the critical region due to eigenvalue fluctuations. More generally, rescaling the spectral axis, adjusted to the distance of neighboring eigenvalues, offers a powerful approach to handling singularities in the infinite size limit.</description>

      <title>Spread complexity and quantum chaos for periodically driven spin chains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16182v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The complexity of quantum states under dynamical evolution can be investigated by studying the spread with time of the state over a pre-defined basis. It is known that this complexity is minimised by choosing the Krylov basis, thus defining the spread complexity. We study the dynamics of spread complexity for quantum maps using the Arnoldi iterative procedure. The main illustrative quantum many-body model we use is the periodically kicked Ising spin-chain with non-integrable deformations, a chaotic system where we look at both local and non-local interactions. In the various cases we find distinctive behaviour of the Arnoldi coefficients and spread complexity for regular vs. chaotic dynamics: suppressed fluctuations in the Arnoldi coefficients as well as larger saturation value in spread complexity in the chaotic case. We compare the behaviour of the Krylov measures with that of standard spectral diagnostics of chaos. We also study the effect of changing the driving frequency on the complexity saturation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19577v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum magic, or nonstabilizerness, provides a crucial characterization of quantum systems, regarding the classical simulability with stabilizer states. In this work, we propose a novel and efficient algorithm for computing stabilizer R\'enyi entropy, one of the measures for quantum magic, in spin systems with sign-problem free Hamiltonians. This algorithm is based on the quantum Monte Carlo simulation of the path integral of the work between two partition function ensembles and it applies to all spatial dimensions and temperatures. We demonstrate this algorithm on the one and two dimensional transverse field Ising model at both finite and zero temperatures and show the quantitative agreements with tensor-network based algorithms. Furthermore, we analyze the computational cost and provide both analytical and numerical evidences for it to be polynomial in system size.</description>

      <title>Is it possible to overheat ice? The activated melting of TIP4P/Ice at solid-vapor coexistence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16574v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A widely accepted phenomenological rule states that solids with free surfaces cannot be overheated. In this work we discuss this statement critically under the light of the statistical thermodynamics of interfacial roughening transitions. Our results show that the basal face of ice as described by the TIP4P/Ice model can remain mechanically stable for more than one hundred nanoseconds when overheated by 1 K, and for several hundreds of nanoseconds at smaller overheating despite the presence of a significant quasi-liquid layer at the surface. Such time scales, which are often of little experimental significance, can become a concern for the determination of melting points by computer simulations using the direct coexistence method. In the light of this observation, we reinterpret computer simulations of ice premelting and show that current results for the TIP4P/Ice model all imply a scenario of incomplete surface melting. Using a thermodynamic integration path, we reassess our own estimates for the Laplace pressure difference between water and vapor. These calculations are used to measure the disjoining pressure of premelting liquid films and allow us to confirm a minimum of the interfacial free energy at finite premelting thickness of about one nanometer.</description>

      <title>The trade-off between diagonal and off-diagonal elements in the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08297v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To bypass using local observables as intermediate quantities in proving the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH), we have introduced an observable-independent measure of distinguishability. In this paper, we establish the connection between this measure and several other ETH measures in a more natural way. We first demonstrate a universal trade-off relation between the diagonal and off-diagonal elements of the measure. We then extend this discussion to eigenstate typicality and the average observable. This trade-off relationship reveals that the exponential growth of off-diagonal elements directly suppresses their own values, as well as indirectly suppressing the diagonal elements. This provides a new perspective on the physical mechanisms underlying ETH. Finally, through numerical calculations on a one-dimensional Ising spin chain, we explore various trade-off relationships and examine strong and weak ETH.</description>
