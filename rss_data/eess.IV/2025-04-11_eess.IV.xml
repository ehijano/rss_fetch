      <title>GIGA: Generalizable Sparse Image-driven Gaussian Avatars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Driving a high-quality and photorealistic full-body human avatar, from only a few RGB cameras, is a challenging problem that has become increasingly relevant with emerging virtual reality technologies. To democratize such technology, a promising solution may be a generalizable method that takes sparse multi-view images of an unseen person and then generates photoreal free-view renderings of such identity. However, the current state of the art is not scalable to very large datasets and, thus, lacks in diversity and photorealism. To address this problem, we propose a novel, generalizable full-body model for rendering photoreal humans in free viewpoint, as driven by sparse multi-view video. For the first time in literature, our model can scale up training to thousands of subjects while maintaining high photorealism. At the core, we introduce a MultiHeadUNet architecture, which takes sparse multi-view images in texture space as input and predicts Gaussian primitives represented as 2D texels on top of a human body mesh. Importantly, we represent sparse-view image information, body shape, and the Gaussian parameters in 2D so that we can design a deep and scalable architecture entirely based on 2D convolutions and attention mechanisms. At test time, our method synthesizes an articulated 3D Gaussian-based avatar from as few as four input views and a tracked body template for unseen identities. Our method excels over prior works by a significant margin in terms of cross-subject generalization capability as well as photorealism.</description>

      <title>Examining Joint Demosaicing and Denoising for Single-, Quad-, and Nona-Bayer Patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Camera sensors have color filters arranged in a mosaic layout, traditionally following the Bayer pattern. Demosaicing is a critical step camera hardware applies to obtain a full-channel RGB image. Many smartphones now have multiple sensors with different patterns, such as Quad-Bayer or Nona-Bayer. Most modern deep network-based models perform joint demosaicing and denoising with the current strategy of training a separate network per pattern. Relying on individual models per pattern requires additional memory overhead and makes it challenging to switch quickly between cameras. In this work, we are interested in analyzing strategies for joint demosaicing and denoising for the three main mosaic layouts (1x1 Single-Bayer, 2x2 Quad-Bayer, and 3x3 Nona-Bayer). We found that concatenating a three-channel mosaic embedding to the input image and training with a unified demosaicing architecture yields results that outperform existing Quad-Bayer and Nona-Bayer models and are comparable to Single-Bayer models. Additionally, we describe a maskout strategy that enhances the model performance and facilitates dead pixel correction -- a step often overlooked by existing AI-based demosaicing models. As part of this effort, we captured a new demosaicing dataset of 638 RAW images that contain challenging scenes with patches annotated for training, validation, and testing.</description>

      <title>VideoSPatS: Video SPatiotemporal Splines for Disentangled Occlusion, Appearance and Motion Modeling and Editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an implicit video representation for occlusions, appearance, and motion disentanglement from monocular videos, which we call Video SPatiotemporal Splines (VideoSPatS). Unlike previous methods that map time and coordinates to deformation and canonical colors, our VideoSPatS maps input coordinates into Spatial and Color Spline deformation fields $D_s$ and $D_c$, which disentangle motion and appearance in videos. With spline-based parametrization, our method naturally generates temporally consistent flow and guarantees long-term temporal consistency, which is crucial for convincing video editing. Using multiple prediction branches, our VideoSPatS model also performs layer separation between the latent video and the selected occluder. By disentangling occlusions, appearance, and motion, our method enables better spatiotemporal modeling and editing of diverse videos, including in-the-wild talking head videos with challenging occlusions, shadows, and specularities while maintaining an appropriate canonical space for editing. We also present general video modeling results on the DAVIS and CoDeF datasets, as well as our own talking head video dataset collected from open-source web videos. Extensive ablations show the combination of $D_s$ and $D_c$ under neural splines can overcome motion and appearance ambiguities, paving the way for more advanced video editing models.</description>

      <title>Q-Agent: Quality-Driven Chain-of-Thought Image Restoration Agent through Robust Multimodal Large Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Image restoration (IR) often faces various complex and unknown degradations in real-world scenarios, such as noise, blurring, compression artifacts, and low resolution, etc. Training specific models for specific degradation may lead to poor generalization. To handle multiple degradations simultaneously, All-in-One models might sacrifice performance on certain types of degradation and still struggle with unseen degradations during training. Existing IR agents rely on multimodal large language models (MLLM) and a time-consuming rolling-back selection strategy neglecting image quality. As a result, they may misinterpret degradations and have high time and computational costs to conduct unnecessary IR tasks with redundant order. To address these, we propose a Quality-Driven agent (Q-Agent) via Chain-of-Thought (CoT) restoration. Specifically, our Q-Agent consists of robust degradation perception and quality-driven greedy restoration. The former module first fine-tunes MLLM, and uses CoT to decompose multi-degradation perception into single-degradation perception tasks to enhance the perception of MLLMs. The latter employs objective image quality assessment (IQA) metrics to determine the optimal restoration sequence and execute the corresponding restoration algorithms. Experimental results demonstrate that our Q-Agent achieves superior IR performance compared to existing All-in-One models.</description>

      <title>Dual Deep Learning Approach for Non-invasive Renal Tumour Subtyping with VERDICT-MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work aims to characterise renal tumour microstructure using diffusion MRI (dMRI); via the Vascular, Extracellular and Restricted Diffusion for Cytometry in Tumours (VERDICT)-MRI framework with self-supervised learning. Comprehensive datasets were acquired from 14 patients with 15 biopsy-confirmed renal tumours, with nine b-values in the range b=[0,2500]s/mm2. A three-compartment VERDICT model for renal tumours was fitted to the dMRI data using a self-supervised deep neural network, and ROIs were drawn by an experienced uroradiologist. An economical acquisition protocol for future studies with larger patient cohorts was optimised using a recursive feature selection approach. The VERDICT model described the diffusion data in renal tumours more accurately than IVIM or ADC. Combined with self-supervised deep learning, VERDICT identified significant differences in the intracellular volume fraction between cancerous and normal tissue, and in the vascular volume fraction between vascular and non-vascular. The feature selector yields a 4 b-value acquisition of b = [70,150,1000,2000], with a duration of 14 minutes.</description>

      <title>MoEDiff-SR: Mixture of Experts-Guided Diffusion Model for Region-Adaptive MRI Super-Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) at lower field strengths (e.g., 3T) suffers from limited spatial resolution, making it challenging to capture fine anatomical details essential for clinical diagnosis and neuroimaging research. To overcome this limitation, we propose MoEDiff-SR, a Mixture of Experts (MoE)-guided diffusion model for region-adaptive MRI Super-Resolution (SR). Unlike conventional diffusion-based SR models that apply a uniform denoising process across the entire image, MoEDiff-SR dynamically selects specialized denoising experts at a fine-grained token level, ensuring region-specific adaptation and enhanced SR performance. Specifically, our approach first employs a Transformer-based feature extractor to compute multi-scale patch embeddings, capturing both global structural information and local texture details. The extracted feature embeddings are then fed into an MoE gating network, which assigns adaptive weights to multiple diffusion-based denoisers, each specializing in different brain MRI characteristics, such as centrum semiovale, sulcal and gyral cortex, and grey-white matter junction. The final output is produced by aggregating the denoised results from these specialized experts according to dynamically assigned gating probabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that MoEDiff-SR outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of quantitative image quality metrics, perceptual fidelity, and computational efficiency. Difference maps from each expert further highlight their distinct specializations, confirming the effective region-specific denoising capability and the interpretability of expert contributions. Additionally, clinical evaluation validates its superior diagnostic capability in identifying subtle pathological features, emphasizing its practical relevance in clinical neuroimaging.

      <title>Identifying regions of interest in whole slide images of renal cell carcinoma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The histopathological images contain a huge amount of information, which can make diagnosis an extremely timeconsuming and tedious task. In this study, we developed a completely automated system to detect regions of interest (ROIs) in whole slide images (WSI) of renal cell carcinoma (RCC), to reduce time analysis and assist pathologists in making more accurate decisions. The proposed approach is based on an efficient texture descriptor named dominant rotated local binary pattern (DRLBP) and color transformation to reveal and exploit the immense texture variability at the microscopic high magnifications level. Thereby, the DRLBPs retain the structural information and utilize the magnitude values in a local neighborhood for more discriminative power. For the classification of the relevant ROIs, feature extraction of WSIs patches was performed on the color channels separately to form the histograms. Next, we used the most frequently occurring patterns as a feature selection step to discard non-informative features. The performances of different classifiers on a set of 1800 kidney cancer patches originating from 12 whole slide images were compared and evaluated. Furthermore, the small size of the image dataset allows to investigate deep learning approach based on transfer learning for image patches classification by using deep features and fine-tuning methods. High recognition accuracy was obtained and the classifiers are efficient, the best precision result was 99.17% achieved with SVM. Moreover, transfer learning models perform well with comparable performance, and the highest precision using ResNet-50 reached 98.50%. The proposed approach results revealed a very efficient image classification and demonstrated efficacy in identifying ROIs. This study presents an automatic system to detect regions of interest relevant to the diagnosis of kidney cancer in whole slide histopathology images.</description>

      <title>Synthetic CT Generation from Time-of-Flight Non-Attenutaion-Corrected PET for Whole-Body PET Attenuation Correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging requires accurate attenuation correction (AC) to account for photon loss due to tissue density variations. In PET/MR systems, computed tomography (CT), which offers a straightforward estimation of AC is not available. This study presents a deep learning approach to generate synthetic CT (sCT) images directly from Time-of-Flight (TOF) non-attenuation corrected (NAC) PET images, enhancing AC for PET/MR. We first evaluated models pre-trained on large-scale natural image datasets for a CT-to-CT reconstruction task, finding that the pre-trained model outperformed those trained solely on medical datasets. The pre-trained model was then fine-tuned using an institutional dataset of 35 TOF NAC PET and CT volume pairs, achieving the lowest mean absolute error (MAE) of 74.49 HU and highest peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of 28.66 dB within the body contour region. Visual assessments demonstrated improved reconstruction of both bone and soft tissue structures from TOF NAC PET images. This work highlights the effectiveness of using pre-trained deep learning models for medical image translation tasks. Future work will assess the impact of sCT on PET attenuation correction and explore additional neural network architectures and datasets to further enhance performance and practical applications in PET imaging.</description>

      <title>Novel Pooling-based VGG-Lite for Pneumonia and Covid-19 Detection from Imbalanced Chest X-Ray Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel pooling-based VGG-Lite model in order to mitigate class imbalance issues in Chest X-Ray (CXR) datasets. Automatic Pneumonia detection from CXR images by deep learning model has emerged as a prominent and dynamic area of research, since the inception of the new Covid-19 variant in 2020. However, the standard Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models encounter challenges associated with class imbalance, a prevalent issue found in many medical datasets. The innovations introduced in the proposed model architecture include: (I) A very lightweight CNN model, `VGG-Lite', is proposed as a base model, inspired by VGG-16 and MobileNet-V2 architecture. (II) On top of this base model, we leverage an ``Edge Enhanced Module (EEM)" through a parallel branch, consisting of a ``negative image layer", and a novel custom pooling layer ``2Max-Min Pooling". This 2Max-Min Pooling layer is entirely novel in this investigation, providing more attention to edge components within pneumonia CXR images. Thus, it works as an efficient spatial attention module (SAM). We have implemented the proposed framework on two separate CXR datasets. The first dataset is obtained from a readily available source on the internet, and the second dataset is a more challenging CXR dataset, assembled by our research team from three different sources. Experimental results reveal that our proposed framework has outperformed pre-trained CNN models, and three recent trend existing models ``Vision Transformer", ``Pooling-based Vision Transformer (PiT)'' and ``PneuNet", by substantial margins on both datasets. The proposed framework VGG-Lite with EEM, has achieved a macro average of 95% accuracy, 97.1% precision, 96.1% recall, and 96.6% F1 score on the ``Pneumonia Imbalance CXR dataset", without employing any pre-processing technique.</description>

      <title>PhaseGen: A Diffusion-Based Approach for Complex-Valued MRI Data Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) raw data, or k-Space data, is complex-valued, containing both magnitude and phase information. However, clinical and existing Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based methods focus only on magnitude images, discarding the phase data despite its potential for downstream tasks, such as tumor segmentation and classification. In this work, we introduce $\textit{PhaseGen}$, a novel complex-valued diffusion model for generating synthetic MRI raw data conditioned on magnitude images, commonly used in clinical practice. This enables the creation of artificial complex-valued raw data, allowing pretraining for models that require k-Space information. We evaluate PhaseGen on two tasks: skull-stripping directly in k-Space and MRI reconstruction using the publicly available FastMRI dataset. Our results show that training with synthetic phase data significantly improves generalization for skull-stripping on real-world data, with an increased segmentation accuracy from $41.1\%$ to $80.1\%$, and enhances MRI reconstruction when combined with limited real-world data. This work presents a step forward in utilizing generative AI to bridge the gap between magnitude-based datasets and the complex-valued nature of MRI raw data. This approach allows researchers to leverage the vast amount of avaliable image domain data in combination with the information-rich k-Space data for more accurate and efficient diagnostic tasks. We make our code publicly $\href{https://github.com/TIO-IKIM/PhaseGen}{\text{available here}}$.</description>

      <title>Heart Failure Prediction using Modal Decomposition and Masked Autoencoders for Scarce Echocardiography Databases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heart diseases constitute the main cause of international human defunction. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), approximately 18 million deaths happen each year due to precisely heart diseases. In particular, heart failures (HF) press the healthcare industry to develop systems for their early, rapid and effective prediction. In this work, an automatic system which analyses in real-time echocardiography video sequences is proposed for the challenging and more specific task of prediction of heart failure times. This system is based on a novel deep learning framework, and works in two stages. The first one transforms the data included in a database of echocardiography video sequences into a machine learning-compatible collection of annotated images which can be used in the training phase of any kind of machine learning-based framework, including a deep learning one. This initial stage includes the use of the Higher Order Dynamic Mode Decomposition (HODMD) algorithm for both data augmentation and feature extraction. The second stage is focused on building and training a Vision Transformer (ViT). Self-supervised learning (SSL) methods, which have been so far barely explored in the literature about heart failure prediction, are applied to effectively train the ViT from scratch, even with scarce databases of echocardiograms. The designed neural network analyses images from echocardiography sequences to estimate the time in which a heart failure will happen. The results obtained show the efficacy of the HODMD algorithm and the superiority of the proposed system with respect to several established ViT and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures.</description>

      <title>Conformalized Generative Bayesian Imaging: An Uncertainty Quantification Framework for Computational Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Uncertainty quantification plays an important role in achieving trustworthy and reliable learning-based computational imaging. Recent advances in generative modeling and Bayesian neural networks have enabled the development of uncertainty-aware image reconstruction methods. Current generative model-based methods seek to quantify the inherent (aleatoric) uncertainty on the underlying image for given measurements by learning to sample from the posterior distribution of the underlying image. On the other hand, Bayesian neural network-based approaches aim to quantify the model (epistemic) uncertainty on the parameters of a deep neural network-based reconstruction method by approximating the posterior distribution of those parameters. Unfortunately, an ongoing need for an inversion method that can jointly quantify complex aleatoric uncertainty and epistemic uncertainty patterns still persists. In this paper, we present a scalable framework that can quantify both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties. The proposed framework accepts an existing generative model-based posterior sampling method as an input and introduces an epistemic uncertainty quantification capability through Bayesian neural networks with latent variables and deep ensembling. Furthermore, by leveraging the conformal prediction methodology, the proposed framework can be easily calibrated to ensure rigorous uncertainty quantification. We evaluated the proposed framework on magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography, and image inpainting problems and showed that the epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty estimates produced by the proposed framework display the characteristic features of true epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties. Furthermore, our results demonstrated that the use of conformal prediction on top of the proposed framework enables marginal coverage guarantees consistent with frequentist principles.</description>

Abstract: Sparse-view sampling in dual-energy computed tomography (DECT) significantly reduces radiation dose and increases imaging speed, yet is highly prone to artifacts. Although diffusion models have demonstrated potential in effectively handling incomplete data, most existing methods in this field focus on the image do-main and lack global constraints, which consequently leads to insufficient reconstruction quality. In this study, we propose a dual-domain virtual-mask in-formed diffusion model for sparse-view reconstruction by leveraging the high inter-channel correlation in DECT. Specifically, the study designs a virtual mask and applies it to the high-energy and low-energy data to perform perturbation operations, thus constructing high-dimensional tensors that serve as the prior information of the diffusion model. In addition, a dual-domain collaboration strategy is adopted to integrate the information of the randomly selected high-frequency components in the wavelet domain with the information in the projection domain, for the purpose of optimizing the global struc-tures and local details. Experimental results indicated that the present method exhibits excellent performance across multiple datasets.</description>

      <title>PRAD: Periapical Radiograph Analysis Dataset and Benchmark Model Development</title>

Abstract: Deep learning (DL), a pivotal technology in artificial intelligence, has recently gained substantial traction in the domain of dental auxiliary diagnosis. However, its application has predominantly been confined to imaging modalities such as panoramic radiographs and Cone Beam Computed Tomography, with limited focus on auxiliary analysis specifically targeting Periapical Radiographs (PR). PR are the most extensively utilized imaging modality in endodontics and periodontics due to their capability to capture detailed local lesions at a low cost. Nevertheless, challenges such as resolution limitations and artifacts complicate the annotation and recognition of PR, leading to a scarcity of publicly available, large-scale, high-quality PR analysis datasets. This scarcity has somewhat impeded the advancement of DL applications in PR analysis. In this paper, we present PRAD-10K, a dataset for PR analysis. PRAD-10K comprises 10,000 clinical periapical radiograph images, with pixel-level annotations provided by professional dentists for nine distinct anatomical structures, lesions, and artificial restorations or medical devices, We also include classification labels for images with typical conditions or lesions. Furthermore, we introduce a DL network named PRNet to establish benchmarks for PR segmentation tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that PRNet surpasses previous state-of-the-art medical image segmentation models on the PRAD-10K dataset. The codes and dataset will be made publicly available.</description>

      <title>Focal Cortical Dysplasia Type II Detection Using Cross Modality Transfer Learning and Grad-CAM in 3D-CNNs for MRI Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) type II is a major cause of drug-resistant epilepsy, often curable only by surgery. Despite its clinical importance, the diagnosis of FCD is very difficult in MRI because of subtle abnormalities, leading to misdiagnosis. This study investigates the use of 3D convolutional neural networks (3D-CNNs) for FCD detection, using a dataset of 170 subjects (85 FCD patients and 85 controls) composed of T1-weighted and FLAIR MRI scans. In particular, it investigates the benefits obtained from cross-modality transfer learning and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques, in particular Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM). ResNet architectures (ResNet-18, -34, and -50) were implemented, employing transfer learning strategies that used pre-trained weights from segmentation tasks. Results indicate that transfer learning significantly enhances classification accuracy (up to 80.3%) and interpretability, as measured by a novel Heat-Score metric, which evaluates the model's focus on clinically relevant regions. Improvements in the Heat-Score metric underscore the model's seizure zone localization capabilities, bringing AI predictions and clinical insights closer together. These results highlight the importance of transfer learning, including cross-modality, and XAI in advancing AI-based medical diagnostics, especially for difficult-to-diagnose pathologies such as FCD.</description>

      <title>HarmonySeg: Tubular Structure Segmentation with Deep-Shallow Feature Fusion and Growth-Suppression Balanced Loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate segmentation of tubular structures in medical images, such as vessels and airway trees, is crucial for computer-aided diagnosis, radiotherapy, and surgical planning. However, significant challenges exist in algorithm design when faced with diverse sizes, complex topologies, and (often) incomplete data annotation of these structures. We address these difficulties by proposing a new tubular structure segmentation framework named HarmonySeg. First, we design a deep-to-shallow decoder network featuring flexible convolution blocks with varying receptive fields, which enables the model to effectively adapt to tubular structures of different scales. Second, to highlight potential anatomical regions and improve the recall of small tubular structures, we incorporate vesselness maps as auxiliary information. These maps are aligned with image features through a shallow-and-deep fusion module, which simultaneously eliminates unreasonable candidates to maintain high precision. Finally, we introduce a topology-preserving loss function that leverages contextual and shape priors to balance the growth and suppression of tubular structures, which also allows the model to handle low-quality and incomplete annotations. Extensive quantitative experiments are conducted on four public datasets. The results show that our model can accurately segment 2D and 3D tubular structures and outperform existing state-of-the-art methods. External validation on a private dataset also demonstrates good generalizability.</description>

      <title>The Efficacy of Semantics-Preserving Transformations in Self-Supervised Learning for Medical Ultrasound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data augmentation is a central component of joint embedding self-supervised learning (SSL). Approaches that work for natural images may not always be effective in medical imaging tasks. This study systematically investigated the impact of data augmentation and preprocessing strategies in SSL for lung ultrasound. Three data augmentation pipelines were assessed: (1) a baseline pipeline commonly used across imaging domains, (2) a novel semantic-preserving pipeline designed for ultrasound, and (3) a distilled set of the most effective transformations from both pipelines. Pretrained models were evaluated on multiple classification tasks: B-line detection, pleural effusion detection, and COVID-19 classification. Experiments revealed that semantics-preserving data augmentation resulted in the greatest performance for COVID-19 classification - a diagnostic task requiring global image context. Cropping-based methods yielded the greatest performance on the B-line and pleural effusion object classification tasks, which require strong local pattern recognition. Lastly, semantics-preserving ultrasound image preprocessing resulted in increased downstream performance for multiple tasks. Guidance regarding data augmentation and preprocessing strategies was synthesized for practitioners working with SSL in ultrasound.</description>

      <title>Zero-Shot Low-dose CT Denoising via Sinogram Flicking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many low-dose CT imaging methods rely on supervised learning, which requires a large number of paired noisy and clean images. However, obtaining paired images in clinical practice is challenging. To address this issue, zero-shot self-supervised methods train denoising networks using only the information within a single image, such as ZS-N2N. However, these methods often employ downsampling operations that degrade image resolution. Additionally, the training dataset is inherently constrained to the image itself. In this paper, we propose a zero-shot low-dose CT imaging method based on sinogram flicking, which operates within a single image but generates many copies via random conjugate ray matching. Specifically, two conjugate X-ray pencil beams measure the same path; their expected values should be identical, while their noise levels vary during measurements. By randomly swapping portions of the conjugate X-rays in the sinogram domain, we generate a large set of sinograms with consistent content but varying noise patterns. When displayed dynamically, these sinograms exhibit a flickering effect due to their identical structural content but differing noise patterns-hence the term sinogram flicking. We train the network on pairs of sinograms with the same content but different noise distributions using a lightweight model adapted from ZS-NSN. This process is repeated to obtain the final results. A simulation study demonstrates that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches such as ZS-N2N.</description>

      <title>PIDSR:ComplementaryPolarizedImageDemosaicingandSuper-Resolution</title>

Abstract: Polarization cameras can capture multiple polarized images with different polarizer angles in a single shot, bringing convenience to polarization-based downstream tasks. However, their direct outputs are color-polarization filter array (CPFA) raw images, requiring demosaicing to reconstruct full-resolution, full-color polarized images; unfortunately, this necessary step introduces artifacts that make polarization-related parameters such as the degree of polarization (DoP) and angle of polarization (AoP) prone to error. Besides, limited by the hardware design, the resolution of a polarization camera is often much lower than that of a conventional RGB camera. Existing polarized image demosaicing (PID) methods are limited in that they cannot enhance resolution, while polarized image super-resolution (PISR) methods, though designed to obtain high-resolution (HR) polarized images from the demosaicing results, tend to retain or even amplify errors in the DoP and AoP introduced by demosaicing artifacts. In this paper, we propose PIDSR, a joint framework that performs complementary Polarized Image Demosaicing and Super-Resolution, showing the ability to robustly obtain high-quality HR polarized images with more accurate DoP and AoP from a CPFA raw image in a direct manner. Experiments show our PIDSR not only achieves state-of-the-art performance on both synthetic and real data, but also facilitates downstream tasks.</description>

      <title>Multi-view Hybrid Graph Convolutional Network for Volume-to-mesh Reconstruction in Cardiovascular MRI</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.13706v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging is emerging as a crucial tool to examine cardiac morphology and function. Essential to this endeavour are anatomical 3D surface and volumetric meshes derived from CMR images, which facilitate computational anatomy studies, biomarker discovery, and in-silico simulations. Traditional approaches typically follow complex multi-step pipelines, first segmenting images and then reconstructing meshes, making them time-consuming and prone to error propagation. In response, we introduce HybridVNet, a novel architecture for direct image-to-mesh extraction seamlessly integrating standard convolutional neural networks with graph convolutions, which we prove can efficiently handle surface and volumetric meshes by encoding them as graph structures. To further enhance accuracy, we propose a multi-view HybridVNet architecture which processes both long axis and short axis CMR, showing that it can increase the performance of cardiac MR mesh generation. Our model combines traditional convolutional networks with variational graph generative models, deep supervision and mesh-specific regularisation. Experiments on a comprehensive dataset from the UK Biobank confirm the potential of HybridVNet to significantly advance cardiac imaging and computational cardiology by efficiently generating high-fidelity meshes from CMR images. Multi-view HybridVNet outperforms the state-of-the-art, achieving improvements of up to $\sim$27\% reduction in Mean Contour Distance (from 1.86 mm to 1.35 mm for the LV Myocardium), up to $\sim$18\% improvement in Hausdorff distance (from 4.74 mm to 3.89mm, for the LV Endocardium), and up to $\sim$8\% in Dice Coefficient (from 0.78 to 0.84, for the LV Myocardium), highlighting its superior accuracy.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Cell Instance Segmentation in Scanning Electron Microscopy Images via a Deep Contour Closing Operator</title>

Abstract: Accurately segmenting and individualizing cells in SEM images is a highly promising technique for elucidating tissue architecture in oncology. While current AI-based methods are effective, errors persist, necessitating time-consuming manual corrections, particularly in areas where the quality of cell contours in the image is poor and requires gap filling. This study presents a novel AI-driven approach for refining cell boundary delineation to improve instance-based cell segmentation in SEM images, also reducing the necessity for residual manual correction. A CNN COp-Net is introduced to address gaps in cell contours, effectively filling in regions with deficient or absent information. The network takes as input cell contour probability maps with potentially inadequate or missing information and outputs corrected cell contour delineations. The lack of training data was addressed by generating low integrity probability maps using a tailored PDE. We showcase the efficacy of our approach in augmenting cell boundary precision using both private SEM images from PDX hepatoblastoma tissues and publicly accessible images datasets. The proposed cell contour closing operator exhibits a notable improvement in tested datasets, achieving respectively close to 50% (private data) and 10% (public data) increase in the accurately-delineated cell proportion compared to state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, the need for manual corrections was significantly reduced, therefore facilitating the overall digitalization process. Our results demonstrate a notable enhancement in the accuracy of cell instance segmentation, particularly in highly challenging regions where image quality compromises the integrity of cell boundaries, necessitating gap filling. Therefore, our work should ultimately facilitate the study of tumour tissue bioarchitecture in onconanotomy field.</description>

Abstract: Epilepsy is typically diagnosed through electroencephalography (EEG) and long-term video-EEG (vEEG) monitoring. The manual analysis of vEEG recordings is time-consuming, necessitating automated tools for seizure detection. Recent advancements in machine learning have shown promise in real-time seizure detection and prediction using EEG and video data. However, diversity of seizure symptoms, markup ambiguities, and limited availability of multimodal datasets hinder progress. This paper reviews the latest developments in automated video-EEG analysis and discusses the integration of multimodal data. We also propose a novel pipeline for treatment effect estimation from vEEG data using concept-based learning, offering a pathway for future research in this domain.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06301v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Learning-based image compression methods have recently emerged as promising alternatives to traditional codecs, offering improved rate-distortion performance and perceptual quality. JPEG AI represents the latest standardized framework in this domain, leveraging deep neural networks for high-fidelity image reconstruction. In this study, we present a comprehensive subjective visual quality assessment of JPEG AI-compressed images using the JPEG AIC-3 methodology, which quantifies perceptual differences in terms of Just Noticeable Difference (JND) units. We generated a dataset of 50 compressed images with fine-grained distortion levels from five diverse sources. A large-scale crowdsourced experiment collected 96,200 triplet responses from 459 participants. We reconstructed JND-based quality scales using a unified model based on boosted and plain triplet comparisons. Additionally, we evaluated the alignment of multiple objective image quality metrics with human perception in the high-fidelity range. The CVVDP metric achieved the overall highest performance; however, most metrics including CVVDP were overly optimistic in predicting the quality of JPEG AI-compressed images. These findings emphasize the necessity for rigorous subjective evaluations in the development and benchmarking of modern image codecs, particularly in the high-fidelity range. Another technical contribution is the introduction of the well-known Meng-Rosenthal-Rubin statistical test to the field of Quality of Experience research. This test can reliably assess the significance of difference in performance of quality metrics in terms of correlation between metrics and ground truth. The complete dataset, including all subjective scores, is publicly available at https://github.com/jpeg-aic/dataset-JPEG-AI-SDR25.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18560v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep metric learning (DML) involves training a network to learn a semantically meaningful representation space. Many current approaches mine n-tuples of examples and model interactions within each tuplets. We present a novel, compositional DML model that instead of in tuples, represents the influence of each example (embedding) by a continuous potential field, and superposes the fields to obtain their combined global potential field. We use attractive/repulsive potential fields to represent interactions among embeddings from images of the same/different classes. Contrary to typical learning methods, where mutual influence of samples is proportional to their distance, we enforce reduction in such influence with distance, leading to a decaying field. We show that such decay helps improve performance on real world datasets with large intra-class variations and label noise. Like other proxy-based methods, we also use proxies to succinctly represent sub-populations of examples. We evaluate our method on three standard DML benchmarks- Cars-196, CUB-200-2011, and SOP datasets where it outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.</description>

      <title>Neural Approximate Mirror Maps for Constrained Diffusion Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12816v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models excel at creating visually-convincing images, but they often struggle to meet subtle constraints inherent in the training data. Such constraints could be physics-based (e.g., satisfying a PDE), geometric (e.g., respecting symmetry), or semantic (e.g., including a particular number of objects). When the training data all satisfy a certain constraint, enforcing this constraint on a diffusion model makes it more reliable for generating valid synthetic data and solving constrained inverse problems. However, existing methods for constrained diffusion models are restricted in the constraints they can handle. For instance, recent work proposed to learn mirror diffusion models (MDMs), but analytical mirror maps only exist for convex constraints and can be challenging to derive. We propose neural approximate mirror maps (NAMMs) for general, possibly non-convex constraints. Our approach only requires a differentiable distance function from the constraint set. We learn an approximate mirror map that transforms data into an unconstrained space and a corresponding approximate inverse that maps data back to the constraint set. A generative model, such as an MDM, can then be trained in the learned mirror space and its samples restored to the constraint set by the inverse map. We validate our approach on a variety of constraints, showing that compared to an unconstrained diffusion model, a NAMM-based MDM substantially improves constraint satisfaction. We also demonstrate how existing diffusion-based inverse-problem solvers can be easily applied in the learned mirror space to solve constrained inverse problems.</description>

Abstract: Applying style transfer to a full 3D environment is a challenging task that has seen many developments since the advent of neural rendering. 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) has recently pushed further many limits of neural rendering in terms of training speed and reconstruction quality. This work introduces SGSST: Scaling Gaussian Splatting Style Transfer, an optimization-based method to apply style transfer to pretrained 3DGS scenes. We demonstrate that a new multiscale loss based on global neural statistics, that we name SOS for Simultaneously Optimized Scales, enables style transfer to ultra-high resolution 3D scenes. Not only SGSST pioneers 3D scene style transfer at such high image resolutions, it also produces superior visual quality as assessed by thorough qualitative, quantitative and perceptual comparisons.</description>
