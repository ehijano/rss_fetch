      <title>Tumura-Clunie Differential Equations with Applications to Linear ODE's</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study nonlinear differential equations of Tumura-Clunie type, $ f^n + P(z, f) = h, $ where \( n \geq 2 \) is an integer, \( P(z, f) \) is a differential polynomial in \( f \) of degree \( \gamma_P \leq n - 1 \) with small functions as coefficients, and \( h \) is a meromorphic function. Assuming that $ h $ satisfies a linear differential equation of order $ p\le n $ with rational coefficients, we establish a result that classifies the meromorphic solutions \( f \) into two cases based on the distribution of their zeros and poles. This result is then applied to study the zeros and critical points of entire solutions to certain higher-order linear differential equations, thereby extending some known results in the literature.</description>

      <title>Quasibounded solutions to the complex Monge-Amp\`ere equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Dirichlet problem for the complex Monge-Amp\`ere operator on a B-regular domain $\Omega$, allowing boundary data that is singular or unbounded. We introduce the concept of pluri-quasibounded functions on $\Omega$ and $\partial \Omega$, defined by the existence of plurisuperharmonic majorants that dominate their absolute value in a strong sense - that is, the ratio of the function to the majorant tends to zero as the function tends to infinity. For such data, we prove existence and uniqueness of solutions in the Blocki--Cegrell class $\mathcal{D}(\Omega)$, using a recently established comparison principle. In the unit disk, our approach recovers harmonic functions represented as Poisson integrals of $L^1$ boundary data with respect to harmonic measure, and our characterization extends to all regular domains in $\mathbb{R}^n$, when the boundary data is continuous almost everywhere. We also describe how boundary singularities propagate into the interior via a refined pluripolar hull.</description>

      <title>Surjectivity of the asymptotic Borel map in Carleman ultraholomorphic classes defined by sequences with shifted moments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove several improved versions of the Borel-Ritt theorem about the surjectivity of the asymptotic Borel mapping in classes of functions with $\boldsymbol{M}$-uniform asymptotic expansion on an unbounded sector of the Riemann surface of the logarithm. While in previous results the weight sequence $\boldsymbol{M}$ of positive numbers is supposed to be derivation closed, a much weaker condition is shown to be sufficient to obtain the result in the case of Roumieu classes. Regarding Beurling classes, we are able to slightly improve a classical result of J. Schmets and M. Valdivia and reprove a result of A. Debrouwere, both under derivation closedness. Our new condition also allows us to obtain surjectivity results for Beurling classes in suitably small sectors, but the technique is now adapted from a classical procedure already appearing in the work of V. Thilliez, in its turn inspired by that of J. Chaumat and A.-M. Chollet.</description>

      <title>Pre-K\"ahler structures and finite-nondegeneracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09467v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the geometry of Levi degenerate CR hypersurfaces, we define a pre-K\"ahler structure on a complex manifold as a pre-symplectic structure compatible with the almost complex structure, i.e. a closed (1,1)-form. Extending Freeman filtration to the pre-K\"ahler setting, we define holomorphic degeneration and finite-nondegeneracy and show that the symmetry algebra of a real analytic pre-K\"ahler structure is finite-dimensional if and only if it is finitely nondegenerate. Concurrently, we extend the classical correspondence between K\"ahler and Sasakian structures to the pre-K\"ahler setting, i.e. a one-to-one (local) correspondence between $k$-nondegenerate CR hypersurfaces equipped with a transverse infinitesimal symmetry and $k$-nondegenerate pre-K\"ahler structures. We additionally formalize a second relationship between the categories, constructing a natural $k$-nondegenerate pre-K\"ahler structure defined on a line bundle over such CR structures via pre-symplectification.
  Focusing on the lowest dimensional case, we solve the equivalence problem of non-K\"ahler pre-K\"ahler complex surfaces that are 2-nondegenerate by associating a Cartan geometry to them and explicitly express their local invariants in terms of the fifth jet of a potential function. We describe the vanishing of their basic invariants in terms of a double fibration, which gives a pre-K\"ahler characterization of the twistor bundle of symplectic connections on surfaces. Lastly, our study of pre-K\"ahler complex surfaces that are symmetry reductions of homogeneous 2-nondegenerate CR 5-manifolds leads to a characterization of certain critical symplectic connections on surfaces and shows locally homogeneous 2-nondegenerate pre-K\"ahler complex surfaces are flat.</description>

      <title>Geometric characterizations of inner uniformity through Gromov hyperbolicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.05494</link>
      <description>arXiv:1706.05494v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the characterization of inner uniformity of bounded domains $G$ in $\IR^n$, and prove that the following three conditions are equivalent: $(1)$ $G$ is inner uniform; $(2)$ $G$ is Gromov hyperbolic and its inner metric boundary is naturally quasisymmetrically equivalent to the Gromov boundary; $(3)$ $G$ is Gromov hyperbolic and linearly locally connected with respect to the inner metric. The equivalence between the conditions $(1)$ and $(2)$, and the implication from $(2)$ to $(3)$ affirmatively answer three questions raised by Bonk, Heinonen, and Koskela in 2001.</description>

      <title>Plurisubharmonic functions with discontinuous boundary behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.00768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.00768v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the Dirichlet problem for the complex Monge-Amp\`ere operator with bounded, discontinuous boundary data. If the set of discontinuities is b-pluripolar and the domain is B-regular, we are able to prove existence, uniqueness and some regularity estimates for a large class of complex Monge-Amp\`ere measures. This result is optimal in the unit disk, as boundary functions with b-pluripolar discontinuity then coincides with functions that are continuous almost everywhere. We also show that neither of these properties of the boundary function - being continuous almost everywhere or having discontinuities forming a b-pluripolar set - are necessary conditions in order to establish uniqueness and continuity of the solution in higher dimensions. In particular, there are situations where it is enough to prescribe the boundary behavior at a set of arbitrarily small Lebesgue measure.</description>

Abstract: We study the boundary behavior of the Kobayashi-Royden metric and the Kobayashi hyperbolicity of domains in Riemannian manifolds. As an application, we prove a Fatou type theorem on the existence, almost everywhere, of non tangential limits for bounded conformal harmonic immersed discs. We also prove a Picard theorem for conformal harmonic discs and give some examples of Kobayashi hyperbolic Riemannian manifolds.</description>

      <title>A dimension-free discrete Remez-type inequality on the polytorus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.10828v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consider $f:\Omega^n_K \to \mathbf{C}$ a function from the $n$-fold product of multiplicative cyclic groups of order $K$. Any such $f$ may be extended via its Fourier expansion to an analytic polynomial on the polytorus $\mathbf{T}^n$, and the set of such polynomials coincides with the set of all analytic polynomials on $\mathbf{T}^n$ of individual degree at most $K-1$.
  In this setting it is natural to ask how the supremum norms of $f$ over $\mathbf{T}^n$ and over $\Omega_K^n$ compare. We prove the following \emph{discretization of the uniform norm} for low-degree polynomials: if $f$ has degree at most $d$ as an analytic polynomial, then $\|f\|_{\mathbf{T}^n}\leq C(d,K)\|f\|_{\Omega_K^n}$ with $C(d,K)$ independent of dimension $n$. As a consequence we also obtain a new proof of the Bohnenblust--Hille inequality for functions on products of cyclic groups.
  Key to our argument is a special class of Fourier multipliers on $\Omega_K^n$ which are $L^\infty\to L^\infty$ bounded independent of dimension when restricted to low-degree polynomials. This class includes projections onto the $k$-homogeneous parts of low-degree polynomials as well as projections of much finer granularity.</description>

      <title>Weighted cscK metrics on K\"ahler varieties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07968v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the weighted constant scalar curvature K\"ahler equations on mildly singular K\"ahler varieties. Assuming the existence of a suitable resolution of singularities, we establish the existence of singular weighted cscK metrics when the weighted Mabuchi functional is coercive for an extremal weight. This extends the works of Chen-Cheng and He to the singular weighted setting. Moreover, we provide a method for constructing examples of singular cscK metrics inspired by the work of Arezzo--Pacard. In contrast to the usual gluing techniques, our approach does not require a precise understanding about of the metric behavior near the singular locus.</description>

      <title>Epstein curves and holography of the Schwarzian action</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05690v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the duality between Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity and Schwarzian field theory, we show identities between the Schwarzian action of a circle diffeomorphism and (1) the length and the hyperbolic area enclosed by the Epstein curve in the hyperbolic disk $\mathbb{D}$, (2) the asymptotic excess in the isoperimetric inequality for the equidistant Epstein foliation, (3) the variation of the Loewner energy along its equipotential foliation, and (4) the asymptotic change in hyperbolic area under a conformal distortion near the circle.
  Together with the isoperimetric inequality and the monotonicity of the Loewner energy, our identities immediately imply two new proofs of the non-negativity of the Schwarzian action for circle diffeomorphisms. Moreover, we extend the identity (1) to the dual Epstein curve in de Sitter $2$-space, to the Schwarzian action for the coadjoint orbits $\mathrm{M\"{o}b}_n (\mathbb{S}^1) \backslash \mathrm{Diff}(\mathbb{S}^1)$, and to piecewise M\"obius circle diffeomorphisms which are only $C^{1,1}$ regular.
  We also show that the horocycle truncation used in the construction of the Epstein curve defines a renormalized length of hyperbolic geodesics in $\mathbb{D}$, which coincides with the log of the bi-local observable. From this, we show that the bi-local observables on the edges of any ideal triangulation of $\mathbb{D}$ determine the circle diffeomorphism.</description>
